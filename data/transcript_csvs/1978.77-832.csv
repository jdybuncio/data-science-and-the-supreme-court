1978.77-832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.018,The case is submitted.
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,65.959,68.931,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,105.605,112.005,You mean by that question is whether they have the authority to do it or whether they have the discretion to do it?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,112.005,124.19,Whether they have the statutory authority to deny the application and we're here today to contend that the Board may indeed deny such an application unless it entails the capital deficiency's remedy.
1978.77-832,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,126.87,132.283,Do I correctly understand that the undercapitalization is conceded here?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,132.283,133.301,That's correct.
1978.77-832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,245.614,250.113,"But denying the application wasn't going to give it that additional capital though, was it?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,250.113,264.121,"That's quite correct but the insistence in this category of cases, the capital be replenished as a prerequisite to getting the desired change and status is the motivation that makes applicants come up with the additional equity capital."
1978.77-832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,264.121,277.421,"In other words, the Board kind of has the red light and says, “Unless you meet -- unless the bank meets particular qualifications which we would not independently enforce if you're holding company application, we will deny leave for formation of the holding company.”"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,277.421,300.23,"The light is red until the Board examines the financial resources of the parent and the subsidiary and has to find that each is adequate under the Board's current standards and in this case, it found a serious deficiency in the bank and it found that the holding company by extracting dividends from the bank would keep the bank would keep the bank in that undercapitalized state for a period of at least 12 years."
1978.77-832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,300.23,304.697,"Well, wouldn't the dividends be extracted by the present owners if there is no holding company?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,304.697,305.483,That's correct.
1978.77-832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,306.252,309.134,"So, what good does it do to deny the application?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,309.134,325.77,"By insisting on replenishing of capital in this kind of case where there's a serious deficiency, the Board has obtained an injection of badly needed capital in some 400 separate cases and an injection of some $2 billion in badly needed equity in the banking system."
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,337.413,348.032,"It discharges the price, in other words, for somebody who wants to form a single bank holding company and get the tax advantages of that, he has to pay the price by improving the capitalization of the bank."
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,348.032,348.739,That's correct.
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,350.583,361.27,"Even though the capitalization of the bank was unchanged -- would be unchanged absent Board action, whether or not it was owned as before by individual owners or owned thereafter by a holding company."
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,361.27,371.549,That's precisely the point and this procedure is identical to the procedure under the Federal Reserve Act which Congress stated was the model to be applied here.
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,397.072,407.527,"Mr. Shapiro, having interrupted you, may I ask you this which doesn't seem to be very clear from my reading of the briefs at least."
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,414.443,415.371,"Yes, they are."
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,419.044,436.248,"So -- so, if that's true, the situation remains as before from the point of view of the stability of that indebtedness and --"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,436.248,436.917,The situation --
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,436.917,441.626,"And any advantage of the holding company however is light as in that advantage then, isn't it?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,441.626,442.612,That's correct.
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.193,455.41,"No improvement in the capitalization of the bank and there wouldn't have been, had there been no holding company."
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,455.41,461.398,"That's correct and that's why at this juncture, the Board insists, there now be an improvement to remedy --"
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,461.398,467.918,"As a price -- as a price for this people getting the tax advantage of forming of one bank holding company, what do you get --"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,467.918,471.758,"It's not a price, it's the statutory criteria."
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,473.704,475.865,It's a condition.
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,475.865,476.761,Correct.
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.761,499.112,"Mr. Shapiro, if I understand you correctly, if the holding company were a multi-million dollar concern, just all cash and no-risk business in it, no multiple bank situation, you would nevertheless and if the advantage at the results of the formation of holding company would be totally to the benefit of the bank because they get the tax deduction, they don't now get."
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,503.314,504.1,That's correct.
1978.77-832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,514.417,524.781,"Is there not some value to the guarantees resulting from the Holding Company Act, from a holding company status?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,524.781,530.238,There certainly is very significant advantage in having the holding company status.
1978.77-832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,546.68,548.716,"In most banks, almost."
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,548.716,549.644,But not in Illinois.
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,549.644,551.148,"But not in Illinois, that's correct."
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,572.777,583.335,But if your answer is accurate that the original owners here remain as guarantors of the indebtedness then there is the advantage of now there being two sets of debtors instead of just one.
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,583.335,584.361,"Well, the holding company."
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,584.361,587.064,The holding company is now added as an additional debtor.
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,587.064,587.461,But --
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,587.461,590.306,"And the original debtors remain debtors, correct?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,590.306,594.885,The holding company under this application would remain simply a shell.
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,596.919,598.783,"It assumed the indebtedness, doesn't it?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,598.783,599.312,That's correct.
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,599.801,601.318,So there's an additional debtor?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,601.318,608.958,And would have no income other than the dividends paid from the bank which would otherwise be otherwise be paid to these guarantors that you referred to so it wouldn't be --
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.958,612.002,"Otherwise, it would be paid to Uncle Sam in half, wouldn't they?"
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,612.002,616.58,A lot of those -- the dividends for the most part you're talking about are the product of the tax saving?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,616.58,618.477,That's correct.
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,623.156,626.607,The Government's position is that its better to have that money go to the Government really.
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,626.607,639.807,"Well, the Government's position is that if this new valuable status is sought, it is incumbent upon the parties seeking this new advantage to shoulder the responsibility of maintaining adequate capital in the bank, that's the Government's position in Mitchell."
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,639.807,650.119,And your position is based entirely on the statutory language that the Board shall take in to consideration the financial and managerial resources of future prospects of the company or companies in the banks concerned.
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,650.119,667.751,"And its based on the long history that we cite on the brief, one pertinent portion of that is the analysis or the analogy to the practice under the Federal Reserve Act where an applicant can't obtain membership in the system unless its capital as adequate relative to assets and relative to liabilities in the judgment of the Court."
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.751,675.573,"No, there of course you're talking about membership in the system of banks all of which affect one another in their operation; we don't have any consideration like that here, do you?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,675.573,682.498,There is a certainly economic differences but Congress said that they are inconsequential and that the same pattern is applicable under the Holding Company Act.
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.498,694.676,"Does the Government still concede as it did, at least Judge Fairchild have quoted you in the Court of Appeals to saying that in any economic analysis of this, the formation of the new company can only be beneficial to the bank can't cause any harm."
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,694.676,705.097,"I think that that concession has been estrange a bit but we do agree that a hundred and $130,000.00 benefit is better than no one $130,000.00 benefit and that's a positive factor."
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,705.097,710.317,And you can't point to any harm other than the failure to do something you wanted to do.
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,710.317,714.626,We can point to possible harm and the Board did that in its opinion.
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,737.223,740.255,All of which would have applied if there've been no bank holding company involved here?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,740.255,742.888,"Well, some of which would not have applied."
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,783.827,784.344,"Yes, but that was a situation --"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,784.344,785.18,Even though the bank was sold.
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.18,794.096,"-- in which they did not maintain the 80% necessary to take advantage of the tax advantage which is the whole purpose of this transaction, isn't it?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,794.096,800.821,I'd -- I have never seen that fact referred to Your Honor that there was less than 80% control in the Beverly Hills National Bank case.
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,802.047,803.981,"Oh, I'm sorry I'm confused."
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,803.981,814.43,"The difficulty was that that the holding company couldn't meet a relatively small obligation on its debt securities and even though the bank resounds, this caused the panic among depositors."
1978.77-832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,845.874,856.758,What criteria do you suggest were taken into account by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in recommending approval of this application?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,856.758,895.693,The Reserve Bank in Chicago recognized the low capitalization problem and recognized its persistence but it felt that there was a strong management in this bank and that the management had done a lot of good for the bank which we don't dispute and that this management shouldn't be faulted for taking over the bank at the time of difficulty and a sop if you will should be thrown to them and that possible improved earnings could reduce the string on the capital but the Board simply disagreed concluding that the low capitalization factor was such a serious problem that steps had to be taken out.
1978.77-832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,903.465,906.125,And what about the Comptroller's view of this?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,906.125,912.85,The Comptroller originally recommended against the transaction on the ground that the bank's capital was too low.
1978.77-832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,936.554,945.119,What sanctions are available on the part of any federal agency for the bank's failure to meet the standard you're referring to apart from the application for a holding company?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,945.119,956.264,"Apart from denial of the holding company, it is in theory possible that the Comptroller could commence a cease and desist proceeding involving a trial --"
1978.77-832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,956.264,957.25,He didn't do it here?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,957.25,958.178,He didn't do it here.
1978.77-832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,980.829,993.15,So the holding company is kind of a goody that's held out in exchange for giving up this rather extended proceeding that would be necessary if the bank didn't want a holding company?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,993.15,1010.681,"If the Board or the Comptroller had to conduct trial and an appeal in the judicial enforcement proceeding every time that they needed to correct the capital deficiency in some 400 cases of the Board alone, they'd be doing nothing else but conducting these kinds of trial, it would be totally infeasible."
1978.77-832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1010.681,1024.098,"Well, in the criminal law area this has been outlawed for years, I suppose you realize that they're making someone give up a right to jury trial in that sort of a thing like the case right behind you is not too different from that."
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1031.083,1033.465,I don't because no right here is being given up.
1978.77-832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1065.56,1069.616,"Those Acts specifically authorize that sort of test, don't they?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1069.616,1075.926,"And this Act, the legislative history makes very clear, incorporates these same standards."
1978.77-832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1083.519,1085.303,They didn't say it say it in this Act?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1085.303,1092.54,They said it in the House Report that a company that -- and they used the term financial resource and what after all is a resource.
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.285,1172.738,"Mr. Shapiro, I just want to clear one thing up in my mind."
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1189.681,1195.927,"Since 1970, 400 applications have been held to be deficient under the standard under holding company --"
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1195.927,1195.948,400?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1195.948,1204.272,-- act alone and that's just one agency as scrutinizing capital in banks and in each of this cases the Boards insisted on --
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1204.272,1212.177,You mean the 400 applications in which the acquired banks capitalization didn't meet the 8% test and that was the reason for denial?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1212.177,1234.753,"That's correct and the denial was combined with an improvement at the later stage resulting in a replenishing of the needed capital and Board's testimony before the Senate in 1976 was that this has resulted in the injection of some $2 billion in additional capital and so we're talking about a recurrent problem that's dealt with, we think economically under the statutory provision."
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.753,1245.707,"Well if there --- if there are 400 banks that this was a problem and that it were subject to application, I presume there must have been a lot of other banks that weren't involved in proposed transaction that also were deficient in capital, is that right?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1245.707,1246.715,That's correct and the --
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.715,1255.17,So that -- that maybe it's almost a characteristic of the banking industry that they don't satisfy this particular criteria?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1255.17,1271.914,"Well, we know that that isn't true because the Board has made statistical analysis of banks within different peer groups and within this peer group which is a size criterion, the average nationally is 9% and so the Board's 8% standard is somewhat lower than the national average."
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1284.718,1295.173,And is it a flat rule of the Board that no one bank holding company will be permitted to be organized if the bank to be acquired has a capital ratio of less than 8%?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1295.173,1300.72,"I am informed that it is as close to a flat rule as it could possibly be, I believe that it is."
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1300.72,1303.752,Is the rule contained in a written regulation anywhere?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1303.752,1312.66,It's contained in the uniform system of bank classification which is in the bank examiner's manual which has been in existence since 1969.
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1325.93,1327.126,And they basically what they do?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1333.681,1339.747,"Well, a bank that was below the 8% standard wouldn't get into the Federal Reserve System until it improved."
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.667,1357.077,Would the bank lose their FDIC insurance when they get below this amount?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1357.077,1357.843,Pardon me?
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1357.843,1364.39,Will the bank lose its FDIC insurance coverage if its capital ratio falls below this percentage?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1364.39,1368.417,That is such a draconian sanction that it's never been done.
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.417,1370.87,It just won't grant new insurance to a bank that doesn't comply?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1370.87,1376.118,"Well, if this bank were denied its FDIC insurance, it would mean that it would go under receivership."
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.171,1409.191,"But of course in the denial or the application has not achieve the end, I gather."
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1409.191,1409.239,Not --
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1409.239,1410.175,Still as under the --
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1410.175,1414.696,Not to the state because it's still in litigation and of course they hope for success which would --
1978.77-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.696,1419.0,Even if the FDIC wins the litigation then its objective will not be achieved?
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1419.0,1444.259,"Well, we hope that it will be achieved through the offer of new equity securities by the bank, by finding new ventures at the holding company level, or by retaining the earnings for a period of time in the bank, any of these steps could be employed to replenish the capital base and if that occurs and it should occur within a reasonable period of time, then this respondent is free to return to the Board to get a fresh appraisal of its application."
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1524.413,1532.077,"Mr. Shapiro, has any other Court -- considered this question in any Court other than the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1532.077,1543.854,"No Your Honor, no other Courts has and you'll notice that the Seventh Circuit relies upon general reasoning rather than the citation of any precedent and that's because there is no case law in this area."
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1547.155,1551.597,"One more question, who wrote the opinion for the panel?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1551.597,1551.884,It was senior --
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1551.884,1553.9,"September 7, 1976, it doesn't --"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1553.9,1561.789,Senior Judge Hastings wrote the panel decision and Judge Fairchild who had dissented in the original case wrote the decision for the en banc court.
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1561.789,1564.553,Doesn't appear who the author was of the panel of --
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1564.553,1567.853,I notice that myself Your Honor with some embarrassment but those are the authors of the opinions.
1978.77-832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1567.853,1568.819,Just go on.
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1569.807,1577.087,Respondent asserts that because a capital deficiency already exists here that there is no rational ground for us to stand on the way.
1978.77-832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1603.151,1608.628,"Now, where -- how do you relate that specifically to the statute, that doctrine?"
1978.77-832,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1608.628,1642.985,"Under the statute the Board is directed to consider an every case financial resources and the legislative history says that these considerations of financial soundness and managerial soundness, the so-called banking factors are the basis for granting or denying and if the applicant has not shown sufficient responsibility to raise capital to minimally adequate levels, then the statute we say authorizes a flat denial and tell the applicant improves the condition of the bank and meets minimum Board standards."
1978.77-832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1649.499,1651.882,Very well.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,1657.769,1661.652,May it please your -- may it please the Chief Judge in this Honorable Court.
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1773.897,1780.891,"Mr. Collins, I take it you're not defending the judgment below on the theory espouse by the Seventh Circuit however?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,1780.891,1781.919,I am Your Honor.
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1781.919,1782.366,You are not.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,1782.366,1783.654,"That -- I am, I do."
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1837.8,1839.557,They have the power to say that?
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,1839.557,1841.401,"Well, they might have the power to make such a regulation."
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1841.401,1842.357,And that's the argument.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,1842.427,1845.698,But they surely haven't made such a regulation.
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1847.714,1849.012,"Well now, you say they don't?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,1849.012,1852.952,"Well, it would seem to me to be this that they have the power --"
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1852.952,1853.182,It doesn't.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,1853.182,1855.735,-- only to relate it to the specific transaction.
1978.77-832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1880.554,1887.184,"Certainly, the Board could have a general rule though by which it treats a number of applications?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,1887.184,1889.857,"If they do, it does not appear from their opinions."
1978.77-832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1949.107,1955.36,"Well, do you take the position that the Board had no authority to deal -- make this decision at all?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,1955.36,1961.097,"No, no sir, not -- please don't put me on that, no sir."
1978.77-832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1962.093,1965.147,"Well, you said the Comptroller of the Currency had that authority?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,1965.147,1971.782,"No, they had the authority to decide the case but this is how it is suppose to work according to the statute."
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2100.051,2101.331,Mr. Collins.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2101.331,2101.519,Pardon me.
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2101.519,2102.774,May interrupt you just a minute?
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2102.774,2103.65,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2103.65,2117.402,The difficulty with your argument you are now making as I perceive it is that the Comptroller has authority only to make a recommendation to the Federal Reserve Board with respect to the formation of a holding company.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2126.111,2126.448,Very much so.
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2126.448,2129.792,The Comptroller can only -- can only make a recommendation.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2129.792,2131.537,May I respond on that point Your Honor?
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2131.537,2132.743,Please do.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2132.743,2138.44,The Comptroller has the -- has the duty to respond to the application.
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2180.856,2186.343,"Well, that's true but Section 3 imposes obligation on the Board to consider the financial --"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2186.343,2187.581,Correct.
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2187.581,2191.222,-- condition not only of the bank but of the holding company?
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2191.222,2191.769,Correct.
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2191.769,2193.873,And the future prospects of both?
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2193.873,2194.28,"Well, --"
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2194.28,2195.358,So show that your --
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2195.358,2196.416,There are ways --
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2196.416,2200.107,-- on the Comptroller seems to me to be perhaps misplaced to some extent.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2200.107,2204.426,"Well, if Your Honor thinks so then certainly misplaced but --"
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2204.426,2206.093,"Well, it's relevant -- it's relevant --"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2206.093,2206.253,But the point that --
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2206.253,2208.407,-- but I'm talking about the ultimate responsibility.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2208.407,2214.772,But the point that I would make is that the decision that they're to make is suppose to be a judicial decision and not an economic decision.
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2215.042,2217.814,"Well, what authority do you have for that?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2217.814,2219.978,"Well, that it's a statute."
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2239.556,2239.734,"No, sir."
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2239.734,2240.281,-- an economic or banking decision.
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2240.281,2274.143,"I'm arguing -- I am -- well, no, I think its up to the Comptroller whether or not a bank should open tomorrow morning and he makes that decision everyday as to every bank in America and I don't know that that's a judicial decision unless there was a case of gross abuse and I don't know that there's ever been such a case but I think that and my point to Your Honor is that the decision of whether to allow or to withhold the privilege of a bank holding company is one which is accorded or not accorded in accordance with judicial principles and not as part of the money policy of the Federal Reserve Board."
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2274.143,2274.213,Oh!
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2299.303,2299.62,Correct.
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2299.62,2302.432,It imposes a statutory duty upon the Board to --
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2302.432,2303.67,I have -- I have no --
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2303.67,2305.315,In every case to take those --
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2305.315,2306.89,Right.
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2306.89,2307.786,-- concerns into consideration.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2307.786,2329.253,"And I have no quarrel with that because to me, what that means is that you view this case in this record and if there's anything about this transaction which harms anyone of those considerations or does not even or you could even say does not benefit the situation upon this considerations that it is entirely proper for the Board to take that into consideration."
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2329.253,2330.401,Or has to in every case?
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2330.401,2331.419,"Well, certainly."
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2331.419,2331.988,That's the rule of Congress.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2331.988,2347.075,"Well, certainly but the point is that in this case, they are denying this status, I suggest as part of their basic monetary policy of the United States and not because of anything good, better and different about this case."
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2356.016,2362.374,"Well, the Board simply says we took into consideration the financial resources of the bank concerned."
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2362.374,2364.418,"Well, that's what they in their opinion --"
1978.77-832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2364.418,2369.975,At which was Congress directed us to do in every case.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2369.975,2376.63,The most that can be said is that they claim in their opinion which is in the petition.
1978.77-832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2478.243,2483.93,Do you think they should ignore “monetary policy?”
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2483.93,2484.966,"Well, I would hope --"
1978.77-832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2484.966,2486.261,How could they?
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2486.261,2487.249,"Well, I think that --"
1978.77-832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.249,2490.104,In one grant you say that that's their job.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2490.104,2490.781,"Well, let me --"
1978.77-832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2490.781,2494.731,"And then your next grant you say, but they shouldn't do it when it comes up against my bank."
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2494.731,2508.12,I think that's the difference between this Court in any judicial body and an administrative body and I'll agree with Your Honor that they'll have a hard time doing that but I think they have the obligation when they have a judicial decision to make which this is.
1978.77-832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2508.12,2510.885,Where in the legislative history did you get any of this?
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2510.885,2524.384,"The legislative history if I may, the legislative history is that this is a judicial type decision and a judicial type decision means you got to be fair to both sides and act equally among all parties and that's what a judicial decision is."
1978.77-832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2524.384,2530.654,"Well, I should assume that any administrative body is obliged to do that whether it's judiciary or anything else."
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2530.654,2540.712,"But in an open market money committee meeting at the Federal Reserve Board, there's no plaintiff and no defendant and they simply decide on the basis of some administrative rule what they're doing."
1978.77-832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2540.712,2542.975,"Well, what's wrong with what was done here?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2542.975,2544.472,"What was done here, what is wrong is done here --"
1978.77-832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2544.472,2556.806,"What you wanted, do you take the rules says that once the Comptroller meets and decides in favor of the bank that all the Federal Reserve Board does is rob his time?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2556.806,2557.744,Not at all.
1978.77-832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2558.907,2561.093,What if -- what is different from that on the other --
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2561.093,2574.112,"Alright, the obligation of the Federal Reserve Board is they could definitely I think overrule the -- suppose the Comptroller had a bank that was in a failing condition and he said well, start a holding company and that'll pull it out."
1978.77-832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2582.693,2586.384,"Listen, it's a Federal Reserve Board, it's not the Federal Reserve Court."
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2586.384,2600.583,"Well, it is in this instance -- when they're exposed to make a judicial decision and decide between parties on the basis of a record, they're suppose to do it so fairly and I think that that's different from their general administrative responsibility over the money systems."
1978.77-832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2600.583,2602.677,"When you say between the parties, who are those parties?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2602.677,2609.93,Parties would be the applicant and the respondent which should be the staff of the Federal Reserve Board which shows to go against this.
1978.77-832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2611.723,2613.917,That's not a party situation in the normal context of --
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2613.917,2629.033,"Well, not in -- in the administrative law context, I think it might be considered that the Federal Reserve Board of Chicago strongly recommended this and the strongest of term, they said it was the bank would suffer severe detriment if it were not granted."
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2657.448,2670.692,"Mr. Collins, I'm having little difficulty following you when you talk about the Board's decision in this case being based on the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy, is that referred to by the Board in its decision?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2670.692,2671.5,No it is not.
1978.77-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2724.557,2726.282,That's not really what the Board said in this case though.
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2726.282,2727.518,"No, it is not."
1978.77-832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2756.652,2771.987,"Well, anytime you're adjudicating a case involving a particular applicant like your client here, you make the adjudication on individual factual determinations but then you apply policy to them, don't you whether its legislation or rule making or what?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2771.987,2785.104,"Well, my point is that should be at least some kind of written policy that someone can know and for them to simply to deny it on the basis of a record when in fact on the facts of the particular case nothing but benefit flows from it."
1978.77-832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2806.491,2825.663,"But suppose the Federal Reserve Board and looking down the road is their business includes that anything that will encourage speculation and bank stocks at a particular time is bad for the whole monetary system, then do you say they cannot take that policy into account?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2825.663,2853.466,"Well, if they -- if that policy were applied to this case, they would grant the holding company because when four people own stock that's tied up for many years that is not readily salable because its closely held and where they have to keep the 80% block together to qualify for the tax consideration, then in this case it wouldn't -- the application of such a policy would leave them in an arbitrary and capricious position."
1978.77-832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2870.141,2873.033,Just for this one transaction and this mean --
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2873.033,2874.381,I would think so.
1978.77-832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2881.794,2885.847,"Well, but the Federal Reserve Board has got to somewhat different function, has it not?"
1978.77-832,1,25070,george_b_collins,,2885.847,2890.318,"Well, I think in this instance, the way the statute and the procedure is written."
