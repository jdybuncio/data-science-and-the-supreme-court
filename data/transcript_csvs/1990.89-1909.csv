1990.89-1909,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1967.189,1970.482,Are you saying that that's the component of originality in this case?

1990.89-1909,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1989.917,1999.751,--what elements of originality have you added to those facts that make this a work of original authorship under 101?

1990.89-1909,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2050.775,2053.085,I'm not stunned by the originality so far.
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2055.597,2067.498,"--Well, the congressional intent behind that says that the... in dealing with the standard of original works of authorship, it says this standard does not include requirements in novelty, ingenuity, or aesthetic merit."
1990.89-1909,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2067.498,2070.357,"Yes, but it must constitute an original work of authorship?"

1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2158.836,2159.355,At--
1990.89-1909,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.355,2165.609,--You think... it seems to me that we have here a statutory definition that is obviously a definition of art.

1990.89-1909,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.031,2230.502,Right.
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2230.502,2231.053,And--

1990.89-1909,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.468,2258.872,And what... original... you--

1990.89-1909,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.001,2337.872,It would take a lot of time to reduplicate all the research he's done.

1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2357.283,2359.507,"--Well, that was his subjective decision."
1990.89-1909,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.872,2369.863,All right.
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2369.863,2377.948,"--like the patent copyright law, because if... well, let me go back a second here."
1990.89-1909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2392.818,2397.161,But they have to start from scratch and go door to door and do it.
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2402.544,2403.185,--Justice O'Connor--
1990.89-1909,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2403.185,2404.555,That's your position.

1990.89-1909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.898,2637.359,As a matter of fact they charge you to take you name out.
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2640.791,2647.716,"Well... that... Justice Marshall, I know that's the position, you know, when you're representing the telephone company, everybody hates the telephone company and utilities."
1990.89-1909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2649.767,2651.618,I'm not speaking about everybody.
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2652.97,2653.42,--If--
1990.89-1909,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2653.42,2654.169,Do you want to speak about it?
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2655.02,2683.968,"--If this Court were to find that because the bits... individual bits and pieces of this information in a directory are factual in nature and that the author's work of creating that directory, collecting, assembling, and making the decisions on how to put that out, if a defense would fly that, well, I'll wait until you put it out and spend $100,000 doing that and then I'll just copy it, like they did in this case--"
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.968,2687.662,"Well, just looking at the white pages alone you's still have the same number of telephone books, wouldn't you?"
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2696.808,2698.909,"--Justice Stevens, yes--"
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2698.909,2702.041,"And I suppose you're going to have to do it alphabetically, because otherwise nobody can use it."
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2702.041,2705.764,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I think that--"
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2705.764,2706.404,"Well, isn't that right?"
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2706.404,2710.847,"--Well, we're told by the Kansas Corporation Commission to annually publish a directory."
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2712.887,2716.641,Do you suppose any other form of directory would satisfy their requirement?
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2722.313,2724.595,"Justice Stevens, yes."
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2728.928,2730.478,In what respect does it differ?
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2730.478,2746.38,--Because of the... of this white page listing section could have been set out in 26 different alphabetical sections of the... encompassing the same listings because... in fact we have people that say that we're completely on the other side of western Kansas--
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2746.38,2746.921,"Oh, I see what you're saying."

1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2755.076,2755.627,I see.
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2757.257,2757.928,--Yes--
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.928,2772.046,"It's not the alphabetizing, it's if you had a single telephone company with just one area of service like the City of Chicago and nothing else, say, then it would have... there would... the same telephone directory would have to be published year after year."
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2772.046,2773.839,"--Yes, and that would be a decision for them."
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.188,2794.793,"Well, what other than the selection of which areas of service to be included in the directory would be different if we held it was not copyrightable?"
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2806.9,2810.02,I'm not sure if I understand your question.
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.02,2816.645,"Well, does the copyright law protection have any impact at all on your decision as to how to assemble the white pages?"

1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2830.654,2835.199,"I understand, but my question is would you create them any differently if there were no copyright law protection?"
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2836.628,2851.219,"--Well, Justice Stevens, to answer that question, there's a market for this information that if we do not put accurate, complete listing information, we're not going to sell the yellow page advertising."
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2851.219,2852.318,Well--
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2852.318,2855.711,"And in northwest Kansas, the revenue from this directory and from the yellow and white--"
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2855.711,2856.182,--From the yellow pages.

1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2867.32,2869.241,"Well, that's true whether or not there's copyright protection."
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2890.806,2892.105,"--Your Honor, I'm not sure what the company did."
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2903.783,2904.634,"--Sure, because they want people to use the service."
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2904.634,2905.145,--That's right.
1990.89-1909,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2929.01,2936.654,"And how does that... I understand that it may intrude on your revenues from the advertising yellow pages, but otherwise it doesn't have any impact on your business at all, does it?"
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2936.654,2940.688,"--Well, we... there is--"

1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2948.663,2952.126,"--Well, there is revenue produced from the white page listings."
1990.89-1909,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2973.239,2978.453,Are you... I take it the courts of appeals that have dealt with this are on your side.
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2978.453,2991.202,"Every... excuse me, Justice White, every single case since the landmark case of Leon in '37 to the most recent case of the United Telephone are... Illinois Bell--"
1990.89-1909,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.202,2993.973,What was the earliest case that's on your side?
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2993.973,2994.624,--Leon.
1990.89-1909,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2994.624,2995.723,What date was that?
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,2995.723,2996.765,1937.
1990.89-1909,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2998.986,3005.521,And Congress didn't intend to change the definition of an original work of art in '76.

1990.89-1909,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3010.122,3011.955,"Well, does that bring us to Section 103?"
1990.89-1909,1,29670,james_m_caplinger_jr,,3027.844,3033.978,"--Justice Kenney, in my opinion of 103 was set out--"

1990.89-1909,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.993,3411.936,All these decision against you were just wrong.
1990.89-1909,2,33879,kyler_knobbe,,3411.936,3415.819,--They're wrong under this definition of the statute.
1990.89-1909,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3426.143,3431.888,Is Section 103(a) an addition to the 1976 act in 103(b)?
1990.89-1909,2,33879,kyler_knobbe,,3431.888,3434.709,"Yes, I think so, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1909,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3454.654,3463.94,"That's very interesting, but I don't see how it has anything whatever to do with whether it's a copyrighted... I mean, that's a good argument for Congress."
1990.89-1909,2,33879,kyler_knobbe,,3463.94,3464.469,I'll pass over it then.
1990.89-1909,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3464.469,3466.091,I'll make an exception for this.
