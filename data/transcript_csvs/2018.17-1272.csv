2018.17-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.105,7.865,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1272, Schein versus Archer and White Sales. Mr. Shanmugam."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,7.865,17.06,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Arbitration Act requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms."
2018.17-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,44.965,66.97,"Mr. Shanmugam, can we back up and have you explain why we even get to a question, the question presented, because Schein has no arbitration agreement with Archer, so how -- what is this agreement? It's not between Archer and Schein."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,73.805,78.56,"Justice Ginsburg, there is a question in the case concerning non-parties."
2018.17-1272,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,163.2,163.93,Can we take this --
2018.17-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,163.93,169.245,I'm not sure your answer to Justice Ginsburg is totally responsive.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,196.255,211.75,"So, Mr. Chief Justice, I think there are two parts to your question. First, to pick up on my response to Justice Ginsburg, we are certainly not disputing that the issue of equitable estoppel, the issue of which parties are bound, is an issue that goes to validity."
2018.17-1272,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,275.85,276.39,But the question --
2018.17-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,276.39,303.035,"But clear -- clear and unmistakable delegation, why can't it be both; that is, that the arbitrator has this authority to decide questions of arbitrability, but it is not exclusive of the court? We have one brief saying that that is indeed the position that the Restatement has taken."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,303.035,319.32,"So all of the courts of appeals to have considered the issue have held that this type of incorporated delegation meets this Court's requirements, and let me explain why that's true, even though, again, that's an issue outside the scope of the question presented."
2018.17-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,428.83,442.565,"But the district court -- the district court made -- decided on alternative grounds, and wasn't the district court's first decision that this contract did not have a sufficiently clear and unmistakable delegation?"
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,442.565,447.69,"Yes, that is correct. And the Fifth Circuit then discussed the issue but ultimately did not rest on it."
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,498.45,498.9,Could I -- could I --
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,498.9,502.83,-- with the question of who decides to say that that defeats arbitrability here.
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,502.83,513.49,You just said the parties agreed to have the arbitrator decide this issue. Assume the Douglas -- facts of the Douglas case.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,565.85,566.02,Sure.
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,566.02,567.675,The arbitrator made a mistake.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,567.675,582.12,"So, Justice Sotomayor, let me address, you know, both that and the related question of what remedies are available to the arbitrator and -- and to the opposing party more generally in the event that a truly frivolous claim of arbitrability is raised."
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,582.12,582.63,Exactly.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,582.63,621.63,"I think, to address your question directly first, I think in a case where an arbitrator reaches an improper conclusion on arbitrability, the remedies, if any, would be those provided for review of arbitral decisions more generally. And as this Court is well aware, there is a very live dispute in the lower courts about the extent to which courts can review the merits of arbitrators' decisions and whether they can be reviewed for manifest disregard. That is an issue that this Court has left open. But I think that that would potentially be available."
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,639.19,650.605,"Basically, you're telling me at least on the express terms of enforcing an arbitration award under the statute, there is no remedy for that Douglas party?"
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,650.605,653.01,"Well, there is potentially review --"
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,653.01,653.31,If -- if --
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,653.31,654.75,-- for manifest disregard.
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,654.75,657.345,If we -- if we accept manifest disregard.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,657.345,657.83,Yes.
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,657.83,658.715,We haven't done that yet.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,658.715,659.6,Which is to say --
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,659.6,664.33,But there's no statutory provision under the Act?
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,664.33,680.305,"Which is to say that it's no different from review where an arbitrator reaches a wildly incorrect conclusion on the merits of an arbitral award. In other words, arbitrability is in the same bucket as any other issue that is properly remitted to the arbitrator."
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,680.65,681.11,Do you think that --
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,681.11,683.78,"-- if any, would be under Section 10 of the Arbitration Act."
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,683.78,688.545,Do you think that it could be the arbitrator exceeding their powers?
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,688.545,716.18,"Well, it could be. And I think that if you look at the lower courts that have reviewed arbitrability determinations, some of them have located review in exceeds powers in Section 10(a)(4), though even those courts have engaged in pretty deferential review. I think, as a practical matter, it's basically the same review as manifest disregard review, and it certainly is not the sort of de novo review that Respondent seems to contemplate."
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,716.18,768.465,"Can -- can you understand the common sense resistance to the idea that, if a party has not agreed to arbitrate a particular issue because it's wholly groundless, there is no way that an arbitrator could in good faith and without error reach a conclusion that arbitration was agreed to, seems counterintuitive to believe that we're sending a party to arbitration, to potentially go through the expense of arbitration when something's wholly groundless, and then potentially not to have an avenue of relief when it comes to enforcing the arbitration award."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,768.465,769.52,Justice Sotomayor --
2018.17-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,769.52,787.45,"That's why -- I'm sorry -- that's why I think one of the amici said the courts are not understanding that, at the core, this is always about have you agreed to arbitrate an issue? And, if you haven't, you shouldn't be forced to."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,787.45,815.975,"Justice Sotomayor, I'm sorry to have interrupted, but two points in response to that. First, I think it's important to the extent that we're talking about the parties' intent to recognize that the parties intended for the arbitrator to decide arbitrability. There was no carve-out, explicit or implicit, for wholly groundless claims, which is to say that where, as here, you have a dispute of this variety, you have one party saying that the claim of arbitrability is wholly groundless."
2018.17-1272,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,850.695,851.33,But why is that --
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,851.33,851.52,Now I do --
2018.17-1272,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,851.52,906.19,"-- Mr. Shanmugam? I mean, if you look at First Options, First Options is a case where we said we're not going to treat these delegation clauses in exactly the same way as we treat other clauses. And there was an idea that people don't really think about the question of who decides, and so we're going to hold parties to this higher standard, the clear and unmistakable intent standard. And wouldn't the same kind of argument be true here, that the parties never really considered who was going to decide these groundless claims of arbitrability, or maybe, if they did consider it, they would have thought that it was a pretty strange system to send it to an arbitrator just so that the arbitrator could send it back to the court? So that we are going to -- to -- you know, to -- to say that there's a special rule in interpreting these kinds of clauses."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,906.19,923.07,"Justice Kagan, I -- I -- there is obviously an interpretive rule that requires clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended to delegate the issue. But I would respectfully submit that, once you have that evidence, that rule falls out of the equation. And again, with --"
2018.17-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,923.07,950.07,"Why -- why do you have the evidence? When the -- the -- the model case is this Court's Rent-a-Car decision, and there the -- the clause said the arbitrator, not the court, has exclusive authority. And here we -- we're missing both the arbitrator, to the exclusion of the court, and the arbitrator has exclusive authority."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,951.27,965.96,"I think, Justice Ginsburg, if you take a look at page 946 of this Court's opinion in First Options, it focuses on the willingness of the party to be bound by the arbitrator's decision. And I think, with all due respect, we have that here."
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1000.1,1010.925,What's wholly groundless? What's wholly groundless? Is -- is he saying what's wholly groundless is the claim that arbitrability is to be decided by the arbitrator?
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1010.925,1011.5,No.
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.52,1016.03,Substantive.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1016.03,1017.375,-- arbitration.
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1027.61,1027.87,Okay.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1027.96,1028.65,-- but notwithstanding --
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1028.65,1040.96,-- so you say step 1. Is there clear and unmistakable evidence that an arbitrator is to decide whether a particular matter X is arbitrable? Is that right?
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1040.96,1041.605,Yes.
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1041.91,1049.53,"And step 2, the answer to the first question is yes, they did decide that clearly and unmistakably."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1058.445,1059.86,That is the regime --
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.86,1059.95,Okay.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1059.95,1061.81,-- that Respondent is advocating here.
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1061.81,1061.91,Yes.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1061.91,1063.92,And I would like to say a little bit about why we think that --
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1063.92,1064.82,"Well, I have a question about it."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1064.82,1065.43,Sure.
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1065.43,1077.47,"You say when you get to step 2, once we're there, now there is no wholly groundless exception, go send it to the arbitrator."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1078.505,1079.43,That is correct.
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1079.43,1079.59,Okay.
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1089.93,1102.055,"Are you saying no matter what, even if he has to read the word yes in the contract to mean no, never, under no circumstances, is there no exception no matter what?"
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1102.055,1103.29,"Yes, and picking up on Justice --"
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1103.29,1104.87,"Yes? Yes, no exception no matter what?"
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1104.87,1111.54,"There is no exception no matter what, but there are remedies available where a party makes a truly frivolous claim."
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1111.54,1111.71,What?
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1111.71,1120.76,"First, it is agreed that the arbitrator has the ability to impose a wide range of sanctions on a party that is making a frivolous argument."
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1126.575,1128.995,"The arbitrator, by the way, loves Martians."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1128.995,1130.33,"Well, what we contend --"
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1130.33,1134.16,So -- so what they're worried about is they're going to get a bad decision on this ridiculous claim.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1134.16,1137.54,But going back to the very early days or the relatively early days of this Court's --
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1137.54,1137.99,Yeah.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1137.99,1145.31,"-- FAA jurisprudence, this Court made clear in Shearson Lehman that we presume that arbitrators are fair, impartial decisionmakers."
2018.17-1272,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1145.31,1146.95,"Well, they may not --"
2018.17-1272,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1146.95,1147.13,Mr. Shanmugam --
2018.17-1272,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1147.13,1161.38,"Well, they may or may not love Martians, but do you think it's fair to say that they love arbitration, so they're not probably very much inclined to sanction parties who bring suit -- bring arbitrable disputes to them?"
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1161.38,1181.99,"They actually do have specific and explicit remedies under their rules for providing -- for imposing sanctions, including cost and fee shifting and the like. And it may very well be that after an arbitrator makes his or her determination that a district court would have the ability to impose sanctions under Rule 11 where the requirements of that rule have been met."
2018.17-1272,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1181.99,1192.07,"Well, how can it do that? If the court can't even take a peek at the arbitrability question itself, how does the court all of a sudden have the power to sanction a motion to compel?"
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1192.07,1202.46,"At least before remitting the issue to arbitration, I think there would be a conflict between Rule 11 and the Arbitration Act if a court were to make a merits determination first."
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1215.98,1220.775,Now what is the advantage -- what is the advantage of this? Because remember step 1.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1275.495,1282.47,But the whole point of the principle that the parties can delegate arbitrability to the arbitrator --
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1282.47,1282.64,Yes.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1282.64,1287.3,-- is that the parties can make a decision about who decides and where --
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1287.3,1288.07,"No, I understand that."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1288.07,1291.04,-- the parties' intent is sufficiently clear that the arbitrator --
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1291.04,1291.19,Yes.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1291.19,1291.98,"-- decides, it's --"
2018.17-1272,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1291.98,1315.065,"Well, it's never sufficiently clear if the matter that they're deciding to arbitrate is a Martian matter, unless they really said Martians, which I don't think would ever happen. In other words, if it is a totally ridiculous claim, shouldn't you have to find a clear and definite commitment to send a wholly ridiculous matter to the arbitrator?"
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1315.065,1341.65,"That goes to the merits, and wherever you set the bar, the fact remains that it is still a merits determination. And to the extent that this Court is concerned about this as a policy matter -- and I would respectfully submit that there is not a lot of evidence to indicate that this is a problem, perhaps not surprisingly, because often the defendants bear the cost of arbitral proceedings -- the regime that we are advocating is not only more faithful to the language of the Arbitration Act --"
2018.17-1272,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1341.65,1342.29,"Well, what about --"
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1342.29,1343.92,-- it is a much more efficient regime.
2018.17-1272,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1343.92,1355.705,"-- what about Section 4 of the Act, which Respondent points to as the front-end equivalent of what you alluded to in response to Justice Sotomayor as the back-end Section 10 review?"
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1355.705,1357.17,As this Court made clear --
2018.17-1272,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1357.17,1362.88,"The ""failure to comply therewith"" language in particular which they focus on, what does that mean and what does that do?"
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1362.88,1363.56,Sure.
2018.17-1272,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1389.765,1392.235,So what work -- what work does that language do?
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1392.235,1393.44,All that it --
2018.17-1272,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1393.44,1394.3,On performance.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1394.3,1395.13,-- requires --
2018.17-1272,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1395.13,1399.11,"I -- what -- give me an example of when that would have some effect, if there is one?"
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1399.11,1408.65,"Well, I -- I think that all it requires a court to do -- and this is a pretty minimal function -- is to determine that you have one party that wants arbitration and another party that does not."
2018.17-1272,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1408.65,1409.91,So that -- that's what I thought you'd say.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1414.705,1420.91,"Well, there has to still be a -- a -- a dispute, which is to say you've got to have one party --"
2018.17-1272,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1420.91,1423.04,"That's covered by the beginning of the Section 4, though."
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1423.04,1426.45,"Well, I -- I don't think so."
2018.17-1272,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1430.455,1438.03,A party aggrieved by the alleged failure or refusal to arbitrate. I'm -- I'm just trying to figure out what failure to comply therewith --
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1438.03,1449.17,"I think both sides agree that those two things are essentially reenforcing, which is to say that when you have a party that resists arbitration, the moving party is aggrieved."
2018.17-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1502.36,1514.555,But that was -- that was the court's -- left for the court to decide whether the motion was for the magistrate judge to reconsider or for the district court to review.
2018.17-1272,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1514.555,1536.29,"That explains three of the six years of the delay, Justice Ginsburg. But I really don't think it can be reasonably disputed that if the issue of arbitrability had gone to the arbitrator in the first instance, as it should have, that we probably would be entirely done with this case. And, of course, our fundamental submission is that there is simply no footing in the text of the Arbitration Act for this exception."
2018.17-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1553.9,1556.95,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Geyser."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1556.95,1565.37,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners' position is at odds with the FAA's plain language and the parties' obvious intent."
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1566.38,1570.09,But your position is contrary to Rent-A- -- Rent-A-Center?
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1570.09,1571.81,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1571.81,1586.28,"So explain it to me, because I think Rent-A-Center said that that language is limited to was there an agreement between the parties and was there a delegation; and if there is, don't look to the merits."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1586.28,1586.76,I -- I --
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1586.76,1595.62,I don't see how determining whether something is wholly groundless is anything but a merits determination.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1595.62,1612.265,"Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's what type of merits determination. Section 4's plain text authorizes the courts and, in fact, instructs them to have a gatekeeping function in looking at the merits of whether there's a failure to comply with the arbitration agreement. It says nothing at all about the failure to file a legitimate claim on the merits."
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1613.49,1614.775,I'm sorry.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1617.84,1627.86,"But Rent-A-Center, again, the -- what they were talking about in that case is they're saying that if the underlying merits is -- is frivolous, the underlying merits of the case, the actual lawsuit --"
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1627.86,1633.41,The Rent-A- -- Rent-A-Center didn't say that at all. Rent-A-Center said don't look at the merits at all.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1635.275,1636.14,"Well, I --"
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1636.14,1638.54,-- a particular form of the merits.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1638.54,1644.19,"Well, I don't think Rent-A-Center, though, is saying that if there's only one possible outcome, then you should send it to the arbitrator anyway."
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1681.58,1681.82,But doesn't --
2018.17-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1681.82,1685.695,"Well, that's the problem, isn't it? That's the problem with my prior suggestion."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1720.89,1723.14,"The -- there are a number of problems with that, Justice Breyer."
2018.17-1272,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1751.31,1777.235,"But doesn't that depend on the -- the -- the nature of the -- the agreement as to arbitrability? What did the parties agree to have the arbitrator decide? Suppose you have an agreement that says the arbitrator has exclusive authority to decide all questions of arbitrability, regardless of whether the claim of arbitrability has any merit whatsoever."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1778.35,1780.47,I -- I think that would be a highly unusual agreement.
2018.17-1272,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1780.47,1781.57,"Yeah, but what would you say?"
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1781.57,1785.87,"If -- if the parties said that, then I think you would have a failure to comply with that agreement."
2018.17-1272,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1792.9,1803.66,But that's a question of -- that's not the question that's before us. That's the question of the interpretation of the -- of this contract and the scope of what was delegated to the arbitrator.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1803.66,1816.08,"Well, but the -- the scope of what was delegated, the question here is did the parties actually agree at the outset, is there a clear and unmistakable showing that they intended to have an arbitrator decide a wholly groundless claim that has only one possible outcome?"
2018.17-1272,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1816.08,1825.995,"Well, I thought the question we agreed to take was whether there's a wholly groundless exception when the parties have agreed that arbitrability will be decided by the arbitrator?"
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1825.995,1853.15,"Well, but I think there are two different things here, Justice Alito. One is, is there a general delegation clause, which, again, wasn't even found in this case. It comes to the court assuming that there is one. And then the second is, if there is a general delegation clause, such as here it is incorporating the AAA rules, which, as Professor Berman pointed out, is a pretty tenuous hook to, again, satisfy a clear and unmistakable standard, did the parties when they said nothing else about it really intend to be subjected to frivolous arbitration claims?"
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1853.15,1895.6,"Mr. Geyser, the problem is that you're taking the position here that this was wholly groundless to consider a mixed injunctive relief and damages claim as being covered by this arbitration award. The other side makes a very compelling argument that, no, there's actually a ground to -- to say that injunctive relief goes to the court, but damages go to arbitrators. And when we have mixed claims, most courts will either send the matter to arbitration and stay the injunctive relief until the arbitration's over."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1937.885,1938.84,I agree.
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1944.53,1944.77,No.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1974.75,1975.57,It -- it -- it is.
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1975.57,1979.23,"So, you know, mistakes are made even by judges."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1989.47,1999.755,"Your Honor, the wholly groundless doctrine is a very modest inquiry. All you need to do to satisfy it, in respect to my friend, it is not asking the court to decide the arbitrability determination."
2018.17-1272,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2004.51,2009.065,But the court has to decide wholly groundless.
2018.17-1272,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2016.715,2017.575,Good question.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2017.575,2020.79,I think the -- where the line is drawn is where the courts of appeals have drawn it.
2018.17-1272,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2029.8,2030.48,But you're just --
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2030.48,2031.985,That's my problem with this case.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2031.985,2033.49,"Well, but, again, my friend, though -- my --"
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2033.49,2037.66,"It may be extremely weak, and I'm not sure that's true, but --"
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2037.66,2041.43,"Your Honor, respectfully, though, Petitioners sought review on one question, not two."
2018.17-1272,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2055.6,2055.88,"Well, Mister --"
2018.17-1272,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2055.88,2058.67,"You seem to be just, you know, slicing the baloney a little thin."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2078.655,2087.23,"I -- I think that the difference is, is there a legitimate or plausible argument? Is there any argument on the other side of the bound -- of the ledger? And, if there is, then the courts compel arbitration."
2018.17-1272,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2087.23,2092.49,So what standard should we say: Wholly groundless or no bona fide dispute?
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2092.49,2096.57,"I would say if there's not a bona fide dispute, then it goes to the arbitrator."
2018.17-1272,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2101.57,2109.77,"But -- but what does even that mean? Clearly, there's a bona fide dispute when two parties are litigating all the way to the United States Supreme Court. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2109.77,2110.31,"Well, but --"
2018.17-1272,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2110.31,2124.2,"Right? And so I know it's a small exception today, but the experience of this Court has been when it creates small exceptions, they tend to become larger ones with time. And -- and the whole point of arbitration, of course, is to try and streamline things."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2155.395,2157.65,It -- it -- it may take care of a lot of them.
2018.17-1272,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2161.72,2166.21,"So why -- so why do we need to go down the baloney slicing road, to mix my metaphors?"
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2166.21,2175.42,"Well, we -- we -- we suggested that the Court not grant review precisely because this is not a good vehicle for it because there's not a clear and unmistakable showing in any possible way, but --"
2018.17-1272,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2175.42,2179.39,So are you -- are you -- are you now saying we -- we don't need to answer the question presented --
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2179.39,2179.6,No.
2018.17-1272,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2179.6,2182.68,-- and you give up and go back to the court of appeals on the first one?
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2182.68,2183.63,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2018.17-1272,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2183.63,2184.24,I didn't think so. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2184.24,2184.87,Absolutely not.
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2227.37,2239.31,"Well, we have a magistrate judge who disagreed and we have other courts in other circuits, I'll bet, but we have other courts who have read it exactly the way they read it."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2245.78,2248.43,"Well, no, Your Honor. And just to be very clear on two things."
2018.17-1272,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2306.77,2315.965,"Well, what -- what injunctive relief does Archer seek? We're told that what Archer wants most of all is money damages."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2315.965,2324.83,"Well, and -- and the courts could have, or the parties could have -- and at least the ones that had the arbitration clause -- could have written this to say that the predominant relief is damages."
2018.17-1272,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2326.69,2331.57,But what kind of injunctive relief? Just let's take this down to the ground.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2331.57,2331.985,Sure.
2018.17-1272,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2374.575,2379.68,"On the text of the statute, you hang almost everything on the ""failure to comply therewith"" language."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2394.23,2397.09,"I -- respectfully, I -- I think he's mistaken."
2018.17-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2470.54,2483.785,"Is -- just follow me here -- is -- Professor Bermann, I thought, was writing an amicus brief on your side which says there isn't a clear and unmistakable commitment to arbitration."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2486.265,2490.47,The -- it's -- I think it's assumed in this case that there is even though he didn't quite --
2018.17-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2490.47,2495.205,"There is? So we'd -- so his -- so we'd say that that point he makes might be a good point, but that's not in the case."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2517.44,2520.66,"We -- you -- that is, in fact, what the Court I believe is doing."
2018.17-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2521.79,2522.52,It's pretty theoretical.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2523.46,2526.83,We -- we would warmly invite a DIG if the Court would like to -- to DIG the case. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.83,2527.425,Yeah.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2527.425,2536.56,"But, at the same time, though, we -- we do think there is, in fact, a ""wholly groundless"" doctrine just as there has been one for decades in the lower courts without any meaningful frustration of legitimate rights to arbitrate."
2018.17-1272,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2536.56,2552.3,"Mr. Geyser, can I go back to Justice Kavanaugh's textual question, because, when I stare at this language, ""the failure to comply therewith"" language, it seems to me I can read it two ways, neither of which is yours. So the first way is Mr. Shanmugam's minimalist way."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2580.1,2580.6,Sure.
2018.17-1272,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2592.075,2592.85,You can't do that?
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2592.85,2594.75,But -- but -- I'm sorry?
2018.17-1272,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2594.75,2595.61,Keep going.
2018.17-1272,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2595.61,2597.15,The ship has sailed. We're agreeing that the ship has sailed.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2597.15,2597.91,The ship has sailed.
2018.17-1272,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2639.98,2650.19,"But you -- you seem to agree with Justice Kagan, I think, that the statute doesn't, most naturally read, create a ""wholly groundless"" exception with that language."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2668.31,2670.45,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh, I don't think it's new at all."
2018.17-1272,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2672.75,2682.87,"It's new in the statute, is what I'm saying, in the sense that you had an all-or-nothing question, I think, with the statutory language, as Justice Kagan said, and the court decided that."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2682.87,2690.33,"Well, I think -- I think there are two ways to look at it, and one is a statutory hook, which I still do think is the best way to read this language."
2018.17-1272,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2717.95,2722.37,"But that goes, again, to the interpretation of the delegation of arbitrability."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2734.505,2735.24,There -- there is --
2018.17-1272,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2735.24,2736.425,"That's the argument, right?"
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2736.425,2745.92,"That -- that is -- that is part of the argument, Your Honor, and the reason I think it's correct is that no one anticipates being dragged into an absolutely frivolous dispute."
2018.17-1272,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2754.175,2769.065,But is that -- is that generally true when parties agree by contract on a particular decisionmaker? What if it's a forum selection clause? Is there an exception to that for wholly groundless disputes?
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2769.065,2780.545,"No, I think a forum selection clause would be slightly different because someone has to adjudicate the -- the underlying merits, whether it's this judge or a judge in a different district. That's not true, though, with a wholly groundless arbitration demand."
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2814.79,2837.39,"Sorry, but is this a sensible system where, even though we only have five cases over a long period of time in which courts have denied arbitration on wholly frivolous grounds, we're now inviting this fight in every motion to compel arbitration --"
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2837.39,2837.955,I --
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2837.955,2845.915,-- and that itself will multiply expenses? Maybe not in your individual case but as a burden on courts.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2845.915,2846.31,No --
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2846.31,2853.545,So it's not clear to me that your solution is more efficient in a meaningful way.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2853.545,2857.55,"I think our -- our solution is far more efficient, Your Honor, and if -- if I could explain why."
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2857.55,2858.71,Only if you win.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2858.71,2861.04,"Well -- well, if we win, then I -- I think --"
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2861.04,2862.135,If you win in court.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2862.135,2866.06,"Well, no, I think plaintiffs have -- have an incentive to have their cases adjudicated."
2018.17-1272,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2939.64,2961.715,"Could I go back? Beyond your saying it's not an efficient system, are you saying essentially that the -- that the basis for this rule is that we don't believe that a delegation clause includes this, that we don't believe that the parties intended for a general delegation clause to include these kinds of groundless questions? Is that basically the idea?"
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2961.715,2962.77,That -- that is certainly --
2018.17-1272,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2962.77,2964.025,The contractual idea.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2964.025,2964.74,Exactly.
2018.17-1272,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2966.3,2966.75,Yes.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2988.68,2991.06,"Oh, I -- I don't think that's strange at all, Your Honor."
2018.17-1272,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3030.785,3032.11,"Well, but you phrase it that way."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3045.6,3057.32,"I -- I think if the party is clear and unmistakable in saying that, even if the dispute has absolutely no conceivable merit, and everyone knows it's going to be back in court whether the parties like it or not, then, if they make that sufficiently clear, then debatably --"
2018.17-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3057.32,3057.67,A work --
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3057.67,3059.03,-- there is a failure under Section 4.
2018.17-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3059.03,3064.9,"But there's a work contract lawyer, labor, one of them says I'll tell you what I want arbitrated."
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3073.645,3076.85,"The -- well, I -- I think if it -- so if it's a wholly groundless --"
2018.17-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3076.85,3078.81,It has nothing to do with this contract.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3081.715,3089.05,"Again, I think the answer if the Court looks at it and says there's nothing for the arbitrator to do, then there's not a failure to comply by not filing an arbitration demand."
2018.17-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3089.05,3089.83,No failure to comply. Okay.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3094.92,3098.995,So I think -- and that's also consistent just with general litigation norms.
2018.17-1272,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3132.78,3139.82,"If you -- if we -- if we don't accept your argument, can you tell us, there are many, many open questions in this case, right?"
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3139.82,3142.33,There are many open questions in this case.
2018.17-1272,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3142.33,3144.895,So -- that the Fifth Circuit didn't decide?
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3144.895,3146.16,That's correct.
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3165.24,3168.305,It's not academic because our answer has a consequence.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3179.93,3180.48,Yes -- yes.
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3189.895,3193.11,"Well, that's only because you intend to win all the other questions. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3193.11,3195.15,"Well, we -- that's certainly our intent, Your Honor."
2018.17-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3195.15,3196.0,I can't tell you that.
2018.17-1272,1,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3196.0,3196.3,Yeah.
2018.17-1272,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3256.61,3258.85,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Shanmugam."
2018.17-1272,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3258.85,3279.53,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Respondents' argument today really assumes the answer to the inquiry when Respondent argues that the parties never would have wanted to arbitrate wholly groundless claims of arbitrability. The exact same argument could be made where the underlying substantive claims are frivolous."
2018.17-1272,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3298.795,3315.74,"It is a little bit different, though, Mr. Shanmugam, because in -- in the case that you said, if it's really groundless, you expect that the arbitrator will get rid of it just as fast as the court will get rid of it. What makes this case a little bit different from that is that, here, all the arbitrator is going to do is to send it back to the court."
2018.17-1272,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3318.6,3366.1,"But the arbitrator will make that determination presumably efficiently, will do so at the outset of the proceedings, and, of course, we're assuming here that the parties contracted to have the arbitrator make that determination presumably for the same reason that parties arbitrate -- parties agree to have arbitrators make merits determinations, because they conclude that that will be a more efficient and cheaper way of resolving the relevant issue. And Respondent has no answer for Justice Sotomayor's question about this Court's decision in Rent-A-Center which provides that, where the parties have remitted the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator, it should be treated just like any other issue. And what Respondent is asking this Court to do is to allow courts to make merits determinations on the issue of arbitrability even in the face of a delegation. And that brings me --"
2018.17-1272,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3366.1,3380.015,"Assuming for sake of argument only, hypothetically, that we disagree with you, there -- there, in fact, can be a wholly groundless ground -- pardon the pun -- do you lose --"
2018.17-1272,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3380.015,3380.59,Well --
2018.17-1272,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3380.59,3389.315,"-- under your question presented? Assuming that I thought, again, presuming only, that you had an arguable claim."
2018.17-1272,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3389.315,3395.2,We -- we continue to believe that we have a valid claim of arbitrability and certainly not a wholly groundless one.
2018.17-1272,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3401.93,3405.355,"But you don't under the question presented, if we disagree with you?"
2018.17-1272,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3405.355,3409.97,We didn't present a question concerning the application of the wholly groundless exception.
2018.17-1272,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3467.08,3472.215,"Yes, but in the law, I mean, normally, in the law, when a judge says something frivolous, he says so."
2018.17-1272,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3484.55,3487.15,There are certainly cases in the law more generally --
2018.17-1272,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3487.15,3487.94,It's not just arbitration.
2018.17-1272,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3488.71,3520.765,"I -- I recognize that, for instance, in the context of administrative law there are cases that stand for the proposition that, where an administrative agency concludes that it would be futile to have a hearing, the agency has the power not to hold the hearing. But this case is different from any of those cases because what Respondent is arguing is that, where the parties have agreed to have one decisionmaker make a determination, another decisionmaker has the power to short-circuit that determination. And, after all, the fundamental policy of the FAA is to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms."
2018.17-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3527.73,3528.76,"Thank you, counsel."
