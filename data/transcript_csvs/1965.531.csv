1965.531,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.21,"United States versus Blue, Number 531 on the docket."
1965.531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,21.471,25.878,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,1850.224,1854.831,"Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1981.507,2001.266,"May I interrupt just for a moment; I thought the Solicitor General said that the Court had found that he was not deprived of his right, to his ability to have counsel and so forth by reason of the -- of anything it had done on a -- under that jeopardy assessment."
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2001.266,2003.168,"At the time of the hearing, that is true."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2004.596,2008.024,"Well then, it has no application here, has it?"
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2008.024,2008.362,Well --
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2008.362,2010.361,Is it the material here?
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2010.361,2025.423,"It's material in this respect, as the Solicitor General stated, in the Daeche case in particular, it takes a lot of money to defend a case and we don't know how much money Ben Blue is going to make."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2315.267,2322.578,"Now, may I ask just how does that affect our case here, what you've just been saying?"
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2322.578,2355.26,"Well, what I am saying is that the use of the jeopardy assessment procedures, which was intended to be purely for civil purposes, is being used in this case to compel the defendant to incriminate himself, because the same income, the same tax is involved in the Tax Court case -- in the Tax Court petitions in the Tax Court case as are in the indictment."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2355.26,2371.24,"I understand that but you seem to stress the fact that the jeopardy assessment was a $100,000 or more and that the indictment only charged $40,000 or more."
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2398.24,2399.711,"Yes, Your Honor, the same principle applies."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2399.711,2403.307,Well what -- what is the difference between these variations?
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2403.307,2409.373,"Well, I think (Voice Overlap) perhaps indirectly I was attacking the whole jeopardy assessment procedures."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2412.776,2417.409,"Well, that may be but another day is another day, how does it affect this case?"
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2417.409,2421.785,The combination -- it's the combination of the jeopardy assessment.
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2526.717,2529.978,But has he been putting that position yet?
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2529.978,2542.59,He has because there is no way of extending the period of time in which the Government files a statutory notice after the jeopardy assessment is made.
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2574.994,2576.936,Had he done that?
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2576.936,2578.455,He did that.
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2578.455,2585.584,And did he do more than just to simply deny that he owed that money?
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2585.584,2591.682,"Well, in this particular case, there were general denials of what might be called general denials (Voice Overlap)."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2591.682,2593.301,Was there anything more than that?
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2598.004,2598.627,No.
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2601.457,2602.559,Take what?
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2602.559,2605.0,The depreciation of automobiles.
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2628.789,2637.695,I know but he never had -- he's never been compelled yet to do that at the time that the indictment was dismissed.
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2637.695,2646.684,"We -- there's no way of knowing how fast the Tax Court is going to operate and in this case, he has already -- he has his verifications."
1965.531,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2695.303,2698.892,Did you not suppress the Tax Court admission?
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2698.892,2699.616,I beg your pardon.
1965.531,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2699.616,2708.884,"Didn't you manage to suppress everything you said in the Tax Court, rather than dismissing that one?"
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2724.189,2736.999,"Well, then you get into a procedural matter which I think was brought up before."
1965.531,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2780.709,2794.137,"Well, that just omits suppression, that doesn't say you have to dismiss the indictment that you're confusing, it seems to me, immunity from suppression of a confession."
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2794.137,2794.571,Well --
1965.531,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2794.571,2796.198,Or statement.
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2796.198,2814.731,"Aren't we moving -- aren't we moving into -- aren't we moving into an area, Your Honor, where it's a question of -- what the question of due process and not -- and not a matter of evidence?"
1965.531,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2828.223,2832.457,And the Government hadn't a chance to show if he can get a fair trial.
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2836.532,2845.234,"Well, but he -- he has -- he has been compelled to come in and make statements under oath."
1965.531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.234,2855.043,Could you give one statement in his practical provision that you think is incriminated?
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2855.043,2862.29,"Well, I tried to give the example of the depreciation."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2862.29,2865.533,Did he admit anything in regard to that?
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2871.959,2873.843,"In this particular case, that's true."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2873.843,2874.471,Yes.
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2874.471,2880.744,"And if counsel had known at that time that there was going to be an indictment, this might have been a little different petition."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2893.235,2897.15,"Well, let me -- let me put this question to you."
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2942.419,2952.604,"Well, I believe procedurally, he would suppress the evidence and then wait for the Government to do something under the situation that you've just given me Mr. Chief --"
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2952.604,2954.792,"Yes, why shouldn't we do that here?"
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,2954.792,2966.104,"Well, there's another point which I haven't mentioned and that is the discrimination element of this."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3168.981,3188.88,"Mr. Mortenson, suppose the Government sued a man for taxes that he didn't pay for illegally operating a skill, would it then be deprive to be -- of the right to prosecute him until that case was decided?"
1965.531,1,22870,ernest_r_mortenson,,3188.88,3200.599,"Well, as the Government points out, Mr. Chief Justice, in its brief, this question may arise in other areas."
1965.531,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3248.014,3249.226,Solicitor General.
1965.531,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3249.226,3251.239,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.531,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3255.812,3257.385,Very well.
