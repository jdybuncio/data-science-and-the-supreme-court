2012.11-1221,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.752,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1221, Hillman v. Maretta."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,6.837,10.706,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,39.641,44.944,Why did it make an exception then only for divorce decrees?
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,44.944,47.729,Justice--
2012.11-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,47.729,55.666,"I mean, there is an express exception in the statute that the beneficiary can be changed by a decree of divorce."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,55.666,56.518,--Yes.
2012.11-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,56.518,66.624,"Now, why would Congress say that while at the same time believing that the beneficiary can effectively be changed without a decree of divorce?"
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,66.624,80.048,"Justice Scalia, because Congress knew that one of the main purposes behind FEGLIA was to help the insureds or enable the insureds to carry out responsibilities to their families."
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,84.936,96.074,"But it's written -- but it's written in such precise terms, it must be incorporated in a divorce decree, and the decree must be filed with the employee agency pre-death."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,108.967,128.029,"--Justice Ginsburg, I believe that the requirements that it get filed in -- it being a divorce decree and it get filed before death, are an example of Congress intending to preempt the field of interference with the FEGLI plan."
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,173.326,192.121,"Why should it be different than the outcome in Wissner and Ridgway and one -- one case that you cite quite often is the Hisquierdo case for -- you -- you cite it for deference to State domestic relations law, but what was the outcome in that case?"
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,192.121,197.859,The outcome in that case was the preemption prevailed in that case.
2012.11-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,243.588,254.528,"But, you know, the -- the exception suggests another thing besides the fact that it suggests that the only way the second spouse prevails is by a divorce decree."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,303.611,311.882,"--Well, the exception for divorce decrees I would analogize to the Rose case, when this case was -- when this Court was addressing veterans' benefits."
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,371.937,372.987,What -- what was the issue?
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,374.721,388.129,"In Rose, there was veterans' benefits and those -- he was being sued in State court for enforcement of child support and those were his only assets."
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,388.129,391.75,"Now, they were taking them from him to support his family."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,391.75,392.4,Correct.
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,392.4,393.733,Which is quite something different.
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,399.687,402.056,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.081,416.648,And you think that's the -- that's the purpose of this exception for divorce decrees?
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,416.648,417.734,--I think that--
2012.11-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,417.734,425.504,"In your experience, a man usually has more children or children in his second marriage than he did in his first?"
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,425.504,428.706,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.706,429.792,"No, I don't think so, either."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,438.246,447.937,I think what Congress was doing is Congress was making a statement -- I don't think they were trying to say they were looking at this divorce law in particular.
2012.11-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,488.329,492.633,"In other words, they're preempted, but the whole purpose of the preemption can be thwarted."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,492.633,498.869,"--Justice Kennedy, it's not the purpose of the preemption."
2012.11-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.494,598.985,"Once again, the divorce exemption blows away that -- that explanation, that all Congress is concerned about is efficient administration of the plan so long as the insurer will know."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,618.631,623.2,"--Well, they're -- they're not going to have to check unless it's been properly filed, but--"
2012.11-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.2,624.216,Okay.
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,628.685,629.27,"--Yes, yes."
2012.11-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,648.498,665.21,"But -- but quite apart from -- from that, it -- it seems to me that under your proposal the Congress would actually have accepted a situation where one spouse sues a former spouse."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,681.403,682.739,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,682.739,684.739,Or would the insurance company itself be under some liability?
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,684.739,688.492,"Justice Kennedy, that's the -- the whole point, is that the insurance company isn't--"
2012.11-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,688.492,690.958,That's the design of the statute.
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,690.958,691.791,--That's the design of the statute.
2012.11-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,691.791,700.314,"But I'm just wondering whether under State law the insurance company, if it -- if it knows this doesn't have some duty to refrain from making the payment or to put it in escrow or to interplead."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,700.314,701.53,Not at all.
2012.11-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,711.286,715.174,"And if you're representing the insurance company, you wouldn't say you better interplead to be on the safe side?"
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,715.174,728.248,--I think this Court can establish the -- I think they have established under the Kennedy case that they have a duty to pay the designated beneficiary.
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,745.526,753.365,"Mr. Ruttenberg, how do you get to this notion that administrative convenience is all that is involved?"
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,797.308,798.91,I believe that the.
2012.11-1221,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,850.443,873.558,"If an insured, after making a designation of a beneficiary, writes a will and leaves the insurance proceeds to a different person, the Federal law would still, as interpreted by the State Supreme Court, require the money to be paid to the designated beneficiary, wouldn't it?"
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,873.558,874.308,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,874.308,887.882,And what does that say about Congress's supposed desire to ensure that the money goes to the person that the insured wants it to go to?
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,887.882,905.61,"Well, Justice Alito, after the money has been paid out in a case like that, it is possible that there are State laws involved that -- that would allow someone to have a suit, institute a suit against who received that."
2012.11-1221,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,917.735,938.664,"Well, the point is if Congress's objective, if one of its objectives in addition to administrative convenience was to effectuate the will of the insured, then I don't see why it would provide for Federal law to override a subsequent will which directly expresses the desire of the insured."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,938.664,943.118,I don't think FEGLIA says that.
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,944.034,945.018,You would agree with that?
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,950.372,950.872,--Yes.
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,950.872,953.324,That it has only to do with administrative convenience?
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,953.324,957.376,"Well, I don't want to say that it has only to do with that."
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,963.446,975.27,Why should this scheme be treated differently than the National Service Life Insurance and the successor law in Wissner and Ridgway?
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,991.882,1000.055,There's -- there's a -- you have to compare the FEGLIA and the SGLIA to get the intent of Congress.
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1014.797,1024.253,"But the two decisions that dealt with the anti-attachment, they gave that as an alternative ground of decision."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,1035.561,1037.194,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1084.525,1092.647,"In -- in your briefs in this case, you put in the assignment provision as -- as an afterthought."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,1102.522,1104.255,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1104.255,1110.626,So you -- you seem to assign lesser importance to it.
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,1110.626,1125.469,I do assign less importance to the assignment provision than I would to the -- the lack of an anti-attachment provision or the -- the divorce provision or the express preemption provision or even the legislative history.
2012.11-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.859,1172.516,"I keep -- I keep coming back to the explicit divorce provision, which says when there's a divorce decree, only properly filed, it, without a change by the beneficiary, goes to the new wife, okay."
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,1226.267,1231.305,There -- there are two -- two points I'd like to make there.
2012.11-1221,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1294.647,1295.963,So why not just say that?
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,1320.965,1330.337,"--I believe that's basically what they did, because the other type of court orders such as a waiver wouldn't make sense to put in there."
2012.11-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1380.267,1393.51,"Mr. Ruttenberg, what about the interest, which was an interest in Wissner and in Ridgway, of uniformity under this Federal insurance scheme?"
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,1441.674,1455.067,"Congress was definitely concerned with -- and -- and as, again, I keep referring to the Rose case because I think it worded it well -- it was concerned with the uniformity of the administration of the policy."
2012.11-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1529.632,1535.12,"Why don't they just say, look, if the -- if the State law says so, the -- the new wife gets it?"
2012.11-1221,0,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,1563.203,1569.443,--The -- the first reason is because I don't think they wanted to try and come up with every permutation of divorce law.
2012.11-1221,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1592.639,1593.805,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1597.124,1605.296,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1683.896,1692.918,"Of course, if the ex-wife were in bankruptcy proceedings this money would not necessarily go to her, right; it would go to the bankruptcy estate?"
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1692.918,1697.389,"It -- it might, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1697.389,1702.543,So -- so why is the State law any different--
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1702.543,1703.793,"Well, Congress--"
2012.11-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1703.793,1707.345,--with respect to divorces?
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1707.345,1710.716,"--Well, one reason, Your Honor, is 8705(e)."
2012.11-1221,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1730.627,1741.668,"Well, my problem with this case is, other than administrative convenience, I don't see what purpose Congress could have thought that this provision serves."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1741.668,1746.653,"Your Honor, there is certainly elements of administrative convenience in the statute."
2012.11-1221,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1746.653,1750.188,What else -- what other -- what other objective do you think Congress was trying to achieve?
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1750.188,1759.211,"It was trying to provide a benefit to Federal employees, and that benefit was to be able to provide benefits, life insurance proceeds, to the person of their choice."
2012.11-1221,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1759.211,1772.037,"Why would it override the expressed will of an insured in -- the express desire of an insured in, for example, a will that's executed after the time of the assignment--"
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1772.037,1773.253,In the case of--
2012.11-1221,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1773.253,1774.989,--and the designation of the beneficiary.
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1774.989,1782.409,"--In the case of a will, Your Honor, 8705(a) makes specific provision for the filing of a will with the employing officer, OPM."
2012.11-1221,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1809.06,1809.812,But why?
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1832.426,1840.082,"Congress wanted a simple rule, and it determined that the best evidence of intent is the actual naming of the beneficiary."
2012.11-1221,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1841.815,1844.15,How can that be the best designation of intent?
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1855.607,1871.217,"--Well, I think you can debate what the better policy default is, but when you have a long-standing policy that says to Federal employees, This is what we take account of and we give top -- top billing, top priority to the naming of the beneficiary--"
2012.11-1221,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1871.217,1879.14,"Mr. Johnson, that -- that is in the OPM manual, but I think Mr. Ruttenberg pointed out that it's 106-some-odd pages."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1893.049,1895.918,"--The simplest answer, Justice Ginsburg, is the form itself."
2012.11-1221,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1922.236,1925.188,"Well, why do you resist -- I'm just curious."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1947.967,1949.653,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1950.803,1951.436,Is that right?
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,1951.436,1954.873,"--Well -- well, it is true that if you open the door you'll have this be problem."
2012.11-1221,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1967.031,1984.309,"Well, that provides a simple -- that provides a -- a simple rule for the people who are affected by this dispute, and those are the people who are -- who stand to benefit either under the designation of the beneficiary or under the will."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2006.723,2008.506,I think that's part of what was involved here.
2012.11-1221,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2100.464,2123.562,"If he is right, if the only consideration that led Congress to make this absolute rule and so forth the underlying the previous holdings, if the only consideration were ease of administration by the Federal administrator, this statute wouldn't undermine it."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2135.703,2139.921,If the question is whether it's possible to comply with the mandate to pay the named beneficiary--
2012.11-1221,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2139.921,2140.205,Yes.
2012.11-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2167.255,2169.788,He's -- by the time the issue comes up.
2012.11-1221,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2169.788,2170.873,--Is there anything else?
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2170.873,2175.008,"--In -- in many cases, Your Honor, the former spouse will have the care of children."
2012.11-1221,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.145,2183.181,"Well, maybe we should say, look, this is a statute that is absolute."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2194.585,2196.868,"And that would be -- and that would be a short route to affirmance, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.868,2197.251,Right.
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2197.251,2200.905,This Court has spoken to the -- the nature of language like this.
2012.11-1221,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2222.352,2225.62,"But I guess the question, Mr. Johnson, is whether we just got it wrong there."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2259.191,2275.22,"--It's conceivable, Your Honor, but at a minimum, I think this -- this Court has said repeatedly that when this Court's ruled on the meaning of language and -- and a similar language is adopted in a new statute, it's given the judicial interpretation unless Congress says otherwise."
2012.11-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.837,2291.93,"Yes, I guess -- I guess you might -- you might respond also that, you know, it's characterized by -- by your -- your friend as a -- a State law having to do with -- with marriage and -- and so forth."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2350.451,2352.387,"--Either way, it's preemptive, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2388.66,2403.17,"Mr. Johnson, there are at least one case where the State law would override the beneficiary designation and that's obviously if the beneficiary murdered the -- the insured."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2418.13,2423.749,"Your Honor, I believe -- I do agree with the premise of your question was that the -- which is that the Slayer would not be paid."
2012.11-1221,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2471.397,2475.351,"--So you get there by a Federal common law rule, but then who would get the proceeds?"
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2487.426,2489.142,"No, it would go to the order of precedence."
2012.11-1221,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2489.709,2492.075,The next one is -- it would be--
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2492.075,2498.246,"--It would be the widow or the -- then the children and so forth, in that scenario."
2012.11-1221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2554.065,2559.053,"In the -- in the Wissner case, there was a community property State."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2572.363,2573.879,"I think that would be right, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2575.398,2583.169,"Because it was a specific provision on that point in Wissner, and I -- or the Court so read it."
2012.11-1221,1,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2587.539,2588.106,--Yes.
2012.11-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2667.658,2669.008,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2682.334,2684.536,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2710.485,2711.787,"Well, how far -- how far does that go?"
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2727.463,2735.217,"--That's true, Your Honor, but the designated beneficiary is benefiting in a sense when that money is used to pay that person's obligations."
2012.11-1221,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2769.973,2781.864,"Well, why would Congress want to make sure that the money goes to the designated beneficiary where there is a very clear expression of intent on the part of the insured that the money go someplace else."
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2781.864,2788.102,"Well, I think there are a number of purposes served by that, and that speaks to the will question that Your Honor asked earlier."
2012.11-1221,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2808.081,2809.765,These arguments seem to be circular.
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2826.727,2831.363,"--Well, it creates a clear and uniform set of rules that everyone can abide by."
2012.11-1221,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2863.083,2864.935,But your -- your concern is there might be fraudulent wills?
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2864.935,2875.142,"--It's possible that if you are looking outside the designated -- the beneficiary designation form, that you may have people trying to come up with some other expressions of intent."
2012.11-1221,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2878.177,2880.027,"Well, it seems to me that's grasping at straws."
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2880.027,2891.919,"Well, Your Honor, that's, as I say, one of the purposes that Congress gave when it passed that amendment in 1966 that said you don't conduct this free-floating inquiry into the insured's intent."
2012.11-1221,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2915.367,2917.486,When are they told -- when are they told over and over again?
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2917.486,2918.369,"--Well, they--"
2012.11-1221,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2918.369,2930.56,"They -- they get the form when they -- when they sign up for the life insurance, so they periodically get notices from OPM saying, now, remember, you've designated so-and-so as your beneficiary, you know, annually, like in the open season?"
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2932.746,2941.1,--OPM actually does instruct agencies to periodically remind employees that they must keep their beneficiary designations up to date.
2012.11-1221,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2944.485,2946.337,Nobody has told me that in many years.
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2948.356,2950.372,--I hope it's clear at this point.
2012.11-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2950.372,2955.009,"Well, but I mean, we do get these cases over and over again."
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2960.913,2968.517,"That may be, but, nevertheless, Federal law sets up the rules and expects people to abide by them."
2012.11-1221,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3038.594,3051.419,"Do you think that situation comes up a lot, where an -- an insured wants to make sure that a former spouse gets more money than the spouse is entitled to under the divorce decree?"
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3051.419,3053.62,"I certainly think it's possible, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3056.722,3057.688,"Well, everything is possible."
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3060.274,3061.207,I don't know--
2012.11-1221,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3061.207,3061.707,--was concerned about?
2012.11-1221,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3061.707,3070.813,"--I don't know if I can speak to how common it is, but, as we said in our brief, there may be many reasons why somebody would want to give their ex-spouse the insurance proceeds."
2012.11-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3141.326,3142.892,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1221,3,21433,daniel_h_ruttenberg,,3145.061,3148.746,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.11-1221,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3312.801,3314.918,"Thank you, counsel."
