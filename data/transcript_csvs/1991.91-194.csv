1991.91-194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-194, the Quill Corporation v. North Dakota."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,45.112,52.866,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,135.253,153.214,"I suppose you concede that if Quill had an office in North Dakota that... and solicited out of there, and they had an inventory, there wouldn't be any problem, would there?"
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,153.214,154.766,"Your Honor, we would not before this Court."
1991.91-194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,158.718,164.372,That has hardly balkanized the American market.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,164.372,178.449,"--No, the balkanization occurs because North Dakota and other States are suggesting to this Court that National Bellas Hess is no longer the jurisprudence to determine what is subject to tax."
1991.91-194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,181.484,183.251,Only where mail order houses are concerned.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,183.251,183.334,"--Yes, sir."
1991.91-194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,231.565,236.386,Is that on the assumption that there's a due process component to Bellas Hess?
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,236.386,243.04,"Bellas Hess, Justice Kennedy, involves two aspects, commerce and due process."
1991.91-194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,281.581,288.084,Suppose we were to conclude that our reading of Bellas Hess is that it's simply a commerce clause case.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,298.459,311.35,"Justice Kennedy, I would submit that under this Court's analysis in National Bellas Hess, Complete Auto, National Geographic, and every case preceding and succeeding, that there is both a commerce and due process nexus question."
1991.91-194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,311.35,314.469,--I'm just saying suppose we disagree with that?
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,314.469,317.521,"Your Honor, you would have to overturn National Bellas Hess."
1991.91-194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,321.992,334.132,"You're saying then that if we find that there is no due process component, at least no viable due process component, then we must overrule National Bellas Hess."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,334.132,340.369,"--Your Honor, I'm suggesting that the commerce clause and the due process component... when we speak of due process, there are two aspects."
1991.91-194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,391.486,399.342,"Well, if you want to argue the case on the theory that Bellas Hess must rest on a due process analysis--"
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,399.342,400.325,I'm arguing--
1991.91-194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,400.325,401.944,--I suppose that that's your choice.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,426.059,427.475,"--Your Honor, I--"
1991.91-194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,427.475,433.629,"If you want to say that Bellas Hess then must be overruled, I suppose you're at liberty to argue that."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,433.629,436.265,--I may have been misunderstood.
1991.91-194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,470.854,485.348,"Well, that's exactly the point, that is we're forced to address here, whether that physical presence requirement should exist anymore after Complete Auto and the cases following it."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,485.348,486.164,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,490.667,500.79,I would have thought you might want to rest your argument just on the commerce clause and say it is better left to Congress to change.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,506.861,516.116,"--Your Honor, again, I must be misspeaking because I am suggesting to you that Bellas Hess relies on the commerce."
1991.91-194,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,666.648,672.152,"Was the... in the opinion in Complete Auto, was National Bellas Hess cited?"
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,672.152,674.121,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.91-194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,906.27,909.489,"Well, what's the reason for the nexus requirement under the commerce clause?"
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,913.876,917.995,"It's not only for discrimination, Your Honor, it's for the national marketplace."
1991.91-194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.388,938.741,You think we have a national market only for mail order businesses?
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,938.741,939.474,"--No, sir."
1991.91-194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.693,942.376,"Well, I mean that's very strange."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,953.751,956.018,"--Oh, Your Honor, I suggest otherwise."
1991.91-194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,976.665,980.818,I'm saying that seems to me a very limited notion of what the founders' vision was.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,983.12,984.387,The founders' vision?
1991.91-194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.387,987.389,We want a national mail order telephone market.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,987.389,987.989,"No, no."
1991.91-194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1037.405,1039.44,"Yes, but you're missing my point."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1045.594,1046.461,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1046.461,1053.098,"And says, my goodness, we send these salesmen out into the so-called national market, and we're going to be taxed by every one of these jurisdictions."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1054.034,1055.95,"No, Your Honor, I don't say that's okay."
1991.91-194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1055.95,1056.736,"You don't say national market for that, do you?"
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1056.736,1057.702,I'm not saying that's okay.
1991.91-194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.18,1104.049,I'm not sure you're understanding me.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1117.607,1122.178,The... the physical presence that... this Court has drawn the mark--
1991.91-194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.178,1128.498,"I know what we've done, but you're elevating it to a point of principle and not mere fact."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1128.498,1129.082,--The--
1991.91-194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1129.082,1132.05,You're saying that this has something to do with our national market.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1132.05,1132.867,--The benefit--
1991.91-194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.867,1141.973,"But you're perfectly willing to have the national market fragmented by allowing these... how many thousands of jurisdictions... tax drummers, except for the benefit of a Federal statute."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1141.973,1151.011,"--Oh, Your Honor, the presence of a drummer, the warehouse, the retail outlet in the State, the out-of-State vendor is now in State."
1991.91-194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1175.646,1177.563,And would you say that they're part of a local market?
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1209.7,1220.389,"Oh, but I think, Your Honor, that when you juxtapose the benefits derived from the vendor in the State, those are clear benefits."
1991.91-194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1342.12,1346.171,"Well, I'm sure they are."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1381.095,1386.898,"Yes, Your Honor, and I would agree with you except this case is distinguishable."
1991.91-194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1412.364,1418.87,"Well, you might go beyond that, Mr. Gaggini, rather than just saying the merits were rightly decided."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1436.046,1437.081,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.91-194,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1441.116,1443.585,Provided it's not on due process.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1445.954,1447.12,"--Your Honor,--"
1991.91-194,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1447.12,1453.591,That's why I share the two Justice's comments that we're a little concerned that you're putting it on both pins.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1453.591,1460.964,"--Well, I am not suggesting this Court doesn't retain its right to analyze any congressional legislation."
1991.91-194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1536.594,1541.446,"Counsel, refresh my recollection."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1562.978,1567.763,"Your Honor, there was an excellent compilation which is attached to--"
1991.91-194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1567.763,1568.299,"Well, how many States?"
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1569.099,1570.399,"--Thirty-two States, Your Honor."
1991.91-194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1570.399,1570.815,Thirty-two.
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1570.815,1572.584,Thirty-two have adopted legislation.
1991.91-194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1593.58,1601.686,"And if we were to overrule National Bellas Hess all those things would have kicked in for several years back, I assume."
1991.91-194,0,30651,john_e_gaggini,,1601.686,1610.959,"--Yes, Your Honor, there... there's a horrendous... historical... the retroactive liability is so dramatic in this case because it's not the tax liability of the vendor we're talking about."
1991.91-194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1691.578,1694.613,"Thank you, Mr. Gaggini."
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1696.315,1706.838,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, members of the Court, may it please the Court:"
1991.91-194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1728.119,1730.269,Are you asking that Bellas Hess be overruled?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1730.269,1732.088,"--Yes, I am, Justice Blackmun."
1991.91-194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1738.658,1745.296,"Of course, of the present members of the Court, I think only Justice White was here at the time, and he was a member of the majority."
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1745.296,1747.248,"--Exactly, and that's why I wore this tie today."
1991.91-194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1758.221,1759.955,Do you have any better reasons?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1760.855,1767.661,"--If you give me a minute, Justice Kennedy, I'll think of some."
1991.91-194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1796.644,1808.219,"Would that involve potential retroactive liability covering several years and in a large number of the States, General Spaeth?"
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1808.219,1808.988,It might.
1991.91-194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1812.606,1815.142,"It would be a very substantial in amount, would it not?"
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1815.142,1815.508,--It could be.
1991.91-194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1826.264,1828.3,"Well, I suppose you've seen the handwriting on the wall there?"
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1828.3,1829.3,--Yes.
1991.91-194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1843.125,1868.527,"Of course it bears on it in this way: if National Bellas Hess rests on the... dormant commerce clause, certainly Congress can take care of this problem, and it could rightfully weigh the really massive concerns here for retroactive liability and try to sort it out in a fair and reasonable way."
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1868.527,1869.727,That's the problem--
1991.91-194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.727,1875.18,"Now, that's not going to happen if this Court decides to jump the gun and turn the tide."
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1875.18,1882.334,"--The problem, Your Honor, is that Congress is, as this Court well knows, ill suited the weigh the complexities of this decision."
1991.91-194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1882.334,1888.571,They're much better suited to do than we are because they can deal with the retroactivity problem.
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1888.571,1897.141,But every time this issue has been presented to Congress it's been stalemated... in no small part because the Direct Marketing Association has argued Bellas Hess is a due process case.
1991.91-194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.141,1903.128,"But that doesn't mean the Congress is ill suited to do it, just because it doesn't pass the law that you want."
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1904.013,1909.065,"I was speaking about the political realities, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.904,1917.537,"Well, that's the way the game goes."
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1917.537,1918.237,--That's right.
1991.91-194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.58,1946.256,"Well, if we were to reverse the Supreme Court of North Dakota here, say that Bellas Hess is still good law, but that was based on the commerce clause, not the due process clause, would that solve some of your problems?"
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1946.256,1948.708,"Well, that would give me half a loaf, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1991.91-194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.708,1949.442,Better than none.
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1949.442,1954.279,"It's better than none, but as you might understand, I'm hoping for the whole loaf here today."
1991.91-194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.827,1985.795,"As Mr. Gaggini would say, that shows you what a free market will do."
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1986.345,1991.433,I think it shows you what big 5 or 6 percent tax advantage does as well.
1991.91-194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2006.875,2015.731,"Is it correct, General Spaeth, that as the record seems to disclose, Quill is only the number 6 in North Dakota?"
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2015.731,2016.198,That's correct.
1991.91-194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2016.198,2017.083,Who are the other five?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2020.202,2024.57,I think they are the largest direct marketer of office equipment in the State.
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.724,2031.774,You mean they're collecting the tax?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2031.774,2034.592,"--Yes, they agreed to do it after we went after them."
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.628,2046.233,"Are you just saying we were flat wrong in Bellas Hess, or do you think there have been developments since them that make Bellas... that undermine Bellas Hess, or both?"
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2046.233,2050.018,"Well, in all due deference, Justice White, I think you were flat wrong in National Bellas Hess."
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.109,2087.226,Why does North Dakota deserve to collect the tax?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2093.38,2095.947,We don't provide them anything.
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.82,2103.436,Is that the State?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2103.436,2104.22,Yes.
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.855,2108.071,How about the phone lines?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2108.071,2108.807,We regulate the phone lines.
1991.91-194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2119.596,2126.934,That's the argument that was rejected in Bellas Hess after being quite eloquently portrayed by the dissent.
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2126.934,2128.384,"I agree with you, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1991.91-194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2138.759,2141.342,Have there been any other changes in the national market?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2148.031,2148.565,Yes.
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2261.054,2268.192,Do you think you could require the out-of-State marketer to qualify to do business in the State?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2268.192,2273.512,To register as a business?
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.512,2273.946,Yes.
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2273.946,2274.548,"Yes, we could do that."
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.281,2277.833,"If you win this case, you would."
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2277.833,2278.716,"--Yes, we would."
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.246,2304.667,How do... can you get jurisdiction over these out-of-State sellers in your own courts?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2304.667,2306.667,"--Yes, in a variety ways."
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.667,2309.019,"What, under your long arm statute?"
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2309.019,2309.435,Yeah.
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.774,2323.376,Under your long arm statute?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2323.376,2324.176,--Right.
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2348.491,2360.632,"Well, how long has... the North Dakota law has been in its present form only since you changed the regulations to redefine who a retailer was?"
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2360.632,2361.199,That's correct.
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.199,2362.001,How long has that been?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2362.001,2363.151,Since 1987.
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.151,2364.384,So '87.
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2368.905,2371.124,"Well, that's not my decision, but there's a possibility."
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.124,2372.774,"I know, but I suppose you'll try."
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2372.774,2373.892,"Yeah, there's a theoretical--"
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.892,2374.826,Who would you try to collect from?
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2374.826,2375.609,--From Quill.
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.609,2377.844,And not from consumers.
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2377.844,2378.628,That's correct.
1991.91-194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2395.405,2398.09,"Well, you're right now able to move against the consumers, I guess."
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2398.64,2400.307,--If we knew who they were.
1991.91-194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.161,2414.616,"Well, I just thought you told me... you told us that all these marvelous computer developments around, so everybody knows everything about everything."
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2417.382,2426.405,I think it would be very difficult for us to go to all the direct marketing companies that market in the State and try to figure out if they made sales in the State of North Dakota.
1991.91-194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2432.927,2439.664,Mr. Gaggini mentioned that some States require filling it out on their income tax returns.
1991.91-194,1,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2443.366,2447.703,"He mentioned one State, Maine, and I can explain that in two words: L.L. Bean."

1991.91-194,2,30651,john_e_gaggini,,2620.046,2630.004,"--It's that the consumer's decision, and there's a citation to the Congress hearings, Justice Stevens, that the consumer doesn't make a decision necessarily on sales and use tax collection."
1991.91-194,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2639.526,2644.18,"Yeah, but you're not denying you have a sales... a competitive advantage over those who pay a tax?"
1991.91-194,2,30651,john_e_gaggini,,2644.18,2647.215,"Your Honor, I'm saying that's not a decision of the consumer."
1991.91-194,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2717.66,2718.979,"Thank you, Mr. Gaggini."
