1978.78-160,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,58.879,We'll hear arguments next in Wilson against Omaha Indian Tribe and the consolidated case.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,69.647,74.484,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,132.166,146.619,"Mr. Smith, I was a little confused by the -- just the nexus of what you're telling us now about the factual situation by the State of Iowa petitioner's reply brief filed here on March 17."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,154.964,156.371,That's a typographical error.
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.371,157.398,Within the State of Iowa.”
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,157.398,158.363,It should be “east.”
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,159.676,160.541,Shouldn't it?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,160.541,161.076,It should be “east.”
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,161.076,161.152,Yes.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,161.152,170.487,"It's been on the east bank, for 48 years at least, and some of it for 85 years."
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,201.495,204.535,Is there a helpful drawing in these papers?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,204.535,219.48,"Yes, on the back of the white appendix, there is a drawing, a map, of this area and, there, it shows the present river."
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,239.719,242.517,You say that's where -- there are several drawings in representation.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,242.517,250.712,"That's right, but they -- the one I'm referring to is on the back sh-- cover, attached to the back cover."
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,250.712,251.743,Of the white -- I see it.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,251.743,253.359,Of the white appendix.
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,253.359,256.81,That is the appendix to the petition for a writ of certiorari.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,256.81,257.411,Yes.
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,257.411,258.934,Filed here July 28.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,258.934,261.232,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,261.732,263.178,That was the most helpful drawing.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,263.178,272.941,"Yes, there -- actually, there are copies of the same map in several other places in briefs and so forth, but that's the one I've referred to."
1978.78-160,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,360.76,363.779,What Court does Iowa claim?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,363.779,367.339,"It shows on that map that I've referred to, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,368.229,373.502,"You say that it claims as part of the bed of the old river, the old bed?"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,373.502,392.722,"Yes, Iowa claims part of this land as secretion to the east half of the bed of the river which Iowa owned, and the rest of it is claimed by Iowa and the other defendants as secretion to Iowa riparian land."
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,435.074,438.132,Applying what law?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,438.132,442.454,Applying -- the District Court held the law of Nebraska was applicable.
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,442.454,443.389,That's what I thought.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,443.389,443.744,I think --
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,443.744,443.963,Which was somewhat more favorable to --
1978.78-160,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,443.963,446.049,I think it should be the law of Iowa but it was state law.
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.049,452.174,"But the law of Nebraska was somewhat more favorable to the tribe than would've been the law of Iowa, correct?"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,452.174,452.424,Yes.
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,452.424,454.152,So far as its presumption of avulsion.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,454.152,455.844,That's correct.
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,540.193,543.198,Do you mean avulsion of federal law?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,543.198,545.126,"Yes, that's right."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,630.611,646.819,"Do you think then, if it were decided that assuming that federal law applies, we don't have an issue here as to whether the Court of Appeals directly viewed the federal law of avulsion."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,646.819,649.427,"You didn't grant certiorari on that point, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,649.427,650.249,"Okay, thank you."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,650.249,656.135,"We hoped you would, but we were disappointed."
1978.78-160,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,801.052,814.808,"Actually, in the 1822 enactment in Section 4, when you go back in statutes at large, it's used in the plural in the first sentence in the first clause and the singular in the second clause, isn't it?"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,814.808,817.366,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,850.808,862.597,"Mr. Smith, is it your view that if, say, a husband and wife who were joint tenants of a property were Indian would not have the benefit of the statute if they both brought suit on the cases without being entitled --"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,862.597,864.076,"No, that's not right here, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,864.731,865.17,And I don't --
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,865.17,872.275,"Individual Indians -- if there's two individual Indians suing one White person, the statute would -- on its face, would apply."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.275,873.726,What if there are three?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,873.726,875.366,"Or three, but this is --"
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,875.366,877.915,But how do we distinguish between singular and plural then?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,880.043,880.186,"Well, if it's --"
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.186,882.438,"Because either you con -- once you concede that, you're conceding --"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,882.438,887.208,"If each one is suing for itself, but if it's an organized group --"
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.208,888.006,"Well, that's a different point."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,888.006,888.897,"That's a different point, yes."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,888.897,894.066,And then I think you really are abandoning the point that the singular is of any significance.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,895.205,905.893,"Well, I don't think that the plural would be -- could be construed to include a tribe, but --"
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,905.893,912.404,But shouldn't we read this at least as covering plural Indians and not place so much emphasis on the “an Indian”?
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,912.404,914.188,Each individual Indian would be --
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,914.188,915.076,Each individual Indian would --
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,915.076,916.845,"Certainly, his own property right."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,916.845,916.915,That's right.
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,916.915,923.359,"That's a different case away, but I just wonder if the singular is significant rather than the fact it refers to “Indians” rather than “Indian Tribes.”"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,923.359,936.31,"Well, as I say, I don't think-- even in the 1822 Act, I don't think that could be properly construed to include a tribe or the plural is used, but I say if, by any stretch of the imagination, it could be."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.074,953.987,"What if instead of the tribe suing one tribe-- tribal member, it sued on behalf of the class of Indians who belonged to the tribe? How would you handle that?"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,953.987,968.398,"Well, if it's a matter of the individual rights by, I would say, one could see for the class, but here, as I pointed out, this is not because he brought four individual Indians by the tribe."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1157.518,1168.516,"Well, isn't that a fundamental reason why the statutory presumption is inapplicable to this case, even if it otherwise would be?"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1181.638,1182.081,It does.
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.18,1191.393,"Isn't that correct, regardless of your argument, as to the meaning of the statutory presumption?"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1191.393,1193.194,"Yes, that's right, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.029,1246.553,"Well, if he shows previous possession or ownership then, under the circumstances of this case, the change must have been an avuslive change and the Indians win regardless of any presumption."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1251.366,1252.038,If he shows an avulsion--
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.038,1254.036,Under this federal law in any event.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1254.036,1255.627,"If it is an avulsion, yes."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1255.627,1258.038,"Yes, that's the end of it."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1258.038,1259.276,Yes.
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.098,1268.538,But doesn't that turn on whether one takes this “under the sky” approach to the land or decide first whether there's accretion and an avulsion?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1272.607,1273.133,Not just--
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.133,1278.151,"They did think a prima facie case of that, didn't they?"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1278.151,1280.112,"With reference to the “under the sky,” the--"
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.112,1291.481,"If you measure the latitude and longitude “under the sky” or however you phrase it here, they did demonstrate everyone's satisfaction that this area was, at one time, within the reservation."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1291.481,1292.892,But the area under the sky--
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.892,1293.464,Yes.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1293.464,1294.905,But not the present land.
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.905,1298.508,"I understand, but isn't that an issue you have to decide in reading the statute?"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1305.875,1309.22,"Well, it doesn't say “area under the sky.”"
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.058,1310.784,It doesn't say anything.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1310.784,1313.059,“Previous ownership or possession--“
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.059,1313.676,Of what?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1313.676,1316.683,Of the land in controversy.
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1316.683,1321.074,"And if you're cor-- if it was accreted land, then the land didn't exist until the accretion."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1321.074,1322.18,That's right.
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.18,1324.152,Does the word “land” appear in Section 22?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1326.756,1330.151,"Well, it says in-- it says “property”--"
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1330.151,1330.352,Right.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1330.352,1336.095,"In all trials with respect to property, and the implication of --"
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.095,1336.635,And it is conceded by everybody that --
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1336.635,1338.131,“Previous possession or ownership” is --
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.131,1342.933,"This particular area on the surface of the Earth, at one time, did belong to the Indi."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1342.933,1349.404,"This particular area, yes, but not the property that's in that particular area now."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.404,1353.721,Depending on how one construes the word “property” within the meaning of Section 22.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1356.387,1362.017,"Well, if it's this property, why, then that's one thing."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.85,1558.708,"Of course, under your construction of the statute-- presumption of the statute, its constitutionality would be very dubious, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1572.259,1575.108,"Well, then I think that's--"
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.108,1587.204,"Disfavoring White people at the expense of everybody else, Negros and everybody else, would raise serious constitutional questions under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1587.204,1588.683,"Well, it certainly does, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1590.176,1595.039,As a discrimination -- a differentiation between Indians and non-Indians would not.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1595.039,1602.148,"Well, I think the discrimination between Indians and non-Indians of this sort would still be an invidious discrimination."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1602.148,1602.594,"Well, but you say--"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1602.594,1604.121,I am unaware of the Mancarry case--

1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1649.047,1649.37,Well--
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1649.37,1649.992,I'm aware that Mancarry--
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1649.992,1663.229,"The more it felt its discrimination differentiation to the benefit of Indians between Indians and non-Indians does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, at least in a certain context."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1663.229,1663.466,I'm not--
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1663.466,1664.351,That's our case.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1664.351,1669.051,"I'm not clear on that, Your Honor, in this Mancarry case."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1669.051,1669.977,The Court is.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1670.559,1673.15,The Court held there could be a discrimination in --

1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.796,1735.378,That's your construction of it.
1978.78-160,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1740.367,1741.744,Let me put the question this way.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1753.048,1785.192,"Well, according to the-- that argument, if they were from Nigeria or China and they were discriminated against as between them and White persons, the -- that would make the section unconstitutional, but what I'm saying is it's equally unconstitutional where it's simply discrimination of this sort between an Indian and a White person."
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1785.192,1792.219,"Mr. Smith, following up on Justice Blackmun's point, as I understand it, the record does not tell us the race of your individual clients."
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1792.219,1792.702,That's fair.
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.399,1798.618,It's conceivable that two or three of them are from China and the rest are White persons.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1817.68,1831.232,"Well, that's -- if this was the only point in the construction of the section, yes, it will be possible to go back and prove that some are White and some are other and --"
1978.78-160,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1831.232,1832.124,"And so, some of your clients--"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1832.124,1834.951,"So, there might be a difference which--"
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1834.951,1840.137,You're going to make a constitutional argument in your brief?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1840.137,1843.88,"We made a constitutional argument in our petition for certiorari, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1843.88,1845.597,"But in your brief on the merits, do you?"
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1845.597,1851.894,"In our brief, we tried to confined our arguments to the --"

1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1852.776,1854.646,"The construction of the statute, yes, because--"
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1854.646,1855.434,Belongs to what?
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1855.434,1858.523,That was all that this Court granted certiorari on.
1978.78-160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1862.955,1863.709,We don't really have it.
1978.78-160,0,23163,edson_smith,,1863.709,1881.951,"But you didn't-- actually, on the constitutionality, you have up-- held up the petition for certiorari of one of the other defendants which raises the constitutionality question, along with ours."
1978.78-160,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1890.951,1893.0,Mr. Cullison.
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,1893.0,1898.258,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-160,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1982.148,1989.547,To what use was the land put at the time you described as its having been invaded and occupied?
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,1989.547,2001.758,"It was-- a portion of it claimed by the State of Iowa, Your Honor, was used for a wildlife refuge."
1978.78-160,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2109.848,2117.592,You say that they did that as a matter of the federal boundary law of accretion and avulsion?
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2117.592,2134.103,"Your Honor, they used that-- the two Court of Appeals cases involving interstate boundaries to reach this result, and we contend that they, even in this particular case--"
1978.78-160,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.103,2146.962,"I had always read Nebraska against Iowa, the 143 US case, to stand for the proposition that there's a presumption that it-- the change occurred by accretion rather than avulsion."
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2146.962,2148.893,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2148.893,2151.524,I think many texts had read it the same way.
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2151.524,2152.446,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2245.545,2251.653,"What was the basis of federal jurisdiction in the present case, diversity or what?"
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2251.653,2261.22,"It was the United States title in the land in dispute, the Indian title to land in dispute."
1978.78-160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2261.22,2262.898,The United States is the plaintiff.
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2262.898,2266.815,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.041,2488.787,"What if in an earlier century than that, Iowa and Nebraska had become involved in a dispute as to their boundary?"
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2488.787,2489.067,Then--
1978.78-160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.067,2497.23,"In the same area and they sued each other in this Court, and the question was-- it got down to whether there was accretion or avulsion?"
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2497.23,2502.56,Then that would be a question of federal law to be decided by this Court.
1978.78-160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.56,2503.329,At that time?
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2503.329,2504.995,At that time.
1978.78-160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.995,2510.757,"And, now-- and that-- so, that-- but that's irrelevant in this case because, why?"
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2510.757,2533.063,"That's irrelevant in this case because, now, there is an interstate boundary and for the additional reason that the only issue that the location of the boundary could have any relevance to the case would be in choice of law between Iowa and Nebraska in case there was a conflict between the law of Iowa and Nebraska."
1978.78-160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.063,2544.782,But the events that changed the river took place at a time when federal law would've controlled if there hadn't been a dispute between Iowa--
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2544.782,2560.349,"That's very correct, Your Honor, but the only relevance of the location of the boundary in this case would be in the choice of law where there's a conflict between the law of Iowa and the law of Nebraska."
1978.78-160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2683.827,2692.33,"You say, it's really no different than if the same property had simply been public lands, not an Indian reservation."
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2692.33,2694.048,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.048,2704.042,The Un-- the mere ownership of riparian land by the United States doesn't mean that the law of avulsion or accretion should be federal law.
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2704.042,2705.401,Or should be any different in local law--
1978.78-160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2705.401,2706.839,"In that section of the river, yes."
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2706.839,2707.82,"That's right, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2725.461,2732.582,"And you say it should be decided just as though this weren't an interstate river at all, if it were just a river inside some state."
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2738.827,2740.541,"That's right, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2753.941,2760.497,"Mr. Cullison, I realize that this question bears on Mr. Smith's side of the case, as argued here."
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2760.497,2762.338,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.338,2766.496,Yours is between which law applies.
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2784.595,2786.028,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2788.622,2800.291,"Well, the-- Section 194 refers to an Indian may be a party on one side and a White person on the other."
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2815.037,2817.646,"That is our position, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2817.646,2820.431,"Do you think it's, well--"
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2820.431,2821.04,I believe that--
1978.78-160,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2821.04,2829.568,"Part of your position, but, I take it, in-- because you're on this side of the case you might be sympathetic to Mr. Smith's position so far as individuals are concerned and maybe you're not taking it--"
1978.78-160,1,25054,george_bennett_cullison_jr,,2829.568,2855.164,"I believe the constitutional problem that was raised with respect to different types of people do not apply to the state, that you still can-- that, still, it does not apply to the State of Iowa regardless of whether-- of the constitutional problems of distinguishing or making distinctions between Blacks and Whites and Caucasian and Orientals."
1978.78-160,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2875.189,2881.122,"Mr. Veeder, we'll not ask you to split your argument for three minutes if you'll be prepared to go on at 1:00."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,2881.122,2882.604,"You're very kind, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2902.211,2905.847,"Mr. Veeder, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,2905.847,2910.064,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2997.767,2998.763,Mr. Veeder.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,2998.763,2999.126,Yes?
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2999.126,3003.227,"The-- this litigation began, as I understand it, by a Bill to quiet title--"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3003.227,3003.641,That's right.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3003.641,3006.177,Filed by the tribe and by the United States.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3006.177,3013.139,"The United States of America filed, and, incidentally, I have a large map here that might be of help to the Court, I don't know whether what locations are important."
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3013.139,3015.898,"Now, but that's just-- if you just please listen to my question--"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3015.898,3015.977,Yes.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3015.977,3016.446,"And answer it, thank you."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3016.446,3018.591,I will.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3018.591,3024.446,It began by a Bill to fi-- to quiet title filed by your client and the United States as plaintiffs--
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3024.446,3026.452,The United States filed the first complaint.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3026.452,3027.132,"Yes, and the--"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3027.132,3029.402,And it related to this land that is in pink.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3029.402,3044.23,"Right, and in order to-- I suppose the allegations in that complaint were that, or at least depended upon, the proposition that this was an avulsive change, didn't it?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3044.23,3046.055,"Not really, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3056.833,3066.829,"And, as some sort of a statutory or other presumptions or inferences that would change the general rules, the general rule would be that the plaintiff has the burden of proof, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3066.829,3093.017,"That's correct and we certainly proved the-- we offered our prima facie case and we proved that these lands were originally part of the Omaha Indian Reservation, we offered the treaty, we offered the 1867 Barrett Survey showing concisely and precisely where those 2,900 acres were situated and that, in 1867, the river flowed around that land."
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3097.753,3100.522,That is at-- the so-called “under the sky meets and bounds”?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3100.522,3102.757,That's “under the sky.”
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3117.913,3119.868,As a matter of the “meets and bounds”?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3119.868,3120.202,Yes.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3120.202,3120.38,“Under the sky”?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3120.38,3130.985,"Yes, those were-- that was surveyed by Barry-- by Barrett and it was entirely a federal United States Congressional survey--"
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3130.985,3146.544,"Because, under the ordinary rules of this, this land would've had to shift it to the east bank of the river by reason of avulsion for it to be the same land in the Iowa property law, would it not?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3146.544,3146.825,Your Honor--
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3146.825,3161.207,"If the actual loss of the land on the west bank and a gradual accretion on the east bank and a gradual erosion on the west bank than under ordinary property laws, it wouldn't-- it would've belonged to the owners on the east bank, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3161.207,3162.312,"Well, Your Honor, we--"
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3162.312,3164.534,"The owners on the east, isn't that generally proper--"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3164.534,3168.515,"No, Your Honor, I think that's-- if I may respectfully suggest--"
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3168.515,3169.622,"Well, please do."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3169.622,3174.058,That is a very simplified situation that you have described.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3176.027,3176.32,Yes.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3176.32,3177.674,It's in Oxbow.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3195.202,3196.666,That's not directly in issue in this case.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3196.666,3197.424,"No, it isn't."
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3200.125,3200.312,Right.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3200.312,3213.917,"But what I'm saying that it is very simplistic to say that, normally, the rule is that the accretions, that is the presumption of accretions, as--"
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3213.917,3215.449,"No, I'm not talking about a presumption."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3234.422,3237.103,"That's not the situation here, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3237.103,3241.345,"Well, by saying over simplistic, do you mean to tell me it's wrong?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3241.345,3242.023,It is--
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3242.023,3243.915,And don't hesitate if that's what you mean.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3243.915,3247.158,"I really think, on this river, it is wrong."
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3250.786,3253.249,Do you mean on this river or on this situation?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3253.249,3256.027,On the Missouri River and this situation.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3305.992,3313.656,"Well, normally, when one files a complaint in a civil case, the general rule is that it's his burden to prove his case, isn't it?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3313.656,3322.141,Up to the point where there is an affirmative defense interposed and this is the point that is controlling here.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3377.564,3378.876,By prescriptive writings?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3378.876,3384.079,"Yes, but it doesn't apply to the United States nor to the tribes."
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3424.191,3424.681,Well--
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3424.681,3425.085,That's the--
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3425.085,3428.331,Where is that in the-- where is that in their answer?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3428.331,3437.826,"It's-- I've got it, well, marked here, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3441.72,3443.827,Okay.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3443.827,3456.156,"Footnote 50, we go right straight down the line and we trace their entire title showing that they have no title whatever and showing the source of their title."
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3456.156,3458.09,"Now, give us the page, would you?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3458.09,3459.528,"I'll get it right now, Your Honor?"
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3459.528,3461.248,Is it 27?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3461.248,3466.186,We started on page 25.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3471.051,3472.07,Of what?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3472.07,3473.184,Of my brief.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3473.184,3473.292,This blue brief.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3473.292,3477.338,The brief of the trial.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3477.338,3485.299,"Well, my question was-- you said that they answered “yes, we admit that the tribe once occupied this land.”"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3485.299,3486.747,That's right.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3486.747,3488.391,And I was just wondering where that was in the briefs.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3488.391,3503.197,"And their affirmative advances, Your Honor, if you would look on page, of my brief, 30, 31, 32, 33, we see allegations in their answers."
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3534.637,3537.771,"So they don't really say “yes, we admit the lands in controversy were once occupied by the tribe.”"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3537.771,3540.528,"Well, Your Honor, yes."
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3543.367,3545.977,"They said those lands are gone, eroded away."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3545.977,3551.797,They also said that it was originally situated in the State of Nebraska and it was under the treaty.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3554.141,3554.644,"Well, where?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3561.745,3578.181,"I'll get it, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3584.388,3588.933,Of your brief?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3588.933,3589.586,In the appendix.
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3589.586,3590.64,Okay.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3590.64,3601.778,"And you will find there the plaintiffs had admitted that, in 1867, the Barrett Survey was made to describe the land."
1978.78-160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3619.793,3630.543,"So, that's a little different from saying that the lands in controversy were once occupied and they say that they-- the lands once-- that the lands-- that the Indians once occupied no longer exists."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3634.1,3646.644,"That's right and, Your Honor, to go back to the original question, those lands, the only defense they had was that there o-- that they eroded away and that they were replaced."
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3658.097,3668.868,"You said a few minutes ago essentially what this sentence embraces, namely that the land was washed away."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3674.998,3677.47,I was quoting from their defenses.
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3680.028,3682.366,You do not concede that it was--
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3682.366,3682.996,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3729.56,3732.866,The District Court declined to credit your evidence.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3732.866,3746.971,"Well, for whatever he said, the District Court simply copied the petitioner's pet-- findings, verbatim, with all the mistakes in them and the Court of Appeals reversed."
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3776.942,3783.114,Do you think the Court of Appeals' treatment of that issue is consistent with this Court's decision in Nebraska against Iowa?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3783.114,3784.482,I can't-- which one now?
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3784.482,3785.872,The--
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3785.872,3787.721,"The first one, 143?"
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3787.721,3788.715,"143, yes."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3788.715,3790.241,"I certainly do, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3831.472,3836.737,Are you suggesting that it would make no difference in this case whether federal law or state law applies?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3836.737,3845.48,"Your Honor, that's an extremely difficult case because, from our standpoint, we believe the primacy of federal law was applicable but, I'll say this."
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3849.53,3856.844,"Well, what should we do though if-- what should we do if we decide the Court of Appeals was wrong on the applicable law and that the law was state law?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3856.844,3857.941,"I hope it never occurs, but I think--"
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3857.941,3860.601,"I know, but what if we deci-- what if we disagree with you?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3860.601,3866.648,"I think the only thing you could do then is send it back to the Eighth Circuit and say “hey, did they win on the basis of state law?”"
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3866.648,3867.806,And you say you did.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3867.806,3868.955,"Well, we certainly did."
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3868.955,3869.528,Yes.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3869.528,3870.772,There's no question.
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3965.006,3980.004,"Yes, but what if the Court of Appeals was correct in saying “we're now reviewing our-- we're now exercising our reviewing function and we find this evidence, as to whether there was accretion or avulsion, to be evenly balanced”?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3980.877,3982.061,Assume they had said that?
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3982.061,3984.867,"Yes, and didn't-- isn't that what they said?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3984.867,3986.264,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3986.264,3987.592,"Well, assume they had."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3988.157,3989.06,Assuming after that--
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3989.06,3990.583,Who loses then?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,3990.583,3995.376,"Well, I think we would win because we've been in our prima facie case and they had overcome it."
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4000.432,4000.882,I know.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4010.211,4012.802,"But, Your Honor, you see--"
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4012.802,4013.839,Who wins then?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4013.839,4015.663,We do because they had--
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4015.663,4016.261,Why?
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4016.261,4023.307,"They had the burden of proving-- Your Honor, they couldn't win on the strength of their case for one very simple reason."
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4038.228,4038.769,100 years ago.
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4038.769,4040.359,No.
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4040.359,4042.432,"Yes, you were in possession when you started the lawsuit."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4042.432,4043.499,"Indeed, we were, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4047.401,4050.513,You had the fires burning.[Laughter]
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4050.513,4051.597,What?
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4053.353,4054.332,"Well, tell me--"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4054.332,4055.119,And--
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4055.119,4056.973,"Well, finish your response and then I--"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4056.973,4072.244,"What I was saying in this is that we were plaintiffs in possession claiming title, predicated upon a treaty, and we made our prima facie case and the only way they could win is if they had the affirmative to prove that that land was washed away and replaced by accretions."
1978.78-160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4072.244,4074.604,This is wholly independent of 194.
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4074.604,4076.438,Wholly independent of 194.
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4091.33,4101.386,"Is it under state law or federal law that you responded to Mr. Justice White, if I understood you, that when the evidence is evenly balanced, the plaintiff prevails?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4101.386,4103.194,"If we're in possession, yes."
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4106.169,4113.899,"Isn't the general rule-- isn't the general proposition that if the evidence is evenly balanced, the plaintiff hasn't carried the necessary preponderance--"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4113.899,4115.243,"Well, we've--"
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4115.243,4117.562,"And, therefore, the plaintiff fails."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4117.562,4123.872,"Well, Your Honor, under this circumstance, and we have to look at the circumstance, we were there claiming under a treaty."
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4125.488,4127.774,"Now, you're analyzing the proof."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4130.077,4130.216,You have to remedy the stre--
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4130.216,4131.255,And mine is--
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4131.255,4132.77,You have to remedy the strength of your title.
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4132.77,4141.326,"That if the evidence is evenly balanced, I had always thought for a number of years that the defendant prevails."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4141.326,4146.242,"I would assume that if they were in possession that might be the situation, but they wouldn't here, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4146.242,4147.144,Very well.
1978.78-160,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4147.144,4154.859,"Mr. Veeder, do you understand that anything that you've argued is something we're supposed to decide, and the two questions we've granted certiorari?"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4154.859,4156.447,"May I hear that again, Justice?"
1978.78-160,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4156.447,4163.198,"Well, we granted certiorari, as I understand it, to decide whether Section 194 applies and whether state or federal law applies."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4166.68,4171.734,"Well, Your Honor, the-- my argument is very explicit on that point."
1978.78-160,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4210.327,4213.991,"As I understand your argument, what you're saying is you don't really care how we answer the two questions--"
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4213.991,4215.832,"I do care very much, Your Honor."
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4225.74,4226.808,"Yes, it is."
1978.78-160,2,46447,william_h_veeder,,4226.808,4244.107,Thank you.
1978.78-160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4244.107,4246.362,Mrs. Beale.
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,4246.362,4248.203,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-160,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4344.073,4371.789,"Well, Mrs. Beale, what about the admission in-- at page 75 of the appendix which, I gather, is the answer of the respondents, admit that the lands described in paragraph 2 of plaintiff's complaint were, in 1867, a part of the Omaha Indian Reservation, to which, United States held title for the use and benefit of the Omaha Tribe of Indians. Is that enough to trigger the presumption?"
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,4371.789,4375.086,"Well, I think even if they had not admitted that much--"
1978.78-160,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4375.086,4376.552,Is that enough to trigger the presumption I think--
1978.78-160,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4376.552,4377.384,You say it is.
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,4377.384,4379.124,"I think it is, surely."
1978.78-160,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4568.39,4568.467,"Mrs. Beale, are you--"
1978.78-160,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4568.467,4580.054,Can you suggest any statutes in which the term “Indian” has been construed by a Court to mean many Indians or an Indian tribe?
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,4580.054,4582.888,"Actually, I'm not certain that-- of that question."
1978.78-160,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4583.399,4592.971,"No, in that period, Congress was legislating quite regularly on Indian's rights, Indian tribes, Indian lands."
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,4604.744,4607.768,I'm really not certain if there is another contemporary statute that has been construed that way.
1978.78-160,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4607.768,4610.661,That is-- that's what it means.
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,4610.661,4615.597,"That's right, and I'm just not certain if there was another contemporary act that had that meaning."
1978.78-160,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4615.597,4621.982,"Mrs. Beale, are you addressing yourself now both to the meaning of the words “an Indian” and a “White person,” or just “an Indian”?"
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,4621.982,4627.396,"Well, I was starting with “an Indian,” but I also do want to get to “a White person.”"
1978.78-160,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4792.292,4797.917,"Mrs. Beale, isn't there-- if you look at the reason for the provision, I suppose it's to-- sort of a protective provision--"
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,4797.917,4797.947,Absolutely.
1978.78-160,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4797.947,4808.365,"Because the Indian might be at a disadvantage in litigation with a White person, but is-- does the same disadvantage apply when the United States are doing the litigating for the Indian?"
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,4808.365,4817.111,"Well, I think it was not only that there might be a disadvantage but that there was a very important press to protecting the tribal land so that they wouldn't be lost in a questionable case."
1978.78-160,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4856.574,4872.24,"Mrs. Beale, following up on Justice Stevens' question, is there any precise date that can be assigned to the time when the United States began to sue on behalf of Indian awards for title to land?"
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,4872.24,4873.553,That's a new suggested question.
1978.78-160,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5010.585,5016.187,I understand that the State of Iowa says that it's not Caucasian.
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5016.187,5026.49,"I think the State of Iowa says that it is not a “White person” and it says, number one, that it's not a person at all and, number two, if it is a person, it's not White."
1978.78-160,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5026.49,5028.647,"You agree, don't you?"
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5028.647,5031.497,"No, and we-- the reason being, we think if White--"
1978.78-160,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5031.497,5034.072,"I contemplate there's at least one Negro out there, I know."
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5034.072,5034.423,Absolutely.
1978.78-160,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5034.423,5036.915,I know that.[Laughter]
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5036.915,5039.25,"Absolutely, but we would say that--"
1978.78-160,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5039.25,5040.35,And an Indian.
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5040.35,5042.041,"Yes, that's right."
1978.78-160,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5079.498,5088.27,What if this was the State of Oklahoma where one might quite reasonably make an argument that Oklahoma is not a non-Indian state?
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5088.27,5098.501,"Well, it would be my understanding that it's not, although it has a sizable number of Indian citizens, that it's by no means predominantly or the majority of the citizens are non-Indians."
1978.78-160,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5098.501,5111.484,"But if the state could prove by some sort of census figures and bloodline figures that the majority of its citizens were Indians, then it would not be the subject of the statute."
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5111.484,5114.032,"Well, I can't give a definite answer to it."
1978.78-160,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5176.368,5183.675,"Mrs. Beale, do you think that Section 16 of the statute as construed in the Perryman case is constitutional?"
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5183.675,5203.494,"I would have serious doubts about that, and I also think that in-- as our brief stated, in retrospect, we think the historical analysis which we promoted at the time is incorrect and we would think if the statute came before the Court again that we would urge that that was not what Congress intended in that section."
1978.78-160,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5209.04,5217.372,"But having been construed that way some years ago, aren't we bound to respect that instruction just as much as if Congress had written it in itself?"
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5217.372,5225.413,"Well, it's certainly a precedent for this Court and, I guess, the position that we took in the brief is the same one that I would urge here."
1978.78-160,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5262.764,5272.372,"I guess they have some difficulty under a standing, the rationale, but it's alright to protect the Indians from robbery by Whites but not by a fugitive slave that I think that's--"
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5272.372,5273.98,"Well, I--"
1978.78-160,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5273.98,5279.958,"It sounds to me like, although they gave the reason, they really just read the statute literally."
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5283.544,5285.029,"Well, that must-- I think that--"
1978.78-160,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5285.029,5289.072,"Then they gave a reason that's most unpersuasive for doing that, other than the fact that it says it."
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5289.072,5315.445,"I went back and looked at our briefs to see what he had done, and we had urged that this is-- that the history here showed very clearly that the problem with the interracial wars, and so forth, between the tribes and the citi-- local citizens in Georgia were so serious that Congress reacted to that in drawing Section 16 and in changing the language of Section 16 from a broader term which didn't use the word “White.”"
1978.78-160,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5365.686,5367.408,"Mrs. Beale, your time is running."
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5370.153,5372.667,I would certainly like to do that right now.
1978.78-160,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5372.667,5375.381,You have about four minutes to get it done.
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5375.381,5400.301,"We believe that the united decision is the most recent expression by this Court of what we think is the dispositive principle here, and that is that Indian title is a right not only conferred exclusively by a federal law, but continuously protected and controlled by federal law and, this is very important, subject only to termination in accordance with and by means of federal law."
1978.78-160,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5453.582,5466.575,Do you think the question would be different if the reservation was a newly created reservation and was covered land that was-- to which the tribe never had--
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5466.575,5466.848,Aboriginal title?
1978.78-160,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5466.848,5468.286,Aboriginal title?
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5468.286,5470.302,"I don't think it would be, but if the Court thought that--"
1978.78-160,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5470.302,5476.714,"And you would agree-- would you agree the other way too, that the two cases should be decided the same way?"
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5476.714,5480.333,I would think that they should be but we have both points here.
1978.78-160,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5596.841,5618.09,"So, suppose there's a navigable river inside a state, it's not a boundary river, and there's an Indian reservation on one side of the stream and just west of it is a federal military installation and then there's a national forest on the same side of the stream, all in a row."
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5634.927,5638.915,"Well, yes, we do and we think that the federal law applies in the case of the--"
1978.78-160,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5638.915,5639.091,You can't--
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5639.091,5640.302,Indian reservation for--
1978.78-160,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5640.302,5644.345,"You can't really suggest that that's consistent with Corvallis, can you?"
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5644.345,5646.032,"Well, I would say two things."
1978.78-160,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5701.233,5704.726,"I have one question, Mrs. Beale, if I might."
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5749.221,5749.869,No.
1978.78-160,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5757.459,5757.617,Yes.
1978.78-160,3,40958,sara_s_beale,,5757.617,5776.34,"If federal law applies and, in our contention, that would be no, that Indians can lose as well as win under federal law but that it's important to be applying federal law not only because Congress has manifested this intent and so forth, but in order that if under federal law, the Indians would win as they do here."
1978.78-160,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5788.371,5789.299,"Thank you, Counsel."
