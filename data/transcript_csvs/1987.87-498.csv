1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.5,"Ms. Viakley, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,11.5,14.722,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,245.323,248.725,May I interrupt just to be sure I have got it clearly in mind?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,260.843,267.008,"No, I would not, because we have alleged that the strain in fact paralyzed people in the test studies."
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,307.293,308.424,"Yes, but tested by... tested by whom?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,308.424,309.964,--By the manufacturer.
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,309.964,310.545,Right.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,310.545,314.428,And the data then submitted to the agency and reviewed by the agency.
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,319.691,320.873,But comply with what?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,320.873,324.824,--Comply with the neurovirulence criteria of 73.114.
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,324.824,327.667,But isn't that the criteria that they be free of harmful effect?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,327.667,336.184,No. 73.114 sets out the characteristics of the vaccine to actually produce disease rather than immunity.
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,350.783,352.213,"Yes, but this is done by the manufacturer, isn't it?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,352.213,354.353,--The tests are done by the manufacturer.
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,354.353,354.834,Right.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,354.834,360.868,The manufacturer generates the data which is put on the license applications form and submitted to the agency.
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,367.914,378.751,Now are you contending that there are regulations specifying numbers... that the information submitted by the manufacturer had numbers that clearly didn't comply with the required numbers?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,378.751,379.792,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,379.792,385.275,It's a little hard for me to follow parts of your... of the way you presented it in the brief.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,385.275,388.618,The regulations are a little convoluted.
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,388.618,398.204,"See, the regulations... when I look at the actual regulations, they seem to use words like ""free of harmful effect"" and so forth, which suggests to me a discretionary judgment."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,398.204,405.517,"Your Honor, free of harmful effect appears in the first part of 73.110 which talks about the original virus strain."
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,405.517,406.138,Right.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,406.138,407.909,According to--
1987.87-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.909,409.131,Isn't that what we're talking about?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,409.131,414.284,"--According to the government, we're talking about the vaccine monopools themselves."
1987.87-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,414.284,420.808,"Well, you're the Petitioner, and I thought you were complaining about the original Sabin strain."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,420.808,421.8,"We are, Your Honor."
1987.87-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,423.831,430.525,And on that is it necessary that the agency determine that it's without harmful effect?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,430.525,443.202,--What is necessary is for the agency to review the five original monopools that were produced from that parent strain and assess them for compliance with the neurovirulence criteria.
1987.87-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,443.202,444.624,"Well, that's later on."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,444.624,449.987,"No, that's set out in 73,110, the section that applies even in the original virus strain."
1987.87-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,462.036,470.76,"Well, can't the agency say that something is without harmful effect even though it causes let's say one case of polio in a hundred thousand?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,470.76,481.967,"The critical allegation here, Your Honor, is that the qualifying monopools exceeded quantitative standards in the regulations, in 73.114."
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.492,499.259,"Ms. Viakley, where in your petition for certiorari do we find... I know that Section 262 is set forth on Page 41(a) of your petition."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,507.674,510.957,"In the brief, Your Honor, they are reprinted in the appendix."
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,510.957,513.049,In the appendix to the brief?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,513.049,513.517,Yes.
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,515.63,516.401,Thank you.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,527.618,528.547,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.547,531.66,As Judge Higginbotham said.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,531.66,535.013,"That's correct, and that arises both from the statute and the regulations."
1987.87-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.579,557.728,"You said there isn't any room anywhere for somebody who knows that the batch or lot doesn't comply with those specific standards, there is no room to nevertheless go ahead with it."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,557.728,558.287,None.
1987.87-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.601,565.783,"Well, what's your theory about how it did happen then?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,569.915,591.229,"There may have been pure sheer negligence, or in the Griffin case what happened, and the proof that was recounted in the district court's opinion, was that agency employees decided that the neurovirulence criteria weren't really as strict as the regulations made them seem, and an agency employee decided to ascribe the difference to something called biological variation."
1987.87-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,591.229,595.182,"--Well, doesn't the agency say there is some kind of discretion here?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,595.182,597.553,"No, not in these regulations."
1987.87-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.487,605.057,What's their theory for affirmance?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,605.057,615.345,Their theory for affirmance is basically asking this Court to provide what Congress did not... a broad per se exception for regulatory conduct.
1987.87-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.131,626.382,They don't claim that there was any room for discretion either.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,626.382,634.41,"They have identified no argument that this conduct is discretionary, no exercise of policy judgment."
1987.87-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,634.41,643.953,"So whether this was a deliberate ignoring of the... whether this was a deliberate act, or a negligent act, they say it makes no difference."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,643.953,649.058,"Makes no difference, because there is no authority to exercise policy judgment in making this decision."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,649.058,653.74,Now the first thing that happens is that the strain is licensed; is that correct?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,655.992,666.96,"I think we should use the word ""product"" because whether it's the strain or the vaccine itself is a question that's not clear from the regulations."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,676.995,684.481,And there must be a determination under 73.114 that the characteristics had been met?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,684.481,692.486,That the characteristics of all five consecutive monopools comply with the criteria set out in 73.114.
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,692.486,697.138,I thought the monopools didn't come until after the strain had been first manufactured.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,697.138,705.593,"No, in 73.110, the second that refers to the strain, you see that the process goes all the way down to the monopool level."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,705.593,715.66,"No, I'm talking about just licensing, manufacture of the strain, does 73.114 apply before that license can be granted?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,715.66,718.712,"Yes, it does, and that's clear in 73.110."
1987.87-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,730.7,734.754,Was there a separate license granted for the seed virus?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,734.754,746.642,"Well, Your Honor, our understanding, based on documents reviewed from some of the state court litigation, was that there was government approval of the seed virus which we interpreted to mean issuance of a license."
1987.87-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,758.078,762.741,What agency action with respect to the seed virus are you complaining about?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,762.741,776.61,"We are complaining about the initial approval of the seed virus, because we have alleged that the particular seed virus that produced the vaccine that paralyzed this child also demonstrated excessive neurovirulence."
1987.87-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,776.61,788.318,"Now according to the Third Circuit, I believe, your claim relating to the approval of the seed virus, and your claim relating to release of the lot of vaccine were the same issue."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,788.318,791.91,"Well, Your Honor, the Third Circuit didn't distinguish among any of the claims."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,797.463,801.036,"But the regulations make that distinction, don't they?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,801.036,802.886,"--Yes, they do, Your Honor."
1987.87-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,802.886,812.634,Is the seed virus approved in some way other than by approval of the lot of vaccine?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,812.634,816.256,"Your Honor, that is not clear from the record presented."
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.729,858.325,"May I go back for a moment to 73.114(b), your position on that?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,871.763,883.69,We're saying that the numbers on the license application reviewed by the DBS employee demonstrated excessive neurovirulence; that the numbers on the form were higher than the numbers in the NIH reference.
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.476,896.389,So you are not saying the tests were invalid.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,896.389,896.77,No.
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.77,907.536,"But, rather, that valid tests were conducted which produced numbers that violated a standard that is somewhere in this regulation... I've had difficulty finding, frankly."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,910.709,915.18,In 73.114(b).
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.18,918.502,And where in 114(b) is it?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,918.502,920.495,Tests after filtration.
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,920.495,923.925,There are a number of subheads.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,926.857,931.932,"Subhead (b)(i)(iii), determination of neurovirulence."
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,931.932,942.218,And what are the numbers that are shown in that section that were violated?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,942.218,951.424,The numbers of animals showing lesions characteristic of poliovirus; the severity of the lesions; severity of size.
1987.87-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,969.697,978.462,"So that in other words when it talks about comparative evaluation toward the end, that's a evaluation to be made by the manufacturer making the test, isn't it?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,978.462,992.662,"The manufacturer generates this data, puts it on a license form, and the DBS employee has to review the numbers to see that they match or do not exceed the NIH reference numbers, and that's the conduct we're complaining of here."
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.662,1006.93,"Well, how can you tell from (iii), the subhead, what reference numbers we're talking about unless it's the 80 percent, because that subsection doesn't seem to have any numbers in it?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1006.93,1013.214,"That subsection, Your Honor, under subheads again (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)."
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1013.214,1028.425,"Well, I thought you were referring a moment ago on Pages SA-7 through 9, to 73.114(b)(i) and under that (iii)."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1028.425,1029.637,Right.
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1029.637,1032.449,Determination of neurovirulence.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1041.103,1045.284,"Well, that section refers to the NIH reference strain."
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1047.457,1049.178,And where is that in your brief?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1049.178,1051.009,--It's not in the regulations.
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.464,1059.704,And you haven't put them in your brief or in your petition?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1059.704,1067.832,"No, Your Honor, we've just alleged that the demonstrated characteristics of this vaccine exceeded the NIH reference."
1987.87-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.868,1086.592,Is there any issue that we have to decide whether or not this strain or whatever you call it complied with the numbers?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1086.592,1090.235,"No, you have to accept the allegations of the complaint as true."
1987.87-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1090.235,1090.966,"Yes, exactly."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1090.966,1094.779,"And we have alleged that the strain exceeded the numbers, violated the regulations."
1987.87-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.779,1100.593,And you also allege that the people who reviewed the tests knew that they didn't--
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1100.593,1104.473,We've alleged that it was demonstrated on the face of the application.
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1108.998,1120.105,"--I would have found it helpful, in view that we are supposed to be deciding whether this is or is not a possibly discretionary function, to have the thing taken one more step down the line."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1120.105,1122.565,"And what step would that be, Your Honor?"
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1122.565,1131.061,To see what the effect of these numbers that you allege would have been filtered into sub (iii).
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1131.061,1142.558,"The numbers are just... they are in very small... for example, four lesions, a lesions that's two centimeters in diameter, those are the numbers we're talking bout."
1987.87-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.558,1143.84,Is this all alleged in your complaint?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1143.84,1151.956,"It's not in the complaint, because the NIH reference numbers are not of record since we've had no discovery in this case."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1169.897,1174.281,Can the vaccine be produced before this strain is licensed?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1174.281,1178.963,"Well, again we're going back to the question of exactly what is licensed."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1181.755,1188.42,Does a manufacturer have to have any license before he produced the vaccine in his own laboratory?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1188.42,1189.111,--No.
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1191.321,1192.243,Has to have a?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1192.243,1194.814,"An establishment license, but that's something different."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1194.814,1195.483,But that's not an issue here.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1195.483,1197.136,"No, this is a product license."
1987.87-498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.558,1238.963,"These NIH reference numbers that we don't have, and I understand you say we don't need them, that at this stage we accept the allegation that they were clear numbers that were clearly different from what happened here, they are made up by NIH... made up... I mean developed."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1238.963,1239.902,That's correct.
1987.87-498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.902,1241.434,"And that does take judgment, right?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1241.434,1245.605,"No, it take scientific evaluation."
1987.87-498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.959,1249.408,"No, no, no."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1251.231,1254.461,The reference numbers are the same as those we're talking about here.
1987.87-498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1254.461,1267.611,"No, no, but I assume the reference numbers are numbers that NIH develops using its judgment as to how high the numbers have to be before the product is dangerous, no?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1267.611,1277.618,"No, the NIH tests a reference strain, and the demonstrated characteristics of that reference strain represent the NIH numbers."
1987.87-498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1289.994,1292.478,Why do they pick that particular reference strain?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1292.478,1294.809,"Your Honor, that's not in the record."
1987.87-498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.52,1298.632,They might have picked another strain.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1298.632,1304.546,"--There may have been an exercise of judgment initially, and there was in promulgating these regulations."
1987.87-498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.546,1307.238,"Well, I assume... I mean these NIH reference numbers come from somewhere."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1314.842,1316.793,"Which strain to pick, correct."
1987.87-498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.793,1345.653,"Okay, now, you think that there would be one judgment in this case if NIH left it to a particular scientist or teams of scientists to both pick the strain and therefore develop the NIH number, and then apply that to the data from the manufacturer, because that would involve discretionary judgment, right?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1363.245,1374.861,"Your Honor, that's the argument essentially made by the government when it says because the agency had discretion initially at the head of the stream of activity to promulgate regulations, that all conduct is protected."
1987.87-498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.861,1377.203,"Well, I'm not taking it all the way up to the top."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1384.228,1386.509,You're taking it back up the stream though.
1987.87-498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.509,1387.528,Yes.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1387.528,1392.754,"And it is true, of course, that every activity undertaken by government is borne is discretion."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1446.386,1455.024,"Counsel, could we take a look at the last page of your brief, SA-10, Regulation 610.2(a)?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1467.31,1467.831,That's correct.
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1467.831,1469.754,Is that mandatory or discretionary?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1469.754,1474.386,"Well, again, Your Honor, in our reply brief we indicate it's not clear on this record."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1513.432,1516.684,"Now, is that (b), which is under (a)?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1516.684,1518.034,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1526.609,1531.413,"So (b) is a different numerical heading, is it not?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1531.413,1532.082,That's correct.
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1532.082,1536.056,"And that applies to the manufacturer, not to the government."
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1536.056,1541.269,Our submission is that applies to anybody who is in the position of releasing the vaccine.
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1541.269,1549.864,"(b) says that no lot shall be released, but it applies only to the manufacturer, does it not?"
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1549.864,1560.053,"Again, our position is that that... the only sensible reading of the regulations is that that standard applies to anybody who is in the position of issuing a release for the vaccine."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1560.053,1562.052,And what is the correct numerical reference for (b)?
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1562.052,1565.415,630.17 in 21 CFR.
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1565.415,1566.256,630.17.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1566.256,1567.088,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1567.088,1568.007,Thank you.
1987.87-498,0,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,1568.007,1574.871,"If the Court has no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time."
1987.87-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.871,1576.371,"Thank you, Ms. Viakley."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1578.444,1587.222,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.678,1664.441,"Yes, but the problem, and I think Justice Scalia put his finger on it and I want to be sure you address it."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1704.398,1705.029,--Yes.
1987.87-498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.119,1710.311,--Even though it's reduced to particular standards?
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1710.311,1715.925,"Yes, even though the particular employee might have acted wrongly or negligently."
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.925,1719.799,Or even if he just knew--
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1719.799,1720.96,Even if he--
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.96,1722.731,--specifically that this did not comply?
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1722.731,1723.632,--Even if he knew.
1987.87-498,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.632,1727.214,Even though there was no discretion in that particular employee?
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1727.214,1742.662,"Even though that employee had a specific mandate as to what his duty was to be, because the wording of the discretionary function exception focuses on functions of the agencies, not just on duties of particular employees."
1987.87-498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1760.204,1761.526,Taking it a step further.
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1776.165,1779.117,That could pose a different problem.
1987.87-498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1786.532,1789.585,"No, they just say, we want you to do it, and we'll them ourselves also."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1791.045,1806.967,"--If it's doubled, then the primary responsibility is on the manufacturer, and the government is exercising its discretion to spot check or to thoroughly reject or even to retest all the results."
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.44,1821.175,"--Do you think Varig would have come out the same way if there had been an inspection, and the employee knew that there was something wrong?"
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1821.175,1822.885,"--Yes, because--"
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.885,1824.227,"Well, that certainly isn't what the case said."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1824.227,1828.468,"--Well, the issue was not raised because there was not an inspection."
1987.87-498,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1828.468,1832.922,"Well, but the government argued the position you are arguing today."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1835.915,1838.096,I think the court--
1987.87-498,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1838.096,1842.19,And didn't the government take the same position you are taking today essentially?
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1842.19,1848.173,"--Yes, the government did, and I think the court came very close to accepting that position in Varig Airlines."
1987.87-498,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1848.173,1855.767,"Well, the language just doesn't quite say what you are arguing for today, does it, of our opinion?"
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1855.767,1866.185,"Our position today is that the regulatory functions of government, whether it be writing the regulations or enforcing compliance with those regulations, are protected from suit."
1987.87-498,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1880.815,1881.864,Where does it break down?
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1890.18,1894.343,"Well, then he is not performing a regulatory activity."
1987.87-498,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1894.343,1895.134,"Well, he is."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1902.547,1923.371,"That's true, but it is clear from the legislative history that Congress intended to draw a distinction between the common law torts of the employee's regulatory agencies and the peculiar regulatory activities of inspecting, licensing and certifying."
1987.87-498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.934,1956.783,"Congress embodied all of that in the phrase ""discretionary function"", and also embodied the distinction that you urged upon us between... you say it would make a difference whether the government here was displacing the manufacturer in the testing or not."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1962.457,1965.359,"I think that's right, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.79,2005.474,"Why would it make any difference whether you were displacing the manufacturer's testing or not, whether you are doing the testing yourself or displacing the manufacturer's testing?"
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2012.079,2014.401,It makes a difference in several respects.
1987.87-498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2032.322,2037.685,"It makes a lot of sense to me, but I asked why does it have anything to do with whether it's a discretionary function or not."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2047.662,2057.119,"It's a discretionary function in the sense that... well, take the specific statute and regulations at issue here."
1987.87-498,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2071.368,2100.617,"Well, Mr. Kellogg, that's not quite fair, because your opponents refers us to Section 73.114, tests for safety and the neurovirulence standards, and says they are very specific and require numerical calculations that can easily be determined mechanically, and that the complaint alleges a failure to meet the standards, the mechanical standards."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2100.617,2105.04,"--The regulations in question apply to the manufacturer, Justice O'Connor."
1987.87-498,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2112.404,2118.809,"And to submit the results of the test to the federal government for its license, right?"
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2118.809,2119.46,"That's correct, but the--"
1987.87-498,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2119.46,2124.172,And the allegation is that the numbers didn't add up.
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2124.172,2132.287,--But the regulations do not require the federal government to do anything in respect to that data.
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.447,2150.639,You mean any time they file a piece of paper the government need not look at it at all.
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2157.455,2159.134,"--Well, there are three separate allegations."
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.134,2160.336,--You are going to free it for distribution.
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2161.358,2166.19,"With respect to the lot release, yes."
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.673,2190.666,"Now suppose this lot is presented to the agency and the agency looks at the piece of paper, and knows exactly... the person looking at it knows exactly what that lot is about, and knows that it doesn't comply."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2190.666,2192.797,--Then if he--
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.797,2195.94,And do you think at that point there is some discretion involved?
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2195.94,2198.331,--For that particular employee--
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.331,2199.753,Yes or no.
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2199.753,2205.219,"--No, not for that particular employee; for the agency function in question there is."
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.219,2212.022,"No, but the agency function is not to issue that release if those numbers don't add up."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2216.786,2222.67,"Well, the agency does not have to perform any test or check any data whatsoever."
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.67,2223.321,I don't care.
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2240.661,2242.392,"The problem is with the word ""order""."
1987.87-498,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.524,2253.038,"Well if you win, I suppose you might as well repeal the Tort Claims Act."
1987.87-498,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2253.038,2256.2,I don't think that follows at all.
1987.87-498,2,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,3463.049,3464.111,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1987.87-498,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3564.116,3575.744,"Except that it does say discretionary function as the government points out, and not discretionary act, and there is some functions that you would consider discretionary functions even though there are elements within them where you really don't have much of a choice."
1987.87-498,2,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,3586.031,3592.666,"--The only way it can get there is to provide a per se exception for regulatory conduct, and Congress expressly did not choose to do that."
1987.87-498,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3612.789,3613.698,Do you think it rejected it?
1987.87-498,2,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,3613.698,3614.74,"I think it did, Your Honor."
1987.87-498,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3614.74,3616.352,On the face of the statute?
1987.87-498,2,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,3616.352,3617.872,I think it did.
1987.87-498,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3649.672,3654.867,"Well, I know, but that still leaves the discretionary function problem."
1987.87-498,2,23327,ellen_m_viakley,,3660.141,3662.942,"No, they did not deal with regulation of vaccines, Your Honor."
1987.87-498,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3667.503,3668.465,"Thank you, Ms. Viakley."
