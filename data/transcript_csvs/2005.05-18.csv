2005.05-18,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,We'll hear argument first in Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,7.42,10.356,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.97,196.605,"Do you think the right includes any costs other than statutory costs, any expenses?"
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,196.605,198.707,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,198.707,211.848,"How do you explain the reference to expenses on page 4 of the red brief which quotes from the... a section of the statute authorizing a report to be made, a report authorized under?"
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,219.835,222.82,"Well, it said attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses."
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,222.82,223.906,Right.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,223.906,224.289,And it's a direction to--
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,224.289,228.491,So the expenses must be something other than attorneys' fees or costs.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,228.491,232.193,"--Well, they could be expenses of the attorney."
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,249.987,250.337,Right.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,250.337,252.856,--for future reference by... by Congress.
2005.05-18,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,252.856,256.474,"Well, what about... may I just take the question one step further?"
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,277.138,280.423,"Your Honor, I believe that's correct."
2005.05-18,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,283.208,283.692,Is it?
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,290.762,296.333,"There are two subdivisions, subdivision (A) and subdivision (B)."
2005.05-18,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,305.821,327.9,"I... I would have thought that your answer would be that the Congress was interested in finding out the cost of this act, and it's very clear that school districts hire consultants to assist them in... in these cases, and it wanted to know the amount they were paying to the consultants."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,341.577,348.498,--I... I believe Your Honor is correct in that it... it's a direction by the GAO to acquire data.
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,370.828,378.415,"But does it make it possible to read... I mean, I agree with you it doesn't say to do that, but I guess you could read it to do that, couldn't you?"
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,381.967,382.633,Under this statute.
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,382.633,387.001,"Maybe you might be right, maybe absolutely, but might you also be wrong?"
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,397.624,409.265,"Your Honor, I think this Court has looked at that issue in... in two separate cases, and one of those cases is Crawford Fitting and the other is--"
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,409.265,411.217,Which involved this statute?
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,411.217,412.134,"--Well, it didn't involve this--"
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,412.134,412.334,All right.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,448.505,450.239,"--Your Honor, it... it could, but I--"
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,450.239,462.213,"Well, once you say it could, then possibly it's reasonable to ask what the Congress Members were actually thinking, and as soon as we look at what they were actually thinking, that's perfectly clear."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,477.39,489.298,"--But we come back to the historical derivation of how this statute came into... into being, and it did come in in response to Smith against Robinson."
2005.05-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.298,508.593,"I thought the GAO study included not just the... the hours worked and the... the costs, however you choose to define it, on the part of the parent challenging the school board action, but it also included those hours and those costs expended by the school."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,508.593,510.711,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
2005.05-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.711,517.948,In which case it could not possibly have been directed to what items are compensable.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,517.948,520.25,We think that's a separate section.
2005.05-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.25,526.154,"On its face, it covers at least half of the items that are not compensable."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,526.154,527.12,"That's true, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,527.12,527.537,"It's true, but--"
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,527.537,536.643,"Isn't it true that the provision I referred to refers to the specific amount of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party?"
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,542.547,544.13,"Your Honor, I... that's correct."
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,544.13,545.499,Yes.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,545.499,554.521,But I think there are expenses that... that the attorney bears in... in the routine of a... of a... of handling the client.
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.437,562.341,"So you're saying the word expenses should refer only to expenses incurred by counsel, which of course would be normally reimbursable."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,562.341,564.876,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,564.876,576.684,"Well, but I'm not... I'm not sure that you don't have a further answer to Justice Stevens because there's (3)(A) and (3)(B)."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,586.206,597.764,"They're talking about... the same sample refers to a... a designated number of States, a representative number of States."
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,601.216,602.632,--That's certainly possible.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,635.333,641.487,"--Your Honor, I don't think it's so much a question of metaphysics or philosophy... maybe perhaps of philosophy."
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,641.487,649.141,My question is why don't we just look and see what they intended since they wrote it down on a piece of paper and all we have to do is read it?
2005.05-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.141,652.259,"Did Congress say that, Mr. Kuntz?"
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,652.259,652.793,"No, Congress didn't say that."
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,652.793,653.259,I thought it did.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,660.663,665.4,"Your Honor, if I might respond to that."
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,665.4,666.717,"Oh, I'd like you to respond to it."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,668.55,679.441,It's... it's a longstanding rule of statutory construction that Congress' intent is best found in the language that Congress actually puts into the statute.
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,689.547,702.105,"There's no doubt that the best evidence is the text of the statute, but at least the people who drafted this, even if they were not the conferees themselves but were just staff members, they apparently thought the language was subject to that reading."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,702.105,702.988,Your Honor--
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,702.988,705.557,"Which would mean it would be ambiguous, wouldn't it?"
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,705.557,709.525,"--The rule that we look first to the... yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,709.742,715.812,"The rule that you refer to that you cannot look at legislative history... of course, we always start with the plain language."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,726.001,749.616,"But that... in... in the retrospective view that the Court looked at in... in the... the Casey decision, it went back and it traced the origin of a number of... of statutes and looked essentially to similar language, and it found that experts' fees were not a part of attorneys' fees, and it found that experts' fees were not a part of... of costs."
2005.05-18,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,749.616,760.305,"But it also found that there were dozens of statutes, I think... didn't Justice Scalia list in his opinion for... it went on for a couple of pages, including footnotes?"
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,770.91,778.247,"Yes, Your Honor, and to us that proves that Congress knows how to distinguish between experts' fees and attorneys' fees when it wants to."
2005.05-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,778.247,780.699,"Was this language, by the way... I'm not clear."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,789.555,791.071,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe it was."
2005.05-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.071,792.571,So we don't really know--
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,792.571,794.856,It emanates... it emanates solely from the House conference report.
2005.05-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,794.856,796.975,"--Well, that's only half of the Congress, isn't it?"
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.225,797.308,I thought it was a joint explanatory statement.
2005.05-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.308,801.093,"--even if everybody in the House agreed with that, which we don't really know."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,808.83,821.221,"His... Your Honor, the... the President hesitancy was about the retroactive effect of the statute, and he noted that in his signing memorandum, but he didn't note any other differences."
2005.05-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.221,827.875,"So we have a committee of one house that said... that said that, that thought it meant that or would have liked it to mean that."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,827.875,828.791,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.599,843.801,"How do you explain the title, Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of the Conference?"
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,846.336,848.788,"It... yes, Your Honor, it does."
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.788,852.406,So it's not correct it's just for one house.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,858.644,860.596,"It... it does say that, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,860.596,860.846,All right.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,867.583,868.216,"No, Your Honor, it doesn't."
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,868.216,868.5,No.
2005.05-18,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,868.683,876.42,"Counsel, sometimes these joint statements are actually voted on by the Congress as a whole."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,878.755,881.074,"There was no evidence of that, Your Honor, in our review."
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,881.074,881.707,--Which ones are voted on?
2005.05-18,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.55,901.085,Can you cite an example of a conference report that was voted on by the Congress?
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,901.085,907.572,"I... I cannot, Your Honor, and that's why I... I responded as I did, which is that I know of no evidence."
2005.05-18,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,907.572,913.476,I think we have said that conference reports are more valuable than the reports of a single house.
2005.05-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,915.059,921.046,"They are voted on when the... when the conferees make changes, which they sometimes do."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,929.736,934.573,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.823,936.823,Justice Breyer knows that.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,937.673,937.673,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
2005.05-18,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,937.673,946.779,"--I didn't have an opportunity to work for a Senator who, in fact, to my experience asked me to report on a vote on such a thing."
2005.05-18,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,947.479,949.981,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,949.981,950.381,Thank you.
2005.05-18,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,951.214,952.516,Certainly.
2005.05-18,0,39704,raymond_g_kuntz,,952.516,952.783,Thank you.
2005.05-18,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,952.783,963.038,Mr. Salmons.
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,968.942,971.594,"I do not, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1021.39,1023.073,What... what do you say about expenses?
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1053.84,1054.273,--No.
2005.05-18,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1068.581,1069.331,It's the GAO reference.
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1070.783,1078.187,"--it says to look at the... the awards in cases, the awards of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses."
2005.05-18,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1161.768,1177.944,"Mr. Salmons, there's one difference, a marked difference, between this statute and the others, and that is, in... in many of these cases, it is the consultant that is the primary, perhaps exclusive, aide to the parent."
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1193.37,1194.22,--That... that is correct.
2005.05-18,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1213.598,1218.05,"What do you... what do you say about the legislative history, which has been so prominent in the discussion this morning?"
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1219.835,1220.318,--Sure.
2005.05-18,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1227.138,1231.256,"Well, don't you suppose it represents the view of the House and Senate conferees?"
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1231.256,1237.41,"Well, I mean, I think... I think what that points to is the perils of... of using committee reports and statements--"
2005.05-18,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1237.41,1237.76,No.
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1239.026,1240.712,--from the legislative history when the text is clear.
2005.05-18,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1240.712,1262.541,"--an argument, a perfectly fair argument, can be made, whether... whether you find it dispositive or not, that everything that goes into a committee report of one house cannot simply be taken as a literal reflection of the thinking... the... the actual thinking of... of everybody on that committee, let alone a whole house."
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1289.376,1291.895,"I don't think so, Your Honor, and let me try to explain why."
2005.05-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.215,1301.251,Language in the statute but not in the conference report.
2005.05-18,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1301.251,1301.667,Yes.
2005.05-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.667,1302.617,Was there a conference report in--
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1302.617,1303.986,--No.
2005.05-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.502,1309.371,"--And would you agree, if the statute is ambiguous, you can look at the conference report?"
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1309.371,1311.923,"--Well, but my point, Your Honor, is that what this Court said--"
2005.05-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.923,1313.442,Would you answer my question?
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1313.442,1313.708,--Yes.
2005.05-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1317.743,1321.961,And why is it not ambiguous if the author of the conference report read it that way?
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1321.961,1330.967,"For, among other reasons, Your Honor... this is what I was trying to... trying to state because this Court in Casey, dealing with this exact same language, said the following."
2005.05-18,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1360.652,1361.069,"Well, one thing here--"
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1361.069,1361.902,--and it be would wrong to look to that.
2005.05-18,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1385.231,1385.815,Does the gravamen--
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1385.815,1386.098,Smith foreclosed those fees--
2005.05-18,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1386.098,1390.885,"--does the gravamen... well, I'll let you finish your answer."
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1390.885,1391.551,--Sure.
2005.05-18,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1391.551,1396.086,Does the gravamen of the argument... is it that this phrase is unambiguous?
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1396.086,1399.355,"That... that is certainly our first argument, absolutely, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.503,1435.709,"But isn't it true that at the time they did that, it was well settled in cases of this kind that the Court would look at the conference report to ascertain the meaning of the statute?"
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1437.727,1438.561,"--Well, I think--"
2005.05-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.561,1442.513,Was there any case that said you can't look at the conference report at that time?
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1442.513,1443.929,"--There are plenty of cases, Your Honor, that... that point out--"
2005.05-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1443.929,1445.362,--later.
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1445.362,1449.564,"--that the... that... that point out, even... even I think beforehand, that the language is the primary basis to look."
2005.05-18,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.564,1451.682,"Is the best evidence, but not the sole evidence."
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1451.682,1452.182,"And that even when it's unambiguous, that's the end of the matter."
2005.05-18,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1452.182,1461.538,"Counsel, even in... in those benighted days, I don't think... I don't think we ever would use the conference report when the statute was not ambiguous."
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1462.954,1476.381,"We certainly agree with that, and I would just add that I'm not aware of any decision of this Court that would suggest that the type of statutory construction tools the Court would use would depend on what was in place at the time that the statute was enacted."
2005.05-18,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1476.381,1476.731,--No.
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1476.881,1480.25,"I mean, this Court applies the rules that it thinks are appropriate at the time it issues its decision."
2005.05-18,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1480.683,1482.533,--You can't use red if the statute says green.
2005.05-18,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1511.118,1512.118,"--Two responses to that, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1575.823,1577.323,"Thank you, Mr. Salmons."
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1583.81,1587.012,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.057,1608.508,"Mr. Vladeck, let me just give you a purely hypothetical situation."
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1627.052,1630.088,"Thank you so much, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1644.848,1659.857,"Well if that's not this case, what in the world prevented the conferees from putting something as important in this context as expert fees, as I understand it, probably more important than attorneys' fees... what prevented them from putting that in the statute if that clearly was their intent?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1659.857,1665.761,"Without being flippant, Your Honor, I think that the conferees thought they had put it in the statute."
2005.05-18,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1680.604,1680.937,As you--
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1680.937,1689.876,I was going to say it certainly had the meaning in Federal... the Federal court context set forth in section 1920 of the Judicial Code.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1689.876,1699.398,"I understand that, Your Honor, but Congress thought it was adding... that use of the word cost and its breadth was a way of... of including the cost."
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.617,1706.219,"Before you get past Casey, Casey didn't invent this as a definition."
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1719.442,1733.868,"--Your Honor, at the time Casey was... at the time this case was... excuse me... at the time this statute was enacted by Congress, for example, costs were routinely read to include expert fees in title VII cases, for example."
2005.05-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1753.715,1772.677,"Mr. Vladeck, why... if that was what Congress had in mind, then how do you explain the multiple statutes that are listed in Casey that say, in the text of the statute, witness fees?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1772.677,1786.869,"My only explanation, Your Honor, is that the... the Members of Congress who wrote this provision were unaware of the difference this Court would later ascribe to those statutes in Casey."
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.869,1787.236,Not later ascribe.
2005.05-18,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1787.636,1805.431,"Casey... Casey is very clear in saying the judicial background against which Congress enacted 1988, talking about 1988, mirror the statutory background, and it says the judicial background was that expert fees were quite different than attorneys' fees."
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1806.347,1813.667,"Even... even conceding all of that, which I... I think is... let me take a step back."
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1841.917,1843.619,Where is that set forth?
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1843.619,1843.986,--I'm sorry?
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1847.054,1847.738,Thank you.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1847.738,1858.696,"That directs the General Accounting Office, first, to study the amount of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party."
2005.05-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1874.089,1877.624,"Well, what... Mr. Vladeck, may I stop you there?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1884.045,1884.361,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1884.361,1889.599,So prevailing party is identical to parents.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1892.134,1893.101,"That's exactly my point, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1895.085,1900.739,But... but the word consultants appears in subsection (B) of the statute.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1900.739,1900.989,"--Right, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1900.989,1904.857,And that specifically refers to the State educational agency and local educational agency.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1904.857,1904.94,Your Honor--
2005.05-18,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1904.94,1914.313,"And it uses personnel, which sounds to me a very odd way to talk about private experts hired by an attorney."
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1915.279,1928.587,"--Well, Your Honor, this provision, up until the last part which says, and expenses incurred by the parents, the... the last clause of this provision was added in conference."
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.366,1975.568,"--Mr. Vladeck, my... my problem with the argument you're now making is... is a little more basic."
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2002.551,2004.087,--Your Honor--
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2004.087,2007.955,--that elsewhere they go out of their way to add and... and expenses?
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2009.907,2013.376,"--Your Honor, I don't believe that this is an inoperative part of the statute."
2005.05-18,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2030.987,2035.106,"Isn't... isn't it really the point not that it makes no sense, but that it raises a question?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2054.603,2055.77,I... it certainly can be read that way.
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2060.005,2064.458,"Well, but if you conclude that the statute is ambiguous, what do you do with the Spending Clause problem?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2073.114,2073.364,--That's correct.
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2073.364,2086.741,"If it's ambiguous, if the availability of expert fees, which is the big ticket item in these things, not the attorneys' fees, States are not unambiguously on notice that they're accepting that liability when they take the funds."
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2086.741,2093.478,"With all respect, let me quarrel with one of the premises in your question, which is that the... the expenses for experts are, quote, a big ticket item."
2005.05-18,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2109.821,2114.974,"Well, that's before the Magna Carta you're asking for in this case which would establish a whole... a whole--"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2114.974,2115.791,Your Honor--
2005.05-18,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2115.791,2117.843,--new profession of experts.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2117.843,2120.045,"--Your Honor, that is not the case."
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2127.632,2129.817,"Well, even if it is not the big ticket item--"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2129.817,2130.001,--So... so these are modest.
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2130.001,2135.988,--it still has to be... it still has to be unambiguously set forth in Spending Clause legislation.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2135.988,2136.188,Right.
2005.05-18,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2166.007,2178.898,"--Under your reading of 1415, may a court award to parents any costs that they incur in connection with the litigation, or... or would you just add expert fees to the attorneys' fees?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2178.898,2190.372,"Your Honor, there is a body of law on that issue that already exists because courts have interpreted this provision since 1986."
2005.05-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2204.548,2205.048,What about testing?
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2205.864,2214.32,"The cost of testing and evaluation, which is... which is a crucial component of the statute... those costs have been awarded."
2005.05-18,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2214.32,2229.496,"But if costs is not a term... is not a legal term of art, if it really... if it means just the expenses that parents incur, why wouldn't it include things like travel expenses or lost wages to attend the court proceeding?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2229.496,2249.343,"The... the way the courts have addressed that issue, Your Honor, is they... they have looked to the... the initial phrase of the statute, in an action or a proceeding, and have found those costs not sufficiently closely enough related to the action or proceeding to justify an award."
2005.05-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.554,2273.625,Would you read the phrase from the conference report as a limitation?
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2293.289,2300.51,"--Yes, Your Honor, but they've also imposed limitations that are generally... that generally constrain the awards of costs in cases."
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2359.248,2366.904,Why were the earlier versions that included that expressly then not... why didn't they make it through to the final version?
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2366.904,2370.872,"--The... the version that... that was referred to earlier, Your Honor, came out of the Senate bill."
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2396.923,2403.243,"Now, we've slid back from the joint statement to the statement of one Member on the floor now."
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2403.243,2408.231,"--Well, I'm happy for you to rely on the joint statement, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2463.116,2474.756,"Well, speaking of that... of that language, that attorneys' fees may be awarded as part of costs, does that suggest... it doesn't say directly that costs may be awarded."
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2483.779,2494.337,"I don't believe that Congress, when it used the word costs, was adverting to section 1920."
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2497.039,2498.422,"Well, then where is the authorization?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2518.885,2523.606,"--Well, Your Honor, it says... it's part of the cost to the parents."
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2536.58,2545.103,"What is the authorization to pay costs, to pay those costs that include expert fees?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2553.541,2554.025,--Your Honor--
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.025,2556.577,But where is the authorization to pay?
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2556.577,2563.397,"--Under... under that reading, no statute would authorize the... the payment of costs."
2005.05-18,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2563.397,2567.968,"Under that reading, wouldn't... wouldn't you have a problem in a State court?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2577.924,2578.29,That is correct.
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.442,2581.992,Do you know any State that doesn't have a cost statute?
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2581.992,2589.548,"--I have not... I've not looked at them to see whether they correspond to 1920, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2589.548,2595.536,"--Mr. Vladeck, you have... you referred to the section on GAO reporting--"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2595.536,2595.802,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2595.802,2603.891,--as an assist to help you include consultant fees in... in costs.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2627.69,2634.494,"Well, Your Honor, all costs are subject to the general requirement in rule 54 of reasonableness, and--"
2005.05-18,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2634.494,2639.397,Then why... then it would be unnecessary to have done that for attorneys' fees.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2639.397,2639.98,"--Here's the reason, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2742.964,2748.618,"And that's effective too, as though it were written into the statute, because one committee of Congress said so."
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2748.968,2750.301,"Well, Your Honor, this is not one committee of Congress."
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.324,2758.774,And... and they read it.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2758.774,2764.811,"Well, Your Honor, this is the final bill they voted on, and if they turned the page--"
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.811,2767.263,That's the only thing we know for sure that they voted on.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2767.263,2772.999,"--That is correct, Your Honor, though the vote technically, of course, is a vote to approve the conference report."
2005.05-18,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2787.343,2790.878,Did the... did the final bill say we adopt the findings of the conference report?
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2790.878,2791.245,"It did not, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2791.245,2791.961,And other bills have said that.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2791.961,2793.663,I--
2005.05-18,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2793.663,2794.813,Like in... as in Nofstiker.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2794.813,2808.84,"--As far as I know, Your Honor, the procedure followed here was the standard procedure when the conference report takes bills and essentially amalgamates them or redrafts them--"
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2808.84,2811.124,But was this legislation vetoed by the President?
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2811.124,2811.724,"--It was not, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2811.724,2817.195,"Now, when the President signed it, did... did he also approve the conference report?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2818.778,2820.397,I do not know that.
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.397,2821.163,"He had the statute in front of him, didn't he?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2821.163,2826.051,"I... he... my assumption, Your Honor, is he had this."
2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2826.051,2827.167,You... you think he read the conference report too.
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2827.167,2827.701,I don't believe that.
2005.05-18,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2835.24,2835.94,Was there any opposition?
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2850.166,2850.666,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
2005.05-18,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2870.663,2871.413,"Counsel, if I could interrupt you."

2005.05-18,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.137,2962.505,"I mean, that... that's what you're suggesting, isn't it?"
2005.05-18,2,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2962.505,2982.586,"--What I am suggesting is that the Court's role, as I understand it, is to the faithful agent of Congress, and if the... if the expectation of Members of Congress is that language in committee reports will... will garner respect from the Court, it is hard to then change the rules on Congress."
