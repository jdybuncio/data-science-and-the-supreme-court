1960.36,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,19.049,"Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown Incorporated, Appellant, versus Paul A. McGinley, District Attorney, County of Lehigh, Pennsylvania, et al."
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,25.465,28.878,"Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.36,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,94.855,96.35,What about the old statute?
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,96.35,98.916,The old statute is still there.
1960.36,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,648.339,663.735,"May I ask you if your argument leads up to the point that it would be impossible even though a state may have a right to set aside when they have read, it's impossible to set aside Sunday because of its religious significance?"
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,663.735,675.042,"In all -- beside I think that is correct, and I think in answer to -- I think it was a question asked by Justice Whittaker and I think Justice Harlan, I would say you have to go even -- it's not necessary in our case."
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,739.367,744.015,Do you think -- do you think Mr. Kohn if you really -- I'm not sure if I follow you.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,749.411,750.35,Absolutely sir.
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,750.35,760.07,And how is that enforceable if it's left to the free willing unless you attribute much more than I do spontaneous obedience of individual law.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,760.07,771.443,"Well, first of all most of us work for other people and just as you can provide and do provide that you cannot work a man for 40 hours a week without paying him overtime --"
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,771.443,776.038,But we've had intricate machinery of record and so on by which --
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,776.038,786.849,"The same -- may I suggest sir that the same records which show how many hours a week a man has work will show whether he has worked 24 consecutive hours or not, it's the very same record."
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,786.849,791.174,"Yes, but the Fair Labor Standard Act applies to people who are employed by others."
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,791.174,791.847,That's right.
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,792.708,802.126,Now think of the -- think of the diversity of activity as the reconciled entity by all of citizens of Pennsylvania.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,815.438,827.819,"Unfortunately sir, and I regret it more than any by enlarge most of us are coming to work for other people whether in business or in government or in the many other activities."
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,855.369,864.273,But you started out with a great bulk of the population assenting to non-work on Sunday whereas under your scheme you start out with no such case?
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,864.273,877.067,It's precisely sir because the great bulk of the population do I say and the reason for which they -- I said that the law which compel them not to work on Sunday is unconstitutional.
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,883.696,886.011,You're truly not to represented example.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,886.011,902.417,"I wouldn't work -- I wouldn't work on Sunday except that much more arduous labor which I've been confronted with in the last several Sundays writing leaves, but I think a person who was compelled to do what he would do voluntarily has a right to complain."
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,924.278,927.888,But that the law isn't directed against your kind.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,934.279,951.672,"Well as a matter of fact there is no law which protects me on Yom Kippur and I manage to do quite well, and I am sure that the Christians in a predominantly Christian community would have no trouble enforcing the dignity and respect to which the Sabbath in their minds their Sabbath is entitled without the compulsion of this law."
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,979.597,1000.747,"Do you think that the interdependent -- do you think there is such uniformity or comprehensiveness in collective activity in our day that anybody as a different group picking different day, they're all the interdependent of industry and the professions or whatever you call calling, that that would just spontaneously enforce it though --"
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1000.747,1001.092,I don't think --
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1001.092,1003.621,Even the (Inaudible) has a lot complaint enforcing it.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1003.621,1005.83,It would spontaneously enforce itself --
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1005.83,1009.978,Or even -- even -- moderately as impossibly enforce itself.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1009.978,1012.51,The difficulty of enforcement is not this whole test.
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1076.192,1089.146,"But suppose you -- suppose you were right, suppose you can -- you're demonstrably right or persuasively right and might be many people in the Pennsylvania legislature who might have the same narrow view about enforceability that I have."
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1089.146,1097.56,"Well that's why you are here, if may I say so, to guide them when their views are on questions of administration transgress constitutional right."
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1097.56,1101.465,That's a nice view from us to -- whatever you used to guide them.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1104.617,1109.944,"Well, that was a gentle word and I think you have [Laughter] -- that describes the power which you have over it."
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1131.777,1135.912,"Helpfully under racial problem, I have a specific provision of the Constitution."
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1135.912,1136.49,And we think sir --
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1136.49,1143.332,I do not think I have a specific provision dealing with your problem else we wouldn't have had five hours or six hours of argument.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1143.332,1144.728,"Well, --"
1960.36,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1144.728,1151.512,Can anyone -- anyone not a member of the race affected raise the racial question?
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1151.512,1154.634,I think they might sir and there are many cases I think that could be illustrated.
1960.36,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1194.542,1196.453,Are your clients Sabbatarian?
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1196.453,1198.428,"No, they are not."
1960.36,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1198.519,1202.022,They raise -- they raise the religious issue for others?
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1202.022,1202.592,No.
1960.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1246.422,1266.639,"Mr. Kohn, as I understand it, it's your suggestion that the -- all of your constitutional difficulties could be -- would be resolved if Pennsylvania were to enact the statute of the one-day in seven variety, providing that in any seven day period, everybody should have a consecutive 24 hours of rest."
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1278.535,1281.988,"Personally, I think not, because I think that grave and serious --"
1960.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1281.988,1287.878,"Because under your first theory, as I understand it, your clients could operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week --"
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1287.878,1287.99,That's right.
1960.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1287.99,1290.284,-- so long as they arrange their employment's schedule --
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1290.284,1290.403,That's right.
1960.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.403,1293.848,-- so as not to employ anybody more than six consecutive days.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1293.848,1296.361,"I think there, you'd run afoul the religious problem."
1960.36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1402.341,1405.327,But it's not unlike the 1959 law.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1405.327,1405.907,No.
1960.36,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1456.318,1460.061,(Inaudible)
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1460.061,1467.869,No and I don't think it cures the constitutional defect because I have some misgivings myself as to whether if you --
1960.36,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1467.869,1469.89,(Inaudible)
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1469.89,1471.102,Just pure Sabbatarian?
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1489.459,1496.675,Does Sunday have some non-judicial -- non-religious significance.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1503.153,1504.068,Yes.
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1520.39,1522.003,The other way around is also true.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1529.576,1530.313,That's right.
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1530.358,1536.664,"So that the fact that -- the fact that you -- as I say you, neither of those general statements helps us in this problem."
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1536.664,1537.814,That's right.
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1542.382,1543.073,That's right.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1543.073,1551.995,-- then it does transgress the Constitution.
1960.36,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1602.348,1603.845,That's the heart of the case.
1960.36,0,27444,harold_e_kohn,,1603.845,1604.787,That's right.
1960.36,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1615.278,1617.005,Mr. Rubin.
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1617.005,1620.782,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.36,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2095.36,2100.63,"The Vidal -- the Vidal case was not a dehydrated theology, wasn't it?"
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2100.63,2102.84,"Well, it wasn't written by a theologian, as best I know."
1960.36,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2102.84,2106.624,"No, by a very learned man."
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2106.624,2117.186,It's my feeling and it's our position that the history of the Pennsylvania Sunday laws cannot be isolated from the history of Pennsylvania generally.
1960.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2142.126,2145.581,I'm kind of curious about one thing; it's hardly worth taking much time.
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2160.218,2163.267,"Until I heard that today, I never realized such a thing was true."
1960.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2173.333,2175.233,I'm just -- out of curiosity wanted if you --
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2175.233,2181.631,I have no other information on that respect.
1960.36,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2181.782,2184.642,Are you suggesting -- you just said it's the holy day?
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2184.642,2187.614,"Well, it was the day of observance."
1960.36,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2191.808,2194.45,"Well that's their concern, but not the State's concern."
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2194.45,2195.683,That's right.
1960.36,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2195.683,2202.071,"Those are through characters -- as an expression of State, it isn't the holy day."
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2202.071,2204.451,"No, we don't -- and certainly we don't claim it is."
1960.36,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2204.527,2206.476,"If you're saying that, then you're in great trouble."
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2206.476,2220.149,We say that all that the Sunday laws probably were designed to do in Pennsylvania when you put them into this historical matrix is simply to see to it the people who came to Pennsylvania had an opportunity to enjoy the freedoms Pennsylvania offered.
1960.36,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2249.305,2253.217,Does a famous Jew had something to do with revolution in Pennsylvania?
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2255.935,2256.885,I believe there was.
1960.36,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2256.885,2257.27,Yes.
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2257.27,2258.734,I think there are probably were several.
1960.36,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2258.734,2263.198,"No, a particular one."
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2263.198,2271.469,"In this background, I want to then refer to several things that the plaintiff here has referred to in his paper books."
1960.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3123.175,3130.531,"The two lower court of Pennsylvania decisions recent ones don't involve this plaintiff, do they?"
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3130.531,3131.822,"No, I don't believe they do."
1960.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3131.822,3133.748,The ones holding invalid and --
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3133.748,3142.679,"They involve other plaintiffs I think some in similar position of the same natures as the operation may be, it's similar --"
1960.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3142.679,3145.299,One was a criminal case and the other was an equity case.
1960.36,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3145.299,3147.639,One was an equity case and one was a criminal case.
1960.36,2,27444,harold_e_kohn,,3285.954,3303.116,"Despite that constitutional provisions just been read by the Attorney General, it was from Pennsylvania that there came the Murdock case in which this Court established for the first time I think that the Fourteenth Amendment did protect this kind of liberty."
