1963.75,0,19257,charles_hieken,,768.192,783.693,"Well, that -- I'm not to going to limit ourselves to that, Your Honor, because we also said “by virtue of these facts, Automobile Body Research Corporation has improperly created a monopoly and is misusing its patents and, accordingly, such misuse is a tribunal move to the plaintiff.”"

1963.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,788.017,791.919,(Inaudible)
1963.75,0,19257,charles_hieken,,791.919,792.585,"Yes, Your Honor."
1963.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.957,817.6,(Inaudible)
1963.75,0,19257,charles_hieken,,817.6,820.437,"Well, we had both in both ways, Your Honor."
1963.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.886,837.925,Where is that?
1963.75,0,19257,charles_hieken,,837.925,845.757,"Oh, that is -- well, we have, I believe on page 67 of the record."
1963.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,902.059,905.502,Is there (Inaudible)
1963.75,0,19257,charles_hieken,,905.502,906.947,Yes it is in the record Your Honor.
1963.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,909.975,911.564,In another case?
1963.75,0,19257,charles_hieken,,911.564,925.163,"In the -- in volume 1, we have part of our answer in counter claim, that's volume 1 on -- in number 21 October, term 60, starting at page 8."
1963.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.163,927.11,(Inaudible)
1963.75,0,19257,charles_hieken,,927.11,934.459,Yes -- yes it is because a motion for relief to use the record was granted at the time certiorari was granted.
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,1816.0,1821.876,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.746,2030.232,(Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2030.232,2030.838,That is correct.
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.838,2031.589,(Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2031.589,2032.532,That is correct.
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.27,2056.309,(Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2056.309,2058.263,Yes.
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.233,2108.749,(Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2108.749,2115.768,"Because, in that case, he would be selling a staple article of commerce suitable for substantial non-infringing use."
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.956,2124.501,So what you have here involves the use only of --
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2124.501,2133.658,They can reuse -- the record is very clear on that point that the item which the petitioners were making could be used only on these Ford cars had no other use at all.
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2266.806,2276.417,(Inaudible) the owner of the sports car (Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2276.417,2277.131,That is correct.
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.131,2281.285,"And so, he is (Inaudible)"
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2281.285,2282.56,That is also correct.
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.56,2290.76,"And then, they (Inaudible) that he replaced."
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2290.76,2291.55,That's correct.
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2291.55,2293.314,(Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2293.314,2295.599,Or from any other source.
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.599,2298.144,Do you say the (Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2298.144,2298.915,Yes.
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.622,2310.547,(Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2310.547,2313.593,"No, it is just a -- it's a prolongation of the infringement, if you will."
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.008,2325.824,But this (Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2325.824,2327.446,"Yes, it does, because presumably --"
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.446,2330.141,(Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2330.141,2340.251,"No, presumably, but for the repair, the infringement would've ceased at that point.Presumably, but for the repair, this thing would've gone on the scrap heap."
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2341.892,2347.519,(Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2347.519,2350.602,"Well, I'm afraid I am not quite certain on --"
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2350.602,2356.433,I don't -- you say that the top would have been discarded and put in the garbage can or something?
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2356.433,2357.708,"We're assuming -- I understand, that --"
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2357.708,2358.897,Are you assuming?
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2358.897,2360.941,"No, I -- excuse me, sir."
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2386.199,2392.763,"Well, what do you do with last sentence of Justice Whittaker's opinion?"
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2392.763,2394.338,"If I may look at it, sir."
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2394.338,2404.215,"What it says is “measured by this test of replacement of the fabrics involved in this case must be characterized as permissible repair, not reconstruction.”"
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2404.215,2409.516,"Yes.And he previously said that, in permissible repair, that you can't get anything?"
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2409.516,2430.287,"I read that particular statement, Mr. Justice Black, in the context in which it was given and I would invite this Court's attention, for example, to the fact that immediately before the statement here, Mr. Justice Whittaker set forth what I can consider to be the rationale for his statement."
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2473.381,2477.196,(Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2477.196,2478.096,In order to --
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2478.096,2485.195,"No element, not separately patented."
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2485.195,2486.459,That is correct.
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2486.459,2487.336,What does that say?
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2487.336,2501.3,"It says “no element, not itself separately patented, that constitutes one of the elements of a combination patent is entitled to patent monopoly, however essential it maybe to the patent combination and no matter how costly or difficult replacement may be.”"
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2501.3,2502.339,What did he mean by that?
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2502.339,2508.559,"I agree with that statement, except that we must understand that we are not here trying to monopolize an element."
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2539.503,2545.637,"But, if he cut out of patch, a piece of bolt, then that's different than welding?"
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2545.637,2546.113,No.
1963.75,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2560.5,2561.038,"Well, that --"
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.038,2562.359,(Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2562.359,2564.923,"The welding would, itself, be an act of direct infringement."
1963.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.446,2617.855,"I don't know that we've ever reached the precise point as to furnishing an unpatented element of a combination patent.I remember Brandeis' opinion, but that wasn't a combination patent, was it?"
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2617.855,2619.621,"Yes, I believe it was, Your Honor."
1963.75,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2620.634,2635.418,"Because if you have this -- if you reach out this far as to obtain control over the use of unpatented parts of the combination, then you're really getting -- expanding the patent."
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2635.418,2635.722,No.
1963.75,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2637.108,2642.352,"In fact, in the Morton Salt case, where you add an unpatented commodity to it, that --"
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2642.352,2643.678,"I that concede, yes."
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2689.214,2701.243,"Do you mean that every time a man gets a combination patent, that every part of it, for that -- although you couldn't possibly get patent, that every part of it is an infringement for somebody else to sell it?"
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2701.243,2701.955,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2791.176,2793.364,"That's really your question, isn't it?"
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2796.541,2797.924,That is correct.
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2797.924,2803.015,To make a -- cut out a part of the top and call it a fit top.
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2803.015,2803.45,That's correct.
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2803.45,2805.136,The man who'd bought the top pays for it.
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2805.136,2805.744,That's correct.
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2874.487,2875.238,(Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2875.238,2876.357,Reconstruction of the complete combination.
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2876.357,2877.222,That's the (Inaudible)
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2877.222,2877.648,Yes.
1963.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2878.502,2879.825,That's really the issue.
1963.75,1,22964,elliott_i_pollock,,2879.825,2883.308,That is what we were contending at that time.
