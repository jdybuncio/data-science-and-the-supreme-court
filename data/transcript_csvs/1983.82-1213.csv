1983.82-1213,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.027,We'll hear arguments next in New York against Quarles.
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,22.936,25.578,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1213,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.252,234.096,"When you say the holding of the Miranda opinion, was there a holding in Miranda?"
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,234.096,238.498,"Well, as I understand it, the holding of the case was that--"
1983.82-1213,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,238.498,241.71,"It was really all dicta, the whole opinion, wasn't it?"
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,253.467,255.07,--I understand what you are saying.
1983.82-1213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,273.6,275.422,There have been quite a few cases since then.
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,275.422,279.504,"There have been many cases since then, of course, interpreting that."
1983.82-1213,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,348.16,362.38,In Innis the Court seems to have decided that unlike Williams against Brewer that there was no question put to Innis.
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,373.618,374.636,--That is correct.
1983.82-1213,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,374.636,380.89,"This question was directed to the accused, was it not?"
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,380.89,383.031,"Yes, it was."
1983.82-1213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,431.164,452.829,"Well, Mr. Rappaport, certainly the language in Rhode Island versus Innis seemed to indicate that questions reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses were not allowable in the absence of the Miranda warnings."
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,464.035,490.774,"Well, I think, Justice O'Connor, that the face of the Innis opinion says that interrogation is either express questioning or the functional equivalent of express questioning and then went on to define the functional equivalent of express questioning in terms of whether it is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response."
1983.82-1213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,570.926,574.978,"This question goes to the very heart of the offense, doesn't it?"
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,574.978,584.183,"Well, given that the offense now... The only charge left open now is the possession of the weapon."
1983.82-1213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,586.056,590.418,"That is pretty incriminating, I suppose."
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,590.418,609.151,"There is no question that that is incriminating, but the mere fact that the answer to a question might be incriminating or is even likely to be incriminating does not necessarily mean that Miranda prescribes the question to be asked."
1983.82-1213,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,644.023,649.637,"Well, it is a question about a crime, the Sullivan law in New York."
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,649.637,659.854,"--Yes, of course, it is a question about a crime, Justice Marshall, but the question, what is going on here, when there is a crime going on--"
1983.82-1213,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,659.854,662.555,"No, this was specific."
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,673.743,693.916,"--I think in this situation the duty of Officer Kraft and I think, apparent from the record, the intention of Officer Kraft was not to investigate the possession of a weapon or even to investigate the rape charge, but his intention was to secure this weapon."
1983.82-1213,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,693.916,695.128,He had already frisked him.
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,695.128,718.171,"He had already frisked him and determined that the weapon was not on the defendant's person, but it could have been, and very likely was, in the immediate vicinity of the Respondent in a supermarket, and the obligation of the police officer at that point was to secure that weapon."
1983.82-1213,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,718.171,734.802,"As a practical matter, Mr. Rappaport, precisely that question, precisely that question could have been addressed to one of the clerks or customers in the store if they were standing nearby, near enough to see what had been done with the gun, is that not so?"
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,734.802,736.014,"Of course, that is so."
1983.82-1213,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,736.014,743.847,"So, the response of the customer or the clerk would not involve a question about a crime, would it?"
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,743.847,746.108,That is correct.
1983.82-1213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,767.364,772.667,"Mr. Rappaport, I guess there are other issues that you raise in the case."
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,777.021,778.4,I would like to discuss those.
1983.82-1213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,778.4,784.354,"And, would you mind mentioning whether you raised those issues in the courts below?"
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,784.354,785.195,Certainly.
1983.82-1213,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,864.807,866.99,In what court did you make that argument?
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,866.99,868.389,--We made that argument in this Court.
1983.82-1213,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,909.736,915.7,"You don't have to make any argument when the arguments are directed against you in the trial court, do you?"
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,924.256,925.946,"--Well, that is exactly our position."
1983.82-1213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.676,942.359,"Well, they addressed them in the state courts, didn't they?"
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,942.359,945.42,They--
1983.82-1213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.42,950.172,You weren't precluded from making those arguments in the State Appellate Court.
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,950.172,952.774,--We were not precluded from making the arguments.
1983.82-1213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.23,980.883,"Well, if you made the argument and they ignored it, they necessarily rejected it."
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,980.883,988.677,"--Well, they necessarily rejected it, but we think that that rejection is subject to review by this Court."
1983.82-1213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1067.771,1071.321,What if you won only on the fruits question?
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,1074.503,1077.966,This case has not been tried yet.
1983.82-1213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.966,1078.687,I see.
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,1078.687,1081.148,We would not introduce it.
1983.82-1213,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.52,1084.701,"With the gun, yes."
1983.82-1213,0,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,1084.701,1102.853,"--So, given the speculative nature of the deterrent value of excluding the evidence, that is balanced against the interest in making trustworthy evidence available."
1983.82-1213,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1131.202,1132.243,Very well.
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1140.818,1146.982,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1213,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1246.436,1251.85,"Is your argument inconsistent, do you think, with the Orozco case?"
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1251.85,1254.301,"No, I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-1213,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1274.974,1281.619,"Well, you are not arguing that this question was necessary to complete the arrest, are you?"
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1281.619,1286.404,It was necessary to complete the process of arresting him safely in the same way that searches--
1983.82-1213,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1286.404,1294.489,"Well, I thought that the handcuffs had already been placed on him and that he had been arrested at the time of the question."
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1295.658,1320.936,"--The handcuffs had been placed on him, but the officer... Certainly no prudent officer at that point, having heard reliably that the suspect had a gun and having found an empty shoulder holster and having lost sight of him during the chase for 10 or 15 seconds, would have thought that he could relax and begin the process of investigating the crime and putting the Respondent in jail."
1983.82-1213,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1320.936,1323.858,Was he still in danger after he was handcuffed?
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1323.858,1325.358,"Well, he apparently thought so."
1983.82-1213,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1327.611,1331.643,"Well, what in the world could happen to him if the man was handcuffed with his hands behind him?"
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1331.643,1339.699,"--Well, there is no doubt, Justice Marshall, that he could have conducted a search incident to arrest of the area of Respondent, of the--"
1983.82-1213,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1339.699,1340.627,He didn't.
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1342.56,1343.459,"--Well, he did the more prudent thing."
1983.82-1213,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1350.635,1356.579,"And, as the East Indian said, it is much easier to rub red pepper in his eyes instead of doing my work."
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1356.579,1360.162,"Well, this was not an abusive action or a coercive action."
1983.82-1213,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1361.662,1364.033,All he did was ask a question.
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1364.033,1370.728,"--There has been no finding and, I think, no serious suggestion that he coerced Respondent into answering the question."
1983.82-1213,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1370.728,1372.889,Do you have to have coercion?
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1376.382,1379.713,"He is coerced into not moving his hands, but not into answering a question."
1983.82-1213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.747,1402.328,"Would your distinction between seizure and custody come in airport search cases where perhaps you might say that in response to a stop and frisked a person felt they were not free to walk away, but nonetheless you would say they may be seized but they weren't there in custody?"
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1402.328,1404.261,"--That is exactly right, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-1213,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1412.416,1413.866,He wasn't handcuffed.
1983.82-1213,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1413.866,1419.181,"Well, there is nothing that says in a Terry stop the officers couldn't handcuff an accused if they thought it necessary."
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,1789.264,1790.405,Thank you.
1983.82-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.998,1861.161,What if the officer had... He saw the defendant down at the end of this aisle and he pulled his gun and said halt or raise your hands and the defendant halted and raised his hands.
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,1864.692,1872.498,"--That, Your Honor, has been permitted in New York in a case called People v. Chestnut and Huffman."
1983.82-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.498,1874.209,Do you think Miranda forbids that kind of--
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,1874.209,1875.31,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1983.82-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1947.175,1968.04,"--What if the evidence had been that two men had committed this crime and they both ran into the store and the officer sees one of them, arrests him, handcuffs him, frisks him, doesn't find the gun, he finds an empty holster."
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,1968.04,1974.754,"--I believe, Your Honor, that that is a difficult question, but that Miranda would apply."
1983.82-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.589,2000.951,"Well, Miranda didn't rest on coercion, it rested on the possibility of coercion."
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2000.951,2003.753,"Inherent coercion in a situation, that is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1213,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2003.753,2004.734,What is it here?
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2006.575,2007.926,"The handcuffs, certainly."
1983.82-1213,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2019.484,2021.124,What if he hadn't been handcuffed?
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2021.124,2021.695,Excuse me?
1983.82-1213,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2021.695,2022.967,What if he hadn't been handcuffed?
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2022.967,2029.581,"At that time, Your Honor, he might not have been in the degree associated with formal arrest."
1983.82-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.483,2044.331,"In a public place, in a supermarket, there is a possibility of third degree tactics that Miranda was aimed at preventing?"
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2044.331,2052.787,"--There is a... Your Honor, I might note that this was in the... Not to beg the question and not to say--"
1983.82-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.787,2054.187,"Well, it was in a public place, wasn't it?"
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2055.539,2057.649,"--There was no one else around, Your Honor."
1983.82-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.372,2063.441,Police aren't about to take out a piece of rubber hose and--
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2065.662,2067.655,Page 25-A.
1983.82-1213,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2079.573,2082.175,I never heard of a supermarket with nobody around.
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2082.175,2083.237,It was 12:00 at night.
1983.82-1213,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2084.696,2086.447,I have been in those too.
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2092.862,2097.646,"Apparently, according to the question... Now, I asked that question at the time of the hearing."
1983.82-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.854,2111.203,They weren't in the station house anyway.
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2111.203,2112.944,--They were not in the station house.
1983.82-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2112.944,2115.686,And they weren't locked up in somebody's bedroom.
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2117.238,2120.3,"They were, but he was, Your Honor--"
1983.82-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.3,2125.415,"Well, he was handcuffed, that is true, and he was under arrest."
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2125.415,2132.649,"--But, those are the factors, Your Honor, we have as this Court has refined Miranda."
1983.82-1213,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.13,2141.674,What is the closest case you think for the beginning of the Miranda obligation?
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2143.727,2144.887,--Orozco.
1983.82-1213,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2144.887,2147.819,"That was another five to four decision, wasn't it?"
1983.82-1213,2,41496,steven_j_hyman,,2148.84,2149.872,Yes.
1983.82-1213,3,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,3698.083,3698.531,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1213,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3698.531,3700.444,You have three minutes remaining.
1983.82-1213,3,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,3700.444,3701.533,Thank you.
1983.82-1213,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3729.813,3735.887,Was this case decided by the Court of Appeals before we decided Michigan and Long?
1983.82-1213,3,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,3735.887,3738.078,It was decided before--
1983.82-1213,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3738.078,3740.069,"Well, then how were they to know we didn't make that requirement?"
1983.82-1213,3,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,3740.069,3751.148,"--Well, I think the fact that the Court had not made that explicit prior to Michigan versus Long does not mean that the reasoning in that case should not be--"
1983.82-1213,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3751.148,3754.11,Why should we have made it explicit if it was already the law?
1983.82-1213,3,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,3754.11,3758.641,--I am not sure I understand the question.
1983.82-1213,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3758.641,3765.467,"Perhaps we made it explicit because a lot of courts weren't catching the obvious, very obvious signal."
1983.82-1213,3,41922,steven_j_rappaport,,3765.467,3781.498,"Well, I think the point is that there were reasons behind this Court's opinion in Long and this case might present a reason for the application of that principle."
1983.82-1213,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3863.39,3869.963,"It is none of our business and you need not comment on it, but one can't help but wonder why a prosecutor thought he needed this evidence."
