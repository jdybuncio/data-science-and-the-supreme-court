2013.12-786,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.467,"Our last case this term is Case 12-786, Limelight Networks v. Akamai Technologies."
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,8.779,11.778,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-786,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,90.184,104.491,"Mr. Panner, is this -- is this a problem that's special to business method patents as opposed to, say, product?"
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,104.491,109.346,"I think it is a problem that arises with method patents, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,124.279,129.652,"Well, should the rule be different for a method patent than a device patent?"
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,129.652,131.073,"--Well, I don't think the rule is different, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.979,134.251,"That's because the statute isn't different, I assume."
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,134.251,135.556,"--That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,177.602,182.568,"Your -- your position makes it pretty easy to -- to get around patent protection, doesn't it?"
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,194.672,196.109,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,254.1,261.191,"Well, but it would be -- when you say it would be written that way, it would be by not claiming one step in the method, I assume, which changes the whole patent."
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,261.191,267.158,"--Well, it would be -- it would be to claim what is carried out from the point of view of the potential infringer."
2013.12-786,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,283.994,288.635,But you don't know really in every patent whether the tagging is an important part of the process or not.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,288.635,294.039,"--Well, by -- by definition, Your Honor, the -- every step is material and important to the invention."
2013.12-786,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.286,302.581,I don't understand what you're saying.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,314.607,316.013,"--Well, it is -- it's--"
2013.12-786,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.013,317.7,How does that give you any more protection?
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,334.084,342.877,"--Your Honor, I -- I would take issue with that because I don't think that that's -- first of all, to the extent that one is being -- one is using an agent where there would be a vicarious liability for that conduct--"
2013.12-786,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.877,346.032,Yes.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,351.936,363.526,"--Well, Your Honor, that reflects -- that reflects the -- a very well-settled principles of patent law, including the principle that the alleged -- the defendant must carry out every step of the patent."
2013.12-786,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.476,369.381,Yes.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,388.812,419.472,"--Well, Your Honor, in -- in my experience in -- in terms of dealing with patents that are written to technologies that do involve interaction, for example, between cellular phones and networks and content providers who are sending content to a phone, for example, it is very common to draft claims from the point of view of someone who's participating in that process so that all of the steps will be carried out in that -- by that person."
2013.12-786,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,419.472,421.627,Is that what the briefs are talking about as a single actor?
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,421.627,423.407,Yeah.
2013.12-786,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.427,456.457,"You say this isn't here anyway, right?"
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,456.457,457.957,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.957,458.065,Okay.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,465.281,466.625,"Well, 10 of 11."
2013.12-786,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.602,485.225,Okay.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,493.91,495.332,"It may well be, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,496.176,516.791,"But the parties briefed -- this case tends to be rather confusing because didn't the parties brief, what is it, 271(1) or -- and then the Federal Circuit decided it on sub (2)."
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,516.791,520.04,"So, Your Honor, that is -- that's accurate."
2013.12-786,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,576.485,577.642,I understand.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,591.885,593.041,"--That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,593.041,593.619,All right.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,601.617,603.443,"The -- the en banc court did not, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,631.246,634.696,And that direct infringement question would still be open before the court below?
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,634.696,635.82,"--Potentially, Your Honor, yes."
2013.12-786,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,643.818,648.016,"And how would it -- just to follow up, how would it still be open for the court below?"
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,652.687,655.657,"--Well, en banc review actually was granted, Your Honor, because the--"
2013.12-786,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,655.657,657.766,On -- on the direct infringement question?
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,657.766,659.045,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,659.045,660.108,And they just didn't reach it?
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,660.108,660.795,"Correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,660.795,691.736,"And, Mr. Panner, if they did reach it a second time around and they decided well, now that this inducement theory is not available to us, we think that there is a real problem here, that there is a kind of end run around the patent law and so we're going to change what we think on the 271(a) question, if they did that, it would be right to say it would render our opinion on the 271(b) question a nullity?"
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,691.736,698.562,"Well, Your Honor, it is -- that -- that may be right in the -- in the following sense."
2013.12-786,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,716.897,717.974,Yes.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,738.967,764.204,"--I don't think so, Your Honor, because if -- if the Court were to keep -- if the Court were to maintain that rule -- if the Court were to affirm the rule that the Federal Circuit articulated, that might reach circumstances -- that would continue to potentially provide an avenue for claims of induced infringement and circumstances where on some hypothetical new joint infringement doctrine under Section 271(a), there might not be a claim."
2013.12-786,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,764.721,764.896,Yes.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,772.757,781.754,"--Your Honor, that's probably right, and that's a very good reason that the -- for the Court to recognize that the Section 271(b) ruling is incorrect."
2013.12-786,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,797.56,810.461,It's -- it's a good reason to think that the question before us really has no significance that I can think of unless the -- the Court of Appeals -- unless the Federal Circuit is right about (a).
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,810.461,813.553,"Well, again, Your Honor, certainly--"
2013.12-786,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,813.553,832.624,"So you're asking us to decide a question -- to assume the answer to the question on (a) and then decide a question on (b) that is of no value -- no significant -- maybe I don't understand some other -- I don't see some other situations where it would apply, and no significance unless the ruling on (a) stands, unless Muniauction is correct?"
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,832.624,853.46,"--Well, Your Honor, again, I think that there's -- there are -- there might be circumstances where Section 271(a) would still -- still not apply and there might be an argument that, depending on what the more -- we're talking about a hypothetical 271(a) rule that's broader, and we don't know what it would look like and so whether that would leave room for 271(b)."
2013.12-786,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,874.842,884.401,"I just want to make clear, you're saying that under existing law, the question presented makes a huge difference; if existing law is changed, it may not make a difference?"
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,884.401,885.649,That's exactly right.
2013.12-786,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,885.649,887.149,I suppose that's true in every case we hear.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,887.149,889.558,"That's -- that's well said, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,889.798,915.326,"But I suppose, Mr. Panner, what might make this a little bit different is that notwithstanding what you said about 10 of 11 judges, it was clear that the judges thought that there was a real problem here in terms of an end run, and that they looked at this and said, well we could do it under 271(a) or we could do it under 271(b), and 271(b) seems a lot more natural and better for various reasons."
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,924.696,927.398,"I -- I certainly wouldn't agree with that, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.416,960.025,You could.
2013.12-786,0,16746,aaron_m_panner,,960.025,960.962,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2013.12-786,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,960.962,971.036,Ms. Anders.
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1612.941,1615.503,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-786,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1675.352,1676.008,Isn't that a partnership?
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1676.008,1676.68,Excuse me?
2013.12-786,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1676.68,1677.899,Isn't that a partnership?
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1677.899,1680.179,It would not necessarily be a partnership.
2013.12-786,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1690.222,1693.113,There's nothing in the law that requires a formal partnership.
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1693.113,1715.134,"--This is exactly, exactly the point here, which is that as this Court has taught, the Patent Act, and in particular 271(a), imports common law principles of liability unless the law, the Patent Act clearly can be read to exclude them."
2013.12-786,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1833.446,1845.252,"I think there's -- there's disagreement about whether only those two, mainly agency or -- what's the other?"
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1845.252,1846.721,Contractual obligation.
2013.12-786,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.721,1854.765,"Contractual obligation, whether only those two at common law would apply to strict liability torts."
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1862.246,1864.526,"You know, let me just say--"
2013.12-786,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.526,1866.385,Not strict liability torts.
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1866.385,1886.111,"--Let me just say, Justice Scalia, that the proposition that they've asserted, and I gather that you're giving -- you're crediting in their reply brief, that where the underlying tort is strict liability, the attribution rules have to be these formal nonknowledge rules."
2013.12-786,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1941.246,1958.536,"Well, under your submission in a process patent, if the consumer adds the final step, vast numbers of consumers, and let's assume they have noticed -- they've been notified that they can't do this, then there's liability."
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1958.536,1969.905,"Well, I mean, look, before I came here this morning, using my smartphone, I'm sure that technically I performed the last step of probably 15 different method patents."
2013.12-786,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1976.2,1979.074,"Yet, until we issue the case in your favor."
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1979.074,1980.557,"No, no, not at all."
2013.12-786,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2160.203,2170.871,"Well, if you don't prevail on your indirect infringement claim, can you relitigate the direct infringement case in the -- before the En Banc Court, or--"
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2170.871,2190.644,"I think, both the Government and -- at the petition stage, both the Government and Limelight took pains to point out that if you simply reverse and don't grant the cross-petition, the Federal Circuit will have in front of it the question on which it granted en banc review and vacated the panel decision."
2013.12-786,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2227.879,2229.519,My problem is I have no idea.
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2230.301,2230.518,--No idea--
2013.12-786,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.518,2237.266,--I have no idea whether they should be liable or not on a theory of patent infringement themselves.
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2305.472,2314.938,"--Justice Breyer, let me answer the question and then -- and get to my -- the point I was trying to make in response to Justice Kennedy's question."
2013.12-786,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2361.669,2363.81,"And of course, my problem is a rule."
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2385.238,2408.65,"--Justice Breyer, just so that we're clear, in telling -- in urging the Court to address the predicate question of (a) liability in this case, we are not suggesting that it would be possible or appropriate -- well, of course, it's possible -- appropriate for this Court to write a treatise on 271(a) that deals with all method claims regardless of the state of knowledge of various parties, many of whom don't even know about each other."
2013.12-786,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2439.951,2440.451,And--
2013.12-786,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2440.451,2444.574,"And I'd have the same question, by the way, as to 271(b), exactly the same question."
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2466.752,2467.579,"--Yes, I can."
2013.12-786,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2543.86,2551.89,"--And, Mr. Waxman, if -- if -- if we say something about the 271(a) question here, I mean, it does seem as though it's sandbagging Limelight."
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2572.757,2579.362,"Well, Justice Kagan, first of all, I mean, if it were a real problem, the Court could order supplemental briefing."
2013.12-786,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2626.156,2626.577,That--
2013.12-786,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2626.577,2627.593,"I'm sorry, Mr. Waxman."
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2633.778,2634.965,Okay.
2013.12-786,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2642.197,2653.645,"And my question is one you probably can't answer, which is a problem because you have limited time, and the way -- you have such limited time in these complicated cases."
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2688.681,2688.72,--Okay.
2013.12-786,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2688.72,2690.742,--that -- that is basically my idea.
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2697.724,2699.333,Okay.
2013.12-786,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2699.333,2704.815,"And it doesn't depend just upon that there were 4 steps in this case, because there could have been 104."
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2704.815,2705.268,Okay.
2013.12-786,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2705.568,2707.596,There could have been 104 different circumstances.
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2707.596,2707.787,--Okay.
2013.12-786,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2711.172,2711.36,Yes.
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2711.36,2713.664,--a concern about saying anything about (a).
2013.12-786,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2713.664,2714.117,Yes.
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2730.83,2732.344,"Well, just--"
2013.12-786,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2732.344,2739.325,Go with what you have because I don't understand it well enough to know all the facts and circumstances to which I would be applying a new rule.
2013.12-786,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2739.325,2776.903,"--Justice Breyer, if you are hesitant, and perhaps you should be, to say anything about (a) or (b) in the utterly peculiar circumstances of this case litigated judgment on (a), vacation of the panel decision to have argument and decision on (a) and then nothing said about (a) except we don't need -- then the -- then the option for the Court -- it seems to me, the best option for the Court would be simply to dismiss the petition as improvidently granted or to vacate on the grounds that the -- look, you don't ask, you don't get."
2013.12-786,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2778.919,2780.216,"Well, sure you do."
