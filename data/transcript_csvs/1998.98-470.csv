1998.98-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.077,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-470, Ruhrgas v. Marathon Oil Company."
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,47.742,52.556,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,238.639,248.194,"Mr. Wright, the majority in the court of appeals in this case reversed the district court, did it not?"
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,248.194,248.915,"Yes, sir."
1998.98-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.915,253.838,And the dissenters said that they would uphold... that they would affirm the district court.
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,253.838,254.268,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.268,260.493,So it would have come out differently in the district court if the dissenters' views had prevailed.
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,260.493,263.177,"That is correct, Justice... Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-470,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.177,270.31,"Mr. Wright, you're not arguing that the Constitution requires one approach or another, are you?"
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,270.31,273.893,"I... Justice O'Connor, I'm not arguing that at all."
1998.98-470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,293.805,307.626,"When we write the opinion, should we say that that discretion should be exercised in a way so that personal jurisdiction is usually decided after subject matter jurisdiction, all other things being equal?"
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,307.626,310.996,It seems to me you could well write the opinion that way.
1998.98-470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.996,311.567,"Well, should we?"
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,311.567,314.96,If I were writing it I would not write it that way.
1998.98-470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,336.104,348.843,"Well, is there not a value to Federalism in deciding subject matter jurisdiction first in an instance like this, so that in the event it does not exist, the State can address its own long arm statute?"
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,348.843,354.376,--I wonder if I could answer that by putting to you a hypothetical.
1998.98-470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,354.376,357.018,So long as you answer the hypothetical for me.
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,357.248,360.361,I'm surely going to answer the hypothetical.
1998.98-470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,432.188,437.29,"Well, my question is directed to this."
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,468.673,471.023,"Of course, there's always a Federalism."
1998.98-470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,471.023,479.038,"Because you indicate there is some discretion, and I want to know what are the determinants in guiding that discretion?"
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,479.038,503.903,"Well, I think that an important determinant in guiding the discretion would be the extent to which this would require the Federal court to pass on difficult issues of State law, the extent to which the questions of personal jurisdiction are intertwined with the question of subject matter jurisdiction, as, indeed, we think they are here, that all those would be relevant considerations in deciding which issue you would address first."
1998.98-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,503.903,508.107,"You go further, I take it, than the dissenters in the court of appeals."
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,522.957,532.154,"As the lawyer for Ruhrgas, I would say we are very happy with the rule announced by Judge Higginbotham and the dissenters in the Fifth Circuit."
1998.98-470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,538.438,559.061,"And yet there are many authors who have distinguished subject matter jurisdiction as being the most basic from personal jurisdiction, which those authors have ranked along with, say, venue, as a merely dilatory defense, suggesting that there is a hierarchy here, and that subject matter jurisdiction is the more basic."
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,559.061,573.41,"Justice Ginsburg, I would say that I would not agree with them, that I would agree on the great importance of subject matter jurisdiction."
1998.98-470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,605.451,609.494,I was quoting your text when I used the word dilatory.
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,609.494,612.486,I imagined that I recognized the words.
1998.98-470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,612.797,628.014,"I take it the point of your hypothetical was that sometimes in deciding the subject matter case, whether removal was proper, a district judge would decide a host of State law questions, personal jurisdiction questions, all kinds of other questions."
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,628.014,628.865,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,628.865,629.246,All right.
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,634.429,635.951,That is exactly my submission.
1998.98-470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,680.861,690.937,"--Mr. Wright, as to the preclusive effect, imagine that this case had been dismissed for want of personal jurisdiction."
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,723.708,740.038,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe that the party would be allowed in State court to challenge the preclusive effect of the judgment by saying that the Federal court lacked jurisdiction to issue that judgment."
1998.98-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.604,751.985,But how about Trinese v. Sunshine Mining.
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,754.549,758.931,"It did, yes."
1998.98-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.931,764.234,That you could relitigate the issue of jurisdiction if the first court had not had jurisdiction.
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,764.234,771.029,"I'm sorry, Justice Rehnquist, I'm not prepared on that case."
1998.98-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,771.029,772.68,"Well, I'm not sure that's right, either."
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,819.76,833.48,"Well, I go back, Justice Scalia, to I think it's 1803, McCormick v. Sullivan, that after a judgment in a Federal court you cannot resist enforcement on the grounds that in fact there was no diversity."
1998.98-470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,844.908,849.86,"But here, it is attacked in the first proceeding, and the court says, well, I can pick and choose."
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,866.572,867.09,It was--
1998.98-470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.09,872.025,"So you would have a delightful, quite parallel situation."
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,882.431,886.755,"--Well, I don't think I do."
1998.98-470,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,897.551,900.293,But why isn't that exactly the respondents' point?
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,916.685,931.354,"Well, I'd, as I suggested a moment ago, be perfectly content with saying that mostly you consider it first, but look at a case such as Caterpillar--"
1998.98-470,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,931.354,931.564,But why?
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,932.634,934.707,--Why is--
1998.98-470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,934.707,937.977,Why should we usually consider subject matter jurisdiction first?
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,937.977,946.364,"--It is a threshold issue, but threshold issues not always have to be considered first."
1998.98-470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,950.836,955.33,What is the source... are you finished answering him?
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,955.33,955.671,Yes.
1998.98-470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,955.671,967.088,"What is the source, which I've often wondered, of rules of law that say you always have to decide some question of a certain kind first, for example, jurisdiction before merits?"
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,978.786,1002.371,"I think it comes, Justice Breyer, from Article III, that the judicial power of the United States extends only to certain kinds of cases, and that therefore you have to find out whether this is a case that is within your jurisdiction, but you have to do that before you decide the merits."
1998.98-470,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1031.05,1033.021,"Did we get that one right, in your view?"
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1033.021,1034.483,"--You did, exactly right, all nine of you."
1998.98-470,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1035.075,1040.878,"Well, I wasn't sure."
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1063.813,1065.693,I agree completely.
1998.98-470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1144.203,1161.865,"But in your view it need never be determined, because if the district court is right that she could dismiss for personal jurisdiction and that binds the State court, then subject matter jurisdiction is never determined, and properly so."
1998.98-470,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1161.865,1181.701,"I agree entirely with that, and I think the same thing is true in Amchem, that subject matter jurisdiction never has to be decided because you hold that the class should not have been certified, and so you don't pass on the both constitutional and statutory objections to subject matter jurisdiction that were present in that case."
1998.98-470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1185.641,1187.634,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1189.767,1197.651,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-470,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1230.704,1251.637,"Well, he... Mr. Wright gave several examples of situations where courts, apparently properly and with our approval in some instances, have decided certain things other than subject matter jurisdiction before reaching the merits, and that have disposed of the case insofar as the Federal court is concerned."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1253.968,1255.039,--In Amchem.
1998.98-470,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1255.039,1255.688,--as we've just heard.
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1266.287,1275.113,"The abstention cases, Justice O'Connor, involve situations where the Federalism issues aren't raised."
1998.98-470,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1282.957,1289.802,"Well, without deciding, in some instances, like class certification, without even deciding whether there's subject matter jurisdiction."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1289.802,1292.473,"--Class certification is a different issue, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-470,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1337.603,1346.049,What if the subject matter jurisdiction issue turned on some fact finding that would take place at trial?
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1355.597,1368.455,"--The court doesn't have the power, Justice O'Connor, to decide that issue until it determines that it has the capacity to decide the case, and that comes from the fundamental difference between subject matter jurisdiction--"
1998.98-470,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1368.455,1374.829,So you say it would have to go to trial and determine these factual questions despite the lack of personal jurisdiction.
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1374.829,1383.716,"--Justice O'Connor, you can... I think there are hypotheticals that you can come up with that make it difficult for a court to determine subject matter jurisdiction."
1998.98-470,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1388.438,1389.539,"Well, what if we have the rare case?"
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1389.539,1407.07,"In the rare case the court has to undertake whatever procedures it has to to resolve whatever antecedent issues it has to in order to get to that nub issue of subject matter jurisdiction, and I--"
1998.98-470,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1407.07,1410.503,"In other words, you want to support a per se rule no matter what."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1415.045,1429.905,"--The exceptions, Justice O'Connor, are those which have been established in the cases, for example, the inherent power cases, which deal with the court's authority to manage its docket and to manage proceedings before it."
1998.98-470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.073,1453.42,"Do you subscribe to that even when it is not a removal case, even when the alternative is not the same case proceeding in State court, or is it just in these removal situations?"
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1453.42,1458.503,"--Justice Scalia, I think it applies... from a constitutional standpoint it would apply across the board."
1998.98-470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.503,1474.404,"So in all cases, even if it's not a removal case, where there is a personal jurisdiction issue and a subject matter jurisdictional issue, you would say that the Federal court has to decide the subject matter jurisdiction first, or else it has no authority to pronounce on personal jurisdiction?"
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1474.404,1476.154,"Yes, Justice Scalia, I would."
1998.98-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1499.241,1500.01,Mr. Hutchinson--
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1515.581,1519.805,"Insubstantiality and statutory standing, or constitutional standing."
1998.98-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.805,1522.956,Constitutional standing and insubstantiality.
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1522.956,1533.433,"Justice Stevens, I think that was part of the questions that were discussed at some length in the Steel Co. case, which is whether you can--"
1998.98-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1533.433,1534.084,"No... well, okay."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1534.084,1536.685,--The issue of what type--
1998.98-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.685,1538.294,"There the court would have a choice, you'd say."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1538.294,1539.977,--Constitutional versus statutory standing.
1998.98-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1551.645,1551.835,"No, the--"
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1551.835,1552.634,--and the defense of the party.
1998.98-470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1552.634,1565.412,--But Justice Stevens is correct that we do use what you might call an efficiency model whenever we allow a dismissal on jurisdictional grounds because the Federal claim is frivolous.
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1584.287,1592.482,"What is to be said to that, Justice Scalia, to distinguish it, is that the court is looking at subject matter jurisdiction."
1998.98-470,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1597.053,1599.877,"Yes, but it's not looking to Article III jurisdiction, is it?"
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1604.819,1605.718,It may be.
1998.98-470,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1605.718,1617.428,"Well, and if it does that, and if that is proper, then in effect we've already decided the issue as to whether the Article III point always and under all circumstances must take precedence."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1617.428,1621.089,"I don't quite follow that, Justice Souter."
1998.98-470,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1628.966,1634.569,"Well, we are saying in the first instance that it's a frivolous claim in relation to the statute under which it is brought."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1662.506,1672.604,"--But what the Court did there was address its capacity to act, its power to act over the case, and that's very different from the individual right--"
1998.98-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.604,1674.845,But it clearly had power to act over the case.
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1682.459,1685.861,--The Court has to have power before it can act.
1998.98-470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.942,1692.817,"Well, how about Rule 12(b), the way it lists the various defenses."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1713.951,1715.971,But it has been treated hierarchically.
1998.98-470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.971,1716.552,Has it?
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1716.552,1718.533,In the rule itself.
1998.98-470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1718.533,1719.224,Well--
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1719.224,1725.257,"Some of the defenses are waivable, some are not."
1998.98-470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1729.699,1735.194,--Is there authority in case law to that effect?
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1735.194,1758.149,"Justice Scalia, I was actually referring to Professor Wright's treatise, that is correct."
1998.98-470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.58,1769.135,"Is that res judicata here, too?"
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1769.406,1770.338,It is not.
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1774.781,1781.577,"Mr. Hutchinson, subject matter jurisdiction is preserved and it can be raised later and later, so it's the most holy one in that respect."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1830.959,1849.442,"--Well, what I was referring to, Justice Ginsburg, was Rule 12(h), which indicates that a defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper venue, insufficiency of process, all those things can be waived, but... but jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction--"
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1849.442,1862.391,"Yes, because there's always jurisdiction over the person by consent, so there's that difference, but how does it relate to the issue that's before us, and you have been talking largely in the abstract."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1926.475,1939.221,"--That suggests, though, Justice Ginsburg, that... that a court has... may re... pre try a case in determining remand, and that would be against congressional policy, that if all doubts are to be resolved--"
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1939.221,1941.602,"Well, let's not talk about policy, about specifics."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,1965.468,1976.407,"--But in this case the only evidence in the case was that Norge owned the license, and that that license was damaged by the acts of Ruhrgas."
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1985.921,1999.742,"Well, why was it so easy when the Fifth Circuit itself, the majority said, gee, we're a little uncertain about that panel that held there was no subject matter jurisdiction, so we think it better go back to the district court to decide?"
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2022.566,2027.12,"I can't speak to the dissenters, or why they didn't allow the panel--"
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2027.12,2030.731,"I'm talking about the court, the majority, not the dissenters."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2044.381,2051.956,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the majority could have done that, but they decided to return it to the district court, and I don't know why."
1998.98-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.956,2068.116,"--May I ask, just to understand the purity of your position, if the attack on personal jurisdiction had been insufficient service of process that challenged the way in which the process... would you still say that could not be decided before the subject matter jurisdiction issue?"
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2093.623,2101.947,"In my view, yes, Justice Stevens, that the court first must satisfy itself it has Article III power over the case before it can address subject matter jurisdiction."
1998.98-470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2101.947,2120.28,"Why, just... I've always wondered this, and I'm not saying there's no answer to it, but if all these cases, indeed, where it's Article III power versus the merits, they all are cases in which it's arguable both ways whether there is or there isn't the Article III power."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2149.399,2154.802,"Courts can get it wrong, Justice Breyer, but the fact is they have to get it; they have to determine--"
1998.98-470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2154.802,2155.233,Why?
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2155.233,2156.184,--They have to make that determination--
1998.98-470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.184,2156.424,Why?
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2175.845,2179.738,--Because of Article III and the limited power of the Federal courts.
1998.98-470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.202,2185.572,Exactly.
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2198.591,2207.687,"--Because Congress has spoken to that in a removal case, and they've said if... in remand, it cannot be appealed, and I think that--"
1998.98-470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.687,2212.92,"Of course, you're not giving me the answer correctly that I'm looking for, which is it would be totally impractical."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2215.302,2219.135,"--No, Justice Breyer."
1998.98-470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2223.267,2230.281,But there's a constitutional principle that the defendant's asserting with reference to personal jurisdiction as well.
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2270.437,2276.732,"It is an individual right, and that's what distinguishes it from the institutional integrity of subject matter jurisdiction."
1998.98-470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2288.461,2304.441,"Well, but of course, you apply your rule across the board, even to nonremovable cases, so in my hypothetical you were sued in the district court originally and you still say he has to submit himself to the subject matter jurisdiction argument by hiring attorneys and making special appearances and so forth."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2318.419,2334.119,"--Every defendant is going to be inconvenienced, but the sanctity of the Federalism system must take priority over that determination, and we're not, in our situation, saying that personal jurisdiction is not important, it shouldn't be decided."
1998.98-470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2336.401,2343.096,What authority do you have for the standpoint that Federalism takes precedence over personal freedom?
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2343.096,2345.046,--Over the right of the individual?
1998.98-470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2345.046,2348.659,What case do I cite when I write the opinion that has that--
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2348.659,2349.611,I would--
1998.98-470,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2349.611,2350.72,--statement in it?
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2350.72,2358.206,--I would cite those cases that define what is a jurisdictional prerequisite for the case... for the court to act.
1998.98-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2456.621,2462.733,May I ask you to comment on another consideration that occurs to me as I think about the problem.
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2483.556,2496.525,"I'm familiar with that line of cases, Justice Stevens, but again I don't think that rule can be taken this far, and to say that you... the Court goes into a balancing--"
1998.98-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.525,2502.57,You'd say that even though there's no personal jurisdiction we have an obligation to address the difficult constitutional question.
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2502.57,2505.481,"--You have... my... yes, Justice Stevens."
1998.98-470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.481,2506.461,You must decide it before you--
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2506.461,2507.212,You must decide it first.
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2509.084,2520.272,"--Then you're withdrawing from one thing you said in your brief, which I... you said, if the subject matter jurisdiction question is real tough... this is on page 18, 19 of your brief, if it's real tough, there's a simple solution."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2538.163,2565.68,"--Justice Ginsburg, in a removed case, the courts are uniform in saying that doubts should be resolved in favor of remand in order to follow the dictates of Congress in the removal statutes, and as this Court recognized in the International Primate, these are mandatory statutes, and that's what we meant in our brief, that when there are doubts, those doubts should be resolved in favor of remand."
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2565.68,2568.013,"Well, what does that mean--"
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2586.253,2593.96,"No, Justice Ginsburg, but there are different types of cases in which this could be resolved."
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2635.648,2652.567,"Well, I don't understand what you're answering me, because I thought from your brief you say that when the question is tough, accordingly where the subject matter jurisdiction question is difficult, the Federal judiciary already has devised a simple but effective means of resolving the issue, remand."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2671.899,2676.203,The Fifth Circuit deferred to the district judge to make that decision in the first instance.
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2676.203,2677.843,Instructed her to make it.
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2682.498,2684.968,But they could have decided at the Fifth Circuit.
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2689.63,2706.103,"Well, what you just argued is that the district judge should have resolved the doubts in favor of no jurisdiction and just remanded without any decision, saying it's a tough question, a tough question, we're going to remand."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2706.103,2708.984,Doubt should be resolved in favor of remand.
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2708.984,2710.825,Is that what that means?
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2720.441,2721.112,That's not what it means.
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2722.382,2724.135,"Well, let's take this question."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2732.94,2733.979,She should have remanded.
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2733.979,2735.792,After deciding what?
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2735.792,2739.655,"After deciding subject matter jurisdiction, because--"
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2739.655,2741.956,Grappling with each one of those three complicated--
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2741.956,2751.591,"--Complicated issues, and arbitration where there was no arbitration agreement, and the very first filing by Ruhrgas was that there was no such agreement."
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2751.591,2756.185,"--Well, you're saying it's all that easy, but certainly the Fifth Circuit didn't treat it that way."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2756.185,2759.207,The Fifth Circuit dissenters didn't treat it that way.
1998.98-470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2759.798,2771.716,"But no... the Fifth Circuit en banc wiped out the panel decision, which held there was no... if it had been all that easy, they should have let the panel decision stand, but they didn't."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2782.221,2784.743,They sent it back to the district court for resolution.
1998.98-470,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2792.63,2800.435,"Mr. Hutchinson, to me, at least, your position is a little stronger when you confine it to the removal situation."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2835.277,2838.95,"No, not precisely that point, Justice Souter."
1998.98-470,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2842.732,2851.23,"You're just saying in a close case in which courts could reasonably go either way, it's better to let the State court have the first chance if that's possible."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2851.23,2852.148,--Yes.
1998.98-470,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2852.439,2854.34,So that's essentially a dignitary kind of argument.
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2854.34,2856.26,"It is in part, but--"
1998.98-470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2856.26,2866.127,Is there any sense among the practicing bar in Texas that the State courts are more likely to find personal jurisdiction than the Federal courts are?
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2866.127,2867.947,"--No, but the burden of proof is different."
1998.98-470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2867.947,2870.149,What is the difference?
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2870.149,2889.744,"The burden of proof is, under the Kawasaki case in the Texas supreme court, the burden of proof is on the defendant to disprove every ground of personal jurisdiction, whereas the burden of proof applied in Federal court is, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, so that's one difference."
1998.98-470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2889.744,2891.402,"Well, that seems odd for some reason."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2938.954,2961.268,"Justice Ginsburg, what I think the point here in this particular case is that the issues of due process are intertwined with State law and with the factual situation, because one of the issues in the due process argument was, under the Texas long arm statute was, was there a tort in Texas?"
1998.98-470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2973.896,2976.247,"--I think you've answered the question, Mr. Hutchinson."
1998.98-470,1,19247,clifton_t_hutchinson,,2976.648,2977.699,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2977.699,2978.871,"Mr. Wright, you have 10 minutes remaining."
1998.98-470,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2978.871,2982.913,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-470,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3180.964,3201.167,"Do you acknowledge, Mr. Wright, that there's a stronger case for what Mr. Hutchinson proposes in the removal situation, or does it really come down to the same thing anyway, just a Federal court acting beyond its... allegedly acting beyond its subject matter jurisdiction?"
1998.98-470,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3201.167,3203.408,Well... excuse me.
1998.98-470,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3280.01,3281.71,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
