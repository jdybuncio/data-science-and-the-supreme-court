1997.96-643,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.53,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-643, Steel Company, also known as Chicago Steel and Pickling Company, v. Citizens for a Better Environment."
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,13.28,16.303,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.96-643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,73.53,77.612,"Let me ask you a question, please, if I may, Mr. Stein."
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,107.082,118.07,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, under our reading of the statute the EPA's enforcement policy comes under section 325 of the statute, a wholly different section than section 326, the citizen provision."
1997.96-643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.07,142.726,"Well, the citizen's suit provision I suppose is designed to be a sort of private attorneys general approach, and to let citizens pick up the slack if the EPA doesn't do it, and is there any reason why the citizens suit shouldn't have the same authority, then, to come in and seek a penalty for the failure to file on time?"
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,142.726,143.508,Yes.
1997.96-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,237.762,247.909,What about the attorneys fees and costs that the claimant might have incurred in investigating the claim and filing it?
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,247.909,254.584,"Justice Kennedy, the costs that they incur investigating are also costs that they cannot recover if the EPA comes in under the... under EPCRA."
1997.96-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.567,266.533,"They can recover those costs if the violation is not cured after 60 days and the suit proceeds and they prevail, can they--"
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,266.533,269.855,"--If they prevail, then they can assert a likelihood for fees--"
1997.96-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,269.855,272.526,"--Well, but then it seems to me there may be a... you have a statutory argument."
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,274.459,279.955,--I think the Court has ruled that penalties alone have to... do not give a party standing.
1997.96-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,288.292,290.354,And what is the proposition... what is a case for that?
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,290.354,291.782,Diamond v. Charles.
1997.96-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,293.305,297.836,That was just whether or not there was an interest in being a prevailing party per se.
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,310.084,311.286,I think there was language.
1997.96-643,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,317.022,317.843,"Well, then it's not an Article III question."
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,319.015,336.787,"--We believe the statutory question here is far more important than... and... than the Court could rule completely under the statute, because under the plain language of that... it is the completion and submission of the forms, the failure of that action, that gives rise to a citizen action, and that's what United Musical found, that's what the district court found."
1997.96-643,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,337.068,360.822,"So on your view, then, if the compliance came after the 60-day period, let's say the time sequence is 60-day period runs, suit is filed on day 70, the defendant comes into total compliance, files all the back forms, the suit would be moot at that point, if I follow your reasoning."
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,360.822,371.129,"--Justice Ginsburg, at that point, mootness principles would apply and the burden would shift to the defendant to show why mootness would apply and why there would be no likelihood of a recurring violation such as to relieve the court of its jurisdiction."
1997.96-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.781,395.734,You're asking us to read the provision in such a way that nobody would have an incentive to file suit.
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,411.355,411.775,Not necess--
1997.96-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.775,412.977,Why would anybody file a suit?
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,413.999,416.483,"--Well, first of all, I think they may file for any number of reasons."
1997.96-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.336,456.38,"Why shouldn't we say that... I guess we don't have to decide that issue in this case, but why couldn't the situation be that so long as you have not filed before... after the 60-day period and before suit is filed against you, you are liable for the penalty that's set forth in the civil provision."
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,459.342,466.227,"--If you're filed before the suit was... before the suit was filed, but after the 60 days, I believe standing would not lie."
1997.96-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.227,487.912,"If you file after suit, and after the 60 days, if you come into compliance with the law after the suit is filed and after the 60-day period, why isn't it reasonable to say that the Federal Government intended to give these private attorney generals the right to the penalties accruing?"
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,487.912,492.053,"At that point the court would have jurisdiction, Justice Scalia, and the court could apply and determine--"
1997.96-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.053,493.335,You say it's mooted as soon as--
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,493.335,493.796,--Not necessarily.
1997.96-643,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.415,507.198,"--The penalty alone cannot suffice to sustain a suit, the right to the penalty alone."
1997.96-643,0,42142,sanford_m_stein,,507.198,511.45,"--After... after filing, if the party did not cure within 60 days--"
1997.96-643,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1493.989,1501.596,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-643,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.478,1538.328,"I have three statutes that use the word, occur."
1997.96-643,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1549.067,1552.42,"--The venue provision uses the word occur, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-643,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2639.204,2650.083,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-643,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2659.93,2663.652,Do you also take the position in the case of suits against the Administrator?
1997.96-643,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2675.59,2680.055,"They could not recover civil penalties for sure, against the Administrator."
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3216.225,3227.342,"Relative to the term under, the term under appears 27 times in section 326, the citizen provision of EPCRA."
1997.96-643,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3236.699,3244.925,"But isn't it equally reasonable to think that it refers to in compliance with the provisions of, rather than just the statute by name?"
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3244.925,3251.039,"Mr. Chief Justice, Ardonesti v. INS says that the term under should be taken from the context of the statute, and the--"
1997.96-643,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3251.039,3253.242,I don't think we need that case to tell us that.
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3254.302,3255.563,"--Well, in any event--"
1997.96-643,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3255.563,3256.605,--what was the name of that case--
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3256.605,3268.263,"--in the context of this statute, though, I think in the context of the history surrounding the statute, and the context of the way this Court has analyzed citizen suit provisions as being forward-looking, under simply is a relation back."
1997.96-643,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3298.307,3311.715,"--So you think if you filed a statement of emissions that was entirely wrong, all the elements and all the quantities are wrong, you'd... suit would not lie?"
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3311.715,3312.446,"--No, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-643,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3312.687,3313.915,It would have been filed under that provision.
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3313.915,3314.866,--The... but it's also--
1997.96-643,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3314.866,3316.376,"It's just not in compliance with it, that's all."
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3316.376,3316.576,--No.
1997.96-643,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3322.373,3322.603,It's completed.
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3326.867,3331.46,--But we think Congress would not give such an obviously glaring omission in a statute.
1997.96-643,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3338.027,3348.475,"But the language certainly is open, and if it's open, why wouldn't it make a lot of sense to say, in the instance where there's some reason to think they'll do it again, they did it before, maybe they'll do it again."
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3353.37,3365.497,"It would be inconsistent to apply... if we're talking about under, still, and the timeliness element, it would be inconsistent to apply the timely provisions of section 312 and 313, because Congress had readily available options which it used in other statutes."
1997.96-643,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3372.335,3374.136,"Of course, it could have used the language it did in all these other statutes, too."
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3381.05,3392.968,"--Well, by amending the Clean Air Act in 1970... 1990, to say that the... they can sue for a past violation in the event there is evidence of a repeated violation certainly doesn't amend EPCRA."
1997.96-643,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3417.004,3421.818,"A later Congress' amendment doesn't necessarily show what the earlier Congress meant, anyway."
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3422.229,3422.439,--No.
1997.96-643,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3422.439,3430.614,"--It's as reasonable to think the amendment was meant to change what preexisted as it is to think that it was meant to confirm what preexisted, isn't it?"
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3430.614,3435.829,But we don't think there's any likelihood that Congress would have done that without citing any of that in its legislative history of the Clean Air Act.
1997.96-643,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3435.829,3436.828,"Thank you, Mr. Stein."
1997.96-643,3,42142,sanford_m_stein,,3436.828,3437.411,Thank you.
1997.96-643,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3437.411,3438.561,The case is submitted.
