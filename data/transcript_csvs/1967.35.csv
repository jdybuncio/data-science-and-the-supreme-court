1967.35,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.69,"Number 35, Charles Katz, Petitioner versus United States."
1967.35,0,28090,harvey_a_schneider,,16.146,19.237,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.35,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,102.371,108.451,Was the warrant placed on -- was the warrant obtained on the information and obtained through bugging?
1967.35,0,28090,harvey_a_schneider,,108.451,110.028,"Yes, Your Honor, to a large extent --"
1967.35,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,110.028,112.321,Or analyze the wrong word when you say bugging or --
1967.35,0,28090,harvey_a_schneider,,112.321,113.271,"Sir I'm sorry, I didn't hear."
1967.35,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,113.271,113.914,What is it?
1967.35,0,28090,harvey_a_schneider,,116.664,118.287,"That's a good question, Your Honor."
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1798.949,1802.849,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1999.128,1999.602,I know.
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2022.899,2024.954,Well I don't --
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2024.954,2046.499,"Probably going into a glass telephone booth, I suppose can reasonably expect to be overseen that going into a glass telephone booth, assuming that it's reasonably soundproof which your -- says it is not."
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2057.596,2057.987,Well I --
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2057.987,2061.411,Let me put to you another situation.
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2106.531,2107.819,"No, I would not, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2107.819,2107.926,Why?
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2107.926,2109.945,I think that --
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2109.945,2112.049,Do you it's because of the place?
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2112.049,2112.6,That's correct.
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2116.23,2118.717,What's that got to do with anything?
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2118.717,2119.456,Well --
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2119.456,2130.083,"Well the Holmes' quotation, when you've take in context seems to me the reasonable any other man in an open view in an open field."
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2133.79,2133.864,That's correct.
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2133.864,2138.488,-- they could reasonably expect that they wouldn't be overseen.
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2161.181,2173.351,"But it seems to me, Mr. Justice Fortas, that the difference between whether or not they feel that they're being overheard or that somebody is observing them from afar with binoculars is no difference."
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2173.351,2178.879,It maybe that two people meet to pass stolen goods.
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2184.27,2188.121,You mean privacy is restricted to the booth wall?
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2188.121,2197.025,"Not to the booth wall, certainly not to the booth wall, but it is restricted to some area in which there is a private interest."
1967.35,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2395.777,2400.358,What are the requirements for activating it?
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2400.358,2402.919,"Your Honor, it's just not clear in the record."
1967.35,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2409.457,2411.425,I see.
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2411.425,2413.43,So they waited until he was coming.
1967.35,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.579,2465.947,What difference does it make into your argument that it didn't all scare -- you say that this is a constitutionally protected area.
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2467.106,2468.284,"That is correct, Mr. Justice White."
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2501.449,2504.164,"Well, I know, but is that a legal principle?"
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2506.886,2508.8,"Well, that is one of our arguments, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2508.8,2517.283,What kind of protection can we -- within our jurisdiction what kind of protection can we concur out of them.
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2523.249,2526.706,"Well, it is our argument Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2528.591,2528.782,I know that.
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2528.782,2533.185,The Fourth Amendment does not set down any hard and fast rules.
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2536.153,2541.422,I'm trying to get that following to Mr. Justice White's question.
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2555.804,2559.429,"Well, Mr. Justice Fortas, this is based upon our alternative argument."
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2587.498,2599.86,"Suppose it's unreasonable as to everybody else would use the phone booth, Mrs.Jones comes in and telephones a daughter, anybody else in this phonebook."
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2605.184,2605.498,Well I do --
1967.35,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2605.498,2607.915,The first argument is correct.
1967.35,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2607.915,2612.569,I think that The Fourth Amendment has directed a conduct of law enforcement officers.
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,4600.572,4604.345,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4679.731,4682.384,What do you mean by proper control?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,4682.384,4697.851,"Well, as I understand Berger they said that the proper control was discrimination as to what you are looking for, the time that you're going to look for it, who is going to be involved, and what specific subject matter you are looking for."
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4697.851,4720.315,You construed it and as authorizing telephonic eavesdropping if there's a statement made to the officer just showing you and what they want to do as to tell that's eavesdrop this man over the telephone in order to see if he's been guilty of a crime if they do it in the narrow manner.
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,4720.315,4725.703,I can -- that is exactly right assuming that Section 605 of Title 48 --
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4725.703,4729.462,So then it wouldn't bar telephonic eavesdropping.
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,4729.462,4746.256,"In the absence of the statute which does bar a telephonic eavesdropping, I would say that the Fourth Amendment and the Berger case as it construed it does not prohibit reasonably but extremely discriminate searches of that type."
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4747.535,4751.473,You don't mean to divide it up into different crime.
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,4754.573,4754.924,No that --
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4754.924,4761.487,You can say you can eavesdrop if it relates to national security.
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,4765.212,4770.209,I think that that has to be a matter assuming that I'm correct in this Court.
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4955.483,4958.042,Do you think that would have invalid under the Berger case?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,4958.042,4959.699,I think that that but there's no question they might at that way.
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4959.699,4962.286,"Otherwise, they didn't have the right."
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,4962.286,4962.92,Yes.
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4963.182,4980.049,-- that the Constitution to come in and get a search warrant on the basis of the facts that they knew he was followed and have probably cause to believe he had been guilty of using those wires to violate the law in reference to gambling.
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,4980.049,4981.475,Yes.
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4981.475,4985.031,And that that's what justify search warrant.
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,4985.031,4985.455,Correct.
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4985.455,4987.914,The Court could not been out on any ground?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,4987.914,4992.134,That is my opinion for that -- that's exactly what the Berger case says.
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4999.056,5000.515,"Well, that would be all right."
1967.35,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5000.515,5008.924,"Well, I understood Mr. Schneider to say that he thought there was not a probable cause but that the Government did."
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5008.924,5013.899,"For an arrest, at the time that they bug the phone booth."
1967.35,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5013.899,5018.907,"Well, that wasn't probable cause for an arrest but was it a probable cause for?"
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5018.907,5027.935,Probably cause for the issuance of a search warrant to obtain mere evidence which this Court has held as permissible under a search warrant.
1967.35,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5057.963,5071.552,Did they have positive information that he was using -- he was going into that telephone booth to carry on his business of wagering.
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5071.552,5083.964,"They had a confidential informant that they stated and informed them that he was making bets when we went into the telephone booth, and that he was wagering for others, and then placing bets for others."
1967.35,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5119.105,5125.486,"Do you think that under Berger, that would have entitled them to a search warrant --"
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5125.486,5125.71,Yes.
1967.35,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5125.71,5128.507,-- of this character to permit them to do what they did here?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5128.507,5147.086,"Absolutely, but it would have to be very discriminate as -- as I say the other bit of information they had was, Katz's constant and consistent daily activity of going into this particular booth at a particular time."
1967.35,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5147.086,5153.485,Conceding would you mind to talk as just what is left with your case?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5153.485,5154.183,Conceding --
1967.35,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5157.461,5159.492,Isn't that your own case?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5159.492,5160.984,"No, that is not the whole case."
1967.35,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5183.328,5188.249,"With the warrant they could have invaded that area, do you think?"
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5188.249,5189.988,If it was reasonable.
1967.35,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5189.988,5190.446,"Right, invasion --"
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5190.446,5190.899,Right.
1967.35,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5190.899,5196.319,"-- correct, so your case does rest on the fact that there is no warrant?"
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5196.319,5205.11,"Well, I would say this; I enforce the conclusion from Berger that this is a search warrant case without question."
1967.35,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5205.11,5210.522,"Would -- is this area, would you apply the same line of reasoning to the binoculars?"
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5210.522,5215.298,"No, but the difference between binoculars and hearings I think is a very simple thing."
1967.35,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5246.189,5250.607,Are there infrared devices now that could go through brick walls and see what's inside?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5250.607,5279.15,"Right, if they're going to resort to fluoroscopy to get to what somebody is doing inside, then I would say that our test as far as invasion of privacy would apply equally well where the person has intended not to be seen, and could be reasonably seen that under no circumstances except by the use of other devices unknown to the person could the police have gotten there and that might --"
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5279.15,5284.467,How come there are very few people that intend to commit a crime who expect to be seen?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5284.467,5290.62,That's right but they're -- they unfortunately there have been such as in the Hester case.
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5428.455,5429.491,With our without that evidence?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5429.491,5430.246,Pardon me?
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5430.246,5433.165,With or without that evidence?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5433.165,5435.481,That they secured from his lips?
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5435.481,5436.742,Yes.
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5436.742,5444.935,"Well, they convicted him without the subsequent testimony which was before the grand jury."
1967.35,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5576.11,5580.622,"Well, do we have to overrule Reina to do that?"
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5580.622,5600.229,"Well, Reina was a different situation because Mr. Reina could have said being in jail, “I don't want to testify,” and there was no compulsion whatsoever that the Court could give him to force him to testify because it's all the Court could say is go to jail and he could say, I'm in jail."
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5734.688,5737.353,What are they usually involved?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5737.353,5738.953,To compute the line --
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5738.953,5739.869,To what?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5739.869,5741.833,"To get the line, the daily line."
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5741.833,5743.503,Why do you write them there?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5743.503,5752.385,"Well, he, Mr. Katz maybe off the record a little bit that he's one of the best handicappers in the country."
1967.35,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5752.385,5753.036,He's what?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5753.036,5756.994,One of the best handicappers in the country on basketball games.
1967.35,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5776.262,5778.961,Haven't they even given the background of him?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5778.961,5790.543,"As a matter of fact, what we have to do is to go out and have the evidence once it was submitted, go in and get his photo so that he could get copies of what he's (Voice Overlap)."
1967.35,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5790.543,5794.398,Go on in business?
1967.35,2,17862,burton_marks,,5794.398,5812.383,"Finally, I might say this and this is a test that I think the Court can take it's own judicial notice if we took the test and of course again, it's outside of the record but the Attorney General, that's the Solicitor General submitted it somewhat on his own that you can overhear a conversation from an adjoining phone booth."
