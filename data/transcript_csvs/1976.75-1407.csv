1976.75-1407,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,58.75,"We will hear arguments next in number 1407, Trainor against Hernandez."
1976.75-1407,0,29896,john_dienner_iii,,61.927,64.935,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,307.748,313.022,"Mr. Dienner, your question is presented to your jurisdictional statement, did you raise any question about the class?"
1976.75-1407,0,29896,john_dienner_iii,,313.022,319.569,"We did mention in our briefs, both our original briefs and our reply brief, the defect --"
1976.75-1407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,319.569,323.665,"While it was presented in the jurisdictional statement, did you raise these questions?"
1976.75-1407,0,29896,john_dienner_iii,,324.34,328.587,I don’t believe that the defect of the class was mentioned in the jurisdictional statement.
1976.75-1407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.584,553.728,Mr. Dienner.
1976.75-1407,0,29896,john_dienner_iii,,553.728,554.811,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,554.811,566.418,"Are the Sheriffs of every county in Illinois and District division, the Sheriff of Cook County bound by this decree of the District Court or are you just suggesting they will probably obey it as a precedent?"
1976.75-1407,0,29896,john_dienner_iii,,566.418,578.828,Defendant classes were certified Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Sheriff Richard J. Elrod of Cook County was a class representative on behalf of all similarly situated sheriffs throughout the State.
1976.75-1407,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,583.932,594.335,"If you look at page 82 in the appendix of the jurisdictional statement, it clearly appears that the three-judge District Court thought it was at least ordering the sheriff to be in every county in Illinois."
1976.75-1407,0,29896,john_dienner_iii,,594.335,596.491,They certainly had that expectation.
1976.75-1407,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,596.491,598.148,Every court could.
1976.75-1407,0,29896,john_dienner_iii,,598.148,606.614,That amounts as I said to over 200 state officials who’ve been enjoined as a result.
1976.75-1407,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,663.163,664.486,Mr. Bargiel.
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,664.486,667.879,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-1407,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,736.382,741.127,Where the State or state agent is the plaintiff in the State Court.
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,741.127,742.271,That is correct Your Honor and where --
1976.75-1407,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,742.271,743.67,And the like here proposed--
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,743.67,745.486,That is correct.
1976.75-1407,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,750.437,754.183,You got any better reason for remedy to do that?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,755.851,786.023,"No, not that they just happen to be the facts in this case but where the state is bringing the cause of action and they’re doing so in support of a valid and legitimate state purpose, it seems to me that the principles which underlying comity and federalism are obviously more appropriate than where the plaintiff in a lower court action, a private citizen bringing an action against another private citizen and I think that is a first statement of some of the decisions of this Court in recent times."
1976.75-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1105.281,1107.012,"That didn’t happen in this case, did it?"
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1107.012,1109.46,"Well, in this particular case, no, Your Honor."
1976.75-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1119.293,1124.013,But this goes with your argument that the statute is not unconstitutional in every letter–
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1124.013,1124.606,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.75-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.606,1126.33,It maybe one or two parts of their testimony.
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1126.33,1139.346,"Well, what I'm suggesting with regard to the question of abstention that is at the very least one easy example of how the statute might be constitutionally applied."
1976.75-1407,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.119,1168.758,"Don’t you get some suggestion from the District Court’s opinion however, and isn’t it also too generally of this state distinctions between contract attachments and tort attachments that the reason for requiring a hearing in a tort attachment is to fix the probable amount of recovery based on a contract claim like you really don’t have that."
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1168.758,1170.43,I frankly don’t get that impression.
1976.75-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.3,1219.495,How could they construe it in this case?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1219.495,1219.943,Pardon?
1976.75-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.943,1221.241,How could they construe it in this case?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1222.687,1225.952,Well I don’t say that they could.
1976.75-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.952,1230.353,"So, the Federal Court should abstain until somebody else files some other lawsuit raising this issue?"
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1230.353,1230.642,No.
1976.75-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1230.642,1232.474,"This procedure is very seldom used, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1232.474,1233.563,No.
1976.75-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1265.869,1269.972,"Well, you just said it was patently and flagrantly violative of the constitution, they didn’t find that?"
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1269.972,1275.113,"Well, they said it was unconstitutional on its face and it appears to me that there are some questions to whether or not--"
1976.75-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1275.113,1279.231,They also used the words patently and flagrantly on page B5 of the jurisdiction statement.
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1279.231,1279.896,"Well, that’s true too."
1976.75-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.091,1283.543,Yes.
1976.75-1407,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1283.543,1289.005,That they have taken about two or three pages to analyze decisions of this Court to make up their mind.
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1289.005,1290.249,"Well, I will consider."
1976.75-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.379,1292.615,"They may be wrong but at least they said it, that is all I'm saying."
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1292.615,1294.315,Okay.
1976.75-1407,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1357.548,1367.614,"So, is your point that they’re quite apart from the Younger against Harris or anything else just is a matter of the issuance of an injunction that there was an adequate remedy of law?"
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1370.029,1372.887,I would certainly take the position that they had a remedy available to them.
1976.75-1407,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1377.56,1388.552,"It's quite apart from dual jurisdictions or federalism or anything else like the chancery should not ever issue an injunction under ordinarily equitable principles, if there is an adequate remedy of law."
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1388.552,1389.99,"Well, I--yes sir."
1976.75-1407,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1393.192,1395.269,I'm asking you what you are saying that whether?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1395.269,1396.267,"Oh, I --"
1976.75-1407,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1396.267,1398.562,Is that your point?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1398.562,1417.062,"Well, my point is that Younger and Huffman versus Pursue reflect the idea that in my reading is an indispensable prerequisite to obtaining relief in a Federal Court by way of an injunction plan."
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.425,1473.605,Can you give me a citation or some rule or --
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1473.605,1474.08,"Well,--"
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.08,1481.264,--some statutory provision that contemplates this kind of motion?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1481.264,1493.507,"On page 43 of the appendix, section 26 of the Illinois Attachment Act, indicates that provisions to the Civil Practice Act in the--"
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1493.507,1494.836,43?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1494.836,1495.787,"Page 43, Your Honor."
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.016,1497.283,And it’s at what paragraph?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1497.283,1500.583,"Section 26, I'm sorry."
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1509.73,1511.713,"Now, where do we go from there?"
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1511.713,1521.598,"Well, it says including the provisions for appeal in all existing and future Amendments in the rules now and hereafter adapted shall apply to all the proceedings here under except as otherwise provided."
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1526.655,1527.711,What page is that?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1527.711,1531.243,"Well, I'm sorry that is not in the appendix."
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1533.015,1534.75,"That all, just give me the citations."
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1535.488,1538.636,Section 70 of the Illinois Civil Practice Act.
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.636,1544.482,And what does that -- what does that permit a person to do?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1544.482,1548.693,"It says, the Section 70 motion, is a motion to quash."
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.148,1587.147,"Yes, but not the end -- just contesting his right to an attachment or the facts underlying the basic--"
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1587.147,1593.613,"I think he could -- well, no I'm saying I don’t think he could’ve raised anything in that writ, that’s my position."
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.781,1597.099,Could you think of cases for that?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1597.099,1597.512,"No, I think--"
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.512,1607.842,"In cases, we got some Illinois cases illustrating a fellow whose bank accounts has been attached coming in and putting the credits."
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1607.842,1609.738,"No, I don’t have an Illinois case to site to you now, Your Honor."
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1631.018,1633.437,On what ground?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1633.437,1634.79,"Well, for a variety of reasons."
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.907,1645.882,"On the motion like that, will the Court listen to an argument for that as a note?"
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1645.882,1650.594,"Yeah, I think that that’s such a matter that could be raised."
1976.75-1407,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.594,1652.186,You don’t have any Illinois authority for that?
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1652.186,1654.104,I do not have a case to site to you now.
1976.75-1407,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.28,1659.395,"Unless we have it, what do you think?"
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1659.395,1666.43,"Yes, at this particular point that that is true."
1976.75-1407,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1716.783,1719.64,You have some rebuttal that’s the signal for your rebuttal.
1976.75-1407,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1719.64,1723.176,"Oh, I see the white light was on."
1976.75-1407,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1745.666,1748.602,Very well.
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1754.686,1760.16,"Mr. Justice Burger, may it please the Court."
1976.75-1407,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.75,1826.71,You’re not saying that Elrod was not himself an appellant.
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1830.665,1832.648,"Under the rules of this Court, he is not an appellant."
1976.75-1407,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1837.882,1847.383,"But the jurisdictional statement on the face at least in that lists Elrod as an appellant, doesn’t it?"
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1847.383,1847.937,Yes.
1976.75-1407,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.623,1864.024,And Trainor was the only name of the appellant on the docket?
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1864.024,1866.631,Trainor and O’Malley.
1976.75-1407,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1866.631,1868.404,Doesn’t our Rule 10 cover it?
1976.75-1407,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1870.078,1871.102,Require it.
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1871.102,1878.648,"10-1 states, I believe it’s 10-1, states that “all parties in the proceeding below shall be parties in this Supreme Court.”"
1976.75-1407,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1879.384,1885.269,But it also permits them to adopt the co-appellants’ position and I thought they’ve done that here.
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1885.269,1885.875,Precisely.
1976.75-1407,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1907.943,1915.516,"Well, you are not suggesting that we say that the District Court should have abstained in the case brought against Elrod?"
1976.75-1407,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1922.64,1925.14,"But you are suggesting of it, aren’t you?"
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1925.14,1925.486,Yes.
1976.75-1407,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1949.115,1951.702,What was their class -- were they members of a class?
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1951.702,1952.523,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1976.75-1407,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.523,1955.358,And are they class representatives here?
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1955.358,1957.008,They are representatives of the class.
1976.75-1407,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.008,1967.701,"Well and so if it were held that the Court should have abstained, the injunction against the entire class would be set aside."
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1968.774,1970.1,I don’t believe that the Court could even--
1976.75-1407,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.1,1972.744,"Oh, you’re the one who wanted the class, aren’t you?"
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1972.744,1973.734,We asked for the class and --
1976.75-1407,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.734,1976.936,"Then, you don’t like it then?"
1976.75-1407,2,24249,fred_l_lieb,,1976.936,1977.508,"No, Your Honor."
1976.75-1407,3,29896,john_dienner_iii,,3756.549,3760.291,"Yes, if it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.75-1407,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3847.35,3858.867,"I think, they should have the appellee, -- the other people on your side should have filed the brief as appellants."
1976.75-1407,3,29896,john_dienner_iii,,3858.867,3860.21,We filed a brief.
