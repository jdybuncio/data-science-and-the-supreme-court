1998.97-7541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.726,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-7541, Amanda Mitchell v. the United States."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,48.363,50.924,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-7541,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,82.846,92.553,Are there cases that tell us what the authority and discretion of the trial court is in inquiring as to the basis for the... the factual basis for the plea?
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,103.591,132.6,"The trial judge has discretion to make certain that there's a foundation for the guilty plea, and certainly the trial judge can say to the defendant, I'm not going to take your plea unless you tell me everything, but then the trial judge has the opportunity to say, I'm not going to take your plea, and the defendant would also be given the opportunity to say, judge, I'm willing to tell you enough that admits to the essential elements of this offense, but I'm not getting into any sentencing factors."
1998.97-7541,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,132.6,148.15,"I'm surprised you can say... suppose you have three police officers, uncontradicted testimony, overwhelming proof of the guilt, and they testified, and the criminal defendant says, based on what you've heard I plead guilty."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,155.056,159.911,I think the judge has a... I'm not sure the cases say that he can't accept the plea.
1998.97-7541,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,168.126,169.916,"--But once he does that, doesn't his discretion end?"
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,169.916,173.299,"--Yes, it does, and I think under--"
1998.97-7541,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,173.299,176.881,"Because if it does, it seems to me to make your case easier, although I haven't seen cases on this."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,176.881,179.142,"--I haven't seen cases on that, but think Libretti--"
1998.97-7541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,179.142,185.135,In a plea colloquy you're typically told you're waiving a privilege against self-incrimination.
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,185.135,187.439,--Typically that's true.
1998.97-7541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.439,190.942,"In this case, Judge Cahn told the defendant that, I think."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,190.942,215.698,"Well, Your Honor, actually what Judge Cahn said... and I refer to page 45 of the joint appendix toward the top... Judge Cahn said, you have the right at trial to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment or at your option you can take the stand and tell the jury your side of the controversy, so Judge Cahn specifically limited the waiver of the Fifth Amendment to the right at trial."
1998.97-7541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,215.698,223.852,"Well, you know, I don't know that one would parse it quite that strictly, but I... that's a permissible point of view, certainly."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,223.852,232.797,"But even beyond that, I still believe that the cases point to the fact that one does have a Fifth Amendment right at sentencing."
1998.97-7541,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,234.8,238.08,"May I... I'm sorry, I want to go back to the plea colloquy before we get to the sentence."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,258.373,262.016,"Yes, there would be a difference in that way."
1998.97-7541,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,262.016,262.647,What is it?
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,262.647,283.391,In a plea colloquy the defendant is really giving his or her admission to the essential elements of the offense so that a legal conclusion can be drawn right at that time to the effect that individual is guilty.
1998.97-7541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.194,288.624,"Well now, just a minute."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,303.453,304.375,"--Precisely, and--"
1998.97-7541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.375,309.377,And presumably the judge could have asked about the quantity of drugs.
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,309.377,323.609,"--Well, this Court in Libretti made clear that forfeiture is a sentencing issue, and therefore need not be part of the factual understanding, the factual statement under Rule 11."
1998.97-7541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,323.609,328.962,What was the statute under which the petitioner was charged here?
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,328.962,333.304,"This was a drug statute, 8... it was the conspiracy statute."
1998.97-7541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,341.72,346.492,And you conceive that the quantity of the drugs is not an element of the offense here.
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,346.492,347.772,"Absolutely, it is not an element of the offense."
1998.97-7541,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,347.772,354.768,"And would it be an abuse of discretion for the judge to say, I'm not going to take the guilty plea if I have to go through all this thing on sentencing."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,356.801,363.396,I would be willing to give a judge that discretion.
1998.97-7541,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,374.813,379.796,"Well then, the privilege you're talking about is not as important as I thought it was from your brief."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,379.796,386.32,"--Well, I... perhaps I've conceded too much, Justice Kennedy, but at any rate--"
1998.97-7541,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,386.32,388.1,But then you're just making it a later--
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,398.638,398.809,--No.
1998.97-7541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.809,401.513,You're just saying he may not enter the plea unless you--
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,401.513,401.981,Right.
1998.97-7541,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,408.386,439.787,"--Well, are you taking the... going back to the question that I started with or, it seems to me what you're saying is that the essential difference between the waiver and when the individual stands up at the Boykin hearing and the waiver when the individual takes the stand is that the only waiver that's being given in the Boykin hearing is the waiver that in fact is made with each individual representation of fact by the defendant for purposes of entering the plea, and that's as far as the waiver goes."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,439.787,442.009,"That's as... exactly, that's as far as the waiver goes, and--"
1998.97-7541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.009,454.628,And you're saying that the judge can condition his acceptance of the plea upon the defendant's yielding a constitutional right that the judge has no power to demand that he yield.
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,470.747,472.109,"--Yes, precisely."
1998.97-7541,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.159,515.83,"Well, suppose... suppose the--"
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,515.99,523.046,--of that... of the rights that... for the... because they do not relate to the essential elements of the offense.
1998.97-7541,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,523.046,523.405,"--No, but they can."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,581.246,583.077,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1998.97-7541,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,585.166,590.52,"Then it would be a... I don't want to cut you off, but you then say, it would be an abuse of discretion for him--"
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,590.52,590.89,--Yes.
1998.97-7541,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,591.21,593.483,--to refuse to accept the plea under those circumstances?
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,593.483,596.854,--I would say it would be an abuse of discretion in that sense.
1998.97-7541,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,607.546,623.076,"Well, but he's got to understand the consequences to which he is legitimately open by virtue of his conduct, and that involves an appreciation not only of theoretical legal consequences but of the actual conduct, too, so that's the justification for the judge's inquiry."
1998.97-7541,0,41794,steven_a_morley,,623.076,636.644,"--Except the judge can achieve that, as Judge Cahn did in this case, by engaging in a colloquy that lays out, you've reserved for sentencing the drug quantity analysis which will drive your sentence."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1800.45,1805.144,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-7541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1841.236,1847.37,"Could the court at sentencing say, I'm calling the defendant to the stand, and then just examine the defendant?"
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1847.37,1852.125,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, under the principle--"
1998.97-7541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1852.125,1852.585,I think you'd have to say that.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1852.585,1867.895,--I think that under the waiver analysis of a guilty plea the judge could do that at least as to the events that underlie the very count of conviction to which the defendant has admitted guilt.
1998.97-7541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1868.706,1874.55,"I take it that... and this is just to explore the separate proceeding, stand-alone proceeding effort."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1885.617,1887.409,--That's the majority rule.
1998.97-7541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1889.361,1900.759,And I take it what the petitioner is doing here is to say that same sort of analogy applies between the plea stage Rule 11 proceeding and the sentencing.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1900.759,1901.17,--That's right.
1998.97-7541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1914.426,1930.108,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, here we have a special circumstance, because in addition to the guilty plea this defendant expressly reserved the right to contest the amount of cocaine that she was responsible for."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1930.108,1931.861,She did.
1998.97-7541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1932.251,1937.788,"And the judge said, fine, I'll take your plea, and that's the deal we're going to make."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1937.788,1940.148,"--That's true, but that's not--"
1998.97-7541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1940.148,1948.724,"Does that change the situation, then, on the waiver, because there was an express reservation that the judge apparently went along with."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1948.724,1950.724,"--No, I don't think that it changes it, Justice O'Connor."
1998.97-7541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1964.412,1967.514,"The question is not whether she reserved it, but whether she waived it."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1967.514,1974.931,"Well, our position is that she inherently waives it when she stands before the court and says, I am guilty of this charged offense."
1998.97-7541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.225,1982.304,That's all she admitted.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1990.15,1991.339,She did not.
1998.97-7541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.339,1994.121,So why must she admit it now?
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2061.498,2067.382,"They are not exactly parallel, Justice Scalia, and I'm not suggesting to the Court that they are exactly parallel."
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.646,2172.619,"Oh, he can't realistically, but legally he has the right to say to the judge, the reason I'm not going to tell you more is, it may incriminate me in another offense."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2173.801,2175.241,"--Well, I think that--"
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.241,2175.702,Could he not?
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2175.702,2179.415,"--Yes, and the judge at that point could say, thank you, but the rule 11 colloquy is over."
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.415,2179.795,I'm going to take... accept your plea.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2179.795,2180.275,That's right.
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2180.275,2180.646,That's right.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2180.646,2187.792,"And that's why our position is, it's the entry and acceptance of the plea that effectuates the waiver with respect to the conduct underlying the plea."
1998.97-7541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.024,2210.886,Wait.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2238.304,2253.185,"I think the question that the Court has to answer is, what are the necessary and inherent consequences of the guilty plea, and I think that in answering that question, the Court ought to look at the consequences of going with either petitioner's rule or with our rule."
1998.97-7541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.185,2256.876,"And that has nothing to do with the Rule 11 situation, it seems to me."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2276.542,2277.052,It is.
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2277.193,2277.673,--as I understand it.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2278.895,2288.352,"That's right, because it has the effect of prescribing to a rule that all the defendant has to do is come up and to say, bare bones, I'm going to say each element, yes, I agree to that."
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2290.014,2302.112,"May I ask in that connection, Mr.... either in this Rule 11 colloquy where the judge is very careful on page 45 to state the nature of the waiver... you give up your right at trial to remain silent."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2316.682,2318.024,"--I doubt it, Justice Stevens."
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2318.024,2318.041,"I do, too."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2318.041,2330.67,But the judge also doesn't explain to the defendant that upon entry of a final judgment of conviction you may be subpoenaed to testify at a grand jury with respect to all of the facts and details surrounding the offense to which you pleaded guilty.
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.67,2331.832,"No, but this is a routine sequence."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2342.971,2348.994,"It does not, because the purpose of the colloquy is to determine whether the defendant is pleading guilty voluntarily."
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.994,2352.615,"And knows what rights he's waiving, because that's why you have this paragraph in here."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2352.615,2357.099,"Well, he knows... he knows certain of the rights that he's waiving, and certain of the consequences of the plea--"
1998.97-7541,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2357.099,2363.584,"Well, suppose you have this sequence, Rule 11 hearing, guilty plea."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2389.09,2396.086,"--Justice Kennedy, we have not taken the position that the defendant can be required to testify in some other case."
1998.97-7541,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2398.516,2401.398,"Well, if there... if he has no Fifth Amendment right--"
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2401.398,2402.019,--Well--
1998.97-7541,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2402.019,2404.901,"--and if it's waived, what's the basis for his declining?"
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2404.901,2415.417,"--Well, the normal rule that has been evolving in the lower courts... this Court has never squarely addressed it... is that waivers of Fifth Amendment rights are specific to the case in which they're entered."
1998.97-7541,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2415.417,2420.332,"Ah, so now this is just a limited waiver we're talking about that's implied from your guilty plea."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2420.332,2437.272,"That's right, and I don't think that that's inconsistent with the rule that in your own criminal case, when you have come forward and stood before the court and said, I'm guilty, you've effectuated a full waiver of the conduct underlying that transaction in your own case."
1998.97-7541,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2469.834,2483.401,"But Mr. Dreeben, that's so far from this case, where she said, I don't... I do want to contest the amount of drugs, and the judge said, fine, we'll leave that over."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2530.852,2548.624,"--Justice Ginsburg, there is a potentially separate concern that I think your question goes to about adequacy of notice, and whether you were required to legally be given notice of every right that would be waived by your guilty plea before the waiver can be complete."
1998.97-7541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.925,2593.807,"Well, frankly, if I were the trial judge and I heard her say, I reserve the right to contest the amount of the drugs, I would have thought she intended to come up and testify at the sentencing proceeding and say, no, I only had, you know, the lesser amount of the drugs."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2598.942,2599.864,"Well, I think that that's right."
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.127,2629.165,"But as long as she reserved it, as long as... we're talking about something, a fact that she says is in dispute, and she... it's not an element of the crime, so it really doesn't have to do with the factual basis for the plea, and I take it it's also the case that in the later sentencing hearing what she said about this at the plea, since it didn't concern an element of the crime, is really beside the point."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2673.096,2675.506,"Well, I think that that is a sufficiently--"
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2675.506,2678.889,Is there any other... is there any other bad thing that would flow from accepting his view of the case?
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2678.889,2680.051,--I think there are really three.
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2711.181,2711.401,Right.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2721.926,2722.958,"Well, a defendant--"
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2722.958,2725.109,"I mean, the defendant might say, okay, forget it, I'll go to trial, but--"
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2725.109,2725.9,"--Well, if the defendant had the--"
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2725.9,2728.211,"--if the judge says please tell me, I mean, she's going to tell him."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2728.211,2735.246,"--Justice Breyer, if the defendant has a Fifth Amendment right, as petitioner contends, then the defendant will say, well, I don't have to tell you those kinds of details."
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2735.246,2738.048,"Fine, he says, and I don't have to accept your... I don't have to accept your guilty plea."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2738.048,2739.858,"Well, it's not clear to me on what basis he would have to reject it."
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2739.858,2744.192,"I don't have the adequate factual basis here under (f), 11(f) or whatever, 11... you know."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2779.014,2779.185,Yes.
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2808.875,2811.326,"And of course, as Justice Souter said, it's a very fine line."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2815.679,2816.468,"Well, that's right."
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2816.468,2824.445,"So the Government... you don't lose a lot if you don't... if you are not able to draw the negative inference, because you still have the affirmative evidence of amount on which you can still rely."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2824.445,2825.174,That's true.
1998.97-7541,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2829.839,2835.282,"Well, one senses that Judge Cahn actually wanted to raise an issue that would go up to the Third Circuit and perhaps here."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2835.672,2841.586,"I think, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that he perceived accurately that this would be a novel question of law."
1998.97-7541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2841.586,2850.301,"You had a third... you said, number 1, it distorts the societal expectations, number 2 it distorts the Rule 11 hearing, and number 3--"
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2850.301,2867.984,"It gives the defendant an incentive to conceal and minimize his own criminal conduct, so instead of the defendant coming into court and being willing to make a fair statement of what he actually did, you can envision a defendant thinking quite carefully with counsel about what to admit and what to attempt to get by."
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2867.984,2869.606,"--All right, you know... you may or may not know this."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2884.535,2884.765,No.
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2889.019,2889.169,All right.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2890.361,2900.146,"--Well, if this Court holds that there's a Fifth Amendment right with respect to sentencing facts that do not relate strictly to the elements of the offense in the closest way, I think a great many defendants may--"
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2900.146,2900.296,Why?
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2900.296,2900.897,--seek to exploit that.
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2900.897,2902.477,"You know, but the... exploit it."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2910.694,2910.924,Well--
1998.97-7541,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2910.924,2914.424,She wants to deny what the pre-sentence report's saying.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2917.178,2927.834,"--Well, simply because it will deprive the sentencing court and the Government of just that particular piece of evidence that may be relevant both to the crime and sentencing."
1998.97-7541,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2927.834,2946.327,"Yes, but why isn't the answer to that and the answer to the distortion of the Rule 11 argument that the judge simply has to make it clear at the time that the plea is taken that if the plea is accepted the right is being waived not only with respect to testimony at trial, which was the term he used here, I guess, but at sentencing?"
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2968.33,2979.307,"I don't have any objection, Justice Souter, to a judge accurately informing a defendant of more consequences of a guilty plea than are required by the current version of Rule 11."
1998.97-7541,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2979.307,2985.184,"Well, he's simply making explicit to a lay person what in fact is being done."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3010.749,3019.514,"Well, Justice Souter, that amendment of Rule 11, or the Rule 11 colloquy, is consistent with our position that that's the effect of the guilty plea."
1998.97-7541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3038.237,3053.325,"Well, but if we take the view that all the guilty plea does under a colloquy like this is deal with the elements of the crime, not something that's purely a sentencing factor, I can envision a statute where the quantity is an element."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3077.381,3078.112,--That is true--
1998.97-7541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3078.112,3079.602,"I mean, a prosecutor could do that."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3079.602,3087.86,"--That's true, Justice O'Connor, and a defendant could similarly say, I want to enter a plea of guilty, but I want the Government to agree that it will shoulder the load at sentencing."
1998.97-7541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3087.86,3088.02,Well--
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3090.351,3090.831,That's right.
1998.97-7541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3091.71,3092.021,End of story.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3092.021,3096.726,--a baseline from which parties can enter into plea agreements.
1998.97-7541,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3096.726,3098.135,Is it entirely consensual?
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3122.692,3151.412,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, the claim would be made... my response would be that a prosecutor can exert considerable pressure on a defendant to waive all sorts of constitutional rights in the course of a guilty plea, and to give up statutory rights as well, and there's nothing inherently unconstitutional in a procedure in which there is that kind of give-and-take, so I don't think that affirming the view that petitioner has put forward would preclude the Government from trying to vary it by contract."
1998.97-7541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3186.686,3192.198,A prosecutor can agree that a certain witness will not appear before a Federal judge?
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3192.198,3193.47,Justice Scalia--
1998.97-7541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3193.47,3199.054,"A prosecutor can sort of arrange the witness list for a Federal court, then?"
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3199.054,3205.378,"--He can certainly agree that he is not going to call witnesses, or put on certain evidence."
1998.97-7541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3205.378,3209.579,"If I were the judge, I would call that witness myself, the witness most knowledgeable."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3218.116,3236.168,"You can't, but it could be written into the plea agreement that if the court doesn't accept that plea agreement term, it will reject the plea agreement, and at which point the defendant has the option of withdrawing the guilty plea and can go back to ground zero with the prosecution and determine what the most advantageous arrangement really is."
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.937,3251.417,May I ask one other question?
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3271.809,3278.745,"Justice Stevens, presupposing that some of the aggravating factors were bound up in the very conduct."
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3280.247,3280.515,No.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3280.515,3282.107,But I... yes.
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.107,3286.339,"You would draw a distinction between those that were and those that were just prior criminal record, or something like that?"
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3286.339,3286.56,Yes.
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3295.077,3296.557,The logic of your position would apply to that.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3296.557,3296.767,Yes.
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3302.921,3305.494,The waiver would just flow from the plea of guilty.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3305.494,3306.064,--It would.
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.064,3307.674,"But not the nature of the colloquy, or anything like--"
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3307.674,3307.864,It would.
1998.97-7541,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3330.919,3334.722,"--Oh, we've seen a fair number of capital cases where they plead guilty and hope to get a life sentence."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3334.722,3335.483,Yes.
1998.97-7541,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3349.522,3352.843,What would be the result if this had been an Alford plea?
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3352.843,3362.08,"That would depend, Justice Ginsburg, on how this Court ultimately resolved the question of what an Alford plea really is."
1998.97-7541,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3421.331,3426.136,So then the Fifth Amendment privilege would have been retained at the sentencing.
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3426.136,3433.97,"I think that it's possible to conclude that it would have been retained, at least on the theory that we have articulated before the Court today."
1998.97-7541,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3462.929,3474.236,"Are you... is your position different from Judge Slovener, because as I recall she didn't put Rule 11 into her analysis at all."
1998.97-7541,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3474.236,3481.47,"I think, Justice Ginsburg, that the Third Circuit went back and forth between two different rationales."
1998.97-7541,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3540.97,3541.952,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
