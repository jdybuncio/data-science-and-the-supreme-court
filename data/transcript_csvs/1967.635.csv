1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.651,"Number 635, Robert Vincent Gardner, Appellant, versus Vincent L. Broderick, as Police Commissioner at the City of New York."
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,27.341,32.104,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Court.
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,115.066,119.907,I'm a -- I want to be sure I understand the context here.
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,129.473,132.153,"It is my position, Your Honor."
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,142.435,144.097,As a matter of New York law?
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,144.097,147.287,As a matter of New York and I believe federal law as well.
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,147.287,150.063,"Well, but perhaps required by the Constitution, if --"
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,150.063,150.805,"Yes, sir."
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,150.805,155.605,You can make a person testify if you give him -- brought enough immunity.
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,161.95,162.481,Under these circumstances --
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,162.481,166.586,-- in the absence of his signing a waiver of immunity.
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,166.586,167.033,Yes.
1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,302.859,303.859,We'll recess now.
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,303.859,306.419,Thank you.
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,381.097,381.549,He didn't --
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,381.549,382.192,State --
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.192,383.822,He didn't refuse to answer any questions?
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,384.844,386.379,He was never asked any questions.
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.229,391.318,So that that was it.
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,397.208,421.179,"Your Honor, the Court of Appeals of the State in New York by Mr.-- by Judge Fuld, Chief Judge Fuld, has said in its opinion in this particular case, “definitely that a refusal to sign a waiver of immunity under this circumstance is in fact an invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination in the opinion itself”."
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,427.505,432.336,"Well, that's not a -- is it -- that's hardly a construction of the state law, is it?"
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,432.336,432.946,It says construction --
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,432.946,443.852,"That would be binding clearly of course, we would all agree would be binding on us if that were a construction or an interpretation of a state, of a New York state law, New York law."
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,453.006,453.194,Your Honor --
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,453.194,454.183,That's what it is.
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,454.183,460.696,"Your Honor, it was a construction of a New York State constitutional provision."
1967.635,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,629.124,639.637,Is there any question as to whether the issues before the grand jury matters upon which petitioner was going to be questioned?
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,650.013,653.17,There is no doubt in that in respect.
1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,705.419,711.103,Did he had administrative hearing -- if he had there -- before his dismissal?
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,711.103,711.872,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,718.141,722.898,(Inaudible)
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,722.898,724.689,There was no automatic dismissal.
1967.635,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,777.175,799.559,"Suppose this policeman were brought up on charges that -- suppose there's a grand jury investigation and it was known that the focus of that grand jury investigation was a charge that he had shot and killed a man while he, the policeman was on duty?"
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,825.732,826.509,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.635,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,833.686,836.171,"Tell me, what's -- would you say that again?"
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,836.171,838.068,Yes.
1967.635,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,866.734,868.12,Oh!
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,892.497,897.362,If it is limited strictly to supervisory will not be used against him --
1967.635,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,897.362,897.517,He told me if that ruling --
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,897.517,920.794,"-- in a disciplinary sense, then I would say that his refusal to answer, in addition to the extrinsic evidence of the fact of the killing and the gunshot and the ballistics test, it would be illegal residuum there to support a dismissal if the request were for a supervisory rather than a disciplinary reason."
1967.635,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,920.794,921.088,Well so --
1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,921.088,921.354,Let us be specific --
1967.635,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,921.354,924.002,So that the bar is not absolute.
1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,924.629,927.409,"No, go right ahead, right now."
1967.635,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,927.409,929.409,The bar is not an absolute one.
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,953.899,955.268,"You have, you have."
1967.635,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,955.268,957.636,And what's your answer?
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,957.636,966.771,"My answer is that if -- if the -- it goes back again, Your Honor to the purpose of the questioning."
1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1003.968,1026.17,Is it your position that if the department has evidence that this man has been associating with gamblers in an illegal way and perhaps accepting bribes and it calls the officer in and asked him about his conduct in relation to that that he can refuse to testify?
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,1026.17,1031.372,"Especially -- yes, especially, if he's under departmental charges, which he was in this case and if --"
1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1031.372,1036.926,"Well, suppose they want to -- suppose they want to do it to find out whether they're going to fire him or not?"
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,1036.926,1040.534,"I don't think his answers there can be used against him, Your Honor."
1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1102.566,1103.683,They're not punishing him.
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,1108.226,1117.269,"Your Honor, the refusal to sign a waiver of immunity under this section mandates dismissal."
1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1120.759,1132.723,"The legislatures said that, would you not wish people on our law enforcement branch of our Government that won't answer questions when their official conduct is called an issue."
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,1132.723,1133.029,"Well, in --"
1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1133.029,1136.023,It's a legislative determination?
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,1136.023,1143.871,The legislative determination at that instance runs contrary to the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and therefore must fall --
1967.635,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1143.871,1145.273,And that's the issue?
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,1145.273,1145.976,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1238.505,1242.622,"You say, give an adequate good reason for his failure to do what?"
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,1242.622,1247.473,"He had an adequate and good reason, explanation at this hearing."
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1249.359,1251.338,Or you said for his failure to answer questions.
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,1252.988,1255.181,He had an adequate and good reason --
1967.635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1255.181,1257.751,I didn't think he was asked any questions.
1967.635,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,1257.751,1284.901,"He was an -- he had an adequate and good reason for objecting to his very presence in the grand jury room that a subpoena was illegal on the ground that he was a target of the investigation and under Bernoff against Amoroso cited in my brief, this subpoena probably was illegal and -- thank you."
1967.635,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1289.694,1290.854,General Rankin.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1290.854,1297.861,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.635,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1589.698,1609.503,"I suppose that's in a rather large circle of related problems such as the disabilities of any on the men or women on that public payroll to make a speech, to discuss, to criticize First Amendment problems?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1609.503,1612.793,I don't think that's involved here at all.
1967.635,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1621.026,1637.467,I suppose in the welfare program as been administered the conditions to be made explicit so that you can dispense with a warrant for a search of the house to see if the welfare law is being complied with?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1637.467,1640.525,I wouldn't think it was possible under these provisions.
1967.635,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1640.525,1646.386,"I know, this is not a -- this is not that case but I mean this is a rather big subject we're getting into, isn't it?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1646.386,1647.003,"No, I --"
1967.635,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1647.003,1652.041,(Inaudible) employment can be conditioned on the surrender of constitutional rights?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1652.041,1656.708,I think this is a very limited inquiry and it's a question of whether a policeman --
1967.635,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1656.708,1659.014,"Oh, it's just one case, that's true but --"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1659.014,1659.584,"Well, but --"
1967.635,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1659.584,1659.761,-- if whether what?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1659.761,1668.172,-- if you take all public officials in the Court of Appeals of New York has extended it Perlas to public officials.
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1703.233,1716.766,"But general, suppose this man had been dismissed from service for a refusal to sign a waiver and period, nothing more."
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1740.964,1763.267,"I think the case of dismissal just for a refusal to sign a waiver is the most difficult case because the heart, the essence of this right, the people of New York wish to assert is to find out how this man was conducting his work on behalf of the people."
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1764.196,1778.227,"And also it's very arguable that he has an immunity by reason of federal law, federal constitutional law against being prosecuted in the event that he makes such disclosures."
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1778.227,1778.455,"Well, that's --"
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1778.455,1782.557,An immunity which the waiver seeks to defeat.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1782.557,1789.735,It's a contention of the city in this case that he does have that immunity by reason of Garrity.
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1789.735,1792.964,But suppose if he signs a waiver?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1798.021,1798.437,That's right.
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1798.437,1800.046,-- statement?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1800.046,1801.164,It has no effect --
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1801.164,1821.014,"But they've done it -- but if on the other hand, your view of this particular case as a refusal by the officer to answer questions with respect to his -- whether he did or did not take bribes or shot a fellow on the street or whatnot, of course, from his official duties."
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1824.657,1829.817,"Yes, because there you are going getting to the question of the particular conduct."
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1844.202,1853.4,"Well, I didn't know it is different because you're charging him now with the knowledge that he wouldn't -- that the signing of the waiver would be ineffective."
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1853.4,1854.034,Yes.
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1854.034,1861.708,"But he has, I suppose -- he could say well if it's going to be ineffective whether these fellows want me to sign it or whether they'd fire me for signing it."
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1861.708,1863.443,Yes.
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1863.443,1881.699,And that may be a very different case and if a man -- a public official or policeman were fired because of his refusal to answer questions within the narrowly defined scope of his official responsibility.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1881.699,1897.804,"Well, but we have a further gloss on this case and that he refused to answer or sign the waiver and to answer on the ground that he could not even be subpoenaed before the grand jury."
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1913.13,1928.951,"Well, did your Court of Appeals treat it as your brother said, as I understand him, did the Court of Appeals treat this as the case in which he refused to answer the questions as well as case of refusal to sign a waiver?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1928.951,1929.569,No.
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1944.904,1958.515,Because -- if I were just to waive a case as I read with great difficulty of the concurrence that I wrote in Spevack against Klein this would not be covered.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1958.515,1959.633,The Court went beyond that in the --
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1959.633,1961.931,"Now, that would be different kind of a situation."
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1961.931,1966.181,And treated it as a refusal to answer the questions.
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.445,1988.321,He never answered in that hearing anything about his -- the conduct of his official business?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1988.321,1989.407,That's right.
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1989.661,1997.056,But why should the state if it -- all it was to do is to find out how the employee has been performing his job?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2008.807,2010.52,"Well, the grand jury in New York --"
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.52,2019.714,Why don't' they just have an ordinary hearing in the civil context and ask him the questions.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2032.675,2044.453,"Well, a grand jury inquiry is a broader inquiry under the law of New York, then just a proceeding which needs to end in indictment."
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.126,2045.91,Wasn't there a (Voice Overlap) --
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2045.91,2050.203,"-- in this case, he was a target of the investigation."
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.203,2055.436,And didn't -- wasn't there a testimony that he was a -- what a -- possible or probable --
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2055.436,2055.94,He was a --
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.94,2057.362,-- defendant in a criminal prosecution?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2057.362,2058.82,That's right.
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.426,2114.331,Does in -- does the New York law require that an employee be asked to waive immunity if he is interrogated by his superior rather than by the grand jury?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2114.331,2116.175,Yes.
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2124.096,2124.536,Are you -- would you --
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2124.536,2125.25,(Inaudible)
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2125.25,2144.072,"Are you defending -- are you saying that despite the Fifth Amendment in Garrity, a public official may be forced to sign a waiver from payment being discharged?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2144.072,2144.413,No.
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2149.616,2150.308,Alright.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2175.685,2177.421,"May I hear the question again, Your Honor?"
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2177.421,2180.94,Yes.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2219.865,2243.545,"Well, it would seem to me that if you told him that the waiver had no effect as far as waiving his rights were concerned and that he had all of the rights that he has under Garrity and Murphy against Waterfront that he would have no excuse for not proceeding to testify."
1967.635,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2243.545,2245.969,Then he would say -- what -- why do you want me to sign this.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2251.281,2254.599,He was not.
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.687,2262.497,"Mr. Rankin, am I correct that this man was suspended first --"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2262.497,2262.737,Yes.
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2262.737,2263.667,-- by the Police Commissioner.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2263.667,2264.919,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.919,2268.244,On charges of being involved in gambling?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2268.244,2269.371,"Yes, sir."
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2269.371,2272.097,"And the next day, he went for the grand jury."
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2272.097,2274.506,That's correct.
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2274.506,2276.111,That's criminal.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2282.989,2284.462,That's right.
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2284.462,2293.012,"And while he's suspended officer, he still obliged to testify?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2293.012,2294.472,That's right.
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2294.472,2296.759,How can you rationalize that?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2296.759,2297.641,Because --
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2297.641,2304.209,You're not -- the grand jury at that stage had nothing to do with his fitness as a police officer.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2312.32,2312.807,Yes.
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2312.925,2319.017,I submit that if he'd been suspended after you'd had a different case from which you have here.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2319.017,2336.289,The grand jury has a legitimate right of inquiry in regard to the performance of his duties in law enforcement under the laws of the State of New York and the fact that it makes an inquiry.
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2350.576,2354.73,"Well, then the only problem is that he didn't sign the waiver?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2356.963,2363.71,The further problem that he asserted that he could not be compelled to appear before the grand jury at all --
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2363.71,2364.186,"Well, then --"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2364.186,2365.32,-- because he was the target.
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2365.32,2372.344,"Well then it narrows down to bad legal advice, he loses his job."
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2372.344,2376.157,"Well, he refuses to answer the question --"
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.157,2377.571,"Well, isn't that what it is."
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2380.083,2381.432,That's right.
1967.635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2381.432,2383.739,And you say counsel was wrong.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2383.739,2385.438,Yes.
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.438,2389.051,"But if he's answered the questions, he might been fired anyway."
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.051,2389.147,He might have been.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2389.147,2389.773,Well --
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.773,2390.785,Might have been.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2390.785,2410.303,"If you can assume that he had good grounds for thinking that he might be incriminated and those grounds included he himself being involved in some way as his reasons, then if they'd -- if it disclose that he was involved in a bribery, he certainly would have been discharged (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.303,2424.211,"Yes, but I gather, Mr. Rankin, if your position is that under that under the Constitution of New York, had he talked, what he said could not have been used as the basis for evidence in a criminal prosecution?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2424.211,2424.647,That's correct.
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.647,2432.235,But if what he said involved him in something for which he might be disciplined or discharged.
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2436.722,2437.94,"That's the law in New York, yes (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.94,2445.956,"So in other words, he'd have an administrative hearing on all that what he said would do would we provide the basis for the administrative proceedings, is that it?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2445.956,2446.96,That's right.
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.96,2449.652,"And that's subject to judicial review, I gather, is it?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2449.652,2450.806,Yes.
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.503,2497.809,"Do you think, Mr. Rankin that if before the grand jury he refused to waive his immunity and then some questions were put to him and he took the Fifth Amendment and said, I don't need to answer on grounds that it'll incriminate me and the -- and that -- and the -- he was taken before a judge and refused again that he could’ve been held in contempt?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2497.809,2498.708,"No, I don't think so in this case."
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.708,2501.024,Why not?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2501.024,2504.313,The Court at least -- Court of Appeals has not yet decided --
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.313,2518.091,"Well, what about -- do you think -- do you -- is it your position that Garrity in effect provides an immunity in those circumstances which really sends in place of the privilege?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2518.091,2524.841,"Well, I've been told by your decisions you haven't cited that question yet to counsel -- regard to Counselman."
1967.635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.841,2538.137,"So that you're not -- you would think that he could take this -- take the Fifth Amendment before the grand jury in this case and refuse to talk and that only -- and your only contention is that if he does, he can be discharged?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2538.137,2568.12,I have difficulty with answering that categorically in light of your decision in Murphy against Waterfront and in Garrity and trying to arrive at the question of whether or not how much immunity you did give in those cases which clearly say that there is -- that the testimony could not be used and the fruits cannot be used but does not go as far as Counselman's dictum.
1967.635,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2574.747,2588.658,"What -- where -- of course, no questions were asked of this man either before the grand jury or at the administrative hearing except that the latter to establish that he had indeed refused to sign that waiver of immunity."
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2588.658,2589.162,Yes.
1967.635,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2589.162,2593.062,Is it clear what kind of investigation this was?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2604.787,2607.796,"Before the grand jury, no it did not involve his shooting."
1967.635,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2620.304,2623.325,"It was an investigation of organized gambling, was it?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2623.325,2629.607,"Well, it was an investigation of bribery transactions that were --"
1967.635,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2629.607,2631.009,Of alleged police corruption?
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2631.009,2631.762,That's right.
1967.635,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2631.762,2634.177,"Corrupting of the police department by gamblers, is that it?"
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2634.177,2634.827,That's right.
1967.635,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2717.746,2741.248,Has New York ever had a system requiring evidence (Inaudible) --
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2741.248,2744.134,"I don't know of anything of that kind, Mr. Justice."
1967.635,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2764.147,2767.25,(Inaudible)
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2767.25,2767.747,That's right.
1967.635,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2767.747,2771.457,(Inaudible)
1967.635,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2771.457,2777.59,Yes.
1967.635,2,40173,ronald_podolsky,,2777.59,2783.217,Your Honor the appellant waives rebuttal.
