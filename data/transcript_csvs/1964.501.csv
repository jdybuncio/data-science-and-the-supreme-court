1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,8.711,15.709,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.501,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,193.178,194.735,"Well, let me just --"
1964.501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,194.735,206.406,Are you telling us that the (Inaudible) counterclaim or are you telling us that this is part of your motion to dismiss the (Inaudible)
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,206.406,219.061,The point the -- Your Honor is that my counterclaim do allege violations of the antitrust laws and violations of the Federal Aviation Act from one single course of conduct.
1964.501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,219.061,223.331,"I know, but you made a motion to dismiss without prejudice."
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,223.331,226.841,I made a motion for a stay actually Your Honor which was denied.
1964.501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,226.841,231.386,You made a motion which says (Inaudible)
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,231.386,234.882,The actual motion that I made below was a motion for a stay.
1964.501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,241.347,245.747,But this is filing a motion to dismiss the (Inaudible)
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,245.747,247.867,That's the effect of what I've done Your Honor.
1964.501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,285.992,301.197,"Well, what we have before us, in this case I gather is the judgment dismissing with prejudice, accepted to that one count of -- the Court of Appeals said, it was superseded by --"
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,301.197,301.483,That is correct Your Honor.
1964.501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,301.483,302.649,(Voice Overlap) -- is that right?
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,302.649,303.855,That is correct Your Honor.
1964.501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,314.123,318.681,"Well, what did they find -- what I -- that (Inaudible) all gotten so confused yesterday."
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,325.151,326.672,"Well, reverse it Your Honor."
1964.501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,326.672,329.16,Reverse it and say what?
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,329.16,340.382,"Well, I think a reversal would be enough so far as I'm concerned because I have a complaint before the CAB, I am not asking to stay in the court below until after the CAB has acted."
1964.501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,353.721,361.365,"Well, what you want then -- do I understand you is that a reversal which will permit you to stay this --"
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,361.365,361.96,Which will permit the --
1964.501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,361.96,362.654,-- counterclaims?
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,362.654,381.606,"That's right, I want a reversal of this dismissal with prejudice which they are using to interfere with my action before the CAB claiming that the CAB should not consider the complaint I have before them, until the CAB has acted on the violations of Federal Aviation Act and then permit me to go after them to waive -- I should be able to -- but I need some help to do it."
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,381.606,382.048,But Mr. Davis --
1964.501,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,382.048,382.906,What if --
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,382.906,383.867,Excuse me --
1964.501,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.867,384.708,Go ahead.
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,384.708,399.612,"The dismissal with prejudice as I read the Court of Appeals' decision is a dismissal of prejudice of a lawsuit because Hughes was not -- Mr. Hughes was not available to discover, that's clear, is it not?"
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,399.612,400.913,"That's the basis they put it on, Your Honor."
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,400.913,401.319,Yes.
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,410.282,411.729,"None, Your Honor."
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,411.729,415.515,"Now, why does that inhibit you before the CAB?"
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,431.451,434.907,That's an argument that the Irving Trust has presented the CAB Your Honor.
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,454.6,455.033,They are not --
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,455.033,456.067,-- to point out --
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,456.067,459.249,"They have not, Mr. Davis, passed upon that argument as I understand (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,459.249,459.583,No.
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,468.428,471.207,Perhaps the Board has been waiting an adjudication here?
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,471.207,471.889,They could be.
1964.501,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.913,589.318,"But Mr. Davis, whether or not the CAB holds the -- that these people have violated the Civil Aeronautics Act, and whether or not we think here that there's any supersession at all, you were still interested in maintaining your counterclaim in the District Court?"
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,589.318,590.493,Unquestionably.
1964.501,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.493,595.514,"Because even if the CAB was to act first, you nevertheless have the claim for damages to be adjudicated to some --"
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,595.514,596.663,I have claims for damages.
1964.501,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.678,600.75,Yes.
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,600.75,607.131,But I cannot get complete relief for the action now in the District Court until after the CAB has acted.
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,937.423,941.313,Mr. Davis (Inaudible) they're doing?
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,948.093,948.302,Yes.
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,948.302,949.182,(Inaudible)
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,949.182,950.443,No.
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,950.443,1016.704,(Inaudible)
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1016.704,1029.494,"I understand your question Mr. Justice Goldberg and I tell you the answer to it is, the decision to suspend the litigation of the counterclaims did not take place after this business decision or with it."
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1144.847,1147.063,Is that what the (Inaudible) had said?
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1147.063,1163.562,"I announced on February 1 by a letter to the Court and to all party, but by my papers, actually it was not filed until February 6th; I see, I believe on February 5th, but anyway, on the morning of February 6th, is when I made my motion for a stay."
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1188.752,1202.171,(Inaudible) to deny your motion to stay was in -- on February (Inaudible)
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1207.23,1208.04,That is correct Your Honor.
1964.501,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1208.04,1208.767,Is that correct?
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1208.767,1215.999,"That is correct, but that took place after you see -- the action I took on the complaint."
1964.501,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1254.642,1255.195,You may.
1964.501,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1255.195,1256.963,Thank you.
1964.501,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1256.963,1259.871,Attorney Bromley.
1964.501,1,17466,bruce_bromley,,1259.871,1262.796,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.501,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2263.752,2270.481,"All of that was relevant with reference to the antitrust proceeding, is that right?"
1964.501,1,17466,bruce_bromley,,2270.545,2273.168,"All of this was relevant to the counterclaims, sir."
1964.501,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2273.168,2274.538,To the counterclaim only?
1964.501,1,17466,bruce_bromley,,2274.538,2275.434,To the counterclaims.
1964.501,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3005.968,3033.242,"If Your Honor please, confusion which I think arise between the position I'm taking of that -- of Mr. -- Judge Bromley is that this is not a situation of a claimant who wants to continue to litigate and failed to comply with the Court order as was involved in the Link case, but this is a question of the right of the claimant who said, “I cannot get complete and adequate relief, now, I want to stop the litigation”."
1964.501,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3205.958,3206.226,Mr. Davis --
1964.501,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3206.226,3207.72,Hughes --
1964.501,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3207.72,3242.965,I understood Judge Bromley to say that your counterclaim alleged certain conduct on the part of these added defendants and the effect of that conduct on their part so far as TWA was concerned and I understood him to say that they proposed to prove and could prove that this was actually the conduct of Mr. Hughes personally and that he was responsible for the effect of it on TWA.
1964.501,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3257.026,3266.022,"Well, Your Honor, the fact is that that -- the reason for my suspension of the counterclaim is wholly unrelated to the discovery of Mr. Hughes of any documents."
1964.501,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3560.226,3562.547,You may take a minute or so to --
1964.501,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3562.547,3568.951,I realized any tax benefit under 531 is just simply does not make any sense.
