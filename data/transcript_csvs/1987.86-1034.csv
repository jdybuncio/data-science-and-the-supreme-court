1987.86-1034,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 86-1034, Virginia v. American Booksellers Association."
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,12.558,59.353,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court, we are here this morning on a case involving a 1985 amendment to a Virginia statute shielding the exposure of juveniles to certain sexually explicit material by regulating the manner of its display, and despite outward appearances, frankly, from reading both sides' briefs, I would suggest to this Court that the issue in this case is really very simple, because we really have one issue, and the issue turns on the type of material that this amendment affects."
1987.86-1034,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,159.302,161.337,"This is a facial attack, is it not?"
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,161.337,163.439,"--Yes, Justice Brenner, it is a facial attack."
1987.86-1034,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.032,188.988,"Mr. Smith, did the state concede at the appellate level below that books such as Hollywood Wives would be covered by the statute?"
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,188.988,193.708,"Justice O'Connor, I am sure today that the day that I die my tombstone is going to say"
1987.86-1034,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.997,256.616,"Well, what is your point, that the appellees had no standing below?"
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,256.616,267.174,"Justice O'Connor, I would submit that... I agree with what Mr. Bator said in his brief, that really the standing question and the merits question here turn on the same thing."
1987.86-1034,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.163,335.115,"Well, how are we supposed to decide that, by looking at the words of the statute?"
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,335.115,337.483,--I would suggest to the Court two ways.
1987.86-1034,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.464,390.832,"Where did this case come from, what court?"
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,390.832,395.653,"District Court in Alexandria, and then up to the Fourth Circuit."
1987.86-1034,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,395.653,399.688,"Didn't those courts have some view of the breadth, the reach of the statute?"
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,399.688,402.64,They never really focused on it.
1987.86-1034,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.425,414.614,"Well, they must have had some notion of what the reach was to do what they did to the statute."
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,414.614,416.314,--The Fourth Circuit did a very strange thing.
1987.86-1034,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,425.886,428.588,It seems to me they thought it was much broader than you say it is.
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,428.588,431.307,--Justice White--
1987.86-1034,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,431.307,432.742,Is that right or not?
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,437.044,441.265,"--They were talking about a different statute, because they were looking at a statute from Georgia."
1987.86-1034,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.081,444.383,"Well, you still don't answer my question."
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,444.383,449.085,--They never came to grips with this issue.
1987.86-1034,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.085,451.554,With the breadth of the statute?
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,451.554,454.839,They never discussed one way or the other.
1987.86-1034,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,464.179,480.89,"Well, I assume that if we found that the Court of Appeals or the District Court... the Court of Appeals defined this statute more broadly than you do, we might very well take the Court of Appeals view of what the meaning of a state statute is."
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,480.89,485.008,"--As I said, if you take the broad view, we lose, but I would suggest that what the Court of Appeals did--"
1987.86-1034,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.008,486.627,"Well, did the Court of Appeals take the broad view?"
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,486.627,493.031,"--What they did was, they said, we assume that there are these burdens."
1987.86-1034,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,510.592,517.246,Did you ask the District Court to abstain in order to obtain construction of this from the Virginia courts?
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,517.246,519.781,There was a request for an extension.
1987.86-1034,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,550.752,557.306,"Now, did you raise that question in the Fourth Circuit, the District Court's failure to abstain?"
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,557.306,563.877,We raised the question of the District Court should have applied the narrowing constructions of the statute.
1987.86-1034,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.852,577.637,"Well, those are two quite different points."
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,580.422,581.322,The plaintiffs say we did.
1987.86-1034,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,593.296,597.082,The Court of Appeals decided that... they passed on it.
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,597.082,599.7,"They passed on it, if I am not mistaken."
1987.86-1034,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.7,612.357,Didn't the Court of Appeals accepted the District Court's finding that this statute would affect a certain percentage of the materials in the bookstores?
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,612.357,613.157,"No, sir."
1987.86-1034,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.157,618.095,I thought it accepted a finding that from 5 to 50 percent.
1987.86-1034,0,40486,richard_bain_smith,,618.095,621.447,"What they said was this, and this is what I was starting to say earlier."
1987.86-1034,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1481.829,1499.073,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in Butler v. Michigan this Court announced a fundamental First Amendment rule, one from which it has never deviated."
1987.86-1034,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1571.205,1573.991,Why couldn't you just have an adults only part of the bookstore?
1987.86-1034,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1573.991,1574.841,I beg your pardon?
1987.86-1034,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.841,1578.943,Why couldn't you just have an adults only part of the bookstore?
1987.86-1034,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1578.943,1585.596,"Well, Your Honor, we think that would involve a very substantial restriction on the access of the adults."
1987.86-1034,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1585.596,1587.631,"But all you'd be restricting would be juveniles, I would think."
1987.86-1034,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1587.631,1594.368,"Your Honor, there are a couple of reasons why that would be very difficult or onerous for adults."
1987.86-1034,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.282,1616.484,Are they members of your... are people like that members of your organization?
1987.86-1034,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1616.484,1618.52,--Yes.
1987.86-1034,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.52,1620.436,Airport bookstands?
1987.86-1034,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1620.436,1625.839,"Yes, we represent really the whole gamut of booksellers and distributors, including those, Your Honor."
1987.86-1034,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.291,1628.475,And hard core bookstores?
1987.86-1034,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1628.475,1629.325,--I beg your pardon?
1987.86-1034,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.325,1630.41,And hard core bookstores?
1987.86-1034,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1630.41,1638.247,"No, our clients do not include any adult or porno bookstores whatever."
1987.86-1034,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1639.933,1649.789,"Did the appellees below, Mr. Bator, make a claim that they sold books that met the definition of what is harmful to juveniles?"
1987.86-1034,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1649.789,1653.507,"--Yes, the testimony below was very clear."
1987.86-1034,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1653.507,1665.131,"I mean, well, but did the... your clients, did they claim that they display routinely books which meet the statutory definition of harmful to juveniles?"
1987.86-1034,1,37751,paul_m_bator,,1665.131,1669.166,The statutory definition under the Virginia display statute.
1987.86-1034,2,40486,richard_bain_smith,,3319.243,3322.814,"Mr. Chief Justice, I will not take it all."
1987.86-1034,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3341.108,3344.077,"That is effective for this Court now, Mr. Smith?"
1987.86-1034,2,40486,richard_bain_smith,,3344.077,3346.027,We would certainly say it is.
