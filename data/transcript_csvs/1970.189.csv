1970.189,0,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,41.232,44.934,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.189,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,195.561,199.306,Was that expiration by the very terms of the award?
1970.189,0,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,199.506,206.476,It was by the terms of the award Mr. Justice Blackmun as required by the statute.
1970.189,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,206.476,213.704,What was the utility of the whole scheme if there was a terminal point on that presumably corrective action?
1970.189,0,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,213.704,230.19,"Well, the hope of the Congress I take it was that during this 2-year period, as some of the courts have indicated who have reviewed this matter, that a new plateau of work rules and manning regulations would be achieved to collect the bargain."
1970.189,1,30741,john_h_haley_jr,,1572.362,1577.036,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.189,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2209.213,2227.602,"Mr. Haley, what do you suggest the Court meant in the Burley case in the language that one of the statute's primary commands judicially enforceable is found in the repeated declaration of duties to all that’s necessary to reach the solution?"
1970.189,1,30741,john_h_haley_jr,,2227.602,2249.054,"As I interpret that Mr. Chief Justice, Justice Rutley was there speaking of the power of the courts to maintain the status quo until the Mediation Board should determine that Section 2 First had been complied with."
1970.189,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2967.562,2970.012,Pardon me but did you refer to Page 9 of the reply brief?
1970.189,1,30741,john_h_haley_jr,,2970.012,2973.37,Of the reply brief of the --
1970.189,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2973.37,2974.492,Reply brief?
1970.189,1,30741,john_h_haley_jr,,2974.492,2995.631,-- of the railroads reply brief Mr. Justice Black and where are they -- I might read it so that -- while this Court has not of course decided the precise issue before it in this case and that’s the language I refer to.
1970.189,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2996.434,3003.802,What has that has to do with the Norris-LaGuardia Act aspect of the case as I read the sentence?
1970.189,1,30741,john_h_haley_jr,,3003.802,3005.665,But I read it --
1970.189,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3005.665,3016.76,This is the clear teaching of its opinions dealing with the interrelationship of the Railway Labor Act to the Norris-LaGuardia Act and as to the alike had thought with the Amicus argument rather than with yours?
1970.189,1,30741,john_h_haley_jr,,3016.76,3057.199,"Well, I read it just the other way, but I did want to mention that because Norris-LaGuardia has been mentioned in that, as the case depends now, unless Section 2 First, with Section 2 First not now being treated by this Court as justiciable or imposing a judicial obligation, the violation of it obviously is not an unlawful act within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act for which an anti-strike injunction might be issued."
1970.189,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3190.949,3193.065,Thanks Mr. John H. Haley.

1970.189,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3327.98,3330.369,"Mr. Dempsey, am I correct?"
1970.189,2,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3334.182,3335.521,"With respect to Section 2 First, Mr. Justice Blackmun?"
1970.189,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3335.521,3336.402,Yes.
1970.189,2,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3336.402,3337.243,Yes.
1970.189,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3347.75,3349.493,Is there any significance in that?
1970.189,2,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3349.493,3377.161,"No, there is not as this Court in effect held in Virginian because the penalty section does not touch Section 2 Ninth either and of course, the Court, there is no dispute that the Court in Virginian held 2 Ninth enforceable and beyond that the Court in the Texas & N. O. case said that the absence of judicial penalty is not determinative with respect to considering the enforceability of these sections, so that --"
1970.189,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3377.161,3380.647,"Didn’t the Virginian Court said, Section 2 First had --"
1970.189,2,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3380.647,3380.797,Oh!
1970.189,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3383.664,3392.961,"How do they do that, in its opinion it said it was in -- they said the Section 2 Ninth requires the company to treat with -"
1970.189,2,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3392.961,3393.466,To treat with.
1970.189,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3393.466,3398.652,-- and if you got to treat with you have to treat with Section 2 First.
1970.189,2,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3398.652,3403.023,"Section 2 First says but let me point out again that the injunction itself requires, --"
1970.189,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3403.023,3403.772,Used the words there.
1970.189,2,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3403.772,3408.201,-- used the words treat with and exert every reasonable effort.
1970.189,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3454.633,3456.742,"Thank you Mr. Dempsey, thank you, Mr. Haley."
