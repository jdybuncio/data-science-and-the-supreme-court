1989.89-152,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-152, Vera English v. General Electric Corporation."
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,8.437,11.522,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-152,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.112,158.285,"Mr. Payne, what... what was the finding of the district court and of the court of appeals as to whether you had stated a claim under North Carolina law?"
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,158.285,167.141,Both of those courts found in response to the 12(b)(6) motion that we had in fact asserted all of the elements of such a claim.
1989.89-152,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,167.141,171.212,"And that that did... your... your pleadings, therefore, did state a claim under North Carolina law?"
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,171.212,171.512,Yes.
1989.89-152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.366,192.041,Was the retaliatory discharge one of the elements that you included in alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress?
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,192.041,193.158,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,212.789,224.596,"Well, but I mean, I take it your position is the same if we... if you excise from your complaint or if you excise from the trial of the case the fact of the discharge, I take it you still can proceed with your cause of action?"
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,224.596,226.229,--There's absolutely no question about that.
1989.89-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,240.856,242.141,"Now, wait... wait."
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,267.689,268.625,Yes.
1989.89-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.625,275.862,"--a relatively minor humiliation, but all the rest are only... only terrible humiliations because the company knew it was going to fire her all along."
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,275.862,276.812,That... that is certainly--
1989.89-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.812,278.147,"So in that sense, it's important to your case."
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,278.147,278.914,"--part of it, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,278.914,279.331,Sure.
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,279.331,292.324,"In fact, it is our contention that rather than just fire her, if GE had the kinds of concerns it's tried to raise about safety, about legitimate disciplinary action, they would have fired Mrs. English."
1989.89-152,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,359.349,366.039,"That may be, but do you think that... that there will be a remedy for this under the Federal act?"
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,377.145,390.904,"Under Section 210... and I'll say that on the remand, which there is the separate case and that Department of Labor case has been appealed to the Fourth Circuit, the holding of the Administrative Judge was reversed on timeliness, and it was remanded."
1989.89-152,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,398.926,399.443,I beg your pardon.
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,404.747,406.314,I don't think there is an adequate remedy.
1989.89-152,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.864,407.616,I didn't ask that.
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,408.832,410.734,There is somewhat of a remedy under Section 210.
1989.89-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.549,460.099,"He can impose punitive damages, too, can't he, under 210?"
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,460.099,460.884,No.
1989.89-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.884,461.567,No?
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,461.567,477.193,"The punitive damages only come into play under Section 210 if the employer refuses to abide by the Secretary's order, and if the Secretary must then seek enforcement in the district court, and at that level only would punitive damages be available."
1989.89-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.251,493.138,xxx.
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,493.138,495.788,Punitive damages are well-recognized in North Carolina.
1989.89-152,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.578,506.113,xxx your statement?
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,506.113,508.232,"Justice White, there is no statutory limit."
1989.89-152,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.101,516.669,xxx.
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,516.669,517.97,--I'm sorry.
1989.89-152,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.97,519.539,The juries aren't?
1989.89-152,0,36503,m_travis_payne,,519.539,524.674,Right.
1989.89-152,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,566.501,567.853,"Very well, Mr. Payne."
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,576.892,579.344,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-152,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,649.305,662.064,"Mr. Wright, should we read... should we view Section 210 as just providing an additional Federal remedy for circumstances such as in this case?"
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,662.064,662.564,That's right.
1989.89-152,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,665.599,682.561,"You suggested in the government's brief... or the government's brief suggested, anyway, that somehow there might be some kind of Federal preemption of certain defenses by virtue of Section 210."
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,682.561,682.995,Yes.
1989.89-152,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,682.995,685.18,"I must say, I don't understand that."
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,691.517,693.384,Let... let... let me try to explain that.
1989.89-152,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,697.921,698.521,What?
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,698.521,703.141,--A conflict preemption matter as opposed to a field preemption matter.
1989.89-152,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.17,753.657,Does the... does 210 require discharge of an employee who's violated a safety regulation?
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,753.657,755.291,"--No, Justice Kennedy."
1989.89-152,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,755.291,762.53,"Well, then there's not really a square conflict in the case you suppose so the state ordered reinstatement."
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,762.53,767.315,That's why I say I'm not sure it really depends on Section 210.
1989.89-152,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.462,786.645,"That is a state concern, isn't it?"
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,786.645,793.699,"--Yes, and in that case there's a real conflict between... would be a real conflict between the state law and Federal law--"
1989.89-152,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.699,802.655,"Well, not only that but that's... there's just... there's just safety preemption under the Atomic Energy Act."
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,802.655,803.257,"--Yes, that's right."
1989.89-152,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.559,819.467,"While I've got you interrupted, is the... is a plaintiff free just to ignore the administrative process before going to state court?"
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,819.467,824.438,--We don't think that there is any sort of exhaustion requirement or anything.
1989.89-152,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.305,830.991,"Well, that... that certainly is there for a purpose, I suppose."
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,833.859,848.953,"--That is true and, as GE has pointed out, it is the case that the filing of a whistleblower claim will in some circumstances alert the NRC to a safety violation."
1989.89-152,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.953,850.155,It always will.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,850.155,855.873,"Well, of course, in this case it didn't because she'd already complained to the NRC."
1989.89-152,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,877.222,880.59,"But that issue isn't here, is it?"
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,880.59,888.696,"--Well, it's... no, it's not involved in this case, as I say, because Mrs. English had complained to the NRC already."
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.052,985.092,"It is an employment protection statute that is designed to make sure that the agency is doing its job or the, in this case, the utility is doing its job properly."
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,985.092,985.492,Yes.
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.377,986.894,That's right.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,986.894,989.561,There's no question that it has nuclear safety aspects as well.
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,989.561,995.965,I... I don't find that line you're trying to draw between labor protection and safety a clear one.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,997.282,997.751,It is--
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,997.751,1007.023,"--I think that that's how we have to decide these... these matters, to decide whether this is a labor provision or a safety provision."
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1007.023,1011.892,--We don't think you have to decide whether Section 210 is a labor provision or a safety provision.
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1042.463,1045.315,Although you acknowledge it does have safety aspects.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1045.315,1057.373,"Yes, and I would return to the district court's characterization of the... of the nuclear safety issue in this case as being only tangential or in the background."
1989.89-152,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1107.806,1112.876,This is a... this hypothetical is a battery committed by the corporation?
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1112.876,1113.226,Yes.
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.104,1132.671,Excuse me.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1139.86,1141.36,"--Well, I--"
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1141.36,1154.001,I mean suppose... suppose a state has a... has a law that says you can't break somebody's legs in order to make him commit an unsafe practice in a nuclear facility.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1156.803,1159.738,"--That hypothetical is, of course, quite troubling because--"
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1159.738,1160.607,I know it's troubling.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1160.607,1161.507,--you had it framed exactly--
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.507,1163.059,"It's right in the heart of nuclear safety, isn't it?"
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1163.059,1168.611,--You've... you've established a special rule for nuclear facilities.
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.611,1169.379,Regardless.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1169.379,1171.746,We might well have some trouble with that.
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.746,1174.95,"Regardless, would that state law be precluded because it's squarely in the field of nuclear safety?"
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1174.95,1176.95,I think we would say it would--
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1176.95,1177.367,Wow.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1177.367,1178.669,--since it's aimed at that field.
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.056,1189.025,"Well, this one... this one isn't aimed particularly at this field either."
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1189.025,1191.293,--The intentional infliction of emotional distress wasn't?
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.293,1191.727,Yeah.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1192.11,1195.428,"And that's why we say it's not preempted, or that's one of the reason we say--"
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.428,1200.815,Any general law is not preempted even if it's in the... directly in the safety field?
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1200.815,1208.671,--Unless it has an effect and except to the extent that it actually intrudes on the Federal field.
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1223.514,1226.383,xxx called field preemption and conflict?
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1229.002,1230.168,No.
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.738,1267.292,What you are saying is that it is not the purpose of the Federal law to make them any safer than it made them.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1274.03,1274.43,--Well--
1989.89-152,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.43,1276.982,And to make them safer than that is to create a conflict.
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1276.982,1283.902,"--I'll... I'll concede that if you look at it that way, you could always find field preemption to be a conflict."
1989.89-152,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.902,1294.109,"Yes, I would say that there's field preemption if the... if the state purported to give an additional remedy for a violation of a Federal safety rule."
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1294.109,1296.811,"If it was aimed at nuclear safety, of course."
1989.89-152,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.811,1303.549,"Well, they just... they say here's another remedy, an additional remedy, for violating a Federal safety rule."
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1303.549,1314.357,"Well, I stress that... the nuclear safety because in the... in the Goodyear Atomic case this Court upheld an additional remedy under a Worker's Compensation statute--"
1989.89-152,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.357,1315.34,"Well, I--"
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1315.34,1319.809,--that was... that was on account of violation of a safety regulation.
1989.89-152,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.248,1327.681,--Yes?
1989.89-152,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1327.681,1337.27,--we would argue for preemption in that case.
1989.89-152,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1437.05,1438.134,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1442.188,1445.14,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-152,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.794,1690.916,A... there's not going to be much of a chance for retaliation unless somebody's already reported something.
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1692.352,1696.22,--But the question is to whom they have reported the violation.
1989.89-152,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.563,1713.115,--But that--
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1713.115,1714.515,--for the fact of a filing with Section 210.
1989.89-152,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.515,1716.55,"--That isn't so with this case, is it?"
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1716.55,1717.7,That is not so in this case.
1989.89-152,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.842,1759.544,"In a field occupation what kind of a remedy there is is irrelevant, isn't it?"
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1759.544,1769.518,"No, because the value of knowing the nature of the remedy is that the legal test under Rice is, is this a matter in anyway regulated by the Federal Government?"
1989.89-152,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.646,1792.031,"Well, I... but that certainly doesn't depend on how adequate the Federal remedy is."
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1792.031,1793.383,"Oh, no, that's true, Justice White."
1989.89-152,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.256,1803.773,That's right.
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1803.773,1805.408,--in terms and conditions.
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.823,1958.775,"What is the $2.3 billion figure, Mr. Phillips?"
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1958.775,1974.118,"That is a calculation at the time, at least of the complaint, of 5 percent of the... I think gross... of the assets of GE, and it was a calculation the district court made in this case as to what... as to what was asked for."
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.666,2132.653,What do you do... what do you do about the general criminal law examples that the government gives?
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2140.926,2142.326,Our argument is--
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.326,2144.295,I assume that state law would be applicable.
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2144.295,2144.728,--Absolutely.
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2197.762,2198.229,"Well, I--"
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2198.229,2198.862,--the answer is clearly no.
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.862,2208.653,"--Yeah, but, my... my hypothetical was the reason for the murder was to punish the person for reporting the safety violation and to prevent further safety violations."
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2210.253,2211.203,I see what you're saying.
1989.89-152,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2241.708,2262.705,"But if you say the... the criminal law is not preempted because that's not the kind of thing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is interested in, couldn't you say the same thing about the intentional infliction of emotional distress that the... that 210 doesn't purport to deal with that, just as it doesn't purport to deal with battery?"
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2262.705,2268.209,But in... in field preemption areas this Court has never said we look at labels for what the state is doing.
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.308,2335.836,"I think the way you... you've distinguished the murder case and the battery case ultimately is that... is that you say that all that 210 deals with is, as you just phrased it, retaliation in the work place... retaliation through dismissal."
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2335.836,2337.653,Or other terms and conditions of employment.
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.653,2339.538,Or other terms and conditions of employment.
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2344.526,2345.259,That's correct.
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.259,2361.301,"Yeah, but that... but that seems so irrational that the... the Federal Government doesn't care how much you... you tinker with whistleblowing and... and how much you... you alter the balance between... that delicate balance that you point out between how much incentive and disincentive you want to whistleblowing."
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2373.043,2373.726,I agree that... that--
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2373.726,2374.128,--which is not persuasive.
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2374.495,2377.997,"--Well, the distinction, though, is the one Congress made."
1989.89-152,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.083,2442.439,Mr. Phillips has... does 210 reach any whistleblowing that relates to anything other than safety?
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2442.439,2442.839,No.
1989.89-152,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.926,2452.478,"Well, there are a lot of rules and requirements that aren't dealing with safety."
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2452.478,2458.549,"Well, the vast majority of the rules and requirements are designed to promote safety in one sense or another."
1989.89-152,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.549,2462.001,"But there are some that aren't safety related, aren't there?"
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2462.001,2463.269,"But... but, see, I... I would still say that the--"
1989.89-152,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.269,2464.019,Isn't that true?
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2464.019,2465.305,"--That is true, Justice White, but--"
1989.89-152,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.305,2473.375,So... so there would be protection under 210 for a whistleblower who reported something that isn't related to safety.
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2477.362,2495.824,"--Well, I think the way the statute is designed, there would be field preemption there because, again, I think that what... what the basic judgment under Section 210 is, is that any time you have a situation where management is defying requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that is in itself a serious safety concern."
1989.89-152,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2570.138,2576.442,"But her... her claim isn't... isn't for simply a wrongful discharge under state law, as I understand it."
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2576.442,2582.93,"--No, but the rest of her claim, the harassment parts of her claim, are still covered by Section 210."
1989.89-152,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2646.253,2658.811,So your theory is that she may not rely on any element for which she could get compensation under Section 210 in trying to state a claim under state law?
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2658.811,2671.904,"That is precisely my position, Justice Rehnquist, and I would rely on Rice for that point, which is that you have to look at the matter the state purports to regulate and determine whether or not that is a subject matter regulated by the Federal Government."
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.231,2734.411,"It seems to me, however, that once you... you do narrow your argument like that and say, all we're talking about is providing recompense for the very same things, namely, employment related retaliation and no other types of retaliation... it seems to me that once you narrow your argument that way you've abandoned the field preemption argument and you're arguing conflict."
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2734.411,2734.761,No.
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.078,2736.43,"Well, if--"
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2736.43,2737.78,--if I didn't make this point clearly--
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2737.78,2742.148,"--If you're arguing field preemption, you're saying anything that... that affects safety regulations."
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2742.148,2750.838,"--Well, the question is how do you define the field, and the field... and if Section 210 is in the field, it is part of the definition of the field."
1989.89-152,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.664,2769.651,"Be in the field if it were not precisely the same thing, but were some other aspect of safety regulation."
1989.89-152,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2769.651,2772.519,"Well, there's no question that there might be a broader theory."
1989.89-152,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2828.44,2829.64,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
1989.89-152,3,36503,m_travis_payne,,2832.992,2836.26,Thank you.
1989.89-152,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2939.594,2944.648,How... how about Allis Chalmers against Luick that we decided two... two or three years ago?
1989.89-152,3,36503,m_travis_payne,,2951.052,2953.087,"Justice Rehnquist, you're going to have help me."
1989.89-152,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2960.425,2968.264,"Well, that the Court said if the... if the state law requires getting into any sort of interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement, it's preempted."
1989.89-152,3,36503,m_travis_payne,,2973.25,2985.225,"Your Honor, I think that that particular state law is... is not a state law grounded in the same history of things like the violence considered by this Court in the UAW v. Russell--"
1989.89-152,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2985.225,2985.558,Then it depends--
1989.89-152,3,36503,m_travis_payne,,2985.558,2986.641,--of the intentional infliction of emotional distress.
1989.89-152,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2986.641,2991.01,--on what history the state law is grounded in whether or not it's preempted?
1989.89-152,3,36503,m_travis_payne,,2991.01,3012.625,"I think to some extent this Court has in fact made almost those sort of balancing determinations when it looks at... there is... and, in fact, Rice, which the Respondent relies significantly, sets forth that when it is a matter that has been historically covered by the states, there's a very, very heavy burden to preempt."
1989.89-152,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.542,3093.994,"Yes, it does."
1989.89-152,3,36503,m_travis_payne,,3126.965,3128.931,"--Two things, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-152,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.777,3149.062,"Your time has expired... your time has expired, Mr. Payne."
1989.89-152,3,36503,m_travis_payne,,3149.062,3149.429,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.89-152,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3149.429,3150.295,The case is submitted.
