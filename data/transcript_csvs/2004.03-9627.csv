2004.03-9627,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,5.906,We'll hear argument in Pace against the... the warden.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,8.439,50.61,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9627,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,68.61,76.123,"Well, he... he had a prior round of hearings at the State level on these same claims, did he not?"
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,76.123,77.526,"--On different claims, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,84.706,96.678,"I know, but the substance of it, saying it isn't fair to give me life without parole because of what happened, I didn't understand the plea... he raised that in State court before."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,96.678,98.497,--He raised it in the first proceeding an ineffective--
2004.03-9627,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.497,98.907,Yes.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,98.907,99.916,--assistance of counsel claim--
2004.03-9627,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,99.916,100.305,Yes.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,100.305,102.517,--related to that and some other claims related to that--
2004.03-9627,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,102.517,102.788,Right.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,102.788,103.82,--in the second proceeding.
2004.03-9627,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.82,109.021,And he... he essentially wants to relitigate the substance of those previous claims.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,109.021,110.674,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,132.594,152.034,"--of both claims was, however he dressed it up in... in due process, that I wasn't told at the time of my sentencing that life meant life without parole."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,156.743,161.944,"Yes, that his lawyer misled him was the first claim, that by telling him he'd be out in 10 to 15 years."
2004.03-9627,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,161.944,167.517,But the... but the essence of it was I wasn't told that life meant I would never get out of prison.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,167.517,167.938,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,167.938,169.424,Both times.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,169.424,181.85,"In... in the second he raised that plus that the colloquy itself was defective and that the sentence, the life without parole sentence, was illegal and unconstitutional, apart from the misinformation aspect."
2004.03-9627,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,248.558,268.992,"Mr. Wycoff, are you taking the position that this... that Artuz... I thought, frankly, that Artuz had classified within properly filed timely filed and then had a footnote, and it says that there might be some exceptions to a timely filing rule--"
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,268.992,269.242,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,269.242,269.901,--rule.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,281.706,284.018,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.132,320.056,"Well, it depends on what the exceptions are."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,323.316,324.142,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.142,324.885,And they're all spelled out in the statute.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,324.885,326.577,They're similar to the AEDPA exceptions.
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.577,326.743,Yes.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,336.996,339.225,"Well, there are a couple of responses to that, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,359.675,361.516,I don't care what the Pennsylvania law is.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,383.99,393.345,"--If... in terms of... to go to Artuz' analysis, you would have to look at each... the exceptions are... go claim by claim."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,399.798,402.228,"But you haven't pleaded any of them, none at all."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,403.209,404.035,--In that case--
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.035,405.727,--several years out of time.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,414.355,418.608,"--Because the court still accepts it, reviews it to see if any of the exceptions apply."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.608,419.723,"Ah, that... that's your theory that... that--"
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,419.723,421.375,And... I'm sorry.
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,421.375,423.521,--Unless it can be rejected by the clerk--
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,423.521,424.431,"Not at all, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.545,435.577,--But you haven't made the claim.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,435.577,437.556,"Well, that's what the court would determine."
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,442.18,448.208,What... what does the Pennsylvania court... law now say with respect to claim-by-claim pleading of the exceptions?
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,448.208,456.398,--The Pennsylvania Supreme Court now has said you should plead in the PCRA petition the exceptions.
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,456.398,457.618,Claim by claim?
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,457.618,460.113,"For each... any claim that you're raising, yes."
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,461.212,466.989,"This problem couldn't arise again in Pennsylvania, couldn't it, because they have a 1-year statute of limitations?"
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,477.02,480.364,"It... it can arise again, Your Honor, and that--"
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,480.364,480.614,It can?
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,480.735,493.904,"--Yes, it can arise again and... and will many times arise again because consider someone who's already had his or her AEDPA year pass and then discovers, say, a Brady claim and wants to go back and litigate that."
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,497.454,497.825,--You do.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,500.016,500.426,Yes.
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,500.426,501.723,"And then if you miss the year, you're out of luck."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,502.095,506.06,"That's... yes, but under State law, you only have 60 days to get that."
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.719,516.107,I see.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,518.691,519.739,--Yes.
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,519.739,533.552,"60 days runs after his final conviction and then between the 60th day and the 365th day, he has discovered his Brady claim and has not got into court within 60 days."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,533.552,538.093,Or he finds it in what he thinks is within 60 days of when he should have found it.
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,547.503,550.27,And Justice Scalia's question... I'm interested in this.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,583.252,592.457,"It... it depends on if there's a new... if... if there has not been a new triggering date, other than the finality for the AEDPA date, then you will be out of time for AEDPA."
2004.03-9627,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,592.457,595.8,But AEDPA... it doesn't say 1 year and that's it.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,597.537,598.213,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,598.213,600.509,The exemptions still could be the problem.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,600.509,601.418,Yes.
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,617.393,617.559,Yes.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,620.16,621.108,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,621.108,622.677,--But let me ask you this.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,628.25,629.382,Yes.
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,629.382,639.396,"--are there States, do you know, where that is not required and the State court will go through the exceptions even if you haven't pled them?"
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,639.396,644.225,"Well, Pennsylvania actually does that and certainly did it at the time Mr. Pace was litigating."
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,644.225,646.25,"Well, but I thought you said Pennsylvania law had changed now."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,646.25,650.065,They have said now you should plead them at the petition... in the petition.
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,650.065,654.302,"But my... my question is do you know if there are other States where they say, we don't care if you plead these--"
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,654.302,655.249,I--
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,655.249,656.281,--exemptions specifically or not?
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,658.305,659.625,--I... I don't know the answer to that.
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.051,684.866,"And you say that if that's the case, you can file a... a State... a State claim that is plainly no good and until the State court finally gets around to... to telling you that it's no good, your... your AEDPA claim is tolled."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,684.866,690.272,"Yes, while you're... and the State could easily prevent that by setting up some kind of prefiling requirement for--"
2004.03-9627,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,690.272,700.303,"But that's, in... in effect, saying that there is no... that the properly filed, given the Pennsylvania procedure, does not include timely filed."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,700.303,707.833,--The... the question of whether it was timely or not is not actually determined until the end of the litigation.
2004.03-9627,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.833,715.247,But... but you have just said that the... the court will look on its own to see if there are these exceptions.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,715.247,717.393,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,717.393,725.528,"So that there would be no case of an untimely filing in this period when the court was... even if you raised no exception, was going through them."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,725.528,726.437,Yes.
2004.03-9627,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.437,745.673,There would be no case in which an untimely filing would be included in properly filed because the very fact that the court itself would go through the petition to look for exceptions would take it out of the category.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,745.673,753.475,"Yes, Your Honor, and exactly the same could be said about Artuz, the procedural bar rules in Artuz, whether someone pled--"
2004.03-9627,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,753.475,764.721,"But the... the difference was that Artuz ranked timely filing as an ingredient of properly filed, and you say but not in Pennsylvania the way it's set up."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,768.419,773.787,--Because the State court lets you file it and gives it judicial review and applies it claim by claim.
2004.03-9627,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,773.787,778.384,But don't... don't you have a... a... sort of a second prong to... to your response?
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,844.309,844.664,Yes.
2004.03-9627,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,844.664,847.226,--and not determine it as a threshold matter.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,868.32,868.757,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.7,896.228,"This is putting such a... I mean, the system is not going to work."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,919.738,920.277,--Well--
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.277,923.536,--by which time you file another one that's clearly out of time.
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,929.026,935.88,"And... and if you're tempted to answer, well, people want to get out so they're not going to sit around forever, then we'd ask you what about the death cases."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,935.88,940.998,"--Okay, and that was what I was tempted to answer, and since you said it, I'll go straight to the death cases."
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,967.171,968.74,I'm not sure that would apply to other States.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,968.74,969.938,--That's true.
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,981.455,996.787,"Under your rule that filing is sufficient, are there any instances of... of frivolous petition where your rule would not apply?"
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,996.787,1008.493,"Well, I think all the courts of appeal that have... have talked about that have thought... have said that you really shouldn't start figuring out whether it was a frivolous assertion or meritorious--"
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1008.493,1013.405,"Well, then Justice Scalia's prediction is... is right."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1015.347,1020.464,"--Presumably you could and if there's someone who wants to do that, which is going to be a rare--"
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1020.464,1021.784,Suppose you lost on that one.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1049.277,1062.902,"--I think that going down that path is going to open up just a nightmare of... of litigation in Federal court about... if you start talking about good faith and are you... if the State courts deny it, can you still say it was nonfrivolous?"
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1067.36,1069.339,Try... try this simple rule.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1081.106,1084.2,Two... I have two things to say about that.
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.296,1128.039,Why... why not?
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1131.177,1135.718,"--Well, Artuz talks about you look to the State's procedural filing requirements."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.385,1166.183,I thought the whole purpose of AEDPA was... was to prevent delay.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1179.436,1180.012,Yes.
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1180.012,1183.44,And you tell us don't worry about these things dragging on endlessly.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1183.44,1188.269,I'm not... I'm saying AEDPA says come to Federal court within a year.
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.908,1202.963,That's unrealistic if the States allow you to file a lot of stuff.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1211.386,1213.82,--That's one way or a prefiling requirement.
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.82,1214.275,Give me another way.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1214.275,1223.645,"The AEDPA prefiling requirement where you go to the court and you say, I'd like to file this petition, tell me if I can, and the court says, 30 days later, yes or no."
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1224.594,1229.052,"Oh, but if it takes a year a later, then we--"
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1229.052,1230.871,"--Well, yes."
2004.03-9627,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1232.107,1234.419,--Then you just repeat the process one step backward.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1234.419,1235.163,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1263.604,1270.678,What about a... a rule requiring good faith or reasonable argument in death cases?
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1291.55,1301.664,"--I suppose that... I mean, that could be a construction of the statute as long as you let people... people are going to come to Federal court first and get... for stay abeyance if you do that."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.012,1315.866,Do you think that's a reasonable interpretation of properly filed and... and what I proposed to you is not a reasonable interpretation of properly filed?
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1315.866,1318.3,"Well, I was just--"
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.3,1326.845,How can you... how can you tease that elaborate system out of... out of the words properly filed but you cannot tease out of it--
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1326.845,1327.216,--The--
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.216,1336.315,--simply showing on its face that there's either an absolute statute or that one of the exceptions to the statute exists?
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1336.315,1346.058,--The problem with that in terms... is that it conflicts with Artuz' idea that the... any rule that's a condition to filing has to go to the application as a whole.
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1346.058,1350.788,"Well, I don't think it actually... I mean, in... I think they're about equal, aren't they, in respect to language?"
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1366.309,1367.219,Just--
2004.03-9627,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1367.219,1368.909,They each have their problems.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1368.909,1380.965,"--Just in terms of... of policy, I think any rule you adopt that's not mechanical and doesn't let people know on the front end whether they're tolling or not, there's going to be floods of protective filings."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.262,1442.015,The circumstances included the fact that he sat on this thing for 3 years.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1444.616,1448.126,--You're talking about the time from the first PCRA--
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.126,1448.347,"The claim, yes, that's right."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1448.347,1448.885,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.885,1457.801,"So... when... when you... when you fold that into the circumstances, it doesn't seem to me an overwhelming case for equitable tolling."
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1457.801,1460.13,"I have, I think, four responses to that."
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.551,1503.043,--take a whole lot to figure out that you have a claim where your lawyer told you... you weren't going up for life and it turned out you were sent up for life.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1503.043,1504.036,--In fact--
2004.03-9627,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1504.036,1508.783,"I mean, what does it take if... can a 17-year-old figure that something has gone wrong here?"
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1508.783,1514.477,"--Well, in fact, that... that claim was litigated... litigated in the first petition, and in fact, he didn't think of that."
2004.03-9627,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.438,1586.06,You may.
2004.03-9627,0,21693,david_wycoff,,1586.06,1586.924,Thank you.
2004.03-9627,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1586.924,1590.639,Mr. Eisenberg.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1590.639,1594.149,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9627,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1735.205,1745.152,"Well, but if we accept your position, it seems to me that the State prisoners are going to have to go once to Federal court and then they're... they're going to run into an exhaustion requirement."
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1745.152,1758.527,"Well, they're not going to run into an exhaustion requirement, Your Honor, because if they've already been through one round of State post-conviction review, then they are unlikely to be able to exhaust more claims because there's a... there's a--"
2004.03-9627,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1758.527,1759.104,"Well, we're--"
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1759.104,1759.476,--1-year time limit.
2004.03-9627,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1759.476,1763.069,--we're assuming a late-discovered claim that's within AEDPA.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1763.069,1763.691,That's right.
2004.03-9627,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1778.096,1781.523,It... it's my... I still have a feeling that this is a limited universe.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1845.591,1846.789,"It's... it's not, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1846.789,1847.282,It's not?
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1847.282,1848.934,And... and the reason that it's not--
2004.03-9627,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1848.934,1850.049,But have I got it right?
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1851.907,1855.706,--Only... it's... that is true only for successive petitioners.
2004.03-9627,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.348,1880.598,"Now, let's--"
2004.03-9627,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1880.598,1889.43,What do I do it in a State where there is a plausible close question of whether or not the successive petition is barred in the State court?
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1894.073,1900.0,The... the general rule... and this is implicit I think in the fact that Congress passed a statute of limitations.
2004.03-9627,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1924.353,1926.954,But no... there's still an exhaustion requirement.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1926.954,1931.246,--The way that would interact with... for exhaustion purposes with a State like Pennsylvania is this.
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1979.877,1981.13,But isn't there a wrinkle to this?
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2003.504,2005.611,"--With respect to your argument, the answer is absolutely not."
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2026.871,2027.093,Okay.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2039.873,2046.477,"--That is what he was getting at but at a limited point in time, and the whole question for equitable tolling purposes was at what point in time."
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2090.317,2098.945,"If that means the petitioner was wrong, doesn't it also mean that Judge Giles is wrong, and if Judge Giles can't figure it out, isn't there a pretty good argument that the petitioner ought to get equitable tolling?"
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2098.945,2102.084,"Well, there are a number of problems with the equitable tolling, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2148.607,2151.125,But... but Judge Giles didn't understand it either.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2151.125,2157.069,--Judge Giles didn't say that... that the State law would never in the future be applied to these defendants.
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2161.694,2162.892,"So far as this case is concerned, yes."
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2171.47,2180.353,What there is is an argument that he had an argument to make in Federal court that he was not... that he was still going to have the opportunity to go back to State court.
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2187.784,2190.589,But... but this argument is not trying to decide for the States.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2198.929,2201.075,"--It's not true that nobody could figure it out, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2238.022,2247.431,"But if he had gone into the Federal court he went into, and he had not gone through this State procedure, he would have been turfed out."
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2247.431,2250.199,"You can't get equitable tolling, Your Honor, our position would be--"
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2250.199,2251.414,"Well, answer that question--"
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2251.414,2251.768,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2251.768,2253.254,--before you tell me what the consequence is.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2253.254,2253.337,No.
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2264.073,2271.875,"Well, I mean, don't... don't we have to take Judge Giles' statement as being a statement in good faith unless there is a pretty darned good reason not to?"
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2271.875,2275.673,"--The point is, Your Honor, that that's not the test for equitable tolling."
2004.03-9627,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.826,2304.197,--All right.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2308.284,2312.825,"Well, I... I have... there are some... really some... some threshold problems with equitable tolling that--"
2004.03-9627,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.825,2316.54,--I... I have a general question which is not Pennsylvania.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2382.465,2383.125,"--Well, it's--"
2004.03-9627,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2383.125,2389.729,Another that might work is... is requiring in death cases that it be a... a plausible ground or something like that.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2392.33,2396.5,"--It certainly shouldn't be a plausible ground test, and even the petitioner agrees with that position, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.898,2424.818,"Actually most prisoners are not represented, I don't think, at this stage."
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2439.679,2451.568,"--Your Honor, the... the Congress that passed this statute of limitations is the same Congress that made the decision about whether habeas petitioners would be appointed counsel or not."
2004.03-9627,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.144,2466.884,"I'm trying to get from you what is your opinion of a practical approach to this problem in Oklahoma, say."
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2466.884,2470.887,--The practical approach to the problem is to look at the statute that says you have a year.
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2536.524,2554.523,"May I ask how you would handle a case that is a successive petition, a late... a recently found claim, and the... filed beyond the statute of limitations but the State has three exceptions to the statute, but it does not require that the... the petitioner identify the exception in the petition?"
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2563.811,2577.27,"No, Your Honor, because all the court is doing is deciding whether the time bar applies, and in order... in a State that has those kind of categories, what the court is, in effect, doing is deciding what kind of time limit applies to this particular petition."
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.27,2580.818,"And even if it takes a year or so to make that decision, you'd say no tolling."
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2580.818,2584.616,"Your Honor, that's really true of every kind of statute of limitations issue that can come up."
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.383,2606.803,"And in all of those questions, you'd say there would be no tolling in order to find out whether it was timely or not."
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2606.803,2614.066,"--That's right because during that time, the State court is deciding on timeliness, and if it's untimely, it was untimely as of the point of filing."
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2617.698,2625.212,"But what about the reasoning in Artuz that the application was... if it turns out later it was timely, it would have been properly filed?"
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2625.212,2627.608,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2647.709,2658.566,"No, but if I understand you correctly, you're saying that even if it takes the judge 6 months to decide whether it was timely, if he ends up with the conclusion that it was not timely, there would be no tolling for that 6-month period."
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2658.566,2659.476,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.13,2752.643,Why... why are there thousands of cases in which noncapital defendants file this type of case?
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2757.018,2768.164,"The incentive that they have to drag it on is that they may come up with a new legal theory that attracts a... a court that they didn't present before, that new facts may come up, may arise that they try to argue."
2004.03-9627,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2782.57,2787.855,It seems... it seems intuitive also that the prosecution's witnesses will be difficult to locate and so forth.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2793.716,2795.535,"--Well, it's certainly something that--"
2004.03-9627,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2795.535,2796.316,--we take judicial notice of?
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2796.316,2798.728,"--It's certainly something that any prosecutor would tell you, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2868.491,2871.274,"Well, he also raised an... an entirely different claim, didn't he?"
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2876.459,2884.738,"--The reason the colloquy wasn't adequate is precisely for the same reason that he was attacking his lawyers, in the petitioner's view, that it didn't explain to him the meaning of a life sentence."
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2884.738,2885.004,--Right.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2892.911,2896.338,"Your Honor, that's a claim that was waived if it was not presented in the first--"
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2896.338,2898.362,"That... that may be, but it is a different claim."
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2898.362,2898.938,--But... but--
2004.03-9627,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2898.938,2901.539,It is not the claim of ineffective assistance.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2901.539,2912.274,--But the only way that the petitioner could exhaust that claim in State court on a second round of post-conviction review would be to put it in terms of ineffective assistance of first post-conviction counsel.
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2967.176,2971.013,"Just sa a matter of curiosity, is the transcript of the plea colloquy still available?"
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2971.013,2971.55,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2973.78,2976.009,And was there the constitutional violation he alleges?
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,2976.009,2983.318,"--What the judge said three times is, you understand that your sentence will be life, and the petitioner said yes each time."
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3006.102,3013.904,The irony of this whole proceeding is it seems to me it would be a lot easier to decide the merits of that claim if the transcript is available than to get into all these issues--
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3013.904,3014.441,"Well, but, Your Honor--"
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.441,3015.034,--we have today.
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3015.034,3015.64,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.395,3032.98,"Of course, he's a 17-year-old without any learning in the law."
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3038.181,3039.667,--He... he knew it appeared in the transcript.
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3166.189,3168.701,"Thank you, Mr. Eisenberg."
2004.03-9627,1,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3168.701,3168.805,Thank you very much.
2004.03-9627,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3168.805,3172.892,"Mr. Wycoff, you have about 4 minutes left."
2004.03-9627,2,21693,david_wycoff,,3172.892,3176.69,Several things.
2004.03-9627,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3387.424,3388.373,"Thank you, Mr. Wycoff."
