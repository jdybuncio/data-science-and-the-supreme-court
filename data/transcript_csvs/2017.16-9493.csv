2017.16-9493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.15,8.7,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-9493, Rosales-Mireles versus the United States. Ms. Davidson."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,8.7,51.125,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government concedes that the Fifth Circuit's shocks-the-conscience standard is the wrong approach for a court of appeals to apply under the fourth prong of plain error review. The question remains: How should a court of appeals exercise its discretion when confronted with an obvious guidelines error that probably results in a defendant serving a longer prison sentence? We ask the Court to recognize what every circuit but the Fifth already has; that is, in the ordinary case, such an error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the judicial proceedings and warrants correction."
2017.16-9493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,51.125,63.94,"One -- one day? I mean, if your -- if the person is in prison one extra day, that would cause people to look at judicial proceedings as lacking fairness and integrity?"
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,63.94,117.835,"I believe so under the -- under the analysis of the fourth prong. Certainly, a sentence of an extra 20 years, versus a day, 20 years is worse, but, under the analysis of the fourth prong, the question really is, does the nature of the error frustrate the purposes served by the rule at issue? And in the context of the guidelines, a guidelines error directly frustrates the very purposes served by the sentencing guidelines scheme: the congressional goals to promote uniformity and proportionality and to avoid unwarranted disparity; to achieve parsimony, meaning that a defendant is sentenced to the least amount of time necessary to effectuate the statutory goals; and to have respect for the district court --"
2017.16-9493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,117.835,126.35,"No, and these are all reasons that you would consider when the question is -- when there's an objection and the question is raised."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,137.68,138.72,Agreed.
2017.16-9493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,148.27,173.475,"We have said many times that correction under the plain error doctrine should be exercised sparingly, but I take it your argument is, in the context of a guidelines error, the discretion should not be exercised sparingly; it should be exercised routinely."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,173.475,179.94,"Well, Your Honor, I think the context is that 52(b) applies to the grand universe of errors."
2017.16-9493,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,207.54,208.38,Why are guideline error --
2017.16-9493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,208.38,232.885,But then you are saying -- you are saying that guidelines errors are -- are exceptions to the general rule that plain error review should yield corrections sparingly? You are saying that this is a category where it should be exercised routinely?
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,232.885,241.47,"I think a guideline error presents a -- the nature of the guideline error is such that it ordinarily will have that effect, but it won't always."
2017.16-9493,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,241.47,251.325,And -- and why is that? Why are guideline errors a category in which we should kind of flip what usually happens; it goes from sparingly to most of the time?
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,251.325,276.11,"As the Court has recognized in Peugh and Molina-Martinez, the sentencing guidelines provide the essential framework for federal sentencing, and there is a well-documented anchoring effect so that when there is an erroneously high guidelines range, there's a significant risk that the defendant was sentenced to a longer prison time than he otherwise would have had the district court not been influenced by the error itself."
2017.16-9493,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,276.11,290.39,"That seems more a prong 3 question, isn't it? The question -- you know, that -- that most guideline calculation errors are going to have an effect on the -- on -- on -- on the sentence, but then there's also prong 4."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,293.66999995,331.745,"It's our position that prong 3 and prong 4 do have distinct inquiries, but because there's such a direct nexus between the sentencing guideline error and the effect, the separate inquiries will also -- will often be examining the same or similar type of information on the record before it. And while it is true that Molina-Martinez looks at the anchoring effect of the guideline to show that the guideline error itself can be evidence of an effect on substantial rights, the resulting harm of that is a longer prison sentence."
2017.16-9493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,341.91,370.855,"I mean, if we said that an error is plain if it creates a risk that the defendant will serve a longer sentence than the defendant would have otherwise served, I don't know what's left of the plain error rule in criminal cases. You -- you seem to be equating -- you seem to -- your argument seems to be that an error is plain unless it's harmless -- unless it is not harmless, isn't that right?"
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,370.855,371.765,No.
2017.16-9493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,375.68,381.525,"Well, what is left of it in this context? I mean, you cite three examples in your brief."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,413.435,414.0,Yes.
2017.16-9493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,449.12,450.24,Okay.
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,459.67,465.355,"Well, yes, it would rise to a level of seriousness to warrant correction."
2017.16-9493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,465.355,466.04,Okay.
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,473.39,475.41,"Well, every error is different."
2017.16-9493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,511.065,512.19,Okay.
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,543.09,561.57,"Well, it likely could be a plain -- I mean, no, it -- it -- the -- let me back up. The evidentiary standard that has to be met under the third prong of the plain error is a -- is a low evidentiary standard: A reasonable probability."
2017.16-9493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,582.64,584.17,But you're changing the standard.
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,587.245,592.89,Harmless -- excuse me. Are we talking about harmless error standard or the plain error standard?
2017.16-9493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,592.89,608.27,"Well, my inquiry is what is the difference between the plain error rule and the harmless error rule as you understand them? And you just told me, as I -- what I think you just told me was that the court would have to say it's uncontroverted, that this had no effect, otherwise it would be plain error?"
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,608.27,627.07,"If I understand the question correctly as distinguishing between harmless error and plain error, the -- one of the primary differences is that the burden remains on the defendant the entire time during the plain error analysis. The burden never shifts like it does under a harmless error standard."
2017.16-9493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,627.07,632.985,"Yeah, well, that ought to cut in the opposite direction, shouldn't it?"
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,632.985,635.545,I'm not sure I understand the question.
2017.16-9493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,635.545,642.51999995,"The defendant has the burden under plain error, right, so it should be harder there."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,657.94,675.935,"I think the approach that's applied by the majority of circuits actually gives vitality to the plain error standard, as the Court expressed it in Olano. And it turns on the seriousness of the error. So it's going to be contextualized by the error and its effect on --"
2017.16-9493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,675.935,688.39000005,I thought you had just said that the guidelines miscalculation is an exception to the normal way that plain error operates.
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,711.47,712.55,No.
2017.16-9493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,746.1,751.165,"Well, then your answer to Justice Ginsburg should be yes, and it should have been yes at the outset."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,781.895,784.39,"No, I -- let me clarify."
2017.16-9493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,786.92,807.35,"Well, if that's the correct formulation, then why -- why is a sentencing guidelines error more serious than any other type of error, more serious than a constitutional error, more serious than a violation of a statutory command? Here, we're not even talking about something that's mandatory."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,821.17,838.485,"Well, the analysis doesn't turn on whether or not it's a constitutional or non-constitutional error or that the sentencing guidelines are mandatory versus advisory. It's looking at how close of a nexus exists between the error and how it affects the outcome."
2017.16-9493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,870.905,887.085,"I -- I think the basis for your -- or perhaps a basis for your exception is that the error is so precise, you know, a typographical error has caused the person to stay in jail for -- to have to stay in jail for another six months."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,954.705,999.51,"I don't think the amount of excess is the -- is the right marker for a court of appeals to determine because it would run contrary to the congressional goal of parsimony. And as the Court stated in Williams, it's the district court's prerogative to determine the appropriateness of a particular sentence to begin with. As to relative cost, certainly, there's always some cost involved to resentencing, but the fact is it is a lower cost than having a new trial, for example. The Court recognized that resentencing doesn't present the same amount of costs in Molina-Martinez."
2017.16-9493,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1000.475,1028.975,"Mrs. Davidson -- Ms. Davidson, I think of the three prongs, the third and the fourth prong, the third prong as being fairness of process: Were you given the process that you were entitled to constitutionally or statutorily? And so, on the third prong, we've had many cases where elements were not given to a jury."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,1120.36,1152.07,"No, I don't believe so. And in Cotton, it's not just what the court examined of what the outcome would have been but -- but based on what that record demonstrated. And I think that analysis would apply in this case because we don't have a record that demonstrates what a district court would have done by overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence, especially when it's not just a mathematical error of the guideline, but it's premised on a factual error in the criminal history."
2017.16-9493,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1152.07,1169.4,"Well, I think your -- your point in your brief was he got, at the low end of the guidelines, 78 months, despite all of the negative factors that the government points to in its brief, his serious criminal history, et cetera, et cetera. The judge still sentenced him at the low end of the guideline."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,1183.36,1185.29000005,Yes.
2017.16-9493,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1185.29000005,1188.585,It's a possibility -- a strong possibility?
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,1188.585,1190.265,Yes.
2017.16-9493,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1190.265,1205.25,"Ms. Davidson, I was wondering about our -- our standard in Olano and the fourth prong, talking about fairness, reputation, integrity of judicial proceedings, where it came from. And I traced it back to Atkinson, a 1936 opinion."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,1235.605,1292.07,"Well, I'm aware of that history, but I also can't ignore how often cited the Court has restated Olano's formulation, so I don't have a position in -- in going back to a pure disjunctive, but I would like to point out that in articulating that -- what became the fourth-prong standard in Atkinson, Atkinson cites Brasfield, and in Brasfield, it's an example where the Court recognized a type of error that, by virtue of inquiring into the numerical division among the jurors, that inquiry itself impugned the system. And so I think there is recognition that different errors have a different degree of seriousness and have a different level of effect compared to --"
2017.16-9493,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1292.07,1311.33,"Well, if that's true on the fourth prong, public reputation, let's say, how are we supposed to determine that normatively, right? As an empirical matter. We're supposed to take a poll? I think if we took a poll, we'd find that a lot of people may not care about how long your client spends in prison."
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,1330.695,1337.805,"Well, I think it's difficult because there's not going to be that type of evidence on a record of what the public thinks."
2017.16-9493,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1351.71,1366.925,"So it's a normative inquiry rather than an empirical one, I think is what you're suggesting, in which case, should -- should the fact that a person spends a day in prison longer than the law permits be something we should care about?"
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,1366.925,1372.855,"Yes, especially when it results from an obvious and easily correctable error."
2017.16-9493,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1372.855,1374.375,That we made ourselves?
2017.16-9493,0,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,1374.375,1380.95,"Correct. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal."
2017.16-9493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1380.95,1395.72,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ellis."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1395.72,1418.725,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The plain error rule is designed to capture a narrow set of errors that we as a society are not willing to subject to the ordinary rules of party presentation and forfeiture that govern federal proceedings. The question here is whether clear guidelines errors -- errors as a class will almost always meet that test."
2017.16-9493,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1430.01,1453.965,"Isn't it so that most circuits, if not all, that have addressed the question do take the position that guidelines miscalculations, if they're clear, call for correction on plain error review?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1453.965,1459.2,So I think Petitioner overstates the consensus in the lower courts. Only two courts of appeals have adopted --
2017.16-9493,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1459.2,1460.465,Did the Ten -- did the Tenth Circuit?
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1460.465,1461.06,I'm sorry?
2017.16-9493,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1461.06,1477.355,"Did the Tenth Circuit in, what is it, Sabillon-Umana overstate it when the Tenth Circuit said that the third and fourth prongs of the plain error test align in these guidelines miscalculations?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1477.355,1487.75,So I think -- I think what the Tenth Circuit said is that courts of appeals often exercise authority -- their authority under the fourth prong when the first three are met and that some have adopted a presumption.
2017.16-9493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1518.885,1541.44,"Mr. Ellis, can -- can I just -- Justice Gorsuch, when he was a judge, wrote this opinion which I'm sure you've read many times, and I just want to quote one sentence from it and then ask you what you think about it because he basically, you know, suggests why you maybe lose. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-9493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1541.44,1542.86,But this is what he says.
2017.16-9493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1546.76,1570.665,"-- he says, ""What reasonable citizen wouldn't bear a rightly diminished view of the judicial process and its integrity if courts refuse to correct obvious errors of their own devise that threaten to require individuals to linger longer in federal prison than the law demands, especially when the cost of correction is so small?"" And I take that to be combining three things."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1607.9,1608.11,Sure.
2017.16-9493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1608.11,1609.41,Why isn't that right?
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1609.41,1611.32,There's a lot packed into that.
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1640.61,1641.05,Isn't it --
2017.16-9493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1641.05,1642.06,"Well, I think what they're --"
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1642.06,1642.45,I'm sorry.
2017.16-9493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1643.17,1646.74,"I -- I mean, he could probably do it better than I can."
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1646.74,1649.675,You're doing a much better job than I. (Laughter.)
2017.16-9493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1649.675,1669.985,"I think what this is saying is, yes, the reasonable citizen, assuming this great reasonable citizen exists, you know, would think all of those things, but he would say here's this particular kind of error, and -- and it's rare that all of these three things come together. Deprivation of liberties, that's pretty common."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1683.31,1688.27,So -- so you're -- you're exactly right that the deprivation of liberty is not so uncommon.
2017.16-9493,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1750.81,1758.995,Would it -- would it -- would it be ineffective assistance of counsel for counsel not to notice a glaring error in calculating the guidelines?
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1758.995,1761.885,I think there are some -- there may be some cases perhaps.
2017.16-9493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1786.04,1797.59,"I still am not sure, when I -- when I leave here and write down what your position is, what is your definition of the fourth prong as it applies to this case?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1797.59,1798.16,Sure.
2017.16-9493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1806.5,1813.57,What is your -- what is your best guidance as to how to apply it in this case using neutral principles?
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1813.57,1814.8,So I --
2017.16-9493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1814.8,1816.0,General principles.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1816.0,1816.77,"Yeah, sure."
2017.16-9493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1823.07,1823.16,Yes.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1823.16,1835.09,"-- of the judicial proceedings. I think the nature of the guideline -- of the error here should inform that analysis. The Petitioner has argued that we deny that it's relevant, but that's not true. We don't think it's grounds to create an exception to the rule."
2017.16-9493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1839.69,1841.995,So what -- I'm -- I'm waiting to write something down.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1841.995,1843.08,Sure. (Laughter.)
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1843.08,1869.29,"We think that in -- in a guidelines case, in the ordinary guidelines case, where -- where the sentence that was imposed is one that is lawful and one that is -- that would be reasonable even if the guide -- error had been brought to the attention of the court and -- and corrected, it's going to be an unlikely case, an unusual case, where that is the type of error that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings."
2017.16-9493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1869.29,1869.58,Why?
2017.16-9493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1869.58,1891.11,"But there may be -- there may be a case where it does, right? I mean, we're talking about whatever the length of time is here. But let's say the guideline says you should get somewhere between 2 and 5 and, in fact -- between 8 and 10, and, in fact, the right guideline was 2 and 5. Would that be a situation where you say the balance worked out so that it would be plain error?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1891.11,1896.09,"I think it's hard to give a concrete answer based on, you know, facts like that."
2017.16-9493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1920.4,1920.58,All right.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2078.68,2081.415,"So a couple responses to that, Justice Breyer."
2017.16-9493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2161.81,2162.3,Correct.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2206.27,2206.77,So --
2017.16-9493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.77,2216.74,"As I say, we might be able to live with one mistake in one district, but then we have to distinguish which ones, and there's no way to do that. So you might end up with 50 -- the same point I'm making before."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2216.74,2216.965,Sure.
2017.16-9493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2216.965,2227.425,So I'm saying what the integrity is that is interfered with is the integrity of the congressionally-mandated purpose and method through which the guidelines are to be implemented.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2227.425,2236.375,So I don't think there's a record for -- to -- to conclude that the -- that the ordinary application of the plain error rule is going to so muck up the system as you say.
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2242.39,2264.34,"Well, Mr. Ellis, if -- if -- along those lines, though, Congress did speak to this question, the feedback loop problem that Justice Breyer has been alluding to, in 3742(f)(1), where it said if there's an error in calculating the sentencing guideline, the case shall be remanded."
2017.16-9493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2264.34,2265.05,"Yeah, that's true."
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2265.05,2269.92,"Not -- not ""may."" I take it you'd have us read ""shall"" to mean ""may."""
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2269.92,2278.355,"So I think that -- that provision, 3742(f)(1), was written to -- to deal with preserved errors in a mandatory system."
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2278.355,2283.31,"So -- well, you haven't -- you haven't suggested that the statute's ineffectual, have you?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2283.31,2284.15,I'm sorry?
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2284.15,2286.19,You'd have us just ignore the statute then?
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2286.19,2287.54,So I think there's actually a debate.
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2287.54,2288.41,I think those are your choices.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2288.41,2288.74,But now --
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2288.74,2291.74,"We either ignore the statute or we read ""shall"" to mean ""may."""
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2291.74,2293.04,"I -- I guess, respectfully, I --"
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2293.04,2293.71,Have you got a third option?
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2293.71,2294.6,-- I -- I think there is.
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2294.6,2294.7,Okay.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2294.7,2295.39,"Number one, I think in --"
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2295.39,2296.35,So what's the third option?
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2296.35,2303.38,So the third option is to read that to discuss -- to -- to refer to preserved errors and to incorporate the established rules.
2017.16-9493,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2312.21,2314.98,"Well, that ""shall"" is part of the mandatory regime."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2318.43,2322.0,"So that's the first option that he gave me, and I think that's still open to the Court."
2017.16-9493,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2329.85,2364.795,"I mean, suppose a district judge said, all right, you know, there's a dispute about which -- what the guidelines range is, and one of the guidelines that's possible here has a range that includes the sentence of 60 months, and I have considered the statutory factors that I am supposed to consider in identifying a just and appropriate sentence and I think 60 months hits it right on the -- the head, and that's the sentence that I'm going to impose and I would impose that sentence no matter what the guidelines said. Would there be a problem there?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2364.795,2365.78,There would not.
2017.16-9493,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2374.3,2382.03,"But that would be -- if -- if ""shall"" is taken literally, there would still -- that -- that would still be subject to reversal, wouldn't it?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2382.03,2383.2,I think that's right.
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2406.73,2408.86,"Before you -- before we leave that, I'd just like to nail this down --"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2408.86,2409.03,Sure.
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2409.03,2431.24,"-- because the harmless error rule makes sense to me in Williams in light -- in light of the language because the court has to determine the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guideline, and if it's harmless, it wasn't imposed as a result of. But how do you -- how do you get plain error into this rule? How do you get, you know, that problem solved?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2431.24,2431.515,Sure.
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2431.515,2435.22,"Without turning ""shall"" into ""may"" or ignoring the statute all together?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2435.22,2482.0,"As -- I think you -- you -- you get it by -- by recognizing that that provision was passed in the backdrop of plain error, that it was talking about preserved errors, and that there's no reason to think that the Congress meant to overturn it there. And you get it by saying that -- by recognizing that that provision was enacted as part of the mandatory guideline system, that what it was doing was implementing 3742(e), which this Court said was unconstitutional in Booker and therefore struck it. And so I think there's a decent -- a very good argument that, in fact, with it goes the -- the subsequent provision that says when you violate a provision, an unconstitutional provision in 3742(e), here's what you do. And so, in this case, as I say, there are three principal reasons why we think the error does not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Number 1, the sentence that was imposed fell within the corrected range."
2017.16-9493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2503.98,2507.7,"Wait just a second. Just in case you know this, I mean, I should know it, but -- I wrote it."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2507.7,2508.38,I probably should too.
2017.16-9493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2508.38,2509.68,But I don't necessarily.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2518.44,2523.255,"No, the Court didn't. There was a -- there was a dispute about whether (f) would go down with (e)."
2017.16-9493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2523.255,2523.83,Yeah.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2523.83,2532.01,"It was subsequently -- Justice Scalia subsequently wrote about it in a concurrence in Rita, and then the Court wrote about it in Footnote 7 of the majority opinion in Greenlaw."
2017.16-9493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2532.01,2533.195,"My goodness, that's very good."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2535.745,2537.11,"It's an open question, I think."
2017.16-9493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2537.11,2538.42,"It's an open question, okay."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2539.59,2553.87,"We don't think it needs to be resolved in this case because we do think it's talking about preserved errors and the plain error rule would apply. Number 3 -- the number 3 reason is the district court imposed not just a sentence pegged to the bottom or top of what it thought was the correct range but somewhere in the middle, albeit in the bottom half."
2017.16-9493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2553.87,2556.78,"Well, pretty -- pretty low, you know, just over the bottom."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2596.32,2597.705,"Not at all, Your Honor."
2017.16-9493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2655.315,2655.72,I'm sorry --
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2655.72,2656.83,"All those things weigh in, we think."
2017.16-9493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2656.83,2665.825,"-- when -- when you're talking about reasonableness, it seems like you're doing substantive reasonableness, which is what the Fifth Circuit was doing with its standard."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2691.9,2692.97,We think that matters.
2017.16-9493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2692.97,2693.655,All right.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2707.82,2708.625,Public reputation.
2017.16-9493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2708.625,2712.355,"Public reputation. ""Or"" is disjunctive, not conjunctive."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2712.355,2713.95,That's right.
2017.16-9493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2713.95,2716.425,So why isn't it unfair?
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2716.425,2718.235,We think it's not unfair because --
2017.16-9493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2718.235,2720.005,But that's a procedural right.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2722.42,2737.31,"So a couple responses to that, Your Honor. We think it's not unfair because the contemporaneous objection rule is the ordinary rule, and we think in the ordinary case, that applying that rule and the consequences of that rule is fair. We think it's -- it's reasonable to look at the substantive result --"
2017.16-9493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2737.31,2740.32,That's not what this fourth prong says.
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2765.39,2771.085,I think what's fair is that -- I think it -- a system has to have rules and those rules have to have consequences.
2017.16-9493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2809.87,2830.84,"Well, but there again Molina-Martinez is against you, right, because, in that case, we talked about the fact that a remand for resentencing -- I'm quoting now -- ""while not costless, does not involve the same difficulties as a remand for retrial."" And we talked about the government had this concern over judicial resources, and we specifically rejected that."
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2839.575,2842.46,So what the Court said is that it's not the same as a retrial.
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2861.515,2892.29,"If we're going to compare the -- the cost empirically of the two systems, wouldn't we have to account for the fact that under the regime you propose there are a lot more appeals that the courts of appeals have to resolve? In the circuits where this rule exists or this presumption exists, the government frequently confesses error to mathematical mistakes in the guidelines applications and it automatically goes back for resentencing without the need of -- of appellate resources being involved. Should that be a cost that we should consider or -- or is that one you would have us ignore?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2892.29,2896.75,"So, to be clear, it's my position that cost is not relevant to applying the standard."
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2897.09,2900.015,Are you including the fourth prong as well? It's irrelevant there too?
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2900.015,2900.6,Yes.
2017.16-9493,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2916.6,2920.5,"That's -- that's just an argument against the plain error rule all together, isn't it?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2920.5,2930.59,"No, I don't think it is. It's an error for -- for keeping the plain error rule to be a narrow one, to be strictly circumscribed, to maintain the balance between Rule 51 and Rule 52 and maintain the incentives."
2017.16-9493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2936.16,2936.74,Are there --
2017.16-9493,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2936.74,2937.21,If the plain error --
2017.16-9493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2937.21,2947.52,"-- are there some courts -- and I -- I don't mean to be facetious because I think I remember, are there some courts of appeals that just write the district judge a letter and say would it make a difference?"
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2947.52,2950.74,So there is this limited remand procedure that the Court identified --
2017.16-9493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2950.74,2951.18,Limited remand?
2017.16-9493,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,2951.18,2951.57,Yes.
2017.16-9493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2989.045,2993.52500005,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Davidson, seven minutes."
2017.16-9493,2,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,2993.52500005,3037.965,I'd like to start with what Justice Breyer said about the guidelines as being a specialized body of guidance that has specialized proceedings. And we can't ignore the context and the essential framework of the guidelines and the Court's decisions regarding how those guidelines function just because we're under the fourth prong. And so we disagree that the -- that the factors that the government considers are even appropriate because they're directly at odds with the clear guidance the Court has provided. I also want to address the discussion about 3742.
2017.16-9493,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3092.34,3098.345,Would you draw a distinction between guidelines errors and other sentencing errors?
2017.16-9493,2,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,3098.345,3099.585,Yes.
2017.16-9493,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3099.585,3103.19,And what would be the ground for that?
2017.16-9493,2,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,3103.19,3116.36,It would depend on the direct effect the particular sentencing error would have on the outcome and whether or not the error frustrated the purposes served by the rule in question.
2017.16-9493,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3120.46,3130.04999995,Suppose there was a question about whether a defendant was properly treated as a recidivist.
2017.16-9493,2,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,3130.04999995,3147.545,"That would -- if I understand the question correctly, it would be a district court's evaluation of the conduct as -- as opposed to the guideline."
2017.16-9493,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3150.01,3158.53,"No, I'm talking about a non-guidelines issue, a statutory issue where there's a heavier sentence imposed based on prior criminal conduct."
2017.16-9493,2,62899,kristin_l_davidson,,3158.53,3188.435,"If it were erroneous and that's what the -- if it were erroneous and the district -- and the record demonstrated that the district court was influenced in -- in choosing its sentence because of that error, then I think that it would reflect an error that improperly influences the discretion of the district court and could be serious enough to meet all four prongs. Thank you."
2017.16-9493,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3188.435,3189.775,"Thank you, counsel."
