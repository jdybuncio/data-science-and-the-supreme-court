1975.74-730,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,32.054,"We will hear arguments next in 74-730, Roemer against the Board of Public Works."
1975.74-730,0,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,33.734,37.31,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-730,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,149.734,151.88,But there is some limitation?
1975.74-730,0,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,151.88,162.221,"The only use restriction, Mr. Justice Brennan, is found in Section 68 (a) of the Act which states that no money shall be used for sectarian purposes."
1975.74-730,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,442.699,449.594,(Inaudible) Straighten me out on one thing. Western Maryland College is no longer in the case?
1975.74-730,0,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,449.594,450.31,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-730,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.31,453.297,And how and why did they opt out?
1975.74-730,0,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,453.297,460.105,A settlement was reached between Western Maryland College and the appellants.
1975.74-730,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.105,466.371,How does one settle a case such as this where you are dealing with a state statute?
1975.74-730,0,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,466.371,475.308,"Western Maryland College, Your Honor, through the litigation had taken the position that it was not a church-related college."
1975.74-730,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,494.959,497.711,Could you describe what the vestiges were?
1975.74-730,0,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,497.711,500.462,"I can describe some of them, Your Honor."
1975.74-730,1,25848,george_a_nilson,,2639.303,2642.745,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,3709.506,3715.974,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-730,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4068.963,4074.565,"Mr. Connolly, how would you interpret that response?"
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4078.269,4078.564,Question --
1975.74-730,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4078.564,4081.052,-- theology was or unbelievers generally?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4081.052,4083.536,I believe he was generally questioning everything.
1975.74-730,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4105.08,4114.689,"As long as you have paused, Mr. Connolly, did Mr. Greenwald not said that Notre Dame had some kind of policy given to Roman Catholics?"
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4114.689,4114.858,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-730,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4114.858,4117.546,Is that true or false?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4117.546,4119.149,"So far as it goes, it is true."
1975.74-730,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4545.135,4575.483,"Mr. Connolly, are you suggesting by your discussion of these findings, the conclusions that were drawn from, that the secondary purpose of the colleges here is essentially the same or nearly the same as the service academies of the United States government in West Point, Annapolis, and the others providing a chapel and chaplains?"
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4575.483,4587.874,"I certainly do, Your Honor, and I would hope that most of the private colleges of this country also have a secondary objective of improving the spiritual development of the students who attend those schools."
1975.74-730,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4598.294,4601.868,"Chaplains of all different faiths, they do not just have one?"
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4601.868,4603.174,"So do these schools, Your Honor."
1975.74-730,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4603.174,4604.121,Is that not right?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4604.121,4604.668,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-730,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4606.072,4606.894,They do?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4606.894,4607.585,Yes.
1975.74-730,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4607.585,4608.523,Do the record show that?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4608.523,4609.127,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-730,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4609.127,4611.49,Thank you.
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4611.49,4616.553,"To be honest about it, the great majority of them are Catholic."
1975.74-730,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4616.553,4622.03,Did Notre Dame have all?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4622.03,4622.835,"I am not sure about that, Your Honor."
1975.74-730,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4622.835,4625.394,"They had to change names, would they not?"
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4625.394,4628.513,I do not think so.
1975.74-730,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4640.169,4641.731,I thought it was in Baltimore?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4641.731,4642.25,I beg you?
1975.74-730,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4642.25,4643.185,I know a little bit about Baltimore.
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4643.185,4644.164,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-730,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4644.164,4647.204,"Mr. Connolly, the reference to West Point raises this question in my mind."
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4658.598,4659.627,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-730,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4659.627,4660.185,Why not?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4660.185,4668.934,"Because some of the activities, some of the funds of these schools are spent for frank religious activities."
1975.74-730,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4670.705,4678.146,"It is true, as the Chief Justiceâ€™s question has suggested it, Annapolis, West Point, and the Air Force Academy and the other places?"
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4678.146,4680.402,I do not want to argue that case.
1975.74-730,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4680.402,4681.695,It is factually true?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4681.695,4688.857,That is true and it may be that someone someday will bring a case arguing that that is impermissible.
1975.74-730,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4694.221,4696.799,Do you care to show how large the total budget of these schools is?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4701.402,4704.148,"No, Your Honor, but we have a key."
1975.74-730,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4964.134,4965.58,Can I ask you another question?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,4974.887,5003.393,"I think not and I think if Your Honor would read the testimony of the administrators and the faculty members of this school, you will see that they were churchmen and proud of it and they did not attempt at all to modify their positions and they made very clear that whatever the perception was in the past that no longer is there an attempt to inculcate religious values in the academic aspects here."
1975.74-730,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5003.393,5005.404,That cuts the other way in answer to my question.
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,5010.714,5016.476,"No, I think you will find no inhibitions in this at all."
1975.74-730,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5016.534,5020.733,They would run the schools precisely as they would run them were they no state program?
1975.74-730,2,37757,paul_r_connolly,,5020.733,5021.536,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-730,3,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,5422.129,5423.37,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.74-730,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5467.55,5468.332,Mr. Greenwald.
1975.74-730,3,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,5468.332,5469.678,"Yes, sir?"
1975.74-730,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5469.678,5474.3,What percentage of the population the City of Baltimore is Catholic?
1975.74-730,3,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,5474.3,5475.887,"I cannot answer that, Your Honor."
1975.74-730,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5479.237,5481.455,I will ask the same question of the State of Maryland?
1975.74-730,3,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,5481.455,5485.241,"I do not know that either, Your Honor."
1975.74-730,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5485.241,5497.237,"Those percentages approximated some of the other percentages that had been presented here, might not that comparison have some significance?"
1975.74-730,3,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,5497.237,5503.431,Not in the context of the number of clergy which belonged to the faculty.
1975.74-730,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5509.874,5518.484,"It has some significance as compared with the religious preferences of the student body, does it not?"
1975.74-730,3,34466,lawrence_s_greenwald,,5518.484,5521.262,"Yes, it would have."
1975.74-730,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5523.922,5525.973,"Gentlemen, the case is submitted."
