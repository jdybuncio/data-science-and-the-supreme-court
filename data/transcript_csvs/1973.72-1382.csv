1973.72-1382,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,71.249,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-1382, Rich against United States for the use of Industrial Lumber Co."
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,76.66,80.201,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,149.831,152.707,Are you bringing the interest question here?
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,152.707,158.545,"No, Your Honor, I think it will -- I am not prepared to argue that."
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,158.545,161.086,Are you abandoning then?
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,161.086,162.559,I think we briefed it shortly.
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,162.559,165.137,You have briefed it that’s why I’m asking.
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,165.137,172.211,"We briefed it, I’m not abandoning in it but it do have three other issues that I would like to argue that I think are more --"
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,172.211,188.13,"My question is, as I read your brief you bring all five points here, and yet in your petition for certiorari you cover only three, and therefore, I asked why they’re trying to bring all five as a violation of our Rule 40."
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,188.13,191.339,I am sorry.
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,191.339,195.175,Maybe that’s something you can take up later but --
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,195.175,203.484,If that is true.
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,203.484,209.274,The two in question are the interest point and the --
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,209.274,211.647,"And the 90-day, the standard."
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,211.647,213.898,"Point number two, the extension --"
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,213.898,215.693,"Yes, the standard of the 90 days."
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,215.693,217.686,Right.
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,217.686,226.41,"I think that is true and I do believe that there has been an inadvertent violation of your rules, if it is so then I stand correct and I will --"
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,226.41,229.327,I suspect those two issues are not here but --
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,229.327,236.677,"I did not intend to argue them in any event, and I will abide by the Court’s rules on the matter."
1973.72-1382,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.151,400.386,"A materialman can get a relief, but the supplier to the materialman cannot."
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,400.386,400.918,Yes.
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,833.979,837.08,"Well, the reason you had a different surety is because it was a different job."
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,837.08,838.095,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,838.118,844.294,And that these two shipments come to California clearly it would be under the Transamerica bond.
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,844.294,847.657,No question Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1973.72-1382,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,898.644,903.693,"Well, that’s a contradiction in terms so far as normal legal usage is concerned, isn't it?"
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,909.157,912.697,"But this, you know, this is semantic problem."
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1288.849,1295.887,"Mr. Gochberg, on the attorney’s fee point you do have the Richter case going for you, don’t you?"
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,1295.887,1301.285,"Yes, but that is an interpretation by a state court of a state law."
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1301.285,1304.336,Well --
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,1304.336,1305.157,And literally --
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1305.157,1308.01,Isn’t that something in your favor?
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,1308.01,1323.014,"Well, I think I have the Fleischmann case that this Court decided in our favor, because I think the remedy under the Miller Act which says exactly what the subcontractor, a materialman is to recover is identical with the remedy set forth in the Lanham Act."
1973.72-1382,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1346.725,1353.974,"But if you could win on state ground, you just sue and win on that ground, wouldn’t you, in this case?"
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,1353.974,1362.566,"As an old member of the Department of Justice and an associate of Mr. Freidman, I would hope to win on a broader issue, but I wouldn’t like to win on anything."
1973.72-1382,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1377.769,1385.1,"Well, Judge Wisdom’s opinion on Red Top refers to state law for the source of attorney’s fees, doesn’t it, and pretty much as the Ninth Circuit?"
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,1385.1,1388.761,"Yes, and he certainly held there that -- but he said he’s not compelled."
1973.72-1382,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1402.509,1416.29,"Well, then one of your arguments I suppose is that the Miller Act is really a substitute not for a state Miller Act, but for the private materialman’s lien that you have in a private job and there you don’t get attorney’s fees under California Law."
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,1416.29,1424.057,"You don’t get it under California Law, and you don’t get it under Connecticut Law, and you don’t get it under any law unless you have a statute which gives it to you."
1973.72-1382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1426.909,1429.283,"Well, you say Fleischmann ought to apply it exactly."
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,1429.283,1430.343,I’m saying Fleischmann.
1973.72-1382,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1444.623,1446.144,Give towards an amount?
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,1446.144,1449.518,"Give towards an amount, but I will accept your suggestion."
1973.72-1382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.979,1486.363,(Inaudible)
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,1486.363,1488.131,"No, no, that face you always had."
1973.72-1382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1488.131,1489.699,As the fund.
1973.72-1382,0,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,1489.699,1490.31,As the fund.
1973.72-1382,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1558.85,1562.341,Mr. Harlowe.
1973.72-1382,1,21010,dennis_s_harlowe,,1562.341,1565.959,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1382,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1696.737,1705.072,You’re not purporting to say though that the Federal Court could override the decision of the California Court of Appeal with respect to state law in any event?
1973.72-1382,1,21010,dennis_s_harlowe,,1705.072,1717.276,"No, Your Honor, I think all that we’re saying and all that the Chevron Asphalt case has said, and all that the Ninth Circuit in our case has said is that case did not make such a decision."
1973.72-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.431,1893.48,"Well, Mr. Harlowe, why isn’t it then that you look to state law for deciding whether under the Miller Act you get attorney’s fees?"
1973.72-1382,1,21010,dennis_s_harlowe,,1893.48,1901.464,"Because there is no other way Your Honor, to define what type of recovery is intended in a Miller Act case."
1973.72-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1937.444,1946.393,"Okay, now but then if you look to California Law on that kind of a lien, you don’t get attorney’s fees, do you?"
1973.72-1382,1,21010,dennis_s_harlowe,,1946.393,1947.34,"Yes, you do."
1973.72-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1947.34,1952.888,On a private materialman’s action without the state being involved in any way?
1973.72-1382,1,21010,dennis_s_harlowe,,1956.232,1957.721,Oh! Excuse me.
1973.72-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1967.548,1968.852,But you say that under the appellate --
1973.72-1382,1,21010,dennis_s_harlowe,,1968.852,1970.323,"Now, you get them in both sides."
1973.72-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1970.323,1978.14,Under California Law you get attorney’s fees now even though it’s a private party on all sides and private ownership of the land?
1973.72-1382,1,21010,dennis_s_harlowe,,1978.14,1980.055,Yes.
1973.72-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.834,2049.965,"But, that isn’t the ground that Court of Appeals told you, is it?"
1973.72-1382,1,21010,dennis_s_harlowe,,2069.719,2086.009,"Yes, Your Honor the one point that we made there that did not prevail in the Court of Appeals, perhaps I shouldn’t say not prevail, you notice on a footnote in their decision they say that we urged at that time that it should be made retroactive if that’s necessary."
1973.72-1382,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2342.079,2342.729,Thank you Mr. Harlowe.
1973.72-1382,2,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,2344.25,2350.125,Yes I have.
1973.72-1382,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2397.016,2398.504,Though the land was in California?
1973.72-1382,2,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,2398.504,2399.169,Yes.
1973.72-1382,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2399.169,2403.783,"Well, then if you are talking about the substitute materialman’s bond, you’re talking about California Law."
1973.72-1382,2,34465,lawrence_gochberg,,2403.783,2414.251,"Yes, I understand that, but I am not -- but I am pointing out to you that there is a vice in my opinion in allowing the various state law."
1973.72-1382,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2562.916,2563.695,Thank you gentlemen.
