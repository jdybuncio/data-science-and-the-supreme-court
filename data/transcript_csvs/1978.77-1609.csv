1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.848,We'll hear arguments next in Torres against Puerto Rico.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,84.925,88.211,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,108.656,125.408,"Now in that you include I take it the power to examine everything that comes in, just the way customs agents do at Mexican border or anywhere else, is that what you mean to embrace by indiscriminate?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,125.408,138.499,"What I mean to embrace by indiscriminate is as the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico found, the statute Public Law 22 authorizes the individual police officer, not a customs official, but the individual police officer."
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,138.499,144.35,Does it make any difference whether it is a police officer or a customs official or what name you give the person?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,144.35,147.309,"Well, I think it makes a substantial difference."
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,154.326,157.61,That's what I am trying to get at.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,157.61,163.824,So let me get to that question then directly and take up the others later.
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,229.298,235.279,"You are limiting that of course to travelers from the United States, aren't you?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,235.279,249.808,"Well, that is great, that is what the statute says, but that is what a border is all about; people coming from one place to the other regardless of whether they are residents of Puerto Rico or the United States mainland."
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,342.191,347.406,Couldn't the United States put policemen on the border between Mexico and the United States?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,347.406,348.424,Absolutely.
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,348.424,352.894,"As such, there is no magic in the word customs, is there?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,352.894,355.301,There is no magic in the word customs.
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,360.371,363.756,There is and I am talking about the Mexican border right now.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,363.756,364.396,"Absolutely, you can put –-"
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,364.396,369.183,They are customs agents. Could they change their title to policemen?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,369.183,369.838,Absolutely.
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,369.838,371.251,And do the same thing?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,371.251,372.734,Absolutely.
1978.77-1609,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,423.957,427.046,Let me ask something about fact here.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,431.578,434.661,"He is a United States citizen, I am not sure if the record reflects that fact."
1978.77-1609,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,436.545,438.17,Where does he reside?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,438.17,441.319,He resides in the State of Florida.
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.319,445.773,"Mr. Remcho, you are arguing the Fourth Amendment here I take it."
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,454.698,465.482,"The Fourth Amendment in my view clearly limits the authority of the Puerto Rican legislature, that is correct, and I would say in any one of the four rationale that we set forth in our brief."
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.482,474.552,Either because it is analogous to a state and the Fourth Amendment is incorporated by the Fourteenth?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,474.552,474.74,No.
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,499.434,509.211,"We are on pretty thin ground, if you are persuaded by my dissent in Otero, since you presumably have eight people versus one person?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,509.211,519.629,"Well, I am persuaded only by the point that the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply directly in the same fashion as if Puerto Rico were a state."
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,564.307,568.694,"So, and the Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,568.694,570.022,That is correct.
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.022,582.779,"Now, I take it in times of emergency, a city or a particular area can declare a curfew that it couldn't declare it other times without violating the Fourth Amendment?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,582.779,590.14,I suppose that would depend very much on the facts of the situation but I concede that is possible at some point.
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,590.14,616.117,"So supposing that Puerto Rican legislature here had decided that there was, and I gather from the opinions of the three justices in the minority in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico that there was a real crime wave and a drug wave in Puerto Rico and that a great deal of it was the result of people coming into Puerto Rico from the United States."
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,631.43,633.2,I do think it is wholly unreasonable.
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,674.229,674.775,Two centuries.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,674.775,678.192,"Two centuries, excuse me, almost two centuries."
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.192,682.857,You won on this issue?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,682.857,683.775,I am sorry.
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.775,687.493,"You won on this issue, the Puerto Rican Supreme Court agreed with you?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,687.493,688.72,That is correct.
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.72,700.099,"And as I read the brief of your colleague on the bottom side of this case, he does not dispute that decision now."
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,700.099,701.574,I read it the same way.
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.574,709.86,"And, so there is no issue between you on the Fourth Amendment or on the ability to search or on the border question?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,709.86,712.924,I think that is probably correct.
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.279,719.402,Oh!
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,732.393,738.4,"Well, if in fact he has conceded the Fourth Amendment issue, I do not care about the other issue, because that decides this case."
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.4,746.419,"Well, I know, but I would think you would because there is a judgment outstanding against you."
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,746.419,747.05,If this Court --
1978.77-1609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.05,760.441,"If we agree with you and apparently your colleague about the Fourth Amendment issue, then since we do not have any such ""super-majority"" rule here, we would simply reverse the judgment, wouldn't we?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,760.441,762.271,"That is what I am asking, and I think --"
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,762.271,763.742,Wouldn't it follow?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,763.742,766.302,"Yes, it would, that is what we would ask the Court to do."
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,766.302,770.434,"We would have to hold that it is unconstitutional to have that ""super-majority""?"
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,770.434,777.071,Why would we?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,777.071,778.361,Why would you have to hold that it is unconstitutional?
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,778.361,780.926,Is there not a judgment outstanding against you now?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,780.926,783.722,"That is correct, okay."
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.071,831.184,"You suppose this could be an adequate state ground on direct appeal, but nevertheless not bar federal habeas corpus?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,835.577,840.321,"I do not think, it was not decided on an adequate -- the judgment entered was against --"
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.321,849.105,I know it was decided that they – the court below refused to get you relief because a majority of that court did not join in the opinion?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,849.105,850.619,That is correct.
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,850.619,871.192,"Which is a characteristic of local law, and if we can redirect another judgment to be entered by that court unless we hold that provision is unconstitutional."
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,871.192,871.714,I think you can.
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.714,881.674,"Perhaps a federal habeas corpus court can order release because in that event, there would be no necessity to declare anything unconstitutional?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,881.674,883.727,I think you can and the reason is this.
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,911.2,912.135,That you were right --
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,912.135,912.741,You were right --
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.741,913.637,That you were quite right.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,913.637,919.943,"Yes, and as soon as we tell the Court that and declare that this statute is unconstitutional, then that Court --"
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.943,927.997,"They have already declared it, but they say we have no power under the Puerto Rican Law to reverse this judgment; we just do not have that power?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,927.997,928.724,I understand that.
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.018,951.633,"You say the Akron against Bryant point may well be an adequate state ground, but the decision on the merits of the Fourth Amendment question is not?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,951.633,956.787,"No, I am not saying that the Akron versus Bryant may be inadequate state ground at all."
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.521,991.906,Do you think the rule of the majority rule applies to declarations of unconstitutionality?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,991.906,1002.986,"That is what the statute -- the constitution provision says that, that particular Court may not hold a statute unconstitutional without that ""super-majority""."
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1008.361,1016.522,It does not say that it may not satisfy judgments for reasons of unconstitutionality?
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1016.522,1023.672,Couldn't the Court have reversed the judgment in this and not violated the statute?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1023.672,1025.881,And not violated Public Law 22?
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1025.881,1029.295,Yes.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1029.295,1031.874,The Court's specific holding --
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1031.874,1041.598,"Four-to-three, four-to-three say that this judgment must be reversed?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1041.598,1042.522,I think --
1978.77-1609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1042.522,1044.943,Without any reference to the Puerto Rico statute?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1044.943,1047.626,I think there are two responses to that.
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.626,1048.352,They did not think so.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1048.352,1050.119,First is they did not think so.
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1058.614,1060.787,And they are bound to that?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1060.787,1075.202,"Yes, under this Court's decision in Fornaro, you are bound by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's interpretation of its own constitutional provision unless that interpretation is inescapably wrong, and it certainly not inescapably wrong."
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1076.418,1082.992,But the thing that really bothers me is Puerto Rico required to give you an appeal [Inaudible]
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1082.992,1083.733,Yes.
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1083.733,1084.759,By what?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1084.759,1088.256,By Puerto Rico criminal statutes by Rule 3 of the --
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1088.256,1090.182,Not by our constitution?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1090.182,1091.089,"That is correct, no."
1978.77-1609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1091.089,1100.643,"What case of controversy in this Court, in light of the Puerto Rico's position in this Court, what is the case of controversy over the Fourth Amendment?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1100.643,1103.409,The controversy is --
1978.77-1609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.409,1113.357,"Over the Fourth Amendment, only over that question?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1113.357,1118.536,"I would say if the state now concedes that issue, there is no more controversy --"
1978.77-1609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1118.536,1120.299,"Incidentally, Puerto Rico is not a state, is it?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1120.299,1121.951,"It's correct, thank you."
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.962,1139.452,But they still could not enter the declaration?
1978.77-1609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1139.452,1144.749,Unless one of dissenters below now joined the four majority.
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1144.749,1160.288,We just remand it then for reconsideration in light of this concession; that would not change the result if everybody stays for years and they obey the rule because the rule still forbid them from declaring the statute unconstitutional.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1160.288,1161.688,Let me put it differently.
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1162.629,1181.0,Let us begin that at 1 o'clock.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1183.807,1186.612,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.505,1240.136,"Well, that might be true when the lower court happen to disagree, but it did not?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1240.136,1244.138,"Well, the judgment of the lower court is still a contrary."
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1244.138,1250.042,The only reason you lost in the lower court was because of the local rule about upsetting a statute?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1250.042,1254.098,"Well, if Puerto Rico had a rule which say that –-"
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1254.098,1256.936,"Isn't that right, they have agreed with you on the Fourth Amendment?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1256.936,1257.813,"They did, that is correct."
1978.77-1609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1257.813,1258.564,Four–to–two?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1258.564,1262.28,"Four–to–two, that is right."
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.064,1326.089,"But it has decided the appeal, it is affirmed that your client is, one of my colleagues pointed out before, has a judgment of conviction outstanding against him, so that however, whatever the voting rules are down there in San Juan, you lost?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1326.089,1330.634,"That is right we lost, but we can hardly be in a worst position than if we had no right to appeal at all."
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1347.28,1349.575,Did it not rule on the appeal?
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1349.575,1350.829,It affirmed the judgment.
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1350.829,1351.36,Yeah.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1351.36,1356.604,"Okay, but on the grounds it was paroles to do otherwise and that is no different, than if there were no appeal available at all."
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1356.604,1360.642,"Well, is that quite an accurate description of that."
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1373.073,1390.356,"No, it does not because if that is a valid rule, the effect of upholding that rule is to leave a statute which the government of Puerto Rico itself concedes is not constitutional in full place and in full effect."
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1390.356,1399.89,"You say that is not in adequate state ground too, beside the case is on, this special majority rule?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1399.89,1404.767,I think the adequate state ground thing is somewhat different.
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.362,1444.416,"What if it had happened that your Fourth Amendment issue had not been properly raised in the lower court and the Puerto Rican Supreme Court said, we just will not rule on that, because you did not raise it as our rules require and so we affirm the judgment."
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1456.541,1476.414,"Well, the Court has in the past with respect to procedural rules other than even handed -- procedure rules which interfere with the vindication of federal constitutional rights have not stuck down in the past by the Court, which have been –-"
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1476.414,1480.833,"[Inaudible] procedural rule, is it not a procedural rule."
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1499.522,1502.071,"That is it for my client; he is facing three years in jail, I agree."
1978.77-1609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1502.071,1503.871,He is in jail.
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1503.871,1506.287,"That is all we got, did not?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1506.287,1507.686,That is right.
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1508.273,1510.688,Where did you call this procedural?
1978.77-1609,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1510.688,1516.029,"On the habeas corpus issue, under Stone against Powell, is habeas corpus is available?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1516.029,1518.383,I think that is an open question.
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.673,1572.625,If the supreme Court of Puerto Rico -- if the constituent act said in so many words that the supreme Court of Puerto Rico will not consider any United States constitutional claims in hearing an appeal from a conviction.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1591.959,1596.335,Is not in the effect of two are the same?
1978.77-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.335,1598.376,We are about not of one mind.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1598.376,1599.638,I gather that.
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.638,1610.566,"But I have to talk, it would be very hard for the lower court to enter a judgment contrary to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico which has already affirmed the judgment?"
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1610.566,1612.571,"I agree, I think that would be extraordinarily --"
1978.77-1609,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1612.571,1613.091,Difficult.
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1613.091,1626.677,"-- difficult, yes and that is why I think for reasons of judicial economy and also because this case has been fully briefed to the Court, that in order to be guided by the government's concession that they do not even think this mean unconstitutional in order to decide the issue."
1978.77-1609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1626.677,1634.22,"Are you suggesting, your client faces three years in jail because the judgment of conviction was affirmed."
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1656.084,1661.365,"Well, I think you can set the judgment of conviction aside and declare the statute unconstitutional without ignoring what the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico said."
1978.77-1609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1661.365,1676.484,"I know, but obviously everything that was said in your Supreme Court had no bearing on the judgment that was actually handed, that is affirmance of the conviction."
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1676.484,1678.675,I am not sure that it had no bearing.
1978.77-1609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1682.519,1688.498,"Well, surely nothing that was said on the side of the Four support the affirmance of the conviction."
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1688.498,1690.019,That is correct.
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1690.019,1698.209,"What we would do, we would reverse the judgment on the basis of the majority opinion."
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1698.209,1701.245,That is what you are asking us to do.
1978.77-1609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1701.245,1703.457,[Inaudible]
1978.77-1609,0,32699,joseph_remcho,,1703.457,1705.371,"Well, I would like to see it in the books."
1978.77-1609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1711.73,1717.014,You have not much chance to argue [Inaudible]
1978.77-1609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1717.014,1717.968,That is all argued.
1978.77-1609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1720.546,1723.38,Can you get us out of this Mr. Armstrong?
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,1723.38,1729.815,"I will try, Chief Justice, and thank you and may it please the Court."
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2091.342,2093.21,Let me see if I understand you Mr. Armstrong.
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2127.802,2128.553,Correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2128.553,2137.61,"Well, now what provision in the federal constitution would you say he had to assert, had been violated by not reversing the conviction on this?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2137.61,2140.757,I would say that that is a federal ground for reversal.
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2140.757,2141.854,What is it?
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2141.854,2146.936,"The federal ground was that the reasonable, probably unreasonableness of the search."
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2146.936,2148.243,I am sorry I did not catch that Mr. Armstrong.
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2148.243,2161.948,"The probable or reasonableness of the statute, of the evidences of the search, on what the evidence was."
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2166.43,2183.023,"Well I know, but I thought what you told me was that what you should have done was file a petition for rehearing and say that it could not apply the state constitutional provision requiring five votes, because this was a federal constitutional determination by four that the statute was unconstitutional."
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2183.023,2183.974,On federal grounds.
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2183.974,2195.198,"On federal grounds and therefore that they could not affirm the judgment of conviction under the state constitutional, Puerto Rico constitutional provision, but had to reverse it."
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2197.671,2199.259,The supremacy clause.
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2199.259,2200.329,The supremacy clause.
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2200.329,2220.59,Because the judges were bound by the supremacy clause which says that they shall rule on the federal law notwithstanding any provision in the constitution or the laws of the state to be contrary.
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2254.567,2256.89,And therefore you say the appeal should be dismissed?
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2256.89,2257.328,The appeal should be --
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2257.328,2259.354,The appeal to this Court be dismissed?
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2259.354,2273.978,"The appeal in this Court should be dismissed, probably as they are consolidated them on a reasonable grounds for a federal habeas because he has been has got that four-to-three decision there."
1978.77-1609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2317.061,2325.986,"But Mr. Armstrong, you do not doubt, do you, that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has entered a judgment affirming the conviction?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2325.986,2328.54,"No, that is a matter of record."
1978.77-1609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.31,2350.5,Does the constitution of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico required an affirmance in this case?
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2350.5,2368.054,"Requires on affirmance of the conviction because based on their own concept, they cannot decide that the statute is unconstitutional, because only four judges out of eight voted for the unconstitutionality."
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.143,2387.1,But what could have been done then?
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2387.1,2392.526,"Well, Your Honor, I really if it was in the case of that Nixon versus."
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2392.526,2394.515,You never foreclosing that --
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2394.515,2397.052,They say that the --
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2397.052,2399.727,"Do you have eight-member court, do you?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2399.727,2414.326,"Powell, Nixon versus Powell case, he says that the ultimate goal of a criminal procedure is a search for guilt or finding of guilt or the decision on guilt."
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.356,2425.471,"I do not have anything in my question that involve innocence, guilt, or anything else."
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2430.251,2433.891,He had the right to file a petition for rehearing ten days after the judgment --
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2433.891,2439.049,Then that could have been done by the seven people involved.
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2439.049,2443.929,They could listen to the argument on federal supremacy.
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2443.929,2450.369,What could they have done said that statute was – that constitution was unconstitutional?
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2450.369,2452.303,"No, not necessarily but they have to say --"
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2452.303,2453.989,What could they have said?
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2453.989,2474.372,"They could have said that when the statute conflicts with federal law, the rule because Puerto Rican constitutional rule does not apply, that it only applies to unconstitutionality base."
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2474.372,2480.294,And therefore is the man released or still here?
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2480.294,2482.084,"We will be releasing in that case, we have problem."
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2482.084,2483.252,He would be released.
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2483.252,2501.831,"He will be released if they found that there was a conflict that rendered, that they eliminated the bar, that these are raised by this Puerto Rican constitutional provision against the clearing along constitutional except [Inaudible]"
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2501.831,2505.935,But they knew they were dealing with a federal question?
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2505.935,2510.85,They should have known what that – the point was not there specifically raised then.
1978.77-1609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2517.07,2531.3,"But Mr. Armstrong, you are saying that the defendant is in a worse position because three of the justices disagreed with him than he would have been if all seven justices disagreed with him?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2531.3,2532.318,Why he will be in a worse?
1978.77-1609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2532.318,2543.39,"Well, if all seven justices had rejected his constitutional claim, the judgment would have been affirmed and the statute would have been upheld."
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2551.807,2556.209,"Well, it would be the same situation again."
1978.77-1609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2620.769,2651.893,"Supposing the Puerto Rican constitution went even further than it does now and said that no court in Puerto Rico shall ever have a right to upset a conviction of a criminal defendant on a federal constitutional ground, couldn't a defendant who asserted a federal constitutional ground that was not heard by any of the Puerto Rican courts for that reason, nonetheless bring that case here?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2651.893,2667.367,"Well, an absolute prohibition like that is I believe that the -- on the certain circumstances may raise a compelled -- some kind of appellant review."
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2689.052,2699.031,"Mr. Armstrong, you said that the Supreme Court did not consider the federal right, I do not see anything in but federal?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2699.031,2700.083,Nothing in the record shows that.
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2701.171,2705.176,"No I am talking about the opinion of the four judges, all they talked about it?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2705.176,2708.742,They talk about the Due Process.
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2708.742,2711.168,That is right of the federal constitution.
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2711.168,2711.946,"Yes, the federal –"
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2711.946,2715.261,That is all they talked about.
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2717.711,2719.704,"They were deciding a federal question, but when --"
1978.77-1609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2719.704,2723.225,And they decided a federal question?
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2723.225,2729.168,"They left undecided a federal question, because that federal question was not brought to their attention."
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2729.168,2734.015,"Mr. Armstrong, does Puerto Rico have a post conviction procedure?"

1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2749.828,2753.999,We have all the Due Process in the federal --
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2753.999,2762.805,"In the Puerto Rico -- I keep following the state never, but Puerto Rico is not a state, but in the Puerto Rico courts, is there a post conviction proceeding?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2762.805,2764.852,There are several post conviction procedures.
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2764.852,2775.544,"Well could -- if we cannot decide this case, may the appellant go to a Puerto Rico post conviction proceeding?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2775.544,2779.058,I do not see why he cannot file the habeas corpus over there.
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2779.058,2780.574,"Well, that is a federal habeas corpus."
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2780.574,2782.712,"No, I mean a Puerto Rico habeas corpus."
1978.77-1609,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2782.712,2783.802,A Puerto Rico habeas corpus.
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2783.802,2785.834,Habeas corpus.
1978.77-1609,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2795.688,2803.585,"Mr. Armstrong, do you have some cases in this Court by any chance with respect to this?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2849.221,2862.774,"I know that at least in the Akron case, the Ohio case, they mention that the petition was not timely filed and there are other cases where they said that the --"
1978.77-1609,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.774,2864.855,"In the Ohio case, it was not timely filed?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2864.855,2875.481,It was not timely filed I believe and I meant several cases that could raise that point conservations that --
1978.77-1609,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2875.481,2882.197,"Well, so what is the answer to my question, must he present it to the state court on petition for rehearing?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2882.197,2890.313,"That is the first opportunity that he has presenting the federal claim, he must file – he must present the petition for rehearing."
1978.77-1609,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.313,2893.818,"Or if he does not, he may not come here, is that it?"
1978.77-1609,1,38574,roberto_armstrong_jr,,2893.818,2906.971,"He has not properly raised the federal question down and he cannot come here because the question has not been decided, has not been put before the court."

1978.77-1609,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2930.588,2933.893,Do you have anything further counsel?

1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,2936.941,2937.685,Thank you.
1978.77-1609,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2971.849,2972.848,And denied it?
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,2972.848,2974.214,And denied it; that is correct.
1978.77-1609,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2974.214,2986.726,And you presented the claim that this constitutional provision was invalid under the federal constitution?
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,2986.726,2988.749,That is correct.
1978.77-1609,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2990.904,2994.108,And your petition for rehearing is in the record here or not?
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,2994.108,2994.611,Yes it is.
1978.77-1609,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3033.645,3037.146,"And the Supreme Court en banc simply denied the motion, was that it?"
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3037.146,3038.268,That is correct; there was nothing about this being untimely.
1978.77-1609,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3038.268,3042.186,"Now, we do not know they denied it as out of time or --"
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3042.186,3043.12,We do not know that.
1978.77-1609,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.255,3066.893,Why is that the inference?
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3066.893,3077.58,"Because of the Section of 45 (b), which states that a petition for rehearing ought not to be filed if it is late by the clerk and then there is a certain inconsistency between that and 45 (d)."
1978.77-1609,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3077.58,3080.264,Is that a rule [Voice Overlap]
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3080.264,3083.58,"Yes, such we printed in the governments motion to dismiss or affirm at page 7."
1978.77-1609,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3083.58,3085.302,I mean that the rule itself?
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3085.302,3085.623,Yes the rule.
1978.77-1609,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3085.623,3086.577,Rule 45?
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3086.577,3087.742,"Yes, they are reprinted."
1978.77-1609,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3087.742,3088.741,At page what?
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3088.741,3091.676,Page 7 of the government's motion to dismiss or affirm.
1978.77-1609,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3091.676,3094.29,"Yes, thank you."
1978.77-1609,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.29,3108.047,Suppose they did deny it on the merits and do you want us to say that they were wrong in denying it?
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3108.047,3109.041,Sure.
1978.77-1609,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.041,3125.355,"And in namely, you want us to agree with you in your petition for rehearing and declare that, that provision of the Puerto Rican Constitution is invalid under the federal constitution?"
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3125.355,3128.059,"That is correct, I am not so sure --"
1978.77-1609,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3128.059,3133.758,Is that the least but inconsistent with the Ohio case?
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3133.758,3133.921,Oh!
1978.77-1609,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.273,3145.745,So you would really say that we should really upset the Ohio case?
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3145.745,3149.249,"I do not think it is necessary, because the Ohio had two things this case does not."
1978.77-1609,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3158.046,3166.269,"Well, several years ago, this Court upheld a 60% majority requirement for a bond approval in West Virginia, didn't it?"
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3166.269,3175.582,"Well, I think that bond approval matters and those were to civil matters have historically been treated very, very differently from the enforcement of federal constitutions rights."
1978.77-1609,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3175.582,3195.474,"Mr. Remcho, I must say, wasn't this rule 45 or rather [Inaudible] any motion for reconsideration must, if the aforementioned term of ten working days and then in the last sentence, the clerk shall deny outright any petition for extension to file a motion for reconsideration."
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3195.474,3213.773,"Well, I think there is a certain inconsistency between that and between 45(d), which appears on page 7, which says any motion for reconsideration filed out of the aforementioned terms shall be considered by the court only to the extent that it does not effect the mandate and here of course the mandate had already been stayed."
1978.77-1609,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.042,3217.966,It would have affected the mandate somewhat.
1978.77-1609,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3217.966,3220.103,But the court did deny it?
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3220.103,3222.561,"That is correct, it denied it but --"
1978.77-1609,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3222.561,3228.301,"You can say, they were so agreed by the court and say by the clerk?"
1978.77-1609,2,32699,joseph_remcho,,3228.301,3244.475,"That is correct, but the court did allow its clerk to file that petition for reconsideration and it acted on it en banc, which suggests that it gave very stressful consideration."
1978.77-1609,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3244.641,3245.733,Thank you gentlemen.
