1965.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,49.982,"Number 695, Joe Robert Collier, Petitioner, versus United States."
1965.695,0,40860,spritzer,,51.07,52.142,May it please the Court.
1965.695,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,61.615,72.955,Motion is granted.
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,72.955,73.129,May it please the Court.
1965.695,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,73.129,74.79,Mr. Denlinger.
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,74.79,79.726,May it please the Court.
1965.695,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,235.271,244.706,"Well, where is that in the record?"
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,244.706,245.924,It's on page 11.
1965.695,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,245.924,250.147,Thank you.
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,250.147,262.623,"And then, appearing on page 13 is the denial of that motion which followed within three days."
1965.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,349.065,350.387,"Mr. Denlinger, may I ask you?"
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,356.073,356.54,"Yes, sir."
1965.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,357.648,358.728,Why do we go into all of these?
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,362.515,367.468,We'd be very please to do so if the Court agrees with both the Government and with myself.
1965.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,367.468,369.095,What was the suggestion?
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,369.095,383.386,"The suggestion was that since the Government on this newly discovered ground, very newest ground, feels that the case should be sent back and if I agree on that ground, yes I do, why not simply sent it back?"
1965.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,388.566,388.681,"Then, we're talking about --"
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,388.681,389.332,He was (Voice Overlap) --
1965.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,389.332,390.437,-- what?
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,390.437,400.344,"If this Court concurs in the position of both Government and myself, I should be very happy to have the case remanded and the prior judgment vacated."
1965.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,400.344,409.908,"Oh well, I gather if that's right, if that motion for bail is to be treated as a notice of appeal and we don't have to get into all of those business of -- about the motion to (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,409.908,410.84,Exactly.
1965.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,410.84,416.25,But the question still remains whether the -- whether this Court would agree with either one of you that the --
1965.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,416.25,416.846,Or both of them.
1965.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.846,418.106,-- that the -- or that both -- or both of you --
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,418.106,418.661,Yes.
1965.695,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,418.661,426.408,-- that the -- that the Court of Appeals were stuck or the District Court or the Court of Appeals got stuck with that notice.
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,426.408,427.763,That's correct.
1965.695,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,433.536,435.942,"The Government doesn't quite conceded a way, do they?"
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,435.942,436.582,No.
1965.695,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.026,452.654,"That they're -- they -- as I read it, they choose their language rather carefully and they say this Court might properly --"
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,452.654,452.958,Yes sir.
1965.695,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,452.958,453.994,"-- reached that conclusion, they don't say --"
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,453.994,454.404,That's correct.
1965.695,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,454.404,458.298,"-- that that is the conclusion that they reached, they don't really urge that one."
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,458.298,458.592,Yes.
1965.695,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,464.614,466.475,Yes.
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,468.651,470.694,Yes.
1965.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.039,499.094,"Well, this I find -- I frankly don't follow, if the motion for a bail bond is a notice of appeal --"
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,499.094,499.623,Yes.
1965.695,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,499.623,501.193,-- then how can it be sound?
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,505.902,510.793,That's correct.
1965.695,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,510.793,521.932,"But it's equally clear that the application for bond was not denominated or intended by the -- by your -- by the petitioner as another scope here, wasn't it?"
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,521.932,522.956,That's correct.
1965.695,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,525.663,533.102,"And it didn't have -- it's also clear that it didn't contain most of what is required to be in it, in the notice of appeal (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.695,1,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,533.102,533.744,Yes.
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1008.848,1009.69,You will not take --
1965.695,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1009.69,1009.742,"Yes, yes."
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1009.742,1010.971,-- till lunch break.
1965.695,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1011.954,1013.074,Mr. Bender.
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1013.074,1014.539,May it please the Court.
1965.695,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1138.826,1143.31,What you say now is that a little stronger as I read it -- what you say in the brief.
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1143.31,1144.563,Yes.
1965.695,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1232.592,1235.025,This amount to a confession of error or doesn't it?
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1235.025,1242.17,"Well, to say it's a confession of error on -- would indicate that we think the Court of Appeals made an error."
1965.695,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1271.609,1272.268,You've taken --
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1272.268,1272.43,-- in the court below.
1965.695,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1272.43,1275.706,You've taken this point one little baby step by a time?
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1297.292,1299.953,"Well, it doesn't bother me to call it a confession or I just didn't want to suggest --"
1965.695,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1299.953,1300.821,"Certainly, how long?"
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1300.821,1302.998,-- that the Court of Appeals had done anything wrong.
1965.695,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1310.128,1311.014,You couldn't?
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1311.014,1320.631,We did suggest at that stage if the Court might remand it to the court below because it seemed the question which could appropriately be considered by them in the first place since it amounted to the interpretation of the document.
1965.695,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1329.053,1333.88,"Well, except you filed that -- you filed that motion after their petition for certiorari had been granted --"
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1333.88,1333.908,That's --
1965.695,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1333.908,1345.367,"-- and the case had been set for argument, then you came in and asked us to remand it to the Court of Appeals without making any clear -- without making clear analogy, we wouldn't oppose that construction on the paper down to the Court of Appeals."
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1345.367,1347.079,"Well, I suppose we didn't make it clear."
1965.695,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1349.509,1359.212,"Mr. Bender, I think so far as I'm concern, remember what I'm interested in is a question that's capable I think, a very simple answer here?"
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1374.265,1375.138,That's true.
1965.695,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1375.407,1376.078,That is your position.
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1376.078,1377.46,That is --
1965.695,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1377.46,1378.455,That is your position.
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1378.455,1378.589,That is our --
1965.695,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1378.589,1381.343,"I mean, we may have put it in."
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1381.343,1381.902,Yes.
1965.695,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1381.902,1381.937,Right.
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1381.937,1383.818,We do not oppose the remand over this case.
1965.695,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1383.818,1390.065,"You mean, that it was really (Inaudible)"
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1390.065,1394.04,It seems we think it is a sensible course of action for the Court to take.
1965.695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.547,1430.826,(Inaudible)
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1430.826,1431.943,Excuse me?
1965.695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.943,1436.416,I don't suggest (Inaudible) invention itself is a --
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1436.416,1437.397,Our position?
1965.695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.397,1437.967,Yes.
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1437.967,1440.038,"No, I don't think so Justice White."
1965.695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.66,1447.482,"Oh, it isn't as much invention to saying that all -- that's all the notice of appeal needs, saying that it takes two more things."
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1447.482,1457.197,"No, because you have a line of decisions in the lower court stretching over the course of the years holding that similar documents do amount to notices of appeal, including one case, the O'Neal case."
1965.695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.197,1460.564,"Well, he doesn't -- that doesn't -- making these inventions."
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1460.564,1462.584,"Well, it's not as though we were inventing it in this Court now --"
1965.695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.584,1463.516,(Voice Overlap)
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1463.516,1464.544,-- for the first time.
1965.695,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1464.544,1464.778,Yes.
1965.695,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1464.778,1477.423,"I wonder if there's an analogy, I thought frequently you get a petition for (Inaudible) that we treated as petition for (Inaudible)"
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1477.423,1484.27,"Yes, except this is not -- this isn't even a petition addressed to the Court which is going to give the relief."
1965.695,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1492.566,1495.018,That position just filed a motion for bail?
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1495.018,1497.331,"No, not -- not just the motion for bail."
1965.695,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1500.037,1500.96,Right there upon it?
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1500.96,1503.867,"This is -- yes, motion for bail pending appeal."
1965.695,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1512.714,1520.258,"(Inaudible) that the file was -- have to take the bail, I suppose, you're going to take it out, otherwise they don't (Inaudible)"
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1520.258,1532.136,"Well, if it were solely a motion for bail pending determination of the motion for new trial and said nothing about an intended appeal, we would urge that that was not a notice of appeal."
1965.695,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1575.59,1576.355,That is afterwards.
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1576.355,1596.709,"Four months after that time, the Court on February 28th of this year, the Court promulgated rules which were going to effect on July 1st of this year which make it clear behind any doubt that an untimely motion for new trial has no effect upon the running of the time to appeal."
1965.695,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1628.948,1638.964,Do you think this failure to treat this is as a notice of appeal would be a denial of equal protection under Justice Black's opinion in the Griffin case?
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1638.964,1643.061,I don't see why.
1965.695,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1646.468,1648.351,Isn't there one in the Fifth Amendment by --
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1648.351,1652.261,For the -- in favor -- running in favor of the Government?
1965.695,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1652.261,1655.924,"No, of course we haven't quite decided that."
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1655.924,1656.671,I suggest you to not reach that issue in this case.
1965.695,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1656.671,1659.249,"-- because, he just wanted to review an argument."
1965.695,2,37685,paul_bender,,1665.308,1691.688,"I think, as the Court said in Lott, the question should be decided by the rule-making process had now has been decided by the rule-making process and there seemed no reason to overturn the steady course of decision except in one circuit, that is the Tenth Circuit, that an untimely notice of appeal has no effect upon the running of the time for appeal and that sends this case as a fortiori from Lott that the Court shouldn't reach the issue."
1965.695,3,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,1977.563,1981.325,Briefly.
1965.695,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2090.436,2092.246,(Inaudible)
1965.695,3,20757,dean_e_denlinger,,2092.246,2096.101,369 U.S. 438.
1965.695,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2137.404,2148.04,"Mr. Denlinger, on behalf of the Court, I should like express its appreciation to you for having accepted the assignment to represent this indigent defendant."
