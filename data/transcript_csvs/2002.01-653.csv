2002.01-653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.302,"We'll hear argument now in Number 01-653, Federal Communications Commission v. NextWave Personal Communications and a companion case."
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,11.354,14.299,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2002.01-653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,73.785,85.935,"But your point is, is that the regulatory discretion and authority of the agency has been replaced under the statutory scheme in large part by the dynamics of the free market."
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,89.675,90.669,That's right.
2002.01-653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,95.473,103.776,"Well, as to the first part, isn't the Bankruptcy Code and the policy of new start and creditors and so forth, isn't that really part of the free market structure?"
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,103.776,123.312,"--Well, I think there's a difference, though, when a regulator regulates solely for timely payment for its own sake, and in that case it implicates only the policies that are addressed by the Bankruptcy Code, and I think it's a different situation when the regulator looks at the failure to make timely payment as a proxy for something else."
2002.01-653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,123.312,132.597,"Well, but Mr. Clement, in your petition for certiorari, the question presented speaks of an obtained option automatically canceled."
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,136.111,138.204,"Well, it's automatic in the sense--"
2002.01-653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.204,140.699,"I mean, automatic means without any discretion."
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,140.699,167.255,"--With respect, Justice, Chief Justice Rehnquist, when it says automatic, what it means is that it cancels without any, the need for any further action from the commission, but in any given case, the cancellation of a license is a result both of the automatic cancellation rule and the fact that a payment deadline has come forward, and where the commission has discretion is in relaxing the payment deadline, and you can see that in this very case."
2002.01-653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.974,225.963,"Well, Mr. Clement, it appears to me that the FCC went along with the bankruptcy filing, filed a claim for the amount that wasn't paid, and apparently went along with the proposals for a while to work this out and then, very shortly before the decision to reauction the things, the FCC decided not to go along with it."
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,236.782,285.697,"Well, to be sure, the FCC participated in the bankruptcy proceedings and protected its interests as a creditor, but at the same time it has independent interests as a regulator, and the FCC, as we point out on page 19 of the reply brief, made clear at various points well before NextWave went into bankruptcy that it did not view bankruptcy as an exception from the regulatory provisions of the Communications Act, and I think if you look at the specific event that NextWave points to as the automatic cancellation, it's the failure to make a payment that was due on October 29, 1998, and it was due on the 29th of October, 1998, rather than April 30, 1997, precisely because of a public interest determination by the commission."
2002.01-653,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,285.697,294.326,"You say a public interest determination, but the only correlation that seems clear to me is a purely economic correlation."
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,325.903,328.728,"With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think that's correct."
2002.01-653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,379.218,387.207,"Mr. Clement, suppose... and I consider this a classic case for what this provision of the Bankruptcy Code was directed to."
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,415.637,417.383,"No, I don't, but let me give you--"
2002.01-653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,417.383,417.61,Why not?
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,419.373,419.786,--No.
2002.01-653,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,426.928,435.845,"No, the regulatory purpose is having financially responsible drivers so people don't run around the road hurting people and leaving them to bleed on their own account."
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,435.845,436.357,--Well--
2002.01-653,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,436.357,439.896,There's just as much a regulatory purpose in that hypo as there is here.
2002.01-653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.896,441.796,You can always find a regulatory purpose.
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,444.322,466.275,"--But again, but if a State had a regulatory purpose in ensuring that its drivers were financially responsible, and presumptively said that a license would fail to cancel for the failure to pay $500 in traffic tickets, but provided a mechanism for the driver to go in before the regulatory commission and say, look, I know I haven't paid $500 worth of traffic tickets, but I'm actually financially responsible."
2002.01-653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.303,473.399,There's always such a mechanism whenever you have a debtor and a creditor.
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,475.193,476.026,"--Right, but--"
2002.01-653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.026,479.119,You need some special power from the State to do that?
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,479.119,488.897,"--Well, but again, if you look, and what the regulator is doing is extending the... extending the payment not as a creditor, but as a regulator, I think you're in a very different situation."
2002.01-653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.897,492.072,"So you're just making up a regulatory purpose, as a regulator."
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,498.015,500.23,"I really don't think that's true, with respect."
2002.01-653,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.23,525.386,That's something that I don't fully grasp in your argument.
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,545.255,553.522,"--Well, I mean, there is some tension there, and the FCC has been at pains to try to make sure that it doesn't bend over one way too far or the other."
2002.01-653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,566.471,566.978,Well--
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,566.978,567.433,When it did that--
2002.01-653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.433,568.442,--Go ahead.
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,568.442,584.536,"--When it did that, not only did some people complain that they didn't give enough regulatory relief, but other disappointed bidders ran to the D.C. Circuit and said, look, you've acted arbitrarily and capriciously because you haven't stuck with your pre-auction rules."
2002.01-653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,584.536,595.365,"But this doesn't sound at all like the question presented, which says at auction, automatically cancel upon the winning bidder's failure to make timely payments to fulfill its winning bid."
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,601.737,615.581,"Well, again I think the key is, the payments do cancel automatically after all the efforts to get the payments extended have failed, and that's just not like a hypothetical consideration in this case, because in this very case--"
2002.01-653,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.581,617.285,"I agree, you've said two different things there."
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,624.944,626.618,"--No, no, not after attempts to--"
2002.01-653,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,626.618,627.722,So when was the automatic trigger?
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,627.722,632.514,--The automatic trigger is when somebody fails to make a payment--
2002.01-653,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,632.514,632.962,All right.
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,633.871,643.17,"--And... no, it's really not enough, if you look at the broader perspective of the regulation, because there's an alternative way to get out of the automatic cancellation."
2002.01-653,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,663.211,665.795,And you say you have the authority to relax the payment date?
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,665.795,668.259,--Not only does the commission have the authority to do that--
2002.01-653,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,668.259,669.389,If that's true--
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,669.389,670.13,--it did it in this very case.
2002.01-653,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,670.13,672.146,"--If that's true, why don't you settle the case today?"
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,673.717,693.831,"Well, the reason we don't settle the case today, although obviously there were efforts to try to settle this, which would require congressional legislation, which we were unable to get in a timely fashion, but the reason that they are not in a position to cure their defaults, if you will, is because our view is that they have... the opportunity to cure has passed."
2002.01-653,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.62,705.996,"But is the option to cure... if you wanted to settle, would you be disabled from settling, or could you settle, decide, well, we think it would be wise regulation now to accept the payment?"
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,705.996,710.667,--I think it would be within the agency's discretion to settle the litigation at this point.
2002.01-653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.373,734.672,"I think... so it is really a legal issue, whether you have that discretion or not?"
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,736.902,738.077,Absolutely.
2002.01-653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.077,739.896,"Well, do we have to decide that in this case?"
2002.01-653,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,747.437,747.731,Well--
2002.01-653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.731,748.118,Right?
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1021.775,1028.932,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-653,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.317,1055.45,"You refer to it as a regulatory determination which, of course, assumes the whole point at issue."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1055.45,1064.852,"Well, I don't think it... I think that that, in fact, is undisputed as this case comes before the Court, that the FCC had valid regulatory reasons for taking the action it did."
2002.01-653,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1064.852,1067.924,Then why is it phrased in terms of an automatic cancellation rule?
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1067.924,1075.209,"Because the automatic cancellation happened in November of 1998, but one cannot look at that as a mere snapshot."
2002.01-653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.055,1082.682,Why do you have to look at the reasons?
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1099.195,1099.465,--Right.
2002.01-653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1099.465,1103.167,"--such person is or has been a debtor, blah, blah, or hasn't made a payment."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1104.755,1104.999,Right.
2002.01-653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.999,1119.864,"Now, let's assume that there is a Federal statute that makes discrimination because of, or failure to hire someone, or let's say, let's say killing someone solely because of his race--"
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1119.864,1120.534,Yes.
2002.01-653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1120.534,1123.732,"--a crime, a separate crime."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1140.785,1144.334,"Well, I'm not aware of a statute like that, that says, solely because--"
2002.01-653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.334,1144.89,"Oh, I made it up."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1144.89,1146.285,"--I know that, but--"
2002.01-653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.149,1161.694,I'm getting to the question of whether the fact that you have some other motive--
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1161.694,1162.462,--Yes.
2002.01-653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.462,1164.973,--eliminates the sole causality.
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1194.958,1204.701,"With respect, Your Honor, the term because, when it is used in antidiscrimination statutes, and we have cited cases on page 3 of our reply brief, is used to mean motive."
2002.01-653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.743,1230.124,"Then the statute doesn't cover anything, because every regulatory body that cancels a license, whenever there's a license involved, you can say that there is some regulatory motive, as in the hypothetical that I gave to Mr. Clement."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1230.124,1230.917,--Well--
2002.01-653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.917,1233.191,The motor vehicle cancellation.
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1233.191,1240.615,"--I think that... under section 525, the mere fact that an agency has said it has a regulatory motive is not sufficient."
2002.01-653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1247.198,1255.901,"Okay, can... on that point, do you agree that the statute is a response to... the Perez case, the automobile cancellation?"
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1255.901,1256.031,--Yes.
2002.01-653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1256.031,1258.624,There was a regulatory motive there.
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1265.101,1265.865,Well--
2002.01-653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1265.865,1272.306,"So if that situation is supposed to be covered by the statute, then by a parity of reasoning, so would this one be."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1272.306,1284.461,"--But in Perez the Court examined that motive and determined that looking at the statute and looking at the way it operated, in fact, as the Court put it, the sole emphasis of the statute was not the regulatory purpose."
2002.01-653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1288.637,1312.93,"Okay, then sole emphasis and sole purpose really boils down not to exclusiveness but a kind of proximate or principal causation theory, and if that's the case, certainly here the FCC treated the debtor relationship as the principal determinant of the various steps that it took."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1325.177,1331.602,I don't think that section 525 embodies a causation theory in the way that Your Honor is postulating.
2002.01-653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1365.19,1367.052,Then why doesn't automatic mean automatic?
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1371.126,1372.084,Automatic--
2002.01-653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1372.084,1373.579,It means automatic without teeth.
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1373.579,1377.665,"--Automatic means automatic, although there are opportunities, as--"
2002.01-653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1377.665,1379.322,Automatic except where it isn't.
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1379.322,1379.928,--Well--
2002.01-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1406.995,1416.199,"Then Mr. Franklin, why didn't Congress provide an exception, as it did in, for perishable commodities for the Department of Agriculture?"
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1416.199,1416.963,--Well--
2002.01-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1416.963,1430.279,"If there is this nonbankruptcy overriding concern, then we have one example where Congress responded to it by saying the bankruptcy provision isn't going to prevail."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1430.279,1433.147,"--Well, I... no exception was needed here."
2002.01-653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1480.758,1492.829,"Of course, nothing in the Federal Communications Act requires the Federal Communications Commission to stand as the guarantor, you know, to hold the bag for the person that they're giving away this multibillion-dollar license to."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1501.98,1502.571,--But even in that--
2002.01-653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1502.571,1507.234,"So there's no regulatory necessity for this whole tragedy, is there?"
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1507.234,1518.673,"--No, with respect, if one looks at a cash-on-the-barrelhead system, the way the FCC auctions work, and our clients are deeply involved in them, one does not get the license right after becoming the high bidder."
2002.01-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1557.629,1562.052,"May I stop you in your hypothetical, because I thought you don't get the license till after you have make the down payment."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1562.052,1564.592,"--You make a down payment, and NextWave made their down payment."
2002.01-653,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1564.592,1567.054,"Yes, but they didn't have any license until they did that."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1567.054,1588.576,"But what I'm saying is, even on a cash-on-the-barrelhead system the FCC does not require full payment, it can't require full payment until they actually grant the license, and that is a several-month lag between the time when you're declared the high bidder... in one case, in my client's case it was more than a year after they were declared the high bidder for licenses, and they actually received them, because of proceedings that were filed."
2002.01-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1588.576,1596.291,The rationale offered by the commission here was that the policies of the FCC outweigh the policies of the Bankruptcy Act.
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1608.953,1615.808,"I don't think that the FCC has deference in interpreting the Bankruptcy Code, but I don't think it's a question of whether one policy outweighs the other."
2002.01-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1616.577,1618.822,"--Well, that's the explicit rationale of the commission."
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1618.822,1621.413,"--Well, our rationale--"
2002.01-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1621.413,1622.024,That's what it said.
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1622.024,1624.93,"--Our rationale is that they can be harmonized, and should be harmonized."
2002.01-653,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1628.269,1630.581,So that you don't defend the rationale offered by the commission?
2002.01-653,1,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1630.581,1638.399,"--I'm not sure that that is the exact rationale, but we think that the policies can be harmonized and should be harmonized."
2002.01-653,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.399,1639.555,"Thank you, Mr. Franklin."
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1641.165,1650.685,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.476,1682.77,"What do you mean, had deferred it?"
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1682.77,1684.666,"Well, because NextWave--"
2002.01-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.666,1685.776,"You mean, failed to make it?"
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1685.776,1686.977,"--It did not make it, yes."
2002.01-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1688.127,1688.84,Why don't we say that?
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1688.84,1690.374,It did not make it--
2002.01-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.483,1696.147,There might have been some legal mumbo-jumbo that had caused the payment not to be due.
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1696.147,1698.911,"Well, we were reorganizing in bankruptcy--"
2002.01-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.911,1699.673,You didn't pay it.
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1699.673,1702.243,"--and we did not pay because we were reorganizing, that's right."
2002.01-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.086,1749.105,But they say it's not automatic.
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1750.135,1757.117,"I think the record utterly and completely refutes that proposition, and it does so in the following ways."
2002.01-653,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1785.239,1787.861,But we know how the commission has interpreted it.
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1812.266,1818.021,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in the restructuring orders they did do that, but that doesn't make the revocation any less automatic."
2002.01-653,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1828.788,1841.242,"--But if there had been such a settlement, then there could have been some, at least, licenses retained even though there had been the nonpayment, which is supposed to be an automatic trigger."
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1841.242,1848.614,"--Well, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but the date was suspended by the FCC well in advance."
2002.01-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.576,1868.625,There had not been a failure to make an earlier payment?
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1868.625,1870.197,"--That's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.749,1875.143,"Okay, so--"
2002.01-653,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1875.143,1876.964,"--Mr. Verrilli, let me ask you about something else."
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1888.628,1890.318,"That is right, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-653,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1890.318,1902.348,"And if we were to affirm here, does the FCC have any power to prevent a bankruptcy court from reducing the price in that fashion?"
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1902.348,1902.564,Yes.
2002.01-653,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.564,1903.691,That's very strange.
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1903.691,1906.33,"Yes, it does, and it's already been taken care of, in fact."
2002.01-653,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1952.78,1953.349,"Well, didn't the--"
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1953.349,1954.627,--and therefore 544 can't operate.
2002.01-653,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.627,1956.321,--apply to the bankruptcy order in that case?
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1956.321,1957.28,--and it did.
2002.01-653,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.137,1975.316,That is the question.
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2056.447,2058.973,"My response is the following, Justice Breyer."
2002.01-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.599,2117.174,"Well, I'm not sure about that."
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2140.281,2140.865,Well--
2002.01-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.865,2142.312,So I wouldn't say there's no question.
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2142.312,2142.699,--That's a--
2002.01-653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.699,2147.81,"I think if we accept their argument here, we would probably have to accept it in the other situation."
2002.01-653,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2147.81,2164.192,"--Well, I think if we... well, I think that that point is exactly right, Justice Scalia, that the Government's regulatory purpose argument, if accepted, would give them the authority to revoke licenses not only when the payment was not made to the Government, but not made to private parties."
2002.01-653,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.192,2176.176,"So far, I'm trying to get the answer to my question, and so far, in terms of my interpretation, the second point you made is in terms of to the applicability, if my interpretation is right."
2002.01-653,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2859.227,2873.329,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-653,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3024.157,3032.164,"Mr. Tribe, what do you say in response to Justice Breyer's point that the statute really deals with a situation in which the Government agency is not the creditor?"
2002.01-653,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3034.067,3053.463,"Well, I... in a way, I think that that makes our point all the stronger, that is, even when the agency has no conflict of interest, it might not be in it for the money, and one wonders here why, for example, why they don't yank the license when the debt is owed to private creditors?"
2002.01-653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3058.675,3060.623,"--No, no... well, they want their money is all."
2002.01-653,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3060.623,3060.76,"--Well, money--"
2002.01-653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3060.76,3067.949,"They want their money, but there are taxicab licenses, there are nuclear power licenses... licensing is the most common thing in the world."
2002.01-653,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3081.146,3081.521,--Well--
2002.01-653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3081.521,3084.141,"--which the guy never paid the $100,000 for?"
2002.01-653,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3084.141,3084.981,--the license on my interpretation--
2002.01-653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3084.981,3085.137,Yes.
2002.01-653,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3085.137,3092.735,"--does not cancel and at confirmation the license is one of the assets of the estate, and at that point--"
2002.01-653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3092.735,3098.061,"Well, they could get it back... in other words, they could take it back because they didn't revoke it."
2002.01-653,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3098.061,3100.273,"--No, they don't take it back."
2002.01-653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3104.425,3112.114,"I'm a creditor, I'm a private creditor, I say I have a secured interest in this, it's mine, okay."
2002.01-653,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3115.231,3117.06,"I'm sorry, Justice Breyer."
2002.01-653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3150.486,3154.639,"--That's the part that's precisely bothering me, my situation is no worse."
2002.01-653,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3174.877,3201.153,"What I'm saying, Justice Breyer, is that after bankruptcy, if NextWave, for example, were to emerge from bankruptcy they would still have the license, but only on conditions in which you as the FCC, like other creditors, in light of your secured interest, had taken an appropriate piece of the pie."
2002.01-653,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3478.264,3479.384,"Thank you, Mr. Tribe."
2002.01-653,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3479.384,3480.134,Thank you.
2002.01-653,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3480.134,3482.048,"Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutes remaining."
2002.01-653,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3482.048,3485.845,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-653,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3561.324,3563.097,"It's not binding on us, certainly?"
2002.01-653,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3563.097,3570.533,"--Well, it is binding on the FCC, though, and the FCC tried to do its best to take bankruptcy considerations into account."
2002.01-653,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3572.582,3577.06,"But this, they're saying that they're not going to take bankruptcy considerations into account."
2002.01-653,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3577.06,3578.176,"--No, they did."
2002.01-653,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3664.099,3664.597,Exactly right.
2002.01-653,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3665.89,3667.766,"Well, I think... no, I think... I think--"
2002.01-653,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3679.861,3684.536,"I know, but if they did, it's such an obvious argument that I feel there's something wrong with it if you didn't argue it."
2002.01-653,4,37772,paul_d_clement,,3684.536,3686.378,"--Don't worry... thank you, Your Honor."
2002.01-653,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3686.378,3687.479,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
