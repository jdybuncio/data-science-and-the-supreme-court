1964.644,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,67.422,"Number 644, the United Gas Improvement Company petitioner versus Continental Oil Company et al., and Number 693, Federal Power Commission versus M.H. Marr et al."
1964.644,0,15704,archibald_cox,,69.112,72.938,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.644,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.451,1014.949,"What about the undeveloped lease, Mr. Solicitor General."
1964.644,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1014.949,1016.751,What undeveloped lease?
1964.644,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.751,1021.614,"Well, I mean I assume that there was an undeveloped lease is there the same reason then?"
1964.644,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1021.614,1032.873,"Well, I would need the term developed and undeveloped don't have quite definite context to me that enables me simply to discuss it in those terms."
1964.644,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.055,1085.382,"If there had been here a transfer of the lease at all levels and the company took over the operation of the lease, would there really be any difference here?"
1964.644,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1089.53,1091.866,I think we probably would.
1964.644,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.275,1141.449,That --
1964.644,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1141.449,1146.923,-- I'm really coming back to your point if I might say just a word or two about it.
1964.644,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.011,1287.121,Suggesting that the --
1964.644,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1287.121,1293.728,No I think it's -- I think purpose is an important part because it must be a sale in interstate commerce for resale.
1964.644,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.728,1298.758,"It's an objective test, I mean, did they really buy gas or didn't they, do you know?"
1964.644,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1298.758,1312.758,"I would say that it was rather the essence of the thing, the guts of the thing, if I may put it colloquially, is whether they were really getting gas and whether they were really fixing the price at which they got gas."
1964.644,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1572.672,1580.392,"They also, I have very briefly, legitimate argument under the -- an affirmative argument, you've given their negative as they say --"
1964.644,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1580.392,1580.931,"That it's production,"
1964.644,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1580.931,1582.629,-- that it isn't but its production of gathering?
1964.644,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1582.629,1589.648,"I was going to treat -- and I'm sure I've got a long treatment of the Panhandle case, is that what Your Honor was suggesting?"
1964.644,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1592.76,1594.885,Surely.
1964.644,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1594.885,1600.969,The first fault we find with this argument is that it proves too much.
1964.644,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2677.617,2681.006,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1964.644,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2925.555,2926.324,163?
1964.644,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2926.324,2930.232,163 of the record which is in Volume 1.
1964.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2990.86,2995.356,"Mr. Coleman, this chart, which I presume was an exhibit in the case --"
1964.644,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2995.356,2996.116,Yes Sir.
1964.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2996.116,3003.515,"-- 163, was this is an exhibit just prepared for this litigation or was this an annex to a contract or what was it?"
1964.644,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3003.515,3005.393,"Well, this was in the record."
1964.644,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3033.733,3039.868,Yes but it might depend on who says that if this was an exhibit prepared for this particular litigation by one of the parties.
1964.644,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3039.868,3040.477,It's clear.
1964.644,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.296,3086.105,What part of the record?
1964.644,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3086.105,3090.752,"This is volume three Your Honor, where they said --"
1964.644,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3090.752,3091.768,979?
1964.644,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3091.768,3093.012,972 of the record.
1964.644,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3093.012,3094.547,982.
1964.644,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3094.547,3112.353,"Where they said at the first full paragraph, “We have jurisdiction over this transaction, because by it, the producers transferred natural gas to Texas Eastern for resale by Texas Eastern in the interstate market.”"
1964.644,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3578.148,3592.68,"Mr. Coleman, what is lacking as far as power is concerned in the Commission if they just regulated that pipeline, and attempt to get at this price through regulation of the pipeline?"
1964.644,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3592.68,3593.149,Well sir --
1964.644,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3593.149,3598.324,Just allowing some part of its rate base.
1964.644,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3598.324,3602.68,"Well sir, I first say that in Phillips, you could have done exactly the same thing."
1964.644,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3756.287,3758.921,Mr. Searls.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,3758.921,3762.812,Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5207.673,5220.688,Do you say the main standard is (Inaudible)
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5220.688,5223.904,Not the same standard as this Court said in Catco.
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5270.994,5273.446,Could they fix the price?
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5273.446,5292.548,"They could have fix the price and as the Fifth Circuit said Your Honor, you should determine whether you're going to reject this application, whether you're going to grant or whether you're going to grant it conditionally and the right to the impose reasonable conditions certainly gives the Commission considerable control over the matter."
1964.644,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5292.548,5303.048,Do you think the Commission could by exercising power over Texas Eastern specify a purchase price for Texas Eastern?
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5303.048,5305.075,I certainly do.
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5306.103,5309.478,At what stage -- at what stage of the proceeding?
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5317.916,5319.054,In the certificate case.
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5328.867,5330.771,You think that always would be true?
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5330.771,5333.961,Yes sir I think that would always be true.
1964.644,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5391.439,5395.99,(Inaudible)
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5395.99,5398.95,"No, Your Honor we haven't, we did have."
1964.644,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5413.093,5415.35,What was the present state that (Inaudible)
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5415.35,5418.398,Texas Eastern is taking gas from the Rayne Field.
1964.644,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5418.398,5421.636,(Inaudible)
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5421.636,5432.169,The connection has been made and course the certificate application applies not only to construction but also for future operation of the facilities and so Texas is in still much have a certificate.
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5446.454,5466.105,"Deserves, if you say that the Commission has got power to regulate this price, to which Texas Eastern acquired the gas, and it can get all the information it wants and it had gotten all the information already in this hearing, or what difference does it really make to you?"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5475.663,5478.3,Do you mean why they should determine it in a certificate case?
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5478.3,5478.552,Yes.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5478.552,5480.003,Why we want them to --
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5480.003,5490.766,"You just, you say that well they're going to get -- they could do the same thing anyway in the present -- without exercising jurisdiction over the producer."
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5494.289,5496.17,"Yes, I'm appearing here for all of them, yes."
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5496.17,5502.603,"Now, what difference does it make to Continental Oil Company, one of your clients, whether they -- the Commission doesn't do one way or another."
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5502.603,5509.757,"Yes, well now if -- assuming they made gas sales contracts say for instance."
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5518.172,5524.898,"Now, I get you, was that another party to the proceeding and I thought your client some money, but would it all end up in the same result?"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5524.898,5525.804,It wouldn't end up.
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5630.446,5640.111,"Do you say that -- if you say the Commission could actually set a purchase price to Texas Eastern, how can it possibly do that without investigating these very matters?"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5640.111,5643.986,"Well, they could determine this, Mr. Justice White."
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5662.209,5664.075,Just look in market criteria.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5664.075,5668.927,"Well, they would look to market criteria and that'd be the primary consideration."
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5808.438,5811.618,"Well, Mr. Searls, let me get this straight."
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5832.156,5833.361,"Yes, sir in the certificate case."
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5833.361,5837.435,"Now, do you think it could in a transaction like this?"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5837.435,5839.236,"Yes, I do, Your Honor, now --"
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5839.236,5844.124,"Well, remember, -- remember you say it's a sale of a lease."
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5844.124,5845.436,"Yes, but here's a way I'd had --"
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5845.436,5857.568,"If you say that -- if you say that in the transaction like this, the Commission could regulate the price at which Texas Eastern acquired gas."
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5865.797,5869.524,"No, its acquisition of the lease is not subject to regulation."
1964.644,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5912.986,5916.997,"Well, tell me what's the difference between you and the Government?"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5916.997,5926.195,"Well, the between us and the Government is we say that the Commission cannot take jurisdiction over the producers or the sellers of these leases."
1964.644,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5926.195,5935.26,Commission has no word to say if this -- the value of this item in any rate base that you have.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5935.26,5936.966,In the Texas Eastern rate base?
1964.644,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5936.966,5937.513,Yes in the --
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5937.513,5939.674,"Oh yes sir, I think they have Your Honor."
1964.644,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5939.674,5942.663,"At this item, the control of this item of the lease, the value of this lease?"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5942.663,5943.424,Yes.
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5980.134,5982.591,Do you say (Inaudible)
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,5982.591,5985.34,"Yes, I do."
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6011.377,6015.152,"Well, what's the source of their jurisdictional power there?"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6023.045,6031.161,It's -- no it's their power under this Section 7 (c) of the Natural Gas Act to issue a certificate of public convenience necessity.
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6040.842,6046.99,Even though it might be part of production and gathering?
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6046.99,6049.388,"Yes, I don't think production and gathering has nothing to do with it."
1964.644,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6122.148,6128.945,"Mr. Searls, what is the practical condition (Inaudible)"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6128.945,6129.392,We say --
1964.644,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6129.392,6130.892,Of the consumer.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6130.892,6131.346,Yes.
1964.644,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6176.047,6188.233,"But what if you -- you pay a million dollars in the pipeline's rate case, the Commission may limit to a hundred thousand."
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6188.233,6196.312,"If the Commission decides that $900,000 is not a prudent investment, it's improvident, they could limit until $100,000."
1964.644,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6196.312,6197.91,(Voice Overlap) then therefore you can't take that --
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6197.91,6199.148,And you could not -- and you could make that --
1964.644,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6199.148,6203.02,Or you can return the consumer of this in that sort of thing?
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6203.02,6203.51,I think it --
1964.644,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6203.51,6208.603,Pipeline companies did make a lot of improvident --
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6208.603,6209.281,Well they --
1964.644,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6209.281,6210.697,-- some actions to this kind.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6210.697,6218.856,Of course a pipeline company must make a private investment in steel pipe running into millions of dollars or it might be disallowed in a rate base.
1964.644,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6230.477,6242.536,"Mr. Searls, can the Commission practically make the determination as to the pipeline whether it's a provident investment without going into the cost of the original."
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6242.536,6245.009,I think it can Mr. Justice Goldberg as I mentioned.
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6360.723,6362.039,(Inaudible)
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6362.039,6366.139,Yes sir?
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6366.139,6377.892,"Do you think that if you win this case, the price of gas, the Texas Eastern is going to be different than if the Commission wins it?"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6380.149,6380.899,Mr. Justice White I --
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6380.899,6383.942,-- in a different way?
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6383.942,6385.431,I would be concerned --
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6385.431,6395.424,"Are we really struggling here over the price of gas, or just over -- just some litigative advantage to one side or the other?"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6395.424,6413.45,"Of course, I don't know what the price of gas would be if the Commission should win, but I would be concerned that if they went into sellers cost, they would reduce the price to be received or the consideration to be received by the sellers below the cost which it's now receiving."
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6413.45,6421.354,So that's what the mean of -- certainly there's anyone would almost include that the outset that this is really as an argument about the price of gas.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6421.354,6432.723,"Well, it's -- I'm not willing that you go that far, but certainly we are concerned about the consideration about these sellers getting that consideration and Texas Eastern thinks it's made a good deal."
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6438.764,6461.793,"Well, the only -- although the Commission has the power to regulate Texas Eastern's purchase price, you say one way or another, it probably wouldn't have the tools available without investigating producer cost to come out with the same answer that it would if it had this power of the producers."
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6461.793,6469.593,It would not come out with the same answer because it would have a different approach to the problem if it were investigating the costs of the producers.
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6487.143,6493.172,"Well, what if the -- what if the Commission was following an area price approach?"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6493.172,6498.694,"Well, we don't think an area price approach should be applied here."
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6498.694,6501.149,"You mean, there would be less difference between the two approaches and the --"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6501.149,6507.221,"Yes, if they tried to apply area price approach, we do not think they could be applied in this case."
1964.644,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6507.221,6508.034,Why not?

1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6569.614,6578.091,I think to the character evidence that they require to be produced in this case along that line.
1964.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6582.292,6591.462,"(Inaudible) so if that's the condition on the basis that it's improvident, that's what I haven't quite understood about your argument."
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6605.686,6618.109,"Well, Mr. Justice Black I'd have to say that in passing on whether or not the pipeline companies made a prudent investment and provident investment and improvident investment, it's immaterial how much profit the sellers are making out of transaction."
1964.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6618.109,6633.242,"Suppose somebody had bought something about $100 and then they'd sold at leasehold in this for million, could you say that that's not relevant in connection with determining whether it affects this problem."
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6633.242,6637.326,I think you'd have to say will what it would have to pay to get other profits like that.
1964.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6637.326,6638.753,That other would be relevant.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6638.753,6651.935,"Yes, I'd have to say that whatever profit the sellers are making out of transaction is not material and determined whether the acquisition cost of Texas Eastern are consistent with public convenience and necessity."
1964.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6651.935,6656.719,Just simply because you come back to the word profit.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6672.827,6675.418,"What are the leases so far, I think that would be material."
1964.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6675.418,6681.032,"With other lease so far, how much -- in the selling of product for?"
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6688.494,6691.972,"I think it would Mr. Justice Black, that's the character evidence we offer."
1964.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6716.635,6724.645,"A man making a purchase in ordinary goodness I would think, would look to that if he could, I don't see why he wouldn't."
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6724.645,6725.046,"Well, I think --"
1964.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6725.046,6727.216,Just a quick question of pure relevance.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6727.216,6727.64,Yes.
1964.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6727.64,6730.249,I'm not talking about whether statute's forbidden it.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6730.249,6737.08,"Well, I don't believe that the profit that the sellers are making wouldn't be material in determining whether I am making a prudent investment."

1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6782.329,6798.258,"Well, if you went into that store and that party had that product on the shelves about five years, it might make a large profit, or as it might have the same product that he bought six months ago and the price is going up."
1964.644,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6798.258,6801.068,What I'm talking about the relevance not the degree of relevance.
1964.644,2,21474,david_t_searls,,6801.068,6802.036,Yes sir.
