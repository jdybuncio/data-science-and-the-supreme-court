2010.10-5400,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.587,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-5400, Tapia v. United States."
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,8.72,17.795,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-5400,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,72.595,75.63,"You have, in effect, a one-way ratchet."
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,87.855,90.105,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-5400,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,114.255,124.195,Do you think that's -- do you think that's consistent with what Congress thought about rehabilitation when it adopted the Sentencing Reform Act?
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,146.81,154.23,"Well, there's relatively little evidence of what Congress thought about the possibility of rehabilitating individuals outside of prison."
2010.10-5400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,169.724,176.996,"But it is strange, isn't it, that they can take rehabilitation into account for the supervised release."
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,193.541,212.419,"--Well, certainly with regard to supervised release, we think, as far as setting the term of supervised release, the judge is required to take rehabilitation concerns into account, and that's because supervised release is intended to smooth the transition from prison to true liberty and is specifically a rehabilitative vehicle."
2010.10-5400,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,236.951,246.224,"Counsel, aren't -- isn't punishment and rehabilitation often flip sides of each other?"
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,330.446,336.6,The problem is the judge has no ability to ensure that the individual gets that treatment if they're sent to prison.
2010.10-5400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.6,337.183,Your client--
2010.10-5400,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,337.183,337.633,That's a--
2010.10-5400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.633,338.452,"--didn't get, did she?"
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,338.452,340.535,"She did not get that treatment, in fact."
2010.10-5400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.654,347.724,"So, if he gave her extra years in order to get that treatment, he just gave her extra years without the treatment, as it turned out?"
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,347.724,348.841,"--Yes, and I don't think that was that--"
2010.10-5400,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,348.841,349.474,"--Well, wait a minute."
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,375.272,398.202,"--Well, Judge -- I mean, Justice, I would disagree with that characterization of Judge Moskowitz's comments, and I'd point specifically to the Joint Appendix, really, at pages 25 through 38, and particularly to pages 27 through 29, where he very specifically says not that he's imposing this time for punishment purposes, but really to get her into the drug program."
2010.10-5400,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,429.823,440.013,But you're ignoring his lengthy discussion talking about she was really going down the wrong road here.
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,489.362,506.157,"There's nothing that stops a sentencing judge from saying I think that incapacitation, retribution, deterrence justify a sentence of X, and in addition you'll receive rehabilitative resources while you're inside; make -- you know, make best use of them."
2010.10-5400,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,515.529,519.715,So you're talking only about when rehabilitation is the primary purpose?
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,523.7,524.083,No.
2010.10-5400,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,534.808,538.677,So now we want some talismanic words where the judge says what I said?
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,554.786,564.66,"--I think a fair reading of Judge Moskowitz's statements at the sentencing was that, in fact, he was lengthening the sentence for purposes of rehabilitation--"
2010.10-5400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,564.66,565.493,"Well, how do we--"
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,565.493,566.176,--to make sure that she got into the--
2010.10-5400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,566.176,570.647,--can we know that when the government -- didn't the government ask for 63 months?
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,570.647,573.097,--The government did ask for 63 months.
2010.10-5400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,576.634,578.301,And the judge came up with something in between those two?
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,578.301,579.586,"--He did, indeed."
2010.10-5400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.31,598.981,"The judge did say, didn't he -- this is on page 27 of the Joint Appendix --"
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,625.382,637.089,"Indeed, he did, and I believe that he was taking into account his own knowledge of the prison system and what it would require to allow Ms. Tapia to participate in the 500-hour program."
2010.10-5400,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,637.089,660.138,"What if -- putting aside the particular statement here, what if a judge says: I appreciate that one purpose of punishment is deterrence; that's what -- and that's what's going to guide me, and I think you will not be deterred if I only sentence you for 2 years, but I think if you have to go away for 3 years, you will appreciate that what you've done is wrong and you won't do it again."
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,664.074,668.227,"I believe that's for punishment and deterrence, and I don't believe that's an improper purpose."
2010.10-5400,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,668.227,672.012,"Well, maybe -- what is the difference between deterrence and rehabilitation?"
2010.10-5400,0,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,683.07,694.009,"Well, I don't think it is, because I think we can look at the purposes Congress had in mind when it enacted the statute and, in particular, the system it had in mind, the system it intended to overturn when it enacted the statute."
2010.10-5400,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,732.068,732.92,"Thank you, Mr. Cahn."
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,744.526,746.811,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-5400,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,758.618,764.022,"Mr. Roberts, could I take you back to Justice Kennedy's question at the start about the one-way ratchet?"
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,783.519,797.51,"Well, Congress was intending to reject the prevailing rehabilitation model of sentencing, and under that model, defendants were kept in prison until they were declared rehabilitated based on their participation in treatment programs."
2010.10-5400,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,812.705,815.907,That's only one-half of what the thinking was at the time about rehabilitation.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,841.289,853.163,"--Well, Congress expressly determined to retain -- there were people that said rehabilitation never works; it can't be a legitimate purpose of sentencing."
2010.10-5400,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,901.68,909.85,"Yes, but that's different from saying that a lower sentence can be imposed on the theory that with rehabilitation outside of prison, a lengthier sentence isn't needed."
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,946.042,984.0,"--I think it would depend whether that was an aggravating or, you know, mitigating circumstance that the guidelines hadn't adequately taken into account, but I don't think that Congress was trying to prevent a court from selecting another sentencing option, such as probation, in lieu of imprisonment because the court determined that the primary purpose of the sentence should be rehabilitation, or to shorten the sentence to speed the defendant from imprisonment to supervised release, where the court could guarantee the defendant would participate in programs."
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1005.163,1018.555,"Suppose -- suppose the case in which the judge is going to sentence to 2 years no matter, but there is a 2-year rehabilitation program, and the defendant is -- the prisoner is receiving that."
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1025.744,1031.481,"Well, the prisoner is receiving an imprisonment term--"
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1031.481,1032.565,Hypothetical.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1038.968,1039.468,--I--
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1039.468,1044.788,Would you agree the prisoner is then receiving both an imprisonment term and rehabilitation?
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1044.788,1051.442,"--I think the prisoner is receiving rehabilitative services, yes, in prison -- in prison, yes."
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1051.442,1059.465,"I -- so then, we can use those two goals of sentencing in -- in the conjunctive--"
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1059.465,1060.082,Well--
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1060.082,1065.202,--and you can have imprisonment and rehabilitation at the same time?
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1065.202,1080.795,"--Congress intended that, even if a defendant needed rehabilitation, if the other goals of sentencing such as deterrence and protecting the public justified a term of imprisonment, that the court should impose a term of imprisonment."
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1081.497,1083.48,I'm just talking about a matter of diction.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1087.734,1089.834,--Yes.
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1089.834,1094.405,"--case, where you can receive imprisonment and rehabilitation at same time?"
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1094.405,1103.844,"Yes, yes, but what Congress wanted courts to -- required courts to recognize was that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting rehabilitation."
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1103.844,1112.117,"We're -- we're talking about what the statute says, and the question indicates, the hypothetical indicates, that those are not mutually exclusive."
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1120.436,1126.107,I agree that you can -- there can be rehabilitative programs in prison.
2010.10-5400,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1138.85,1139.9,"Counsel, assume--"
2010.10-5400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1139.9,1144.838,Prisons have multiple treatment programs.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1144.838,1145.354,Yes.
2010.10-5400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1145.354,1146.338,And they have vocational treatment.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1179.575,1181.011,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2010.10-5400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1201.09,1223.754,"What if -- what if the judge sentences people who commit robbery with assault typically to 1 year; he can do it 1 to 2 years, he gives them 1 year; except whenever the presentencing report says the person has a drug problem and there's a one-and-a-half-year drug program in the prison, he sentences those people to one and a half years?"
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1232.377,1232.977,Right.
2010.10-5400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1232.977,1236.263,"Is that a problem, or does it always just depend on what the judge says?"
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1236.263,1252.873,"I think generally you take the district court at the court's word for what the purposes of the sentence are, and the sentence has to be justified by the reasons that the district court gives in sentencing the defendant."
2010.10-5400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.873,1254.642,I think you'd say it was wrong for the district court to do that.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1254.642,1255.625,If the -- if the judge--
2010.10-5400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.625,1259.796,But whether it can be established on appeal that it was wrong is another matter.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1259.796,1260.479,--Yes.
2010.10-5400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1264.248,1265.95,It's wrong -- wrong to do what?
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1265.95,1289.232,"--we're inside the district court's head, and the district court is actually not recognizing that rehabilitation is an appropriate means of promoting -- that imprisonment is an appropriate means of promoting rehabilitation but is in fact doing that, but not -- but being disingenuous about the court's reason, then the court is violating the statute, but we're not going to know that."
2010.10-5400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1289.232,1295.034,Does the defendant have the right to raise arguments and inquire into that in -- in every case?
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1306.342,1315.114,I think that -- that it's going to be hard for the defendant to obtain reversal of a conviction under those circumstances.
2010.10-5400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1315.114,1319.517,"Well, I think it's going to be hard for the government to defend a sentence under those circumstances."
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1319.517,1328.107,"Well, I think, as I said, that the words that you -- that the court is required to give its reasons for imposing sentence."
2010.10-5400,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1360.828,1361.494,Counsel--

2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1362.028,1364.446,Suppose the judge said: I'm going to sentence you to 12 months.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1389.229,1390.014,No.
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1397.752,1399.703,"No, he said I -- no, he said I'm not going to consider that."
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1399.703,1402.921,He's not going to consider rehabilitation at all in imposing sentence?
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1402.921,1403.671,Right.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1403.671,1406.44,"Then, yes, that would -- that would be a procedural error--"
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.44,1406.907,All right.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1406.907,1407.825,--to fail to consider it at all.
2010.10-5400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1407.825,1413.111,So -- so then he must consider rehabilitation in the context of imprisonment?
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1413.111,1413.713,Yes.
2010.10-5400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.652,1425.104,I don't understand what you're saying.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1432.975,1433.525,Yes.
2010.10-5400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.525,1434.877,Not in imposing imprisonment.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1434.877,1435.543,It does require--
2010.10-5400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.543,1448.35,"So he can consider rehabilitation in deciding what this person will be required to do in -- in a probated term, but not in how long he's going to stay in prison before he gets probation."
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1448.35,1455.39,"--Yes, but the court can also consider rehabilitation to choose a sentence of probation rather than a sentence of imprisonment."
2010.10-5400,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1455.39,1472.15,Suppose the judge thinks that a -- a defendant would benefit from a type of a vocational or educational training that may be available in prison but that is not available in -- on the outside in the particular community where this defendant resides?
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1473.452,1493.498,"I think the court can still require the availability -- require that as a condition of supervised release if the judge thinks that that's -- or as probation; if the judge thinks that that's a really critical provision to have, and the judge can require the defendant--"
2010.10-5400,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1493.498,1494.298,"No, what if that's not--"
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1494.298,1495.131,--to reside in the appropriate place.
2010.10-5400,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1495.131,1498.05,--What if it's not available in the community on the outside?
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1498.05,1509.508,"Well, then the judge would have to decide whether moving from -- whether having the defendant in a different location than the defendant ordinarily would be is worth providing that program."
2010.10-5400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1520.316,1521.899,"Well, that wouldn't affect the length of the sentence."
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1529.838,1533.806,--The judge cannot prescribe that he be incarcerated in a particular facility.
2010.10-5400,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1553.57,1576.151,"--Counsel, can a judge who believes a defendant is dangerous to the public and thinks that that danger can't be abated without a drug treatment program, could the judge nevertheless under 3553(a)(2)(C) say, because of the danger to the public, I'm going to lengthen the sentence?"
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1576.151,1577.168,--Yes.
2010.10-5400,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1577.168,1581.805,And in the hopes that a drug rehabilitation program will be available?
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1587.191,1595.345,I think the judge can say that -- that this person needs to be in prison for this amount of time to protect the public.
2010.10-5400,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1595.345,1620.245,"So what's different than what the judge did here, where he talked about, explicitly, on page 26, ""it has to deter"" -- the sentence has to deter criminal conduct by others, and it has to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and the sentence -- that's a big factor here, given her failure to appear and what she did out on bail."
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1626.482,1629.434,That is--
2010.10-5400,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1629.434,1635.338,"Now, I know that you're -- there's -- there's an issue about whether this transcript can be read as a dual motive or not."
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1635.338,1635.905,--Right.
2010.10-5400,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1635.905,1641.259,"But my question is, is a dual-motive sentence permissible?"
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1641.259,1653.966,"No, a dual-motive sentence -- if one reason that the judge is selecting the term is to impose a sentence of imprisonment, that violates the prohibition."
2010.10-5400,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1660.537,1662.405,"Isn't that what ""dual motive"" means?"
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1663.039,1664.024,I think -- yes.
2010.10-5400,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1664.507,1665.507,--You want talismatic words.
2010.10-5400,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1666.893,1673.963,"--We -- we think that -- that in this case the Petitioner won't be able to show plain error, won't be able to show an effect on her substantial rights on remand."
2010.10-5400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1673.963,1674.763,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1686.105,1687.155,Thank you.
2010.10-5400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1724.58,1741.857,I could follow your argument much better if the judge could say that this specialized program -- as I am making that a term of your incarceration.
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1768.924,1772.376,"Your Honor, I don't believe that's a large concern for several reasons."
2010.10-5400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1806.484,1812.803,Wasn't there something -- you responded that she didn't -- she said I'd rather not.
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1823.595,1825.178,--There were two distinct issues here.
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.24,1848.961,"I don't know why you consider that that solves your case, that that makes everything okay."
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1874.544,1875.644,A couple of--
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.644,1876.563,It makes no sense.
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1876.563,1884.05,"--I just note, Your Honor, first of all, the statute requires judges to make predictions about deterrence."
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.524,1898.493,You're -- you're not responding to my point.
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1929.079,1941.153,"Your Honor is correct that there is a contingency involved here, but the contingency involved is no greater than the contingency involved in other sentencing decisions judges must make and that is a reason for skepticism."
2010.10-5400,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1944.874,1949.259,"Mr. Bibas, I -- I -- I have to say I don't really understand the whole premise of your argument."
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1971.358,1974.059,"Your Honor, I don't believe you phrased correctly."
2010.10-5400,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1983.249,1983.332,Yes.
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1984.249,1984.782,Yes.
2010.10-5400,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1984.782,1997.073,"You're saying they can consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence, they cannot consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence, but they can consider all these programs in imposing a sentence."
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2006.412,2010.316,"Your Honor, I think the answer is clear if we look at the statutory text."
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2088.899,2091.784,You haven't read the -- the crucial provision of the statute.
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2163.548,2164.317,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.317,2165.417,I don't know any other way to read it.
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2165.417,2166.25,"No, Your Honor."
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.238,2210.177,"I -- I don't know what else recognizing that factor would consist of, except you won't use that factor in deciding imprisonment or length of term of imprisonment."
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2210.177,2212.945,"Your Honor, we've looked through the entire United States Code."
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.349,2219.182,"Well, you tell me what it means here, then."
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2246.285,2256.474,"--Your Honor, a recognize -- we found dozens of instances in the U.S. Code where recognizing introduces a statement of principle or policy or rationale."
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.427,2289.029,But the judge only has the power to impose imprisonment.
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2317.215,2346.048,"Your Honor, judges in supervised release, it -- it -- it's hard to understand why in 3583(e)(3) judges may consider rehabilitation in deciding whether to impose a term of imprisonment on resentencing, and we've been offered no logical explanation as to why that same logic Congress would have meant a flat ban here that it didn't spell out in an initial sentencing."
2010.10-5400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2346.048,2359.375,"It -- it does seem to me that the principal trouble I have with your argument is that, as Justice Scalia mentioned, the judge can't be certain that the treatment will -- will be provided."
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2383.324,2397.714,"Justice Kennedy, while I agree that the reliability of the prediction is an important factor, I think this is dealt with through the ordinary appellate review that this Court has fleshed out in Rita, Gall, and Kimbrough."
2010.10-5400,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2452.882,2459.388,"Mr. Bibas, just practically speaking what does this clause instruct a court not to do in your view?"
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2459.388,2473.695,"It instructs a court to bear in mind that simply locking someone in a cell away from his criminal associates, away from his pattern of life, is not itself going to reform him."
2010.10-5400,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2474.563,2475.297,"Well, really who thought that?"
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2492.859,2497.929,A couple of responses that I think show that to be incorrect.
2010.10-5400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2557.781,2564.085,But wouldn't your proposal lead to unevenness in sentencing?
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2622.791,2625.243,--A couple of points.
2010.10-5400,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2771.302,2780.99,Can you articulate an interpretation of this provision that would guide appellate review?
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2820.548,2822.65,"I understand, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.10-5400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2928.003,2949.332,"But I still find it hard, if I were going to write the opinion, to rule for your position to ignore the 90 percent-10 percent hypothetical problem I have, to say, well now, 90 percent of the time the judge's rules are going to be followed or the judge's recommendations are going to be followed."
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2967.044,2980.452,"Justice Kennedy, first of all, there are programs out there for which the judge's recommendation is a prerequisite and 100 percent of the people who get into the program are ones whom the judge recommended."
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3018.375,3039.221,"If -- if it is as you say, why -- why did Congress leave it up to the Bureau of Prisons to decide whether this person can enter into a rehabilitation program, and not allow the judge to prescribe that the person will enter into it?"
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3042.442,3055.833,"Your Honor, if you will bear with me for your colleagues who like legislative history, and I quote from the Senate report, that this change is designed only to simplify the administration of the prison system, at page 141 of the Senate report."
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3061.237,3064.689,Judges can prescribe it?
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3064.689,3066.307,"No, the change was made--"
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3066.307,3069.009,"Well, that's a substantive change, they can't prescribe, right?"
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3069.009,3075.329,--But it was not intended to affect the authority of the Bureau of Prisons or the judge in their -- in their roles and input.
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3075.996,3078.281,I don't understand what you're saying.
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3084.785,3085.535,--It -- it was--
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3085.535,3086.519,It was a change?
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3086.519,3087.721,"--Yes, it was, actually."
2010.10-5400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3087.721,3088.337,Why?
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3106.533,3126.612,"Your Honor, I believe that there were some legal issues that were coming up in litigation over prison conditions and sentencing in the years leading up to this Act, where there was unclarity as to whether the Attorney General or the judge or the Bureau of Prisons -- whose decision ultimately was being challenged in this litigation."
2010.10-5400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3137.754,3151.044,"Well, the Senate report says that the provisions we've been talking about make clear a defendant should not be sent to prison only because the prison has a program that might be good for him."
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3169.273,3190.204,"Your Honor, the committee in dealing with drug dependence said the commission shall decide whether drug dependence, etcetera, is relevant, shall take it into account only to the extent that it is relevant; and the commission decided as with most of these other factors that drug dependence shall not be used ordinarily in sentencing outside the range, but left it to the judge to decide within the range."
2010.10-5400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3202.179,3204.562,You put a great deal of weight on the word only.
2010.10-5400,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3212.952,3215.754,"--No, I think this goes to Justice Sotomayor's question."
2010.10-5400,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3263.484,3265.084,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.10-5400,3,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3266.953,3268.37,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.10-5400,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3318.968,3337.699,"Counsel, this makes a lot of sense when we're talking about huge disparities in a guideline sentence, versus one where the judge goes outside the guidelines or imposes a greater sentence than otherwise the guidelines would determine for rehabilitation purposes."
2010.10-5400,3,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3411.247,3412.997,Because Congress has prescribed it.
2010.10-5400,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3426.571,3435.077,"Are you arguing for something like a plain statement rule, if the judge says plainly, I'm increasing your sentence so you can get rehabilitation, then there's a problem?"
2010.10-5400,3,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3460.959,3480.355,"It's possible, but I think that this Court entrusts sentencing judges to follow its mandate, and if this Court says you're not to increase sentences for the purposes of getting people into rehabilitative programs, then you should state why you're putting people in prison, that we can count on those reasons to be honestly and truthfully given."
2010.10-5400,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3480.355,3481.322,"Thank you, counsel."
