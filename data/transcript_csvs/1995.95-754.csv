1995.95-754,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.799,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-754, Medtronic, Inc. v. Lora Lohr and the cross-petition, Lora Lohr v. Medtronic."
1995.95-754,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,15.121,27.078,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1995.95-754,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.862,150.979,"Mr. Miller, is there evidence that you have found that Congress thought it was eliminating all State common law claims and would the action of Congress just last year in proposing, at least, caps on punitive damages but not compensatory damages relating to these devices indicate that at a least Congress thought some claims were preserved?"
1995.95-754,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,150.979,157.333,"In all honesty, Justice O'Connor, there really is almost nothing in the legislative history."
1995.95-754,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,210.639,214.152,But the term requirement is by no means self-explanatory.
1995.95-754,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,221.237,229.1,"--That is true, and we have, on the issue of requirement, the fact that 10 courts of appeals have looked at that word."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,1714.516,1722.011,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.471,1812.421,Full premarket approval from the FDA?
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,1812.421,1828.141,"--The States would be free, in that circumstance, because the device was only subject to the 510(k) process, that until such time the DA had required the PMA, that the States would be free to require their own PMA's for that device, and there is a reason for that."
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.141,1829.101,You say the FDA has ruled that.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,1833.913,1835.515,"Well, Justice Scalia, that goes--"
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.515,1840.248,"I mean, they are by the statute or they aren't, unless the statute says they'll be preempted when the FDA says so."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,1840.248,1840.318,--Well--
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.318,1844.021,I find it extraordinary to give deference to the agency on an issue like this.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,1844.021,1846.342,"--Well, the Court has done it on two occasions that we find."
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.342,1847.133,We have?
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,1847.133,1847.554,Yes.
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.567,1883.458,What's the other case?
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,1884.019,1884.95,There's the Lee--
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.95,1885.221,One is Hillsborough County.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,1885.221,1885.661,--Excuse me.
1995.95-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1914.92,1917.241,"You mean the FDA has ruled, not the States have ruled."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,1917.241,1927.909,"Yes, that's right, the FDA has ruled, and there is a reason for that, Mr. Chief Justice, which is this, that for Class III devices the relevant requirement as to safety and effectiveness is clearly the premarket approval."
1995.95-754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1940.147,1957.2,"Mr. Wolfman, once there has been... once, one fine day when the FDA does have a premarket approval setup of its own, and a device does get that premarket approval, would there will be State tort remedies?"
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,1957.2,1959.972,"--Well, I think there would be State tort remedies."
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.961,1993.402,I'm not sure of that.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,1998.945,2000.938,"--Well, now we're moving back to the 510(k) process."
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.938,2001.469,--Yes.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2001.679,2001.939,That is--
1995.95-754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2001.939,2002.33,"Oh, I'm sorry, you're--"
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2006.972,2012.858,"--To answer your question, Justice Ginsburg, we think it a closer question."
1995.95-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.769,2051.601,"Mr. Wolfman, you're going so rapidly, you're losing me a little bit, and I think you may be losing some of my colleagues."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2051.601,2051.972,--I'd be glad to slow down.
1995.95-754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.663,2114.102,I'm not sure I follow you there.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2121.579,2122.347,--Well--
1995.95-754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.347,2123.259,--and why isn't that a requirement?
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2123.259,2125.55,"--Your Honor, I want to be clear on this."
1995.95-754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2136.128,2138.82,"Well, it has to be of the same design as the previous device."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2138.82,2139.251,--It does--
1995.95-754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2139.251,2141.542,So why doesn't that relate to device design?
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2142.143,2144.073,--It only relates to its substantial equivalence.
1995.95-754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2154.13,2155.592,--But isn't there a claim--
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2155.592,2156.133,--to what was on the market--
1995.95-754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2156.133,2158.524,--Isn't there a claim that the device should have been designed differently?
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2158.524,2159.115,--That is correct.
1995.95-754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2159.115,2164.368,"And therefore, wouldn't it be in... would it not violate the requirement that it be the same?"
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2164.368,2169.611,"Well, but again, the requirement, here, is simply that it be the same not for any reason--"
1995.95-754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2169.611,2170.072,Right.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2170.072,2176.305,"--Not for any purpose of its design, and as Medtronic has conceded, there needs to be some subject-matter congruence."
1995.95-754,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2196.068,2197.85,"Right, to show that it was the same, and she says it ought to be difference."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2200.813,2203.003,But her claim is as to the design.
1995.95-754,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2226.127,2238.566,"But the statute doesn't talk in terms of three universes of design, manufacture, labor... and it may talk about labor, but so far as design and manufacture, the statute does not make those distinctions."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2241.999,2242.948,That is--
1995.95-754,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2242.948,2243.669,Or doesn't.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2243.669,2275.639,"--That is precisely right, and that's our point, although many things under the act... for instance, the requirement that manufacturers register with the agency, they're all requirements, but to make any sense out of the statute you have to at the very least concede some subject matter congruence between the State law requirement and the Federal law requirement, and what we're saying is that to be sure, on the State law side Mrs. Lohr's claims would concern the safety of the design of that device, but it does not do so on the Federal law side."
1995.95-754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2361.366,2371.504,"But from what you say, if the FDA chose to be much more specific simply by issuing different and more specific regulations, it could then wipe out State tort law."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2371.504,2380.259,"Well, again, we say that requirement doesn't encompass State damages actions, but that is correct, Your Honor, and let me use an example."
1995.95-754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2411.151,2433.093,"I don't know, Mr. Wolfman... I don't know if you know this, know the answer to this, but I wasn't certain when I read the FDA regs where they say the FDA has to have established specific requirements applicable to a particular device, suppose what they had in their building section was, every building used to manufacture an implant must have a smoke detector every 3 feet in the ceiling."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2453.917,2461.16,"Yes, I do, and I think that is the... what you posit I think is a correct interpretation of the statute."
1995.95-754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2463.754,2463.984,The regs.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2463.984,2464.433,--Yes.
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.885,2479.212,So--
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2479.212,2490.142,"However, what the agency has done as a general matter is focus specifically with respect to devices as in tampons and then otherwise just step back and generally regulate it."
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.142,2506.731,"--Mr. Wolfman, I... what I don't understand is, if you say that requirement means specific requirement at one point in the preemption provision, why doesn't it mean specific requirement throughout the preemption provision, never mind elsewhere in the act?"
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2521.511,2525.124,I'm... yes.
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.124,2529.656,"General requirements are not eliminated, only specific requirements."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2529.656,2530.847,"Yes, and in this case--"
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2530.847,2536.141,"And then further down, which is different from or in addition to any requirement applicable under this chapter."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2540.695,2541.432,--Well--
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2541.432,2549.1,"You can have a State... a State provision so long as its specific, which contradicts a general Federal requirement, or imposes--"
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2549.1,2549.718,"--That's right, and it makes sense."
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2551.09,2556.466,"--So, requirement you're willing to accept as meaning specific requirement wherever it is used in that preemption provision."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2556.466,2560.617,"Well, that's right, but let me use an example of how that played out in the regulatory process."
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.738,2576.379,What requirement is that?
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2577.4,2577.958,--That's the Federal requirement.
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2577.958,2583.014,"Does it require... does it apply only to tampons, or does it apply to a lot of other devices?"
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2583.014,2585.133,It applies to that particular one.
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2588.406,2597.382,"Well then, it's not covered by this anyway so we don't have to talk about it, because you said that any requirement which is different from a requirement applicable under this chapter."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2597.382,2597.682,"Well, the--"
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.682,2598.821,That requirement is not a specific requirement--
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2598.821,2599.352,--But let me--
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.352,2600.344,--so it doesn't even come within in it.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2600.344,2601.334,--Let me explain further.
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.877,2604.395,You really think it's correct?
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2604.395,2604.726,Well--
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.726,2606.118,I can't imagine that you want to read it that way.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2606.118,2609.43,--Let me explain how it is worked out in terms of its application.
1995.95-754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2652.828,2653.679,Why do they have to?
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2669.758,2670.82,"Well, let me tell you--"
1995.95-754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2670.82,2672.75,"It's common, isn't it, in State--"
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2672.75,2675.071,"--That is correct, Justice Breyer, and I suppose I should amend my answer."
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2713.936,2737.483,"--I don't want to waste your time, but just for the record, unless you have a third case, Hillsborough County, which you cited as an example where we've deferred to the agency's interpretation of whether a statute preempts the State, Hillsborough County related to an agency regulation as to whether the agency regulation was intended to preempt, assuming the agency had preemption power, and Lawrence County, the other case you gave me, is not a preemption case."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2745.81,2746.317,Those are the cases--
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.317,2750.692,--because I really don't know of a case in which we've deferred to the agency as to preemption of State law.
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2750.692,2753.703,"--Well, I don't have... those are the two cases I have."
1995.95-754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2757.647,2762.289,"An agency reg, the issue was whether the agency reg was intended by the agency to preempt, as it could be."
1995.95-754,1,18166,brian_wolfman,,2762.289,2764.641,"--Those are the cases I have, Your Honor."
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2822.791,2842.172,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-754,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2872.253,2888.955,"Is your argument there that, assuming a consistent usage within the section, the Federal requirement is described as being a requirement imposed under this chapter?"
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2888.955,2899.781,"--Right, applicable under the act, and the Federal act does not impose... this point does not derive from the word requirement the fact that the Federal act only addresses statutory regulatory requirements."
1995.95-754,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2907.315,2923.155,"But there's also the reference in there, in referring to the requirement at the State level as being imposed by a State or political subdivision, and particularly the reference to political subdivision doesn't sound like something that would cover a common law rule, even a recovery rule, does it?"
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2923.155,2928.869,"--Well, perhaps not, but it's State or political subdivision in common law."
1995.95-754,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2928.869,2929.43,That's true.
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2929.43,2933.161,"And common law derived from State courts, the State supreme court or whatever--"
1995.95-754,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2933.161,2947.012,"But that would at least leave a question, and since preemption gives the presumption against preemption, I would suppose anything that was no clearer than that would not have a preemptive effect."
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2947.012,2947.753,--Well--
1995.95-754,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2947.753,2952.625,"So we would construe it in a way that would not result in preemption, isn't that fair?"
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2952.625,2965.403,"--That may be one possible construction, but we believe, particularly read against Cipollone and the use of the requirement there, and just the nature of State law, State law we believe would also encompass duties imposed by the--"
1995.95-754,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2965.403,2967.184,Why would that be a permissible construction?
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2972.427,2972.767,--Right.
1995.95-754,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.767,2975.82,Your argument is that it includes both the common law--
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2975.82,2976.241,Right.
1995.95-754,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2976.241,2978.001,--and statutory law.
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2978.001,2979.032,"Right, law from whatever source."
1995.95-754,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.032,2983.395,And to cover the statutory thing you would have to include or any subdivision.
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2983.395,2984.706,"Political subdivision, that's correct."
1995.95-754,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3059.525,3063.348,"Temporarily, if this statute works eventually the way Congress intended."
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3063.348,3067.591,"Right, until a premarket approval application is called for under the regulations."
1995.95-754,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3108.477,3116.612,"To establish that, it seems to me you have to say that there's no requirement as to the design of those products."
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3116.612,3118.835,"--That's correct, and we believe that's true."
1995.95-754,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3118.835,3119.904,"But there is one, isn't there?"
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3119.904,3122.135,"No, and if I may, there are several points there."
1995.95-754,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3134.143,3137.214,The obligation to follow that design originates from the statute.
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3146.141,3149.573,"--But Justice Scalia, the same is also true for a pre-'76 device."
1995.95-754,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3170.106,3170.586,Why is that clear?
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3172.419,3178.344,--There's nothing... there's no requirement at all with respect to design imposed on the... on a preamendments device.
1995.95-754,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3178.344,3178.551,"Yes, there is."
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3185.757,3187.688,"Well, yes."
1995.95-754,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3208.19,3218.348,Why doesn't it work to say that the requirement that's Federal which arguably displaces the State doesn't do it at all unless it's a relevant requirement?
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3223.261,3223.582,--No.
1995.95-754,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3223.582,3224.683,It has to be relevant.
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3224.683,3225.034,"Just so, or--"
1995.95-754,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3225.034,3225.392,All right.
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3229.897,3230.898,"--Well, I--"
1995.95-754,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3230.898,3233.649,Do we then turn to see what this agency says?
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3234.498,3242.415,"--We believe you... one does, and the... and I think that is the message of the agency's use of the word specific requirement."
1995.95-754,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3249.147,3252.142,"--You say relevant means, it has to be relevant to safety?"
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3252.142,3258.354,"No, it has to be... the relevance... there has to be subject matter congruence between the State requirement and the Federal requirements."
1995.95-754,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3258.694,3271.083,"What they say is, the relevant requirements, those requirements that are relevant in relation to a particular claim, State reg or rule, is a reg that is specific."
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3271.083,3271.874,"--Right, exactly."
1995.95-754,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3271.874,3278.339,Specific in other specific requirements applicable to a particular device.
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3278.339,3279.007,"Right, and--"
1995.95-754,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3279.007,3280.279,So it must be a specific--
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3293.907,3294.257,--No.
1995.95-754,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3328.881,3329.602,"Well, but that--"
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3329.602,3330.881,--covers the same subject matter.
1995.95-754,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3330.881,3332.654,--It seems to me that sweeps way too broadly.
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3345.083,3345.561,The Federal requirement?
1995.95-754,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3345.561,3345.952,Yes.
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3345.952,3346.352,Yes.
1995.95-754,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3346.743,3348.543,Can there be a failure-to-warn suit in a State court?
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3348.543,3349.214,--I think it would--
1995.95-754,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3349.214,3350.386,That's a specific requirement.
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3350.386,3359.561,"--I think, again, it would depend on whether the agency had intended to... whether that intended to exhaust the agency's requirement with respect to labeling."
1995.95-754,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3375.073,3389.91,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, there are claims here relating to negligent manufacturing and to failure to warn, and there are FDA requirements in both these areas, so what's left of those claims?"
1995.95-754,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3389.91,3411.926,"--Well, as to the... we agree that those are requirements within the meaning of the preemption provision, but they're not... but the State law claim is not preempted unless its shown by the defendant claiming preemption to be different from or in addition to the State law claims, and at this summary judgment stage of the case, we don't believe that this Court can confidently conclude that whatever law the case would be presented to the jury on would be different from or in addition to the general State requirements."
1995.95-754,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3415.208,3416.808,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
