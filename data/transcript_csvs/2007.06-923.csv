2007.06-923,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.987,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-923, Metropolitan Life Insurance versus Glenn."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,8.137,9.356,Thank you.
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,80.833,100.664,"No, but neither, neither does the fact that there may be dual capacities eliminate the fact that there are contrary tugs on the, the individual or the, or the organization that has the dual responsibilities, and there's no reason that the law should be blind to that."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,100.664,102.78,"--No, Your Honor, it should not be blind."
2007.06-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,117.171,121.825,"What do you mean by... let's get straight by what we mean by ""in actuality conflicted""."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,129.847,130.93,We're using the words--
2007.06-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.93,136.417,And aren't we talking in this case always about fiduciaries who are in actuality conflicted.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,136.417,137.301,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.407,147.94,No.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,161.249,162.482,"Yes, that's right, Your Honor."
2007.06-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,166.118,176.092,"So let's call that a conflicted fiduciary, somebody who has two loyalties, whether or not he allows the one loyalty to distort his judgment."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,176.092,176.258,Yes.
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.329,189.316,Let me follow up on Justice Scalia's question because I think your brief really goes astray on that.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,244.868,254.974,"--That's exactly the distinction that we are making by using actual and potential or, as this Court said, possible and actual in Firestone."
2007.06-923,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,264.329,267.781,Does it have to be just the specific decisions?
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,287.528,291.563,--I don't think it would ever result in a de novo review.
2007.06-923,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,298.252,314.862,"So then you're saying, A, the fact that there is a potential conflict is not enough; B, the fact that there are no procedures in the company to ensure that the conflict doesn't affect the judgment, that is not enough either."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,314.862,315.964,No.
2007.06-923,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.23,319.432,I'm positing.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,338.477,341.278,"--No, Your Honor, it does not, and as the United States--"
2007.06-923,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,341.278,350.367,"Well then, I don't know what effect you're giving to the fact, as the earlier questions have indicated, that there is a structural conflict."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,350.367,375.769,"--That's a structural conflict that ERISA anticipates and, as the United States said in its brief to this court in Pegram v. Herdrich, that ERISA tolerates this dual role and this level of conflict in order to keep these plans that are so vital in our country's economic interests in underlying the employee's well-being--"
2007.06-923,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,375.769,386.224,You want us to write an opinion to say that it's irrelevant that a company does not have procedures to insulate the profit section from the claims processing section?
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,388.112,390.502,"--No, Justice Kennedy, absolutely not."
2007.06-923,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,399.53,400.31,How does that work?
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,420.714,436.473,"It means again, remembering that these are claims under 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(1)(B) for benefits due under the terms of the plan, it's very important that the courts remember to look at the terms of those plans--"
2007.06-923,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,436.473,446.079,"All right, you've got two cases, one where the person does not have a conflict of interest under a particular plan, the other where he does."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,452.935,474.782,"--As, as in trust law... and if you look at the cases in trust law, what the court needs to look at when the settlor, here the employer, designates the discretionary authority under the terms of the trust or the plan is that that conflict comes into play if it seems that it's been breached."
2007.06-923,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,489.942,492.827,I guess I don't see an answer to my question yet.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,509.771,520.626,"It remains in the discretion because this Court said that that freedom of contract that's so important to ERISA, to keep the benefits, the employers interested in offering benefits--"
2007.06-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.626,522.578,But you're saying it doesn't make any difference.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,537.771,539.021,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,539.021,540.104,It does make a difference then.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,551.126,551.912,Certainly not.
2007.06-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,556.447,558.566,That's exactly my question.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,558.566,559.032,Yes--
2007.06-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,559.032,560.516,I'm going to let you answer this question--
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,560.516,561.101,--And I--
2007.06-923,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,561.101,563.051,--But I want you to work mine in if you can.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,595.572,614.652,"--In this case... and this case I think presents a very narrow question for the Court, and that is where there is the dual role inherent in the plan but no evidence whatsoever that it infected the decision, if it must be given weight in answer to the Court's second question, then--"
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,614.652,616.452,But then you come to the end of the line.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,647.707,649.492,--She actually applied herself.
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,649.492,653.694,But she got a lawyer that they recommended that she have.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,653.694,660.681,"Metlife recommended a lawyer to her and also said she could use her own lawyer, which was consistent with the plan design."
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,660.681,668.287,But the point is they came to her and said: Get Social Security disability benefits.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,673.357,674.941,Correct.
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,674.941,692.486,"So here is a company that says: Tell the U.S. government that you are totally and permanently disabled, but... and then we'll recoup all that money that we paid out to you; but then when we get a chance to look, look it over, we'll say you're not disabled."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,700.674,712.816,"Because, Your Honor, at the time that that letter was written to the Respondent here in October of 2000, in fact Metlife had granted her benefits."
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,729.361,731.494,"Yes, I'm not questioning that at all."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,731.494,732.063,When--
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,732.063,733.296,That sounds fine.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,743.435,761.313,"--The... the reason is... and it's unfortunate that often Social Security makes the same decision that the plan fiduciary has made two years earlier, and the government is looking backwards at certain evidence that may not be before the ERISA plan fiduciary."
2007.06-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.836,779.71,"Ms. Posner, it seems to me that that ought to be looked at with suspicion, whether or not the person making the decision has a conflict."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,785.447,786.797,Justice Scalia--
2007.06-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.797,791.601,"And I am still... listen, I know that we're responsible for this because we said it in Firestone."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,834.592,835.694,--I think--
2007.06-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.694,838.729,Is that what you mean by giving it some weight?
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,838.729,840.462,"--Yes, Justice Scalia--"
2007.06-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.462,840.712,You do.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,840.712,841.112,--But--
2007.06-923,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.112,845.83,So a perfectly reasonable decision becomes unreasonable simply because you have a conflict?
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,845.83,862.875,"--It depends on how close that reasonable decision is to the line, and in this case the decision was not one that this mere dual-role conflict, the lowest level of conflict that can exist, can push that reasonable decision over."
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,863.508,872.247,"Okay, let's assume... let's assume that I'm reviewing it, and I... I don't find it as clear as you do, and I'm on the fence."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,878.837,883.055,--You... I think under Firestone you have to take that into account.
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,883.055,914.058,"And therefore I will say, okay, I wouldn't know for sure how to go in this case, but I see the conflict of interest and that's enough to make me say more probably than not there was a reflection of the self-interest of the provider, rather than the interest of the... of the insured here; and, therefore, I'm going to find that the... that the conflict did disadvantage the person insured."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,919.128,922.597,"Again, depending upon how these things weigh."
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,922.597,923.616,"Well, I just told you."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,923.616,924.316,Yes.
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,924.316,925.449,I just told you how it weighed.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,941.792,943.375,"No, it would not be."
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,943.775,944.425,Okay.
2007.06-923,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,944.425,947.696,But that's not the argument that I understood you to make in your brief.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,950.229,951.981,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe it is."
2007.06-923,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,971.394,972.394,Could I just get this clear?
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,985.302,986.735,"--That's correct, Justice Alito."
2007.06-923,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,986.735,987.085,--the standard of review.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,987.085,995.839,And I took Justice Souter's hypothetical to mean that there had been a conflict that seriously weighed on his view.
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,995.839,996.307,No.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1053.66,1055.312,I think that that could be.
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1058.68,1059.23,"Well, why wouldn't it be?"
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1059.23,1066.834,"--Well, again, we're looking at conflict as if it's the only factor here, and when we look at these cases--"
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1066.834,1067.203,No.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1068.886,1069.586,--You're saying that--
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1069.586,1074.024,"--factors that say the company was right, factors that say the company is wrong."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1086.597,1087.181,--I think--
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1087.181,1090.116,And am I right or wrong under Firestone?
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1090.116,1097.186,"--Again, I think that it's very important to look at the employer's plan and this employer specifically."
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1097.186,1098.403,"That may be, but what's the answer to my question?"
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1098.403,1100.055,The answer is--
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1100.055,1100.888,Am I right or wrong?
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1100.888,1104.507,"--The answer is you could be right or you could be wrong, but it's--"
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1104.507,1105.459,That is not going to--
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1105.459,1106.242,--so important--
2007.06-923,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1106.242,1110.161,"--That's not going to help the appellate court, my friends here who have to review my decision."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1112.78,1115.481,--These matters are so fact-specific.
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1115.481,1117.349,"Well, let's take these facts."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1117.349,1118.033,"Okay, Your Honor."
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1118.033,1130.407,"As the trier... I mean ERISA, yes, it certainly says you can be both the plan administrator and the payor, but all it says is that that's permissible."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1196.468,1222.351,"Your Honor, the problem with the hypothetical as you just stated is that you've taken the employer's contract out of the calculation, and that the employer has the right to determine its own plan and design those plans as they see fit in order to keep these vital economic safety nets available, affordable and capable of providing a safety net to the--"
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1222.351,1228.677,How does that bear on making a determination that the--
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1228.677,1229.379,--Because--
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1229.379,1238.795,--employee... that the plan administrator has to make: Is this person disabled and is she not?
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1238.795,1244.199,"--You can't make that determination, Justice Ginsburg, out of the context of the plan design."
2007.06-923,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1269.832,1278.187,"Counsel, Justice Souter's question and Justice Alito's question highlight for me what I think is the central issue."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1332.59,1338.078,"We believe that it's the Justice Alito hypothetical, where it does play a role."
2007.06-923,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1348.934,1353.921,But the problem with that is the Court needs to know what the standard of review is before it gets to the merits.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1382.456,1385.844,"No... yes, Justice Alito, and I think you hit the nail on the head there."
2007.06-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1402.916,1402.751,Yes.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1411.59,1439.692,"There are cases, Your Honor, where can you see that, for instance, when you look at the medical evidence, that the administrator shows in its claim file, which, unlike any other area of the law, the whole process is transparent under ERISA; and there may really not be any evidence that's supporting it, or so little that it's hard to understand how that fiduciary could possibly have reached that decision."
2007.06-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1439.692,1440.909,"Well, you're just saying that the plaintiff has to have an overwhelming case."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1444.644,1449.048,"That's actually the standard, though, Justice Stevens, in trust law also."
2007.06-923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1481.769,1495.094,"Well, I can understand that in normal trust situations, but it's hard for me to understand how you're going to prove an insurance company's particular claim adjustment was really motivated by a conflict of interest rather than thinking the claim wasn't valid."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1495.094,1509.668,"That is a problem, but the fact of the matter is that you... you read the cases and the files, as I'm sure you have, and it's apparent that there are... let me use Post v. Hartford as an example, if I may."
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1520.225,1522.577,"Where, where is this decision from that you're--"
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1522.577,1529.748,"Post v. Hartford, Your Honor, is at 501 Fed. 3d 154."
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1626.109,1629.061,--There's one feature of this that I don't understand.
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1659.413,1659.846,--Yes.
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1726.89,1729.592,Then why did Metlife withdraw that proposal?
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1729.592,1755.808,"Well, there was no proposal, Your Honor, but it was given to a rehabilitation specialist to work that up to see if she was disabled and eligible for rehabilitative employment, because her treating physician responded to that inquiry by saying she could do sedentary work, she retained that physical capacity, which was consistent with what he said in January of '02 and again in June of '02."
2007.06-923,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1756.827,1764.397,"My question was not what Dr. Patel said, but how did that proposal get dropped?"
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1764.397,1766.599,"--There was no proposal, Your Honor."
2007.06-923,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1780.025,1781.175,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-923,0,16756,amy_k_posner,,1781.175,1782.375,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
2007.06-923,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1782.375,1787.929,Mr. Rosenkranz.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1787.929,1797.321,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court got it right in Firestone when it said, of course a conflict must be weighed."
2007.06-923,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.39,1804.924,Dictum.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1804.924,1809.378,"--It was dictum, Your Honor, but it was very well-considered dictum because...--"
2007.06-923,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.26,1838.729,What I don't like about the dictum is I don't know what it means.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1838.729,1839.529,--Your Honor--
2007.06-923,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.529,1845.465,"I think it's lovely to say weigh it as a factor, it gets the case off our docket and it's fine."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1846.232,1846.984,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2007.06-923,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.984,1865.029,"Does it mean that a perfectly reasonable decision that is within the discretion... I mean this plan says that Metlife will have... knowing that it will have the conflict, that they will make the decisions and so long as they are not arbitrary, they are valid."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1886.042,1887.025,"--Your Honor, the answer--"
2007.06-923,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.025,1889.311,"If it doesn't mean that, then it means nothing."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1889.311,1890.294,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2007.06-923,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1910.856,1919.694,"Well, but trust law doesn't take into account what we have said repeatedly in our ERISA decisions, which is we want to encourage people to set up ERISA plans."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1947.631,1975.9,"Your Honor, I understand, and this Court considered that in Firestone, the litigation cost and the added administrative costs, and this Court concluded en route to de novo review that the 1132(a)(1)(B) remedy is so infused with the interests of ensuring that the beneficiaries get their benefits due, that that is the interest that the courts weigh most in determining the standard of review."
2007.06-923,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1975.9,1978.533,Do you... which position do you adopt?
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1988.458,1990.408,"Your Honor, the answer is both."
2007.06-923,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2017.725,2020.093,"Well, that sounds like the Justice Alito hypothetical."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2035.187,2041.424,"No, Your Honor, because what trust law says is that you apply especially careful scrutiny, which entails two things."
2007.06-923,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2095.475,2096.341,Trust law doesn't say.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2109.068,2116.489,"Your Honor, it absolutely does, and the 26 law professors in the amicus brief that they filed with this Court explain exactly--"
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2116.489,2118.591,But I don't know what to look to in trust law.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2154.93,2155.514,--Absolutely--
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2155.514,2160.501,"I doubt, since banks are trustees, I doubt but I'm not sure here... 3--"
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2160.501,2160.834,--Your Honor--
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2160.834,2177.026,"--that banks are trustees... suppose you were to say, look, the bank has an interest in maximizing the amount of money in its account and therefore every decision of a distribution of such trustee is subject to some special thing."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2213.901,2218.337,--So let me break it down and first turn to the premise.
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2223.657,2226.026,I overstated.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2226.026,2226.676,Okay.
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2226.676,2228.978,Take the examples that I gave.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2232.263,2232.647,Okay.
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2261.532,2262.466,"But that's, you see, their point."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2276.376,2277.059,"Well, Your Honor--"
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2277.059,2277.909,You have that kind of conflict.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2278.911,2286.482,"--Justice Breyer, it's just wrong under trust law and it's wrong under the facts, as everyone knows them to be in the insurance industry."
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.622,2301.907,"The bank makes its money by putting money in an account, paying interest and lending it at more money."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2301.907,2305.978,But... So let me give an example from real life.
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2321.655,2331.796,"Yes, and Chase Manhattan bank has $14 trillion in trust accounts, and if they just put in for three days money into an interest-bearing account and lend it out for 5 minutes, they will make $1 billion."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2351.741,2375.206,"Well, Your Honor, the first thing to say is that... if that is, in fact, an authorized transaction, that would fall under the self-dealing rules of trust law, and trust law self-dealing rules are situations in which the set law has actually suspended the duty of loyalty of the trustee... that's correct... of the trustee."
2007.06-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2385.628,2387.78,Mr.... Mr. Rosenkranz.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2440.898,2444.016,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, says that explicitly in the claim file?"
2007.06-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2444.016,2446.135,"--That's right, the... the e-mail shows up."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2525.754,2529.539,"Your Honor, the decisionmaker here is the court reviewing?"
2007.06-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2530.239,2533.86,No the decisionmaker is the person who made the beneficiary... the benefits decision.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2585.059,2587.744,"--To consider it, yes, Your Honor, but--"
2007.06-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2587.744,2596.683,"In other words, when we take... it is taken as substantive evidence to... to get us out of the zone of reasonableness in case number two."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2600.301,2601.535,"--No, Your Honor, absolutely not."
2007.06-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2614.228,2616.344,But... but the record has the structural context.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2616.344,2631.654,"--Yes, Your Honor, except for that what would appear to be at a... right at the outer bounds of reasonableness for an unconflicted fiduciary could knock you over the fence, to use Your Honor's earlier analogy, for a conflicted fiduciary."
2007.06-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2655.269,2655.602,No.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2659.321,2659.754,--Number three.
2007.06-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2661.423,2663.739,Number three Honor we can't make up our mind.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2663.739,2669.327,"--But the decisionmaker, you said, Your Honor, in number three, could not make up its mind."
2007.06-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2669.327,2669.893,That's right.
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2669.893,2681.919,And if the... and if the court confirms yes; the decisionmaker was right that this was really close; you're right at the target center of the zone of reasonableness and the conflict of interest doesn't push you over.
2007.06-923,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2691.692,2700.381,So... so you... I guess you are saying it may be considered as substantive evidence but it is not a process tiebreaker?
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2700.381,2703.75,"--Your Honor, let me rephrase it."
2007.06-923,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2744.241,2752.347,How does a reviewing court know how far it can go from the outer boundary of the zone of reasonableness when there is a conflicting interest?
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2764.488,2765.121,"--Your Honor, I--"
2007.06-923,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2765.121,2767.44,Does it work like that depending on the facts of the case?
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2767.44,2770.475,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that's where the Court can't calibrate."
2007.06-923,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2775.094,2777.462,And what would... how would you verbalize it?
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2777.462,2778.096,I--
2007.06-923,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2778.096,2784.902,"Because everybody talks about yes, it's a factor, it's a relevant factor."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2795.591,2799.994,--I would say first and foremost... I would say three things to the district courts.
2007.06-923,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2860.364,2884.664,"Suppose that the insurance company shows or may be required to show, at least by the burden of production, that it has established firewalls, very careful procedures, written regulations that claims administrators are not to consult with the people that set policy and prices."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2891.985,2892.801,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-923,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2895.051,2910.846,So that there is nothing the fiduciary can do in order to avoid intrusive... highly... a high degree of scrutiny in review of every close case?
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2910.846,2915.231,"--Well, Your Honor, first, just to be clear, we are talking about still a deferential standard."
2007.06-923,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2927.872,2937.513,So that all insurance company claims adjustors have less deferential review than independent claims administrators?
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2937.513,2943.834,"--Yes, Your Honor, unless the insurance company comes in and can demonstrate in a case that we've never heard of--"
2007.06-923,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2943.834,2949.138,You want us to institute an industrywide rule differentiating insurance companies from other--
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2949.138,2956.392,"--Your Honor, one very important thing to say about that is that under trust law, an authorized conflict."
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2956.392,2964.164,"Well, is there an example in trust law where, say, a bank's a trustee and they self-insure in some area?"
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2967.599,2970.134,"I don't understand the hypothetical, Your Honor."
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2970.134,2975.621,"Well, I mean, you can easily transpose this to other... trusts are run by banks often that are trustees."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2987.061,2987.596,"Well, Your Honor--"
2007.06-923,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2987.596,2989.413,"--And I think that... my guess, but I don't know."
2007.06-923,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2996.369,3004.722,--Only where what the bank is doing is engaging in self-dealing that... of the sort that's authorized.
2007.06-923,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3005.724,3006.738,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3018.615,3029.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court should not turn a blind eye to the conflict of interest that exists when an administrator both evaluates and pays claims."
2007.06-923,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3038.579,3049.753,"We've heard a lot of talk about judicial eyes today, but it doesn't... it makes it sound as if abuse-of-discretion review is nothing, and with the added factor you want to look more closely."
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3069.629,3078.133,"--Well, we agree with the point you're making, that the question in all of these cases is the reasonableness, where there's a discretionary clause, is the reasonableness of the administrator's determination."
2007.06-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.102,3084.638,And--
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3084.638,3085.288,And one fact--
2007.06-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3085.288,3094.927,--But you say that one of the things that can make it unreasonable is the mere fact that there exists this... this conflict.
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3094.927,3095.96,--The conflict of interest.
2007.06-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.96,3100.314,That renders what is a perfectly reasonable decision unreasonable.
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3100.748,3101.931,In very close cases.
2007.06-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3101.931,3102.516,--I don't understand that.
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3121.91,3132.451,"Well, this is a standard that comes from trust law, the reasonableness standard, and this Court has recognized similar standards in all different areas of the law where they've talked about... where you've talked about reasonableness and abuse of discretion review--"
2007.06-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.451,3135.07,"Well, I don't mind reasonableness and I don't mind abuse of discretion."
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3154.199,3165.506,"--In every case, the court would need to make a decision about reasonableness, and in the cases where there is a conflict of interest that needs to be weighed what the court would do is take a close look at the administrator's rationale--"
2007.06-923,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3165.506,3166.472,Then what analogy?
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3239.202,3250.244,"--First of all, this Court should say that Firestone correctly set out the framework for the de novo default standard of review and what should happen in the case of a discretionary determination where the plan confers discretion--"
2007.06-923,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3250.244,3250.827,Why--
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3250.827,3252.677,--that review should be under the trust law standard.
2007.06-923,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3252.677,3259.349,"--If we look at Firestone, it's rather laconic."
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3292.987,3300.057,"Well, both on pages 111 and on 115, this Court was looking to the law of trusts."
2007.06-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3335.397,3346.971,"Suppose an insurance company... I'll just repeat my earlier question... has done the best that it can do to have a firewall, independence and so forth."
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3354.227,3357.429,"The standard of review would be the same, which is review for reasonableness, but--"
2007.06-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3357.429,3363.916,So it makes no difference what... it makes no difference what the policies of the companies are insofar as the standard of review?
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3363.916,3376.157,"--The standard of review is the same, but the outcome could be different in that case because what the insurance company did should be taken into account when the court is making a judgment call, the same kind of judgment call that courts have made in equity cases for years."
2007.06-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3376.157,3376.724,This--
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3376.724,3377.141,But--
2007.06-923,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3377.141,3379.926,"--This bears upon the question Justice Breyer asked, which we never could get completely answered."
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3383.295,3390.666,--The Sixth Circuit correctly determined that there needed to be greater scrutiny to... to the claims determination in this case.
2007.06-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3412.413,3415.115,I don't think you're at all saying that it's the same standard of review.
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3455.33,3456.067,We think that the answer--
2007.06-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3456.067,3458.394,"There's a clear rule, you know."
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3458.394,3460.422,--We think that the answer comes from trust law.
2007.06-923,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3462.703,3463.483,But under trust law--
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3463.483,3464.532,--about whether a decision was reasonable.
2007.06-923,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3464.532,3468.444,--we don't have... we don't have an established policy of encouraging people to establish trusts.
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3474.498,3484.639,"That's true, but that's balanced against the strict fiduciary duties in ERISA, that in cases of a conflict of interest suggests that the plan administrator's determination needs to get additional scrutiny."
2007.06-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3514.925,3486.022,All right.
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3585.802,3595.776,"--The structural conflict should be used in the weighing although, for the purposes of your hypothetical, I see the answer as being the same in both situations that you posited."
2007.06-923,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3598.978,3604.732,"It's a question of when you use it; and on the first hypothetical, you may not have to use it at all."
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3618.54,3621.242,"That, we think, would be more consistent with purposes--"
2007.06-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3621.242,3624.01,"Well, if you're going to do that, you have to tell me how much it weighs."
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3654.529,3655.779,--Can I answer the question?
2007.06-923,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3655.779,3656.395,Sure.
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3656.395,3661.433,I think the problem with this inquiry is that reasonableness does not have mathematical standards.
2007.06-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3665.42,3667.17,I'm not weighing reasonableness.
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3673.174,3674.609,I think that--
2007.06-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3674.609,3675.826,It's not reasonableness.
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3675.826,3684.464,--The conflict is one of many factors like the Social Security Administration's determination and how it was treated in this case that suggests that the plan administrator's determination was unreasonable.
2007.06-923,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3689.452,3693.237,"Then you should only use it as a tiebreaker, I suggest, if you can tell me."
2007.06-923,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3693.237,3694.287,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-923,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3694.287,3694.856,Thank you.
2007.06-923,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3694.856,3697.556,"Miss Posner, you have one minute remaining."
2007.06-923,3,16756,amy_k_posner,,3697.556,3698.722,Thank you Your Honor.
2007.06-923,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3767.633,3768.652,What did you just say?
2007.06-923,3,16756,amy_k_posner,,3774.639,3775.089,--Yes.
2007.06-923,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3778.707,3779.424,--Was intended by the--
2007.06-923,3,16756,amy_k_posner,,3779.424,3780.641,--was absolutely intended on.
2007.06-923,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3790.532,3791.349,"Thank you, counsel."
