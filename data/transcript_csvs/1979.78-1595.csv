1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.047,This case is submitted.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,83.804,87.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,169.422,177.284,"Mr. Wood, did it -- did it show affirmatively that they had no lawyer or did it just show or fail to show that he had one?"
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,177.284,177.715,"No, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,188.365,191.997,Is there anything on the record other than that counsel told?
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,191.997,192.968,"No, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,221.813,230.715,What -- what is your position here if we go along with you -- is it your position that the conviction must be reversed?
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,230.715,231.097,"No, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,234.952,235.659,Say it again.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,235.659,238.267,I am happy to accept the burden of proof.
1979.78-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,261.524,288.635,"Do you disagree with Judge -- or Judge Russell's statement in the opinion for the Fourth Circuit on the first page of the petition for writ of certiorari which has its App.1 where Judge Russell says, ""The defendant does not deny in this appeal the receipt and possession of a firearm neither does he dispute his earlier conviction in Florida or that such conviction is facially valid."""
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,288.635,291.197,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I do dispute that."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,307.134,309.723,Did the dissenting judge make any issue of that?
1979.78-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,309.723,310.008,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.143,342.535,"But if you go back 20 years, it may be very difficult to find out whether he had a lawyer or didn't."
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,342.535,352.921,"Well, that -- that question has been addressed by this Court with -- with agony I'm sure sometimes, but it's never too -- too late to cure a wrong that was done whether it's 20 years ago or 50 years ago."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,361.656,369.782,Well wasn't there some other way to make that a little more clearer and eliminate it as an issue in the case?
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,373.432,378.1,"Well, as the same, Mr. Chief Justice it came on -- on a proffer."
1979.78-1595,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,385.86,401.456,"Well, Mr. Wood, the -- Judge Winter's dissenting opinion says that in arguing the correctness of the District Court's ruling, the Government in fact concedes that for the present purposes, the conviction was obtained in violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment rights."
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,407.873,408.201,I had always --
1979.78-1595,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,408.201,411.703,I assume at least accepts the hypothesis.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,411.703,412.142,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,414.561,416.415,And argues upon that hypothesis.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,416.415,417.933,"Absolutely, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,417.933,435.332,Is -- is the final sentence in his or final two sentences in his dissent put a mild amount of question on that because it -- Judge Winter would remand in order to determine whether or not.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,442.325,446.348,"I think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,453.156,458.846,Between Judge Winter's view that could not be accomplished except by granting a new trial --
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,458.846,459.176,By -- by re --
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,459.176,460.522,-- making a new record.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,460.522,461.651,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,464.238,465.859,"That's what you tried to do, weren't you?"
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,465.859,466.843,"Yes, sir, absolutely."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,466.843,467.895,(Voice Overlap) exactly what you're doing.
1979.78-1595,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,467.895,470.569,And that's what you complained aboutm did you remember them.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,470.569,471.486,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,471.486,472.783,That's all that was doing.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,472.783,473.801,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,473.801,477.023,"Mr. Wood, under 922 (h) --"
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,477.023,478.395,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,478.395,483.148,-- it would be sufficient if your client were merely under indictment.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,483.148,485.314,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,485.57,488.568,Is that square with your position as to convictions?
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,488.568,489.364,"Oh, absolutely sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,628.882,635.951,"Well, but doesn't the reversal affirmatively vacate the conviction so that there is at that time no conviction extent."
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,635.951,636.989,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,636.989,639.92,"That -- is it quite like the situation you have here, is it?"
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,639.92,640.395,That's right.
1979.78-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.878,719.524,Do you -- do you think the language of Congress on its face is susceptible of in -- including within its sweep the position of a person who has been convicted by a jury as appealed and as the Appellate Court has reversed the judgment and directed a judgment of not guilty to be entered?
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,719.524,720.71,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,724.286,746.243,"And you -- do -- and you really see no difference between that and the question of a person who's been convicted and who, after -- after he's prosecuted under the statute, and has -- who's never appealed as now says, I didn't have a lawyer."
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,746.243,747.435,I do see a difference.
1979.78-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,772.657,775.668,"Well, but he -- he was -- he was successful too and --"
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,775.668,775.73,Yes.
1979.78-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,775.73,777.639,-- and the guy's conviction reversed.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,787.061,787.321,That's correct sir.
1979.78-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.321,788.417,-- for another offense.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,788.417,799.094,That's correct and it raises an interesting point that I've thought about is what if Lewis had come into -- to my office and I hope I don't publically confess malpractice or potential for it.
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,816.816,819.862,Unless you were planning on going out and buying a firearm.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,819.862,820.63,"No, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,824.989,831.676,"So you were you going to apply for a job wherein you list any prior felony conviction I suppose it might be desirable to have his record clear, wouldn't it?"
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,831.676,833.515,I -- I think it would be to have his record clear.
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,833.577,835.688,Because most of the times that would be a bar to employment.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,835.688,837.786,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,838.094,843.395,"Of course also, I assume he could probably take some risk of retrial whenever he does it too."
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,849.457,850.737,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,861.654,876.414,"Mr. Wood, supposing instead of no lawyer he'd offered to prove and for purposes of decision the Government accepted the fact that his conviction rested entirely on a conviction that was obtained from him by stringing him up over a door and beating him up or something like that."
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,880.602,889.858,"Sir, I -- I think as the law review article, the Harvard Law Review article points out, I think, a line has to be drawn."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,891.228,894.616,"But the conception of that would be void -- that would be a void conviction, I suppose."
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,894.616,895.313,"A void, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,895.313,897.071,"That would be a void conviction, I guess but that's --"
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,897.071,897.791,I think so.
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,906.175,908.429,"But that's just as void as one where you don't have a lawyer, is that --"
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,908.429,908.985,I agree.
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,908.985,910.628,Yes.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,917.101,918.029,"I think so, yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,918.029,922.087,I'm not sure I have your response clear in mind.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,924.98,925.493,"No, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,938.34,942.95,And did you -- did you say that he spent four years in prison under this conviction?
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,942.95,947.447,"He spent -- he spent some years in prison, Judge -- Mr. Justice Burger."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,947.447,953.174,"So he certainly didn't think his conviction was void during that period, did he, whether that makes some difference or not."
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,953.174,956.472,"Well, he was -- he knew he's behind bars."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,959.25,963.511,"He had no -- he had no habeas corpus, no collateral attack of any kind on the conviction."
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,963.511,963.929,"No, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1163.545,1165.596,When was this section passed under which you're client was --
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,1165.596,1166.779,"1968, if Your Honor please."
1979.78-1595,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1166.779,1167.394,1968.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,1170.966,1172.168,"Judge, I don't know."
1979.78-1595,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1176.725,1178.651,"This is part of the Omnibus Crime Bill, isn't it?"
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,1178.651,1179.47,"I'm sorry, Mr. Justice."
1979.78-1595,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1179.47,1181.66,Isn't this a part of the Omnibus Crime Bill?
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,1181.66,1182.628,"Oh, yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1184.647,1186.32,That was the passed one.
1979.78-1595,0,17239,andrew_w_wood,,1186.32,1187.963,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1195.213,1201.124,Mr. Levander.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1201.124,1205.327,"First, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1269.63,1272.392,"Well, let me see if I have that there."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1278.677,1279.927,"Well, I believe that --"
1979.78-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1279.927,1281.173,There's a difference?
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1281.173,1282.144,"Yes, I agree."
1979.78-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1321.395,1329.794,"But that had been admissible, that proffer even in -- in the present trial."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1332.41,1333.235,That's correct.
1979.78-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1389.693,1392.927,"Mr. Levander, let me get back a minute to this continuance question."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1403.492,1404.573,That is correct.
1979.78-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1404.573,1411.926,And was any evidence adduced at trial to show that the prior conviction was uncounseled?
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1411.926,1429.968,"From the record, I understand that at the conclusion of the Government's case, Mr. Wood put petitioner on the stand and that he said, ""Now, judge I would let him -- want him to testify about the prior conviction and my -- and his lack of counsel and the judge said, ""Well, but we've already gone through this.”"
1979.78-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.138,1436.626,So the judge refused the proffer during the trial?
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1436.626,1437.677,That's correct also.
1979.78-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1481.377,1502.697,"What you're saying is -- is it what you're saying that if the man wants to purchase a firearm for whatever reason, let's assume he was going to be a guard at a plant or a bank that his first step is to go and have -- take affirmative action like collateral attack on the conviction and have it set aside on that ground."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1515.164,1517.181,That's absolutely correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1979.78-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1673.501,1678.006,"Well, in -- well, in this case, there were no discussion in Congress about any of that?"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1678.006,1680.846,"Well, that's not exactly true, Your Honor."
1979.78-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1682.144,1685.308,(Voice Overlap) it must have been about 10 minutes.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1685.308,1696.63,"Well, the -- that there's a lot more discussion about the parallel provisions in Section 922 and those were enacted the same time and use the exact same language, has been convicted."
1979.78-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1834.047,1845.983,"What was that question, whether they be trusted or whether they are the kind of people, people who fit into the category that Congress said should not be permitted to have firearms?"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1845.983,1846.605,That's right.
1979.78-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.339,1870.55,"But if he had been indicted and the indictment had never pressed, he'd never been tried and was out on bail for three years, four years."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1873.911,1884.47,"Well, the under indictment part would apply presumably he would go into court and simply have it dismissed for failure to prosecute under the Speedy Trial Act of something of that nature or the speedy trial for the Constitution."
1979.78-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1884.47,1886.898,"Well, I would -- but I'm assuming --"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1886.898,1886.994,He has done nothing.
1979.78-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1886.994,1899.342,-- he's waited three or four years and has done nothing and he's still under indictment and he's then in the same posture as this fellow going into an illegal establishment with a -- packing a gun.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1899.342,1917.123,"He would've violated the Act under 922 (g) or (h) if -- if the receipt of transportation can be shown under the statutory language, under indictment is under indictment, convicted means convicted."
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1946.993,1950.151,"Well, that's not really the issue in this case, is it?"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1963.063,1963.444,"Well, if that --"
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1963.444,1966.619,"That -- that's not the issue in this case, is it, with the due process issue?"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1966.619,1969.021,"Well -- well, let me try to explain."
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1969.021,1969.29,All right.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1969.29,1980.789,"If -- if Congress could pass an act, if Congress is constitutionally empowered to say people under indictment may not possess a firearm and that's valid."
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.789,1982.113,Yes.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1982.113,1999.622,"Then it cannot be for -- or it would be completely illogical for the Sixth Amendment to acquire that persons who how have now only be indicted but have been convicted and have not done something about that conviction cannot (Inaudible) possess of firearm, you ignore the fact of their conviction."
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1999.622,2007.566,"Oh, I did not understand Mr. Wood's basic argument to be that Congress would not have had the power to do this but that in fact Congress did not."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2010.29,2011.273,I think --
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2011.273,2012.431,Maybe I misapprehended both.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2012.431,2012.644,Yes.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2030.497,2032.613,Did not do it but also that he could not.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2032.613,2032.68,That's right.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2032.68,2032.959,That he could not.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2032.959,2034.503,And under -- and as to that point --
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2034.503,2036.176,As to that argument that you're not addressing yourself.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2036.176,2036.39,Right.
1979.78-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2036.39,2040.268,"Well, under your reason you can make Burgett into a due process case."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2040.268,2044.769,"Well, I think probably that the Court might have decided under -- due process principles."
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2055.344,2067.232,"Well, Mr. Levander, well, do you say that if a -- if a prior conviction has been set aside that he is still subject to this section?"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2067.232,2067.67,No.
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2067.67,2068.252,No.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2068.252,2069.466,That once the prior --
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2069.466,2070.993,"Well, he has been convicted."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2070.993,2074.753,"Well, I think that would be a -- first of all as of --"
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2074.753,2075.721,"Well, he has been, isn't he?"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2075.721,2076.364,"Well, the Chief Justice --"
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2076.364,2078.135,That's what -- that's what the statute says --
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2078.135,2086.119,"Well, as the Chief Justice point out, once a persons conviction has been overturned, the judgment of conviction is vacated and so therefore he is no longer a convicted felon."
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2086.119,2088.848,"That isn't what the statute says, it says he has been convicted."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2088.848,2092.284,"Well, I think that would be an overly literal interpretation of the language which would work."
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2092.284,2094.802,"Well, that's the argument -- that's the argument your colleague uses."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2097.848,2100.898,"Well, we -- we say if someone who has an outstanding conviction."
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2102.721,2106.328,You would have -- you would have that word rather than the other.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2106.328,2110.871,"The other language would be more appropriate if Congress said, who has ever been convicted regardless of whether or not --"
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2110.871,2113.719,"It might be but it said, who has been convicted."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2116.905,2117.31,"Well, then it would --"
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2117.31,2127.056,"And you say no, you should construe that out of the statute and your colleague says, well, you just should -- if that -- if you're going to do that what -- you had to ask Congress."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2135.525,2148.547,"Well, the existence in the statute of a pardon procedure and administrator procedure for people who have outstanding convictions strongly suggest that Congress intended that convicted meant an outstanding conviction."
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2174.728,2180.811,What about -- you mean either if he served his sentence especially if he served his sentence.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2183.962,2190.358,"Well, it's presumptively valid under Johnson against Zerbst until such time as it's been overturned."
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2277.408,2282.174,What about -- what about one who've been convicted but he's appealed with his case and the case is pending.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2282.174,2296.305,"Well, in United States against Liles, in the Ninth Circuit, they held that both the Act applies to someone who has an outstanding conviction on appeal and that there's no constitutional impediment to convicting him."
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2296.305,2297.196,And you agree with that?
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2297.196,2297.711,I agree with that.
1979.78-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2299.098,2311.753,What happens to the poor man that didn't have a lawyer when he was convicted and didn't have a lawyer during the four years when he was serving his time and he hadn't got a lawyer yet.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2314.17,2314.656,"Well, no sir."
1979.78-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2314.656,2317.679,"If he happened to buy a gun, he's in awful shape."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2317.679,2322.424,"Well, but if -- if he's been convicted, it's Congress' judgment that he should clear his name first."
1979.78-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2326.606,2327.941,Who would tell him that?
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2327.941,2328.503,"Well, 1800 --"
1979.78-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2328.503,2331.504,He didn't have cents enough to get a lawyer the first time.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2331.504,2332.326,"Well, 1800 --"
1979.78-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2332.326,2337.392,He is a sort of a non-lawyer man but he still is a citizen of the United States.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2337.392,2338.501,He certainly is sir.
1979.78-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2338.501,2340.558,He doesn't have had the benefit of lawyers.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2340.558,2345.591,"Well, but 1800 felons knew last year to send applications to the Secretary of Treasury."
1979.78-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.591,2348.13,I thought constitutional rights of individual.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2348.13,2348.68,They -- they certainly are --
1979.78-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2348.68,2354.027,"And weren't limited by 1800 or 18 million, am I right?"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2354.027,2357.561,That's absolutely correct.
1979.78-1595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.59,2439.12,Well then how about the case where the possession of firearms takes place before a conviction has been overturned but it's overturned prior to indictment.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2439.12,2441.14,He still violates the statute.
1979.78-1595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2441.14,2448.171,So is -- it just depend -- it's the crucial -- it's when he possesses a firearm.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2448.171,2454.091,The crucial determination is that he must clear his name before possessing the firearm.
1979.78-1595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2454.091,2460.715,And if he -- if he's cleared it under -- in habeas corpus and that is on appeal by the state.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2460.715,2463.339,If he cleared his name -- once he clears his name either --
1979.78-1595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.339,2466.115,"It isn't clear, the state has appealed it."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2466.115,2469.123,"Say that -- say that again, the coram nobis proceeding, is that --"
1979.78-1595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.123,2475.056,A habeas corpus proceeding -- his one at -- in the trial -- in the Federal District Court.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2475.056,2479.88,"Well then, he's -- once he has overturned his conviction --"
1979.78-1595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.88,2481.476,"Yes, but the state has appealed it."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2481.476,2486.931,"And a state his appealing, then he is still under indictment under Section 922."
1979.78-1595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.931,2489.231,So what purpose does that make?
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2489.231,2492.444,"Well, then he can't go out and receive or transport a firearm if he's still under --"
1979.78-1595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2492.444,2496.952,He's still under indictment but how about -- let's say he possesses a firearm.
1979.78-1595,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2496.952,2502.449,He's as bad -- awful as the man who didn't have a lawyer.
1979.78-1595,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.449,2503.975,"Well, go ahead."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2503.975,2506.012,Thank you.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2546.233,2551.834,"Just before you proceed Mr. Levander, I didn't understand -- I didn't -- I don't think I got your answer to my Brother White's questions."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2552.721,2554.865,I'm not sure I got Mr. Justice White's questions so --
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2554.865,2571.463,"Well, at first -- as I understood it, a person is convicted, he then collaterally attacks his conviction successfully and has that conviction set aside and a state appeals and at that time, may he be indicted for violation of Title 18 (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2571.463,2574.717,"After he overturns his conviction, he receives a firearm?"
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2574.717,2577.74,And it's pending on appeal by the state.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2577.74,2587.917,"Then he has violated Section 922 (g) or (h), excuse me, which refers to the receipt of a firearm but anyone under indictment for a felony."
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2587.917,2590.58,"No, I'm talking about 1202 (a) (1) which is --"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2590.58,2593.819,There's no provision under 1202 (a) (1) for persons under indictment and if --
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2593.819,2595.12,"Well, no, no."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2597.521,2598.018,That's right.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2598.018,2599.011,All right.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2600.245,2602.326,So after his conviction is overturned.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2602.326,2602.974,Yes.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2602.974,2605.436,Then he is not subject to the limitations of Section 1202 --
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2605.436,2606.205,Even though it's on appeal.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2606.205,2611.42,"Although, he's literally within the terms of the statute because he has been convicted by a court of --"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2611.42,2614.039,"Well, but -- but some court has vacated the order of conviction --"
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2614.039,2616.75,But he has been convicted.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2616.75,2616.969,Right.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2618.498,2621.073,"Well, that's what it says."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2621.073,2622.158,The statute as we construe it --
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2622.158,2632.743,The statute says “who has been convicted” and that would make it illegal for such a person to possess a firearm even though his conviction had been set aside on direct appeal.
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2632.743,2635.353,Isn't that the same point Mr. Justice White made before that --
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2635.353,2635.866,Yes.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2635.866,2636.219,Yes.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2640.89,2646.272,"Well, that is what the statute says literally and you're relying on the literal terms of the statute I assume, aren't you?"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2646.272,2651.283,"Well -- well certainly, if that is the literal reading of the statute which we don't have to decide here because here we have --"
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2651.283,2654.694,Well that is what the statute says.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2654.694,2655.284,"Well, the literal --"
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2655.284,2657.45,The literal term is what the statute says.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2657.45,2665.235,"Well, when you think of someone claiming or someone who has been convicted of a felony, you don't think of someone who has overturned that conviction because the order of conviction has been vacated."
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2665.235,2675.977,"Maybe you don't think of somebody as such but the Congress said, made the statute applicable, made it a criminal offense for anybody who has been convicted regardless of the ultimate fate of that conviction."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2675.977,2676.577,"Well, for the purposes --"
1979.78-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2676.577,2685.55,Can he be convicted -- can he be indicted and convicted for having violated the statute by obtaining a gun while there's an outstanding indictment against him.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2685.55,2686.347,"Yes, he could."
1979.78-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2686.347,2692.188,Because the habeas corpus judgement doesn't nullify the indictment.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2694.287,2695.699,That's right.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2695.699,2699.261,"But it can't be under 1202 (a) (1), can it?"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2699.261,2699.905,Not going to argue it.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2699.905,2701.342,"That's the statute about here, isn't it?"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2701.342,2701.735,That's right.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2707.066,2709.674,"Well that -- well, how come?"
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2709.674,2715.195,Because the word convicted is used by Congress there and our view means that someone who has a conviction outstanding.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2715.195,2718.96,"In other words, you're telling us the statute doesn't mean what it says."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2718.96,2730.703,"Well, the Court need not decided that question here since in any event your broader reading of the words has been convicted certainly applies to a petitioner who has never overturned his conviction."
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2730.703,2733.256,Well I was wondering just how -- what your argument was.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2733.256,2734.132,"Well, but we're --"
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2734.132,2736.066,You're not relying on the words of the statute.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2736.066,2737.08,Well we are.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2747.788,2752.45,Somewhere in between with what it says and what it doesn't say.
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2752.45,2760.089,"Mr. Levander, isn't it is just like the First Amendment, Congress shall make no law means Congress may make some law."
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2760.089,2760.427,Some people think --
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2760.427,2761.199,Thank you.
1979.78-1595,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2761.782,2769.772,Maybe you have because of your petite policy and you don't indict in this cases where and they can be set aside.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2769.772,2782.058,That's in any way -- I'm aware of no federal persecution for someone who has possessed or received a firearm after the time that their conviction was overturned and that is the policy that the Government follows with regards to this Act.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2960.504,2964.516,Mr. Wood tell us his in your plan of briefs that Virginia has held just that.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2964.516,2972.322,"Well, Mr. Wood suggest the Court didn't -- I think corrected that -- that case says that the Court didn't reach that issue."
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2982.718,2986.428,Why do you think that conclusion inevitably follows from his argument anyway?
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2986.428,2990.07,"Well, I think he says that --"
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2990.07,2999.102,"We were dealing with an Act of Congress and it's really at least one of his points is, it's a matter of construing that Act of Congress."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2999.102,2999.498,Well --
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2999.498,3010.165,"And maybe the -- maybe the Act of Congress makes it a penal offense to escape from a jail, a prison would have a -- that would be a question of construing that Act of Congress quite a different statute."
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3010.165,3012.762,I'm now referring to his constitutional argument and not his --
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3012.762,3014.133,No --
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3014.133,3015.345,-- and not his statutory argument.
1979.78-1595,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3015.345,3016.453,No.
1979.78-1595,1,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3016.453,3027.086,And as to that the logic disposition leads to conclusion that the Sixth Amendment would justify such as an escape as a defendant just could simply ignore the fact of his conviction and walk out the jailhouse store.
1979.78-1595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3029.16,3031.621,Do you have anything further Mr. Wood?
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3031.621,3034.193,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3128.159,3134.944,"Oh, I suppose you would say he could be convicted even if he didn't know anything about the gun law."
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3134.944,3135.748,"No, sir."
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.479,3139.002,I know.
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3150.78,3152.602,Oh certainly sir.
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.661,3172.06,"You mean it'd be different if he were told -- if he had been told that prior to his possession of the gun, now remember, don't pick up any guns because either you've been convicted and you haven't had it set aside."
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3172.06,3172.92,"No, sir."
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.009,3177.377,Well then what relevance is it whether he's uneducated or not.
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3177.377,3190.541,Well I think that the Government -- I think makes a fallacious argument on this score.The Loper decision has submit is controlling.
1979.78-1595,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3199.206,3210.232,"Mr. Wood, if the extent of -- just confining it to a constitutional inquiry, supposing some cities do they have this regulation that you can't be a cab driver if you've been convicted with felon, they have a form --"
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3210.232,3210.394,Yes sir.
1979.78-1595,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3210.394,3215.074,"-- that you fill out and one of the questions is, have you ever been convicted of a felony and if you --"
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3215.074,3215.181,Yes sir.
1979.78-1595,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3215.181,3217.759,"-- and he answered this falsely, he'd be indicted for perjury."
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3217.759,3218.381,Yes sir.
1979.78-1595,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3218.381,3223.423,"He just ignores it because it is totally void, can he be indicted for perjury as a matter of constitutional law?"
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3223.423,3231.804,"Judge, I've thought about that a good deal this morning and about the perjury aspect of it, I think it's an interesting analogy."
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3258.003,3266.257,I suppose then you're saying that in the 1202 persecution you can litigate the validity of your prior conviction on any ground you want it.
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3266.257,3267.654,No sir.
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.654,3268.759,What?
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3272.206,3272.6,"No, sir."
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3274.36,3283.305,What if he -- what if he just says my conviction was invalid because they introduced tainted evidence.
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3283.305,3285.714,Well -- I don't --
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3285.714,3288.507,Unless the 1202 forward here that kind of an attack on his prior --
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3288.507,3290.132,No sir.
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.132,3290.826,Why not?
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3290.826,3296.017,"Well, I think the line can be drawn with the case you have before you today is a Gideon violation."
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.017,3296.545,"Well, I know but --"
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3296.545,3296.557,I think the --
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.557,3298.17,-- this is a Fourth Amendment violation.
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3298.17,3299.278,Yes sir.
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3299.278,3307.23,Assume that he claims that he was convicted on the basis of evidence illegally seized without a search warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3317.576,3319.133,"I'm sorry Your Honor, I may have misunderstood you."
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.939,3325.596,"Well, in the 1202 case would the Court have to entertain that kind of a defense?"
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3325.596,3326.481,"Yes, and I don't think so."
1979.78-1595,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3328.378,3329.337,Between what?
1979.78-1595,2,17239,andrew_w_wood,,3330.242,3337.321,"Between those that are -- that are -- for example, obviously void and those that are voidable, whatever that is."
1979.78-1595,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3345.32,3352.767,A number states have a provision that the person is incarcerated in the prison under a life sentence --
1979.78-1595,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3352.767,3353.775,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3353.775,3357.968,-- and it commits a homicide and never to escape for example --
1979.78-1595,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3357.968,3358.973,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3358.973,3361.99,-- that death penalty is mandatory.
1979.78-1595,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3361.99,3363.568,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3363.568,3372.572,And suppose you have the land who is in prison uncounseled conviction for murder is under the guilty plea without counsel --
1979.78-1595,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3372.572,3372.834,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3372.834,3373.935,-- and he is in for life.
1979.78-1595,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3376.744,3378.246,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1595,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3378.246,3393.237,You would have to say I suppose that he could not be under that statute because he is in custody under an uncounseled -- therefore unconstitutional conviction.
1979.78-1595,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3393.237,3396.778,"Judge, I would have to say that."
1979.78-1595,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3399.45,3400.085,Thank you gentlemen.
