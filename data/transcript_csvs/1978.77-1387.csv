1978.77-1387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.487,We will hear arguments next in Federal Open Market Committee v. Merrill.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,39.961,43.924,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
1978.77-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,91.033,96.54,Let me ask you a question Mr. Geller about the discretion contention.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,101.022,102.792,Yes.
1978.77-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,102.792,109.507,So I take it your contention is that the discretion could only be exercised in one way in this particular case.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,109.507,115.353,"No, the District Court took the position that it had no discretion, because the Act required immediate disclosure."
1978.77-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.301,145.885,"So, you don’t claim that it comes under any of the exemptions?"
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,145.885,164.106,"No, we do, we claim that it falls clearly within Exemption 5 and we construe Exemption 5 to a Court at District Court discretion as I have said in an appropriate case to decide whether or not to release otherwise disclosable documents where the government is made a showing of harm from the immediate release."
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,164.106,166.503,You said exclusively on Exemption 5.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,166.503,167.153,That’s correct.
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,167.153,168.69,Not on 4 or 8.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,168.69,171.965,"No, the only exemption we’re relying on this Court is Exemption 5."
1978.77-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.965,187.878,"The section that you are dealing with the exemptions beginning this section does not apply to matters that are, and then 5 says inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than the agency and litigation with the agency."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,187.878,188.071,Yes.
1978.77-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.071,191.685,"Now, where does the District Court’s discretion stand from?"
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,191.685,202.03,"We believe it comes from the language would not be available to a party in litigation with the agency, which we think what Congress intended was to mirror the practice under civil discovery."
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,224.971,229.252,"Mr. Geller, why we have to interrupt it, there is a stay order still in effect."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,229.252,233.401,"The stay order is still in effect, that’s correct."
1978.77-1387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,452.068,458.99,"Who can under your theory, legitimately have access to that information now?"
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,458.99,477.263,"During the one month period that the domestic policy directive is in effect, only employees of the Federal Reserve System with the need of access to that directive have access to that directive, which would be the Account Manager who actually does the buying and selling of the open market – of securities in the open market."
1978.77-1387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,477.263,479.981,In the area (Voice Overlap) how many people?
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,479.981,488.342,I would say it’s just a handful of people and generally high officials of the Federal Reserve System.
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,575.176,586.722,"Mr. Geller, do you think that knowledgeable observers of the market reactions will know what‘s going on after a few days however when the Fed gets into the market?"
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,586.722,602.819,"I don’t think so, they can make -- knowledgeable market observers can make educated guesses based upon the Account Manager’s buying or selling of securities in the open market on a daily basis, but there is a certain level of uncertainty that attaches to their observations."
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,849.934,855.636,"Mr. Geller, of course that’s the view of the agency, but it’s not a universally help you, is it?"
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,855.636,856.717,"It’s -- well, the --"
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,856.717,858.648,"For example, Milton Friedman would disagree."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,858.648,858.701,Excuse me.
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,858.701,860.872,"Milton Friedman would disagree, I guess?"
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,860.872,864.048,The respondents have never rebutted that showing.
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,864.048,865.698,Milton Friedman would disagree with this.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,865.698,866.166,"Excuse me, I am sorry."
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,866.166,866.909,Milton Friedman would disagree.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,866.909,885.437,"Yes, Milton Friedman’s, the statements that respondents have quoted from time to time from Milton Friedman really relates to the committee’s claim that the immediate disclosure of these domestic policy directives would allow market speculators to make immense profits on just profits."
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,902.056,910.06,I suppose these are sophisticated people dealing with the economic forces.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,926.775,927.376,"Well, it may not."
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,927.376,934.493,Knowing that the public would know about this and that they would augment the effect and therefore the policy directives would discount that.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,934.493,936.645,I think that that’s not as easily done as --
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,936.645,940.864,"Well, listen, this is all difficult as far as I am concerned but I am assuming we are dealing with experts."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,940.864,949.442,But I think Justice Stewart that your example is an excellent reason of why this type of information falls within Exemption 5.
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,978.172,990.78,"Well, the directive would be published in -- it would be decided upon and then it would become a directive in the light of the fact, it would be public knowledge and therefore the directive would be different in substance."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,990.78,996.086,"Well, I think there is a limit to have different the directive can be and still accomplish the goals, which the directive now accomplished."
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,996.086,1006.6,"Instead of this committee buying $X billions, they’d buy one half of excess, so we will assume that public and the speculators will buy the other half."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1006.6,1009.414,I think it wouldn’t work quite --
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1009.414,1010.326,"Nearly, not that simple."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1010.326,1011.886,Yes. [Laughter].
1978.77-1387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1011.886,1023.164,"Is it enough for your case, enough for your case that no body, no one can predict with any uncertainty what would be the consequences of disclosure."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1023.164,1023.589,Well that’s correct.
1978.77-1387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1023.589,1025.934,"What if there are serious consequences, is that enough for you?"
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1025.934,1031.266,I think that is uncertainly one major part of our argument.
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1083.753,1087.406,But it’s also true that some alumni will disagree.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1087.406,1091.189,"Well, I think there may well be some confusion here."
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1106.104,1113.031,"No, I am confining -- just announcement of the specific policy would be followed during the ensuing 30 days."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1125.165,1127.638,That’s true’ there are certain economists who have taken that view.
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1128.401,1130.576,Including alumni of the Federal Reserve Board.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1130.576,1132.462,"Well, there is Governor Mizell."
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1132.462,1133.085,Last one
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1133.085,1136.225,Alright.
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1142.081,1144.191,I understand that.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1151.495,1152.152,I think that’s --
1978.77-1387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1152.152,1158.395,Therefor I don’t understand why you are spending so much time trying to convince us of one side or the other of the newer element debate.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1158.395,1167.474,"Well, I that if the argument that there would be harm here was totally fanciful, it might be a different situation, but let me get to this lawsuit, which began in May 19."
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.474,1169.298,"Mr. Geller, can I ask you one more question."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1177.324,1181.911,We would be making the same argument although perhaps the need for secrecy.
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.914,1204.08,I suppose your opposition would say still that it affected its academic needs as the obligation made.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1204.08,1207.09,I’m sure it would.
1978.77-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1399.07,1403.371,"Well, it’s a rather peculiar way of achieving any result, isn’t that? [Laughter]."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1403.371,1416.903,I think it’s a rather sensible way Mr. Justice Rehnquist because Congress couldn’t anticipate every situation that might arise in which a Plaintiff under the FOIA might seek access to some internal governmental memorandum.
1978.77-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1427.376,1430.382,What analogy do you draw?
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1454.721,1456.073,"Yes, we think that Congress had said as much."
1978.77-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1456.073,1459.186,"Well, the question was most adjunctive."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1459.186,1469.589,"This court said in EPA against Mink and in subsequent cases, that Congress wanted to adopt that Exemption 5, legislate against the backdrop of civil discovery law."
1978.77-1387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1500.024,1505.838,Does that go beyond claims of privilege at common law that would be recognized in discovery?
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1505.838,1506.143,Yeah.
1978.77-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1602.916,1608.589,"Well, this hypothecates the government being on one side and the public interest being on the other."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1608.589,1622.115,"I think that’s what the FOIA contemplates under Exemption 5 when dealing with a document, which is not subject to an absolute privilege or not totally unprivileged when it falls in this middle ground."
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.456,1649.61,"Well, Mr. Geller, suppose the Court of Appeals was wrong in saying that 26(c)(7) doesn’t apply to any kind of a governmental entity, which I guess they decided, isn’t it?"
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1649.61,1650.783,Yes.
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.783,1664.222,"Suppose it’s wrong in that and we say that the government in an FOIA case can take advantage of 26(c)(7), then the other litigate can take advantage."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1670.599,1671.871,I think if the --
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.871,1681.89,"Suppose it was decided that way, you wouldn’t nevertheless argue that it would be non-discoverable under some other rule."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1682.539,1690.446,"Yes, I think -- well, you have to -- just as in civil litigation, you needn’t pick only one discovery provision and rely totally and that if it’s any –"
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.446,1701.363,"I know, but when you move to some other rule, the part of your argument is the need for secrecy."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1711.951,1718.444,"We are not, but there are other provisions of section 26 like section 26(c)(2) for example."
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.444,1719.794,What about it?
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1719.794,1724.479,We suggest section 26(c)(2) grants a District Court discretion in civil engage.
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1724.479,1728.265,"I know, but the heart argument there is a need for secrecy."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1728.265,1752.115,"The heart of our argument is that the District Court is under the FOIA, when a claim under Exemption 5 is raised, just like in civil discovery, the District Court must assess the relative benefits to the public from immediate disclosure and we’re not talking here again about total non-disclosure, just a delay, a short delay in disclosure against the government’s interest in limited temporary non-disclosure."
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.77,1776.683,Because of the need for secrecy?
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1776.683,1777.439,Temporary secrecy.
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.439,1783.876,"Well, then which advantage you would think that he would protect it under (c)(7) a fortiori?"
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1783.876,1785.559,It may not fall within (c)(7).
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.944,1786.395,What?
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1788.852,1792.592,"Well, the Court of Appeal suggests that, that’s not available to the government."
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.937,1798.257,"As a matter of fact, I thought you are suggesting is incorrect."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1798.257,1804.855,We have put forward a number of privileges that would be available to the government in civil discovery.
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.855,1805.713,Including that one?
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1805.713,1816.414,"Including that one, and what we are suggesting is that the District Court should have viewed this case, as if it arose in a context of a civil litigation in which the Plaintiff sort discovery of materials."
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.414,1817.674,I understand that.
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1822.187,1822.918,Yes.
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.918,1835.802,"To the government in case like this and suppose that the government shows its confidential commercial information, is the District Court nevertheless privileged then to say, well, I am going to balance a little bit here."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1835.802,1839.681,"No, if there is an absolute privilege available to the government, there is no --"
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1839.681,1842.754,"Well, the (c)(7) absolute or isn’t it, if it’s confidential?"
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1842.754,1846.626,"Well, the language of Section (c)(7) suggests that it --"
1978.77-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.626,1850.504,"So there is not any more room for balancing, if (c)(7) applies and there is confidential commercial information."
1978.77-1387,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1850.504,1868.983,"No, then we have to look at the preface to Section 26 (c), which suggests that all of the 1-8 or whatever it is in section 26 (c) privileges may or may not be applied by the court based on the balancing of a number of different considerations, not enumerated in this specific subject."
1978.77-1387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1868.983,1869.857,Very well Mr. Geller.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,1873.865,1878.648,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the court."
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.374,1982.737,"What if -- under which discussion, they follow the practice of not under any statute, it’s just the practice of saying this is subject to reexamination every Thursday afternoon at our meeting and until the final day of announcement, then ordered be open?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,1982.737,1984.546,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1989.621,2008.548,"I am proposing that they don’t adopt it, but they say, ‘here is what we think we are going to do but we’ll meet every Thursday at 3’o clock and sort of listen to the wind and what’s going on in the market and what’s going in Iran and Zurich and Montana and take another look?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2008.548,2014.369,That would not be covered by subsection (a)(2)(b) of the act.
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2017.489,2021.416,Would it be available on your theory?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2021.416,2022.91,It would not be available on our theory.
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2033.075,2037.692,"What I really meant was would it be available at all, necessarily just on your view of the matter?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2037.692,2039.808,"I think it might be, I would have to know --"
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2039.808,2041.711,"Even though, it’s not a final action."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2041.711,2042.262,That’s right.
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2050.302,2052.63,There is no ruling yet.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2060.054,2081.935,"If court please Mr. Chief Justice. I am saying it would not be available under the first subsection of the act, which directs that all policy statements be made available, but it might be discoverable, you couldn’t require the government to publish it, but it might be discoverable by a citizen asking for it the next day or the next year that was all I was talking about."
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2081.935,2087.286,"The answer would be no decision has been made, nothing is final, we are still talking about it."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2087.286,2107.571,"Well, I think that you contain under the Freedom of Information Act, lots of papers that do not constitute final decisions that was all I was saying, but it is not our case here and our case here depends solely upon the concession by the government that this is the policy statement of the Federal Open Market Committee."
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2107.571,2115.72,"Well, my hypothetical resemblance it’s what the government might do if you prevail and --"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2115.72,2120.876,I understand that Mr. Chief Justice and I want to keep my options open too.
1978.77-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2204.645,2231.839,"Mr. Kramer, supposing that in a federal torque claims that case, which the government is defending, so presumably it’s not under the law enforcement exemption, the Section Chief after conference with his associates in the department sends a letter of instruction to the US attorney in the field saying, ‘reject the Plaintiff’s offer a $50,000, make a counteroffer to him of $35,000 and try to settle for $40,000’."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2245.569,2256.163,"I dislike not answering questions categorically Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but the only answer is that this case has nothing to do with that type of document."
1978.77-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2257.13,2274.599,"It does have something to do with your insistence that Sears, Roebuck case limited to pre-decisional conferences because the policy is already adopted, it simply hasn’t been effectuated."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2274.599,2280.133,My argument is confined to statements of agency policy.
1978.77-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.856,2311.229,"But in the lots of stuff as you pointed out in response to the Chief Justice, it doesn’t have to be published, but it’s nonetheless discovered."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2311.229,2312.667,That’s right.
1978.77-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2324.383,2332.314,But would not it be literally incredible to think that Congress intended the publication of the kind of letter I have in mind.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2332.314,2333.709,It would be difficult.
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2337.329,2339.474,How about irrational?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2339.474,2347.809,"No, I don’t think it would be irrational if Your Honor please, any more than I think the Snail Darter case was irrational, although, I though it was extreme."
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2352.311,2361.117,What is a $150 million compared with a $1 billion possibility of market problems?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2365.062,2366.372,Compared to the billions here?
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2366.372,2367.23,Yes.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2367.23,2372.478,"Well, Your Honor please we simply don’t know what the effect would be."
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2372.478,2373.754,If you are going to find out?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2373.754,2380.175,"If Your Honor would like me to address that subject, I’ll be happy to do so."
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2380.175,2383.974,"Now, we probably better wait for freedom in for that."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2383.974,2390.434,"[Laughter] Well, I didn’t mean addressing myself because I don’t know and I don’t see how the court can tell."
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.434,2403.961,"Well Mr. Kramer you are defending the Court of Appeals that, the Judgment opinion however says that the Federal Rule of several procedure 26 (c)(7) is not applicable to the defendant."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2403.961,2406.459,Yes and I agree with that.
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.459,2409.123,Suppose it were?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2409.123,2410.536,Suppose it were?
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.536,2415.521,"Suppose the Court of Appeals is wrong, you can conceive that."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2415.521,2419.866,"I can conceive of it as an academic question, yes."
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.869,2431.705,What we do if we are disagreed with the Court of Appeals on this issue?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2434.739,2441.205,"No, then you would have to -- if you disagree, move forth that it would subject to some recognized privilege and resumption."
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2441.205,2449.757,"Well, what if we just decided The Court of Appeals was wrong on 26 (c)(7)?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2454.135,2463.309,You would still say that none of these privileges applies to a policy statement.
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.309,2468.223,Because policy statement can possibly be confidential commercial information.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2468.223,2473.632,Yes that’s one argument but no policy statement is exempted under Exemption 5.
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.173,2504.118,No policy can contain confidential information within the meaning of 26 (c)(7).
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2504.118,2511.398,I am saying that no statement of policy can find any exemption under Exemption 5 from prompt publication.
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.3,2525.9,Is that the way you read the Court of Appeals opinion by the money?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2525.9,2526.643,No.
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.643,2527.712,No it certainly is not.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2527.712,2529.193,"No, it is not."
1978.77-1387,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2550.577,2551.318,Thank you very much.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2551.318,2552.54,You are welcome sir. [Applause].
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.061,2583.868,Suppose as weigh if there in so far as Exemption if I pick some specific privilege available in civil litigation.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2583.868,2589.542,"Well, the government of course here has not done that in our opinion, it hasn’t picked any specific privilege."
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.057,2592.67,Thus it relies on 26 (c)(7)?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2592.67,2596.393,Yes but which one of 7 is that the commercial --
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.393,2601.188,As specific as you can be as that -- that’s confidential commercial installation.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2601.188,2607.256,I believe that clear that the policies of a Federal agency are not to be denigrated to the --
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.256,2614.618,"That’s your only answer to that, I mean it’s certainly is not because of vagueness or anything, is there is a specific privilege?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2614.618,2628.372,"They haven’t -- Yeah I also have an even more conservative answer Mr. Justice White, they have not been able to point to a single case where any government commercial information was privileged from production if it amounted to a government policy."
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2628.372,2629.734,"Well, may be that was never challenged."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2629.734,2635.699,"Maybe that’s always possible but the older the public gets, more likely that it would have occurred."
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.699,2637.542,"Well, at least here is one."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2637.542,2639.093,You are right sir.
1978.77-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2657.1,2672.14,"What about the agencies -- what about the Justice Department policy that we will under no circumstances certainly toward Claims Act Suit for more than $100,000, sent to all 93 US attorneys around the country?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2672.14,2675.53,That’s a closer one.
1978.77-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2684.718,2686.705,Federal Tort Claims Act (Voice Overlap).
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2686.705,2688.782,"Yes, not under exemption."
1978.77-1387,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2853.332,2857.095,"Well, those are purpose sort of to define the public interest, is not it?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2857.095,2865.085,"That’s another way putting it, yes I accept that, yeah Mr. Justice Stewart and yes, Mr. Justice Powell?"
1978.77-1387,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2865.085,2867.85,I suggest your answer Mr. Justice Stewart first and then back later.
1978.77-1387,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2867.85,2868.691,He did.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2868.691,2870.113,"I am sorry, I did, yes."
1978.77-1387,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2870.113,2875.148,I was going to ask if whether Mr. Merrill is still a law student at Georgetown University?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2875.148,2878.507,"No, he is not; he is a member of the Bar, the District of Colombia."
1978.77-1387,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2878.507,2882.12,What he is not interested in this information at this time?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2882.12,2893.832,I have not asked him because the act doesn’t require that I ask him but I assume that he has no great request from those persons in the organization would file amicus brief in this case.
1978.77-1387,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2894.915,2902.396,"Under your theory of the case, anyone without regard to whatever interest he has may bring cause of action request."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2902.396,2909.965,"Under my theory of what the act provides, yes Mr. Justice Blackmun but all questions of standing and that sort of thing are out when it comes to privilege."
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2909.965,2920.442,"This is what permits some enterprising people to collect a lot of government information, assemble it and classify and select under the act, there is no prohibition."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2920.442,2923.695,"That’s right Your Honor, I assure you that --"
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2923.695,2929.885,They can do it for ideal curiosity and even if they can understand the information after they get it.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2929.885,2931.931,That‘s absolutely true Your Honor.
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2938.605,2944.493,"Now addressing myself to the party in the case, the party need not be able even to understand it."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2944.493,2952.894,"That’s correct Your Honor and by the way I am not sure and I want to very canned about, I am not sure even the Court can understand these domestic policy directives."
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2971.263,2993.483,"Well, Suppose the neighbor board decides to order a regional directive to file a complaint and you write him a letter and say, we talk this all over and our policy now is so and so file is complain is, is that the, I mean is that, that’s exempted, isn’t it?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,2993.483,2997.838,"Well, it’s certainly not a statement of policy within the meaning subsection A."
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.838,3003.152,"So your answer is yes, it him -- your answer is that it’s within the Exemption5?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3003.152,3004.199,I believe so.
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.199,3013.685,Because it doesn’t finally dispose of anything and it just sets the government on of a course of action mainly litigation.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3013.685,3017.073,Precisely.
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.073,3037.722,"So if the government adopts of -- it has meeting and it says we are going to start on a course -- we are going to embark on a course of action right now and here is what we are going to do, and we are going to order our open market operator for the next two or three months to do so and so."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3047.975,3061.134,I don’t read Subsection A to be in its phrase statements of policy to make a distinction between the type of policy.
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.134,3072.137,"Whether it’s a misnomer or not, you must agree that it is an initiation of a course of action by the government, these statements or policy or nothing?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3072.137,3074.439,I would prefer you look at the policy itself.
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3074.439,3081.406,"I know you do, but I am just asking you whatever you look at, doesn’t it set the government on a course of action?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3081.406,3083.351,"Yes, but it --"
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3083.351,3089.183,"And it doesn’t finish it, it just starts it."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3089.183,3094.07,"Well, only in the sense that nothing is ever finished that any agency does if the court please."
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.07,3099.187,"No, that was just exactly the line that was drawn in the series case, which you think was so carefully constructed."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3099.187,3100.868,"Yes, I do."
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3101.358,3116.711,"That’s exactly the line, that the opinions that finally dispose off a case, like opinions not to file a complaint, they are discoverable, but opinions in statements or policy if you want to call them that, saying file are not discoverable."
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3116.711,3149.762,"That’s correct Your Honor and I of course would not be foolish or I am not to going to arrogant to argue with the court as to the meaning of the opinion, but I do want to emphasize that in one sense, every government policy dictates a course of action that’s what a policy statement is, so that when we look closely, I think at the type of record that we are talking about and if you would turn to page 65 and look at one of these policy directive, this is an old one."
1978.77-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3149.762,3151.856,You have told to me I could not understand it anyway. [Laughter]
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3151.856,3160.926,"Well, you couldn’t understand the details but you certainly could understand that the Board is saying that this is their policy."
1978.77-1387,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3179.41,3182.081,It sounds like a statement from the White House Press Officer.
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3182.081,3183.774,Well it’s a -- [Laughter].
1978.77-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3201.374,3206.86,Are you claiming only under Subsection 2 here rather than under Subsection 3 as well?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3216.952,3225.692,"It’s both, we are claiming under both that we could have -- if a citizen or person ask for it, it must be produced, but --"
1978.77-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3225.692,3228.119,It wouldn’t have to be statement of policy to come under theory of --
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3228.119,3230.906,"That is correct Your Honor, precisely so."
1978.77-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3231.369,3233.682,But they are both subject to Exemption Number 5?
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3233.682,3237.308,"Absolutely sir, absolutely."
1978.77-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.038,3359.094,"But this is an intra-agency memorandum, is it not or inter-agency?"
1978.77-1387,1,43619,victor_h_kramer,,3359.094,3359.833,Intra?
1978.77-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.833,3360.491,Intra?
