1967.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,21.452,"Number 37, Massachusetts, Petitioner, versus Donald M. Painten."
1967.37,0,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,23.726,28.96,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,157.087,160.898,"Mr. Attorney General, I'm sorry to interrupt you and take you back one moment."
1967.37,0,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,167.045,167.743,"Well, it was a very (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,167.743,170.653,--is part of the record with the Court of Appeals?
1967.37,0,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,170.653,174.785,"To the best of my knowledge Mr. Justice Stewart, it was not available at the Court of Appeals --"
1967.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,174.785,175.328,It is not here?
1967.37,0,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,175.328,178.855,-- it is very lengthy and it is not here in this Court.
1967.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,204.582,209.926,"Well, that's one way to account for and another way to account for would be that the District Court is -- was wrong and --"
1967.37,0,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,209.926,210.17,The District Court --
1967.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,210.17,213.316,And how can we know without having a (Voice Overlap) --
1967.37,0,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,213.316,235.179,"The District Court explicitly states at the beginning of that portion of its opinion that it did so rely on page 50 of the record, on the basis of the state court record and the evidentiary type of hearing held in this court I find and then follows the statement of facts which I'm about to summarize."
1967.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,235.179,240.07,Is there a dispute as to the accuracy of those facts?
1967.37,0,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,240.07,257.271,"To my knowledge Mr. Chief Justice, no actual dispute and yet in certain respects, the counsel for the respondent and for the Commonwealth select slightly different versions which can be found at these various points, so that I would simply mean and make it clear that --"
1967.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,257.271,261.355,-- could bring you to a different it falls?
1967.37,0,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,261.355,277.914,"Well, of course we represent a petitioner and a respondent in a situation in which the facts and the constitutional issues are so much inseparable that slight shadings of difference in the facts could make a difference in the result."
1967.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,278.381,289.565,Should we be bound -- should we be bound in determining the case by the findings of the judge when we have no record to support it?
1967.37,0,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,292.582,323.425,"Mr. Chief Justice, it seems to me that the findings themselves are part of the record for this Court and that rather than for this Court, for example, to go back to the testimony which you do have transcribed before the district judge and to draw inferences from that testimony ab initio, leaves it preferable it seems to me to rely on the facts as found by the district judge who did have the benefit both of hearing the witnesses before him as well as reviewing the transcript before you."
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,1584.599,1591.045,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1654.904,1657.55,"He did have a mug shot though, didn't he?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,1657.55,1661.553,That's the only basis for suspicion Mr. Justice that there was a record.
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1661.553,1665.272,"Well, ordinarily, they take a mug shot only when someone is arrested or something?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,1665.272,1679.276,"Oh, that's very true then I think we have to concede that much but the officer have no knowledge whatsoever that would connect this man, Painten to any robberies or any crime of that nature."
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1790.478,1795.576,The court -- majority of the Court of Appeals clearly did not pursue that line?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,1795.576,1796.319,"No, Your Honor."
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1796.319,1802.566,That is opposed to the statement by Judge Kaufman concurring?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,1802.566,1803.658,That's true Your Honor.
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1803.658,1816.757,"That the majority then went off on a different basis namely that as I read, namely that the police officer set out to arrest and search the man with the hope that evidence would develop."
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,1816.906,1817.672,That's very true.
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1894.503,1905.623,"If you take this step by step, what are the specific points of conflict with the constitutional doctrine."
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,1931.449,1940.014,That would have to be our contention if Your Honor please that there was not a voluntary admission surely for the purposes of search and the --
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1940.014,1947.341,"And why – wait a minute, let's just like about the admission to the apartment without reference to search?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,1947.341,1952.032,We would argue that the entry to the apartment was not because the voluntary --
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1952.032,1965.322,"You mean that anytime the police come to the door of an apartment and they say this is the police and people let them in that, that is an unlawful entry by the police, wouldn't have to be your position?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,1965.322,1979.904,"Well, if Your Honor please, I don't know whether we would go so far to say in every case, the simple entry by the police without a forceful resistance by the tenant would mean that --"
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1979.904,1987.993,What makes this -- what is the element that differentiate this case then that makes this case a violation of the constitutional rights?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,1992.297,1993.779,"No, I don't think so Your Honor."
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1993.978,1996.623,"That's what the majority said, isn't it?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,1996.623,2004.6,"Well, I think that the United States Court of Appeals looked to the entire record, looked to all the elements in the case --"
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2004.6,2009.174,"Yes but you have to put it in words what did they say, what did they (Voice Overlap)"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2009.174,2012.814,They did look to what the police had in mind of course.
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2026.214,2026.427,Right.
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2041.167,2041.437,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2041.437,2044.636,– for just for purposes of these questions.
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2056.444,2067.402,"Well, having -- in treating your question properly, Your Honor, I have in mind that the courts have already examined this problem to see whether the police were admitted voluntary (Voice Overlap)"
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2067.402,2069.302,"Well, make that assumption."
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2069.302,2076.777,Whether they were admitted for the purposes of talking or whether they were admitted for the purpose searching.
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2082.568,2088.105,The search here was not undertaken or would you contest this?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2088.105,2088.498,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2088.498,2097.074,The search was not undertaken until after the bag containing the revolvers was found and produced.
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2097.074,2106.06,"I think the search began, if Your Honor please, when the officers entered the apartment, walked over to Ash, the gentleman who was in the apartment."
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2114.192,2130.291,"Now was that introduced and there was a testimony to that affect that Ash had in his pocket $200.00 or whatever it was in the bills, was that introduced as evidence against Ash?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2130.291,2135.037,"Let me say this if I may Your Honor, to clarify the history of this very briefly."
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2156.095,2165.779,"Well, was the fact that the officer found $200.00 or whatever in Ash's pocket used in evidentiary manner?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2165.779,2170.193,"Not against Painten, no Your Honor and Painten is the only man before us of course."
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2170.193,2173.595,Now what's your next complaint about what happened?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2173.595,2182.739,The next complaint of course is taking the paper bag from the fire escape and bring it back into the apartment.
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2186.588,2188.669,What made that unlawful?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2188.669,2209.538,"The fact that the paper bag was on -- either on the premises or within the cartilage of this apartment, I surely would urge that most strenuously and that the officers had no authority to search in the apartment, search anywhere in the apartment when they entered and this is just part of the search that they conducted."
1967.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2209.538,2230.635,That's because you say the consent when I went -- we're assuming that it was consent to enter the apartment did not extend to the cartilage or did not extend to a consent to picking up what was inside on the fire escape or whatever?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2230.635,2231.435,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2253.631,2262.018,"Mr. Nordlinger, suppose the policeman outside in the back had gotten a ladder and climbed up and he picked it up?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2262.018,2264.859,I see no difference Mr. Justice.
1967.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.135,2293.309,It makes no difference whether he went through the apartment or went up to fire escape?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2293.309,2295.098,I don't think it would if Your Honor please.
1967.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.034,2313.644,Suppose you have got into the bottom in the backyard of the apartment or house --
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2313.644,2314.056,"Well, I could --"
1967.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2314.056,2316.157,I assume there was more than one tenant.
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2316.157,2317.279,Yes there were.
1967.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2317.279,2320.55,And suppose they had dropped it from the backyard?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2320.55,2335.216,"Your Honor, I can only have in mind when I answer that -- I can only have in mind the cases that we already see in the reports where the courts have examined what is this area in which the material was thrown out."
1967.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.91,2366.507,So it wouldn't made any difference whether they climbed up the fire escape or went through the apartment?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2366.507,2368.723,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2368.723,2373.655,"Well, what do you do what they do?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2383.352,2387.999,"Yes Your Honor, I think there's quite a difference in the facts if you please --"
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2387.999,2393.212,"I mean, throwing it out in the window in a paper bag is different from --"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2393.212,2393.712,No.
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2393.712,2394.925,Throwing them into the --
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2394.925,2396.006,No.
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2419.463,2421.069,"It was still his room though, was it not?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2421.069,2422.549,No it wasn't Your Honor.
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2458.21,2459.386,You don't know why they have it?[Laughter]
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2459.386,2461.293,I don't know.
1967.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.522,2540.855,"Would you be here if he just said, “Come on in please, I will be glad to talk with you?”"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2540.855,2541.749,I think we would be.
1967.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.581,2556.968,What is your concern is just as though the bag that was out on the fire escape proceeding in the corner of the room and the officer without any consent like to look for this?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2556.968,2558.113,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2559.793,2566.574,You're not implicating the exact words that were said in the two that you say it's so difficult?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2566.574,2566.96,I'm sorry.
1967.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2567.749,2571.706,The words that you said -- they said about coming in.
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2571.706,2572.292,Yes.
1967.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2572.292,2581.426,"You draw a distinction between one little words and another [Inaudible], do you mind stating that [Inaudible]."
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2581.426,2596.62,"The record of testimony not -- I'm not speaking of the findings Mr. Justice, the record of testimony in the District Court which appears in the record before this Court today shows that the police said, “I had my badge in my hand.”"
1967.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2630.027,2640.096,"You said there was a difference in that and if they have sent something else, maybe a few but I just don't remember it, it's not important?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2640.096,2646.871,"No, there would be a difference if the petitioner, if the tenant had said, “Come in and look around.”"
1967.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2646.871,2647.967,What did he say?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2647.967,2649.146,He said nothing.
1967.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2649.146,2650.467,He said nothing.
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2650.467,2653.143,The first time to -- I don't want to --
1967.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2653.143,2657.607,"What would happen if he had said, come in and look around?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2657.607,2663.266,I think then Your Honor it would be a very hard foot to make an argument that there was no consent.
1967.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2663.266,2665.832,So you think that could be the same?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2665.832,2666.172,"Well, I think that could."
1967.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2666.172,2668.248,"Remaining silent, isn't not?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2668.248,2669.004,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.004,2671.929,"Well, he did say something, he said wait a minute."
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2671.929,2674.972,"Oh, that's when he first opened the door and saw who it was."
1967.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.832,2676.229,Wait a minute.
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2676.229,2677.062,And they waited.
1967.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.062,2678.597,And then closed the door?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2678.597,2679.196,Yes.
1967.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.196,2681.479,And then he came back and opened the door?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2681.479,2682.56,That's right.
1967.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.56,2683.62,"Well, what did he say there?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2683.62,2684.323,Nothing.
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2684.323,2686.014,For that matter he opened the door to let them in?
1967.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.014,2689.351,He came back after knowing who they were and he came back and opened the door?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2689.351,2690.438,That's right.
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2694.546,2705.068,"Well, I really have difficulty seeing why there wasn't a consent to entry in those circumstances?"
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2705.068,2706.141,Well --
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2706.141,2711.39,That -- opening the door that seems to me the second time to invite them to come in.
1967.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.533,2715.418,And it certainly does destroy your case to admit that?
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2715.418,2726.218,"No, but if Your Honor please, you have this question before this Court in Johnson against United States and a very same thing happened and no consent was found."
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2744.971,2749.917,"Well, there wasn't anything in Johnson comparable to these set of facts as I understand it."
1967.37,1,34904,louis_m_nordlinger,,2760.032,2761.915,That's not the same as Johnson of course.
1967.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2761.915,2764.814,I should have known.

1967.37,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3461.943,3468.368,"Well, why did they assign an officer to the back, while they were questioning?"
1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,3468.368,3472.042,They knew that these were men who had been involved in police records.

1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,3544.804,3571.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, we would say as to that that if the intent of the police officers is to controlling test here that there maybe basis for the courts below, both to have found that they did intend to make an arrest, but our position basically is that the finding of their intent whether or not substantiated in the record, it should not control the question whether or not the ultimate arrest and search were valid."
1967.37,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3571.92,3579.577,"You have in this respect, the Court of Appeals approved the finding of the court below, did it not?"
1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,3579.577,3582.609,"Yes, and indeed they --"
1967.37,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3582.609,3591.994,"Aren't we required to give a very, very strong consideration to the finding of two courts below."
1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,3592.046,3605.4,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that the central issue in this case is whether the finding of intent should control the determination whether or not a valid arrest and search took place."
1967.37,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3625.766,3630.433,But would you ask us to abrogate this finding.
1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,3657.843,3669.047,"We suggest Mr. Chief Justice that even if it had been their intent to make an arrest that that intent alone would not invalidate the entry and in fact, they didn't make an arrest."
1967.37,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3697.967,3708.798,But before they did any talking even they went through as close to the other man's clothes to some extent and they extracted his money from the --
1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,3708.798,3715.508,I think the only possible explanation of that is that the officer saw the bulge and presumed that it may be a gun.
1967.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3729.061,3735.466,"Well just so I'm very clear with you Mr. Attorney General, I gather that the Commonwealth's position is this."
1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,3773.444,3779.97,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, that very simply and accurately does state to the condition of the Commonwealth."
1967.37,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3779.97,3798.635,"It's your position that on the findings of the fact that the District Court approved by the Court of Appeals to the effect that there was not a probable cause for them to enter, should be reversed by us?"
1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,3798.635,3826.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, we concede that there was no probable cause for arrest at the time of entry, but what – our position is that the entry should not be invalidated with all the consequences then flowing from this by the mere circumstance that in the mind of the police officers' entering was the intent as found by the District Court and the Court of Appeals to make an arrest."
1967.37,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3838.603,3840.557,"Excuse me, if I may take another moment."
1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,3881.469,3904.033,"Well, Mr. Justice Fortas, I would suggest that the -- however, one characterizes the terms of legal conclusions what transpired in that case that the fact that the moment the door was opened, the agent said, “you're under arrest, we're going to search the room.”"
1967.37,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3917.447,3940.152,"The issue though in the case as I understand it is whether the entry, not the arrest but the entry was a lawful entry and this Court held that the opinion by Justice Jackson that since there was no search warrant and since coercion is implicit and the request for police, the entry was unlawful."
1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,3940.152,3959.906,"Mr. Justice Fortas, I would have suggested that the essence of that holding is summarized in the statement by Mr. Justice Jackson for the majority, thus, the government is obliged to justify the arrest by the search and at the same time, to justify the search by the arrest, this will not do."
1967.37,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3976.087,3976.672,Thank you.
1967.37,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3976.672,3986.84,Do you think the court's conclusion -- a courts conclusion that there is or it is not a probable cause as a pure question or facts?
1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,3986.84,3987.69,"No, Your Honor."
1967.37,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3993.908,4004.513,"One certain facts that it is -- that those facts, taken together to constitute what's in the mind of the court to consider a reasonable probable cause."
1967.37,2,23080,elliot_l_richardson,,4004.513,4008.33,"Yes, Your Honor."
