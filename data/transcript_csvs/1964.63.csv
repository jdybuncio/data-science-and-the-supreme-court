1964.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,25.637,"Number 63, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Petitioner, versus Clay B. Brown, et al."
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,26.902,29.234,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.63,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,109.154,110.793,"In other words, you said a kind of sale."
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,110.793,112.493,It is not a sale.
1964.63,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,127.008,138.759,So this means (Inaudible)?
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,138.759,140.599,"Not at all, not at all."
1964.63,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,177.02,179.084,How about (Inaudible)?
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,179.084,181.845,"Well, let me --"
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.845,184.146,And they had a right to recapture the property if it --
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,184.146,184.363,That is correct.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,184.363,186.885,(Voice Overlap)
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,186.885,189.199,That is quite correct.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,189.331,190.101,(Voice Overlap)
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,190.101,194.098,-- the case and take you on at a later point.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,197.677,198.894,Just before you do --
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,198.894,199.107,Yes.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.107,202.927,"-- launch under the facts, I want to be sure I understand what your point is?"
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,209.399,209.444,Well --
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.444,212.888,-- it's not an exchange or that that was a transfer.
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,214.399,214.566,No.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,214.566,216.255,You only have to say something is not?
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,216.255,218.112,The transfer is capital asset.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,219.392,220.69,Right.
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,220.69,225.537,The transfer may have been a sale or exchange without at the moment the same of which --
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,225.537,226.823,It was held for six months.
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,226.823,228.747,It was held for six months.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,228.747,229.335,Well --
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,229.335,238.276,"Actually, the more universal question and the question which I think I would emphasize in argument is whether the amounts realized."
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,243.756,243.948,Well --
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,243.948,255.931,And our basic argument is that these amounts were not amounts realized from the transaction even if the transaction was a sale or exchange of some sort.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,255.931,258.875,"Now, you mean there was no gain?"
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,258.875,267.052,"Well, let me say, if I exchange my house for a share of General Motor stock that's a taxable exchange."
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,267.052,267.928,Yes.
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,267.928,275.022,It doesn't mean that the dividends I thereafter receive on the General Motor's stock are taxable as capital gain.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,306.593,310.461,"I know but I -- but I think -- your brief, as I understood your brief, I mean --"
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,310.461,310.948,"Well, the brief --"
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,310.948,312.72,-- your brief said this was not a sale and now --
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,312.72,313.076,The (Voice Overlap) --
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.076,316.174,-- I think you're rather (Voice Overlap) --
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,316.174,320.953,The opening brief frames the question in terms of what are the requirements of an installment sale.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,337.281,338.42,Part of the purchase price?
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,338.42,340.544,"That is correct, only if it is a debt."
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.353,381.048,"Well, I just want to be sure what -- upon what's your theory is based, I --"
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,381.048,388.291,"Ultimately the question to my mind is, even in payment terms of the word “sale”, the word not realized, it doesn't really make a difference."
1964.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,396.066,396.716,Or what?
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,396.716,400.463,"A right to income, an income interest."
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.419,422.118,"Well, I suppose a -- you owe me $100,000 payable over -- $10,000 a year over 10 years, I'd suppose that had a right to income (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,422.118,422.51,Well --
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,422.51,424.646,-- follow either one.
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,424.646,426.592,I think not.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,481.698,483.233,In order for there to be a sale?
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,483.233,485.859,In order for there be -- to be a debt.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,521.664,527.07,"Well, I've made you get way ahead of yourself and I'm sorry but I want to understand it much better after you go into preliminary hearing?"
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,527.07,529.786,"Oh, I hope so."
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,699.085,701.265,And the -- amount of the lease was 90% of the profit.
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,701.265,704.413,"Well, I'm going to go back to trace what was received in exchange."
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,709.306,714.871,If you could but the -- you're satisfied to call that a lease?
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,714.871,715.706,"For present purposes, I am."
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,720.378,720.689,Yes.
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,720.689,721.439,-- further tax.
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,721.439,722.117,But that's not the (Voice Overlap) --
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,722.117,723.19,For purposes of this case --
1964.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,723.19,723.223,Right.
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,723.223,729.314,-- you can assume that that is a lease.
1964.63,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,787.731,793.987,(Inaudible)
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,793.987,797.084,"Actually, I don't question the Institute's taxes -- exemption."
1964.63,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,797.084,798.816,I thought the government remand--
1964.63,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,798.816,807.719,The Government -- finding the shell under which the peanut is in this kind of transaction is not easy and the Commissioner does what you'd expect him to do.
1964.63,1,45208,william_h_kinsey,,2689.96,2695.422,"Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1964.63,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2873.173,2880.06,Why wouldn't your first case you're abused -- be a capital gain and why -- and what would the difference?
1964.63,1,45208,william_h_kinsey,,2882.863,2898.162,"Yes, because if you wrote in a sales price where it was necessary run the asset to extinction to pay the price you have converted future income into capital gain."
1964.63,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2914.306,2916.214,And that in your opinion is a crucial issue?
1964.63,1,45208,william_h_kinsey,,2916.214,2918.585,That is the crucial issue.
1964.63,2,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,6560.276,6561.74,Mr. Chief Justice.
