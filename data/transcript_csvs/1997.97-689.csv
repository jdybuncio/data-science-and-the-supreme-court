1997.97-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.519,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-689, Bonnie Geissal v. the Moore Medical Corporation."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,20.136,22.756,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-689,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,121.432,130.848,"Mr. Weinhaus, would you explain to me what your client stands to recover now?"
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,137.724,139.415,We know some of them were paid.
1997.97-689,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.727,174.399,"Well, presumably your client ought to know whether something was lost or not."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,176.512,178.262,Well--
1997.97-689,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.262,180.155,What is the claimed injury now?
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,180.155,191.943,"--Well, the claimed injury are, amongst other things, we have at least the deductible that we have to pay for, and we have to face health care providers who may hereafter bill us."
1997.97-689,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.778,206.362,How long ago did this death occur?
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,206.362,208.864,"Well, it now occurred a couple of years ago, but--"
1997.97-689,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.864,213.595,But you don't have any bills and we don't know if there's any injury.
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,213.595,215.877,--We have not been told of any bills.
1997.97-689,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,227.798,234.561,"It's just hard to picture what remains of the claim, if anything."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,234.561,235.893,"--Well, what also remains of the claim is this."
1997.97-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,249.535,263.546,"I thought the argument was you would not be entitled to double coverage and one aspect of this that I hope you will clarify, you're talking about maybe bills coming in later, but there are insurance policies."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,278.566,283.541,"--Well, there's certainly a difference in the cap on total... well, there's no difference... there is and there isn't."
1997.97-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.68,301.433,"Well, that's very interesting, but he didn't live."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,301.433,302.522,He did not live.
1997.97-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.522,310.299,"He's dead now, and that's all irrelevant, isn't it, unless, indeed, the bills presented are over a million dollars, or over whatever the limit was."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,310.299,310.839,"Yes, but the--"
1997.97-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.839,311.49,And are they?
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,311.49,320.596,"--Well, we don't... we have not... we did not get that far in discovery because of the way that the magistrate handled that, but presuming that they are--"
1997.97-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.596,322.247,Is there a realistic possibility that they are?
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,322.247,325.068,"--There's a realistic possibility, for the Greek trip, that there are."
1997.97-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,325.068,330.804,"But wouldn't... if he took a trip to the Greek Islands, wouldn't he know how much that cost?"
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,330.804,332.977,"Yes, but... and we know that Aetna did not pay that."
1997.97-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,335.959,347.908,"There's another question I had about how this works is, let's assume he's still... he's just sick, he's not dead, and he's still working, and he's got this dual coverage."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,357.013,365.388,"--Ordinarily, the rule is, his employer and, as pleaded in the case, and as uncontested in the case, Moore was the primary carrier."
1997.97-689,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,405.704,406.225,All right.
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,413.27,413.711,Yes.
1997.97-689,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,413.711,434.374,"And number 2, I think your answer is, assuming, though it didn't get raised explicitly by anybody, that there's nothing in the COBRA act which provides that... your answer may be assuming that there's nothing in the COBRA act that provides that COBRA coverage will be secondary coverage, necessarily."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,434.374,437.355,There is nothing that provides COBRA coverage will be secondary.
1997.97-689,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,447.854,448.174,Okay.
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,465.389,466.751,That's a fair statement.
1997.97-689,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,466.751,466.961,Okay.
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,466.961,472.483,It has not been developed because of the decision of the magistrate to grant summary judgment sua sponte.
1997.97-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,472.483,472.743,Mr. Weinhaus--
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,473.514,482.18,"We certainly claim we have a claim, and we know it's at least of the deductible amount, plus whatever premiums they say we would have had to pay."
1997.97-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,482.18,484.483,May I be blunt about one aspect of this.
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,493.279,494.248,That was his major concern.
1997.97-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.248,497.872,"But he's now dead, as Justice Scalia has pointed out."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,503.615,504.687,"Yes, it does."
1997.97-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,504.687,532.395,"Is that an element that stays on, that... you have the argument that the deductible, you'd have to... you're out of pocket the extra $350, but then you'd have to pay back the premiums to Moore, which amount to in excess of $2,500, so you net... you'd be a net loser, unless what you're saying is, if we prevail, then we get our attorney's fees from the beginning of this representation."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,532.395,537.027,"Well, not only that, but I don't think... I think we're entitled to the entire benefit."
1997.97-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,538.759,542.062,"But suppose it was nothing else, could you say, yeah, we still have a claim."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,547.267,555.773,"--And in addition to that, though, Your... that's correct, but in addition to that, she has the right to say, I want the whole benefit, $120,000."
1997.97-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,565.81,567.92,This was a death benefit?
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,567.92,568.531,No.
1997.97-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.582,574.606,"Well, why would you be paid $120,000 in a lump sum?"
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,574.606,584.123,"Well, it's my understanding... again, these are from off-the-record statements of counsel, is that they paid... that Aetna paid $120,000."
1997.97-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,584.123,585.462,To whom?
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,585.462,588.744,"To health care providers, to hospitals, to doctors."
1997.97-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,588.744,592.048,And you think you have a right to obtain that?
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,592.048,595.72,What ERISA says is that you're not entitled to any damages.
1997.97-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,616.183,618.544,But you say that doesn't defeat your claim against Moore.
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,618.544,630.432,"That doesn't defeat our $120,000 claim in any way, and every other employee of Moore would have the same right to make that same claim if Moore did not pay the bills and some secondary carrier that they also had paid the bill."
1997.97-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,637.017,648.454,"I guess the issue on that would be whether there's standing when somebody brings a claim which is confronted with a counterclaim of a greater amount than the claim, is there still standing to be the claim."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,652.848,653.897,"--Well, there are also penalties, because--"
1997.97-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,653.897,656.339,--Are those penalties that go into the pocket of the plaintiff?
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,656.339,672.861,"--Oh, yes, those are penalties that go into the pocket of... because our theory is, on that, is that if you do not give a proper notice under the statute you're... this employer is subject to a penalty of up to $100 a day for not giving a proper notice, and while--"
1997.97-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,672.861,675.022,But I thought that was a claim that hasn't yet been adjudicated.
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,675.022,701.54,"--Because this claim has not been adjudicated, but on the adjudication of the claim, if we are correct that they should have continued the policy, at that point in time we are entitled to a penalty of up to $100 a day being assessed, and that goes to the plaintiff, and at the time they announced this, Mr. Geissal was very much alive and very much concerned about having the wherewithal to survive, if he could."
1997.97-689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,701.54,704.391,"Are you going to get to the merits, do you think?"
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,706.514,724.815,"Well, the merits of it are, of course, in the plain meaning of the statute itself, Your Honor, because he was covered already under the wife's policy, the TWA health insurance plan at the time."
1997.97-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,770.946,775.678,"Why don't you focus on the exact statutory language that you're relying on, Mr. Weinhaus."
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,775.678,775.859,Yes.
1997.97-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.048,876.069,And you say he never first became covered after the date of election here.
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,876.069,878.673,"--He never became covered, first became covered after the date of--"
1997.97-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.673,879.392,Or he never--
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,879.392,879.853,--He was already covered.
1997.97-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.853,880.734,--He never became covered.
1997.97-689,0,42241,s_sheldon_weinhaus,,882.665,883.436,He was already... there was nothing new.
1997.97-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.273,894.234,"Very well, Mr. Weinhaus."
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,941.866,943.015,"Yes, that's correct."
1997.97-689,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.015,947.6,So you're not really preserving the status quo that existed at the time of the person's employment.
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,947.6,952.16,"I think the general idea is to preserve the status quo, and especially in a case like this it would affect the--"
1997.97-689,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.16,952.891,And you explain this as a glitch.
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,954.082,955.434,--I wouldn't say it's a glitch.
1997.97-689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1021.68,1025.481,"But Mr. Feldman, don't they have the gap exception to take care of that?"
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1025.481,1026.542,--Well--
1997.97-689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1026.542,1031.416,You posed the case where there was significantly less insurance under the new policy.
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1031.416,1040.741,--Let me... that is a view... the significant gap explanation is one that's been adopted by the courts of appeals that have agreed with respondent in the courts below.
1997.97-689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1072.013,1073.475,I'm just saying that it's ameliorated.
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1079.97,1086.595,--That would only be the case if you adopt... if it were true that there is a significant gap inquiry that's required under the statute.
1997.97-689,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.887,1091.757,--Because it continues anyway.
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1093.29,1093.47,--Yes.
1997.97-689,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.238,1095.109,--if it was not first... right.
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1095.109,1095.62,--That's right.
1997.97-689,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1113.334,1117.337,"But the point is, he is in a position to assess whether there's a gap or not."
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1117.337,1130.536,"Right, and he's also in... I might add that if you look at the significant gap inquiry, it's very hard to work, because the plan administrator has to make the determination sometime after the date of election of comparing the provisions of the two policies."
1997.97-689,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1169.522,1174.175,"Would your argument be the same... it wouldn't be as good, but would you take the same position if it said, first is covered?"
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1174.175,1179.819,"I think argument would be the same, but I do think that becomes is the word that really makes it unambiguous."
1997.97-689,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1201.043,1204.406,First is really a redundant or emphatic word.
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1207.628,1208.339,Right.
1997.97-689,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.093,1212.836,"You either become or you already were, one or the other."
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1212.946,1213.707,--That's correct.
1997.97-689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1380.086,1382.648,The temporary period in this case would be 18 months?
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1382.648,1393.417,"It would be 18 months unless some other qualifying event occurs... unless some other terminating event occurs, of which there are several others, in addition to the one that's at issue in this case."
1997.97-689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1393.417,1410.407,"Mr. Feldman, because it is jurisdictional, can you explain why the Eighth Circuit thought the 54(b) issue... they said it was... they considered it a close question, and then didn't expand on it, whether there was an immediately appealable judgment, final judgment--"
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1410.407,1421.314,"I don't understand why they said that, because in looking at it myself I didn't see why it was a close question, so in my view it was a valid 54(b) certification and therefore it was validly before the court of appeals."
1997.97-689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1421.314,1423.407,--I note that Count IV is discrete.
1997.97-689,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1429.623,1443.933,"Perhaps it did, but I didn't... it seemed to me that the issues that were before the court, which were I and II, I was the basic COBRA coverage count, and II... wait a minute, I'm forgetting here exactly what II was."
1997.97-689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1461.784,1463.066,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1464.806,1470.502,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1493.718,1495.019,"Well, why is that relevant?"
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1504.609,1507.23,"--Well, it concerns us, of course is, is that we don't want to pay Aetna."
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1507.23,1510.563,"I know it concerns you, but our basic problem is to decide this particular case."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1510.563,1510.773,Right.
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1510.773,1512.355,And how is it relevant to our problem?
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1512.355,1528.197,"Well, I think that you have to look at the statute, and the statute as a whole, and we have to... based upon a holistic look at the statute, have to determine the intent of Congress, and I don't believe that Congress was trying to protect people and allow them to, in essence, win a medical lottery."
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.561,1544.848,"I don't quite see that, because I thought most insurance policies have in them clauses so that you can't get a double recovery, and one way is, they may have to pay the money back."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1554.258,1555.506,"--That is correct, Justice Breyer."
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1555.506,1555.677,All right.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1556.878,1559.452,We don't intend to pay twice.
1997.97-689,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1567.038,1576.695,"--Well, I mean, if you start out saying, this is disingenuous, they don't want double recovery, and then you tell us there's not going to be double recovery, it seems to me that your opening salvo is rather ineffective."

1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1593.395,1594.217,"--clauses, Justice."
1997.97-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1614.074,1620.789,"--Well, they took an interlocutory appeal because they were thrown out as a matter of law on the meaning of this statute, isn't that right?"
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1620.789,1624.292,"--That is correct, Justice, but what... it's my position--"
1997.97-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1624.292,1636.539,"And nothing to do... if the statute means what you say it means, then I don't see how any of the rest of this is relevant, because you're not entitled to more than one policy, as you read it."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1636.539,1637.86,"--That's correct, Justice."
1997.97-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1637.86,1659.334,"You say this statute just protects the person against the loss of any insurance, and that... so you present a stark question of statutory interpretation on which you divide... you prevailed on your reading, and the rest of it seems to me, as Justice Breyer suggested, not relevant to the question before us, which is what does this provision mean."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1659.334,1659.694,Okay.
1997.97-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1777.494,1781.584,"Why did Congress use the word, continuation coverage?"
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1786.188,1790.642,"--I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg, where--"
1997.97-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1790.642,1794.974,"I thought that the statute uses the words, continuation coverage."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1794.974,1796.494,"--It does at times, yes."
1997.97-689,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.494,1798.357,--section 1162.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1798.357,1800.657,"Right, and 1161, also."
1997.97-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1800.657,1810.125,"That... at least that caption seems to run counter to what you're describing, which is a termination and then a revival."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1810.125,1818.08,"Well, it's new coverage, but it's coverage that relates back to the qualifying event."
1997.97-689,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.421,1837.833,You get it retroactively when you pay the premium.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1837.833,1838.214,--You get it ret--
1997.97-689,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1838.214,1842.377,I don't see how that affects the issue that's before us here.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1842.377,1868.455,"--How it affects the issue before us, Justice Scalia is, is what we have to do is, is to interpret the plain meaning of the statute is, is I believe we have to focus on that clause, after the date of election, set forth in 1162, and that extremely dangling prepositional clause is set off, and it's an independent prepositional clause, and what it... the whole statute is talking about is, is--"
1997.97-689,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.455,1871.528,Where do we find this independent clause in the brief?
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1871.528,1874.54,--In the... I'm using the Government's brief.
1997.97-689,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.54,1874.821,Yes.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1874.821,1878.784,It's at... at page 5a.
1997.97-689,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.784,1880.774,And whereabouts on the page?
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1880.774,1883.356,On the very first paragraph.
1997.97-689,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.356,1883.876,Thank you.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1892.972,1902.008,"The Government's position is, is that becomes is an extremely strong word."
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.727,1956.297,This first becomes coverage--
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1956.297,1957.847,Yes.
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.847,1961.69,"--I mean, I'd like to get your answer to Justice Scalia's question."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1985.119,1987.691,"Well, first of all the relevance is, is that the petitioner--"
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1987.691,1991.123,"--Throughout this whole period, of course, he's covered by the Aetna policy."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,1991.123,1991.574,--Right.
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1991.574,1994.867,So... it has to do with what happened to the Aetna policy.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2009.589,2011.32,I appreciate that position.
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2011.32,2012.799,But what's your answer?
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2016.131,2031.932,"My answer to it is this... as the Eleventh and the Eighth Circuit in this case found out is, is that the... this statute talks about the suspension of coverage, when coverage may end, and its... is... coverage may end only after the date of election."
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2046.903,2048.793,So--
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2048.793,2063.934,"--So what the point becomes is, is that the exact date of the obtention of this preexisting policy really doesn't have a whole lot to do with it, and let me give you a hypothetical that may somewhat clear it up."
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.129,2097.85,"--Your point basically is, don't pay that much attention to the words become after the date of election and first, for the reason that, until the election, there was nothing in effect, so it's natural for Congress to have used those words, since the election created a nothing into a something."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2097.85,2098.881,That's correct.
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2098.881,2100.17,It really has nothing to do with the issue before us.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2100.17,2101.041,That's absolutely correct.
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2101.041,2101.372,That's your argument.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2155.644,2159.918,That basically gets back to the preservation of the status quo argument.
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.214,2234.929,"So that's your point on this one, I take it, is look, all Congress wanted is to give you the 18 months if there's no other coverage in the family."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2234.929,2237.91,"--Right, without the free--"
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.91,2238.08,That's... all right.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2243.205,2244.474,"--No, I don't believe that it would."
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2244.474,2247.777,"Now, aren't lots of people covered with two policies because the spouses both work, or not?"
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2247.777,2249.399,I have--
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2249.399,2255.122,"What do you... you're in this... I mean, just speaking out of your experience, this is your... basically I gather you're represented a lot of these cases."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2273.752,2282.789,"--Justice Breyer, I do assume that there's probably a lot of people who do have this situation, that there are a lot of people with preexisting spousal insurance."
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.674,2289.995,All right.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2313.219,2318.102,--I don't know the... I certainly don't know the answer to that.
1997.97-689,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2348.956,2357.32,"Well, Mr. Washburn, under the COBRA scheme, I take it that your client, the insurance company, is paid a premium for the COBRA coverage."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2359.782,2374.992,"--That's correct, we are paid a premium, but the practical matter is, is the cost of providing benefits to COBRA are always substantially... or not always, but they as a rule are substantially greater than the premiums that are received, because people--"
1997.97-689,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2374.992,2375.613,How is that?
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2375.613,2377.244,"--Well, because people--"
1997.97-689,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.244,2381.467,I assume you make that back from the employer when you sell the employer the whole package.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2382.746,2386.78,--Justice Scalia... I'm sorry.
1997.97-689,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.267,2402.962,"No, but I mean, if you're losing money on the premiums that you get from the retired employees, or the terminated employees--"
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2402.962,2403.132,Mm-hmm.
1997.97-689,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2403.132,2417.474,"--of this employer, you would not sell insurance to this employer unless, when you sell insurance to the employer, you get enough premiums from his current employees, contributed to by the employer or not, to make up for that loss."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2417.474,2417.945,That is correct.
1997.97-689,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.945,2419.684,"So, you know, you're happy."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2421.455,2430.019,"Well, the insurance company may be happy, but the employer and the existing employees may not be happy, because of... particularly with small groups, COBRA--"
1997.97-689,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.019,2430.921,It comes out of their pockets.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2430.921,2444.81,"--It comes out of their pockets and, in fact, what it may have the long-term effect of doing is, is causing a lot of particularly smaller plans to just cancel the group health insurance leaving everybody bare, the COBRA people plus all of the employees."
1997.97-689,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2514.225,2521.88,"Well, it may have been bothering Congress, but if I understand what you're saying, it... you're saying it shouldn't bother us because that's not the case here."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2521.88,2524.671,--It's not the case--
1997.97-689,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2524.671,2528.455,I think you're saying there's another ground upon which you ought to win this case.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2528.455,2529.626,--Right.
1997.97-689,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2529.626,2534.408,"And it's not a ground that was passed upon, as I understand it, in the summary judgment that was entered."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2534.408,2542.954,"Justice Souter, I believe that the plain language of the statute dictates--"
1997.97-689,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2542.954,2557.035,"No, the plain language of the statute may dictate it, but the... as I understand it, the summary judgment was not entered on the assumption that the policy coverage to which the statute applies is as you have just described it."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2567.35,2580.89,"--Summary judgment was granted here is, is because the trial judge determined that... he went along with what the Eleventh Circuit and national companies and now the Eighth Circuit ruled."
1997.97-689,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2580.89,2581.469,"Okay, and that's a different issue."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2582.751,2583.001,Right.
1997.97-689,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2583.001,2597.062,"And now, if I understand what you're saying, you're raising an issue of fact under the policy to be applied to that law, but that was a stage to which the lower courts never progressed, isn't that the case, or am I misunderstanding you?"
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2597.062,2599.954,"Maybe I'm not making myself perfectly clear, Justice."
1997.97-689,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.247,2605.857,You're not suggesting those hypothetical facts are the facts of this case.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2605.857,2606.988,"--No, they're not the facts of this case."
1997.97-689,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.988,2607.179,Okay.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2607.179,2612.863,"There was... as I understand it, Mrs. Geissal had been covered for years by the TWA plan."
1997.97-689,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.863,2621.439,"You're just basically saying there are situations in which there could be a preexisting policy but yet it still... that policy wouldn't amount... would not first become applicable, and so forth."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2621.439,2622.43,"Right, and all I'm just showing is, is that--"
1997.97-689,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.43,2622.62,Yes.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2622.62,2643.715,"--a supercilious approach to looking at just the date of obtention of the spousal policy really isn't in keeping with the act, and I'm just showing that the pure position of, say, all pre-existing spousal coverage is exempt from COBRA makes no sense because of this hypothetical situation."
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2643.715,2644.653,"Yes, with the hypothetical... I mean, that's clever."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2673.823,2674.824,Became primary.
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.824,2678.718,"--Became primary, and you say therefore it became... first became coverage."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2680.62,2681.522,"It's one of my arguments, yes."
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.522,2681.722,All right.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2717.035,2718.845,"Justice, if I may, I--"
1997.97-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2718.845,2719.036,Yes.
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2719.226,2719.376,--get into that.
1997.97-689,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2740.62,2750.448,"This is not a coordination of benefits provision, and this is probably your... your hypothetical is probably why Congress did not key this to primary coverage."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2761.434,2767.451,"--Well, I don't know that primary and secondary coverage should be thrashed out in every single case."
1997.97-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2771.302,2777.315,"But could you explain to me, in the context of this case, he gets sick."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2791.216,2805.294,"Our policy, our plans... our plan, ERISA plan, sits there and says that Aetna would pay, that they're primary, and that is also in accordance with the NAIC model code that COBRA--"
1997.97-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2805.294,2821.646,"That any other insurance... you have the, I would think that you insure your own and the spouses would be secondary, but you say no, that... if you employ someone, any other insurance that that person has would be primary and not yours?"
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2821.646,2821.865,--No.
1997.97-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2857.939,2866.264,What body of law determines whether you shift from being primarily liable as the employer to secondarily liable?
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2870.648,2879.124,"Well, in my brief I did cite that Missouri and Connecticut have adopted the model code, Justice."
1997.97-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2879.124,2883.468,And is that a matter determined by State law rather than ERISA law?
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2883.468,2888.67,"Yes, it is, and it's definitely within the exception for matters of insurance."
1997.97-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2893.973,2896.555,"Because there, there is a difference between the two of you on what the law is, I thought."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2909.895,2913.237,That is what they pled in the lower... in the trial court.
1997.97-689,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2929.076,2937.854,"Mr. Washburn, can I ask you just to comment on one thing that the other side raised, the significant gap argument, that they say under your view you have a significant gap problem."
1997.97-689,2,18173,bradley_j_washburn,,2943.958,2944.379,Okay.
