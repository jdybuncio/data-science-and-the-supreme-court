2019.17-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.4,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1618, Bostock versus Clayton County, and the consolidated case. Ms. Karlan."
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,9.4,29.24,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a employer fires a male employee for dating men but does not fire female employees who date men, he violates Title VII. The employer has, in the words of Section 703(a), discriminated against the man because he treats that man worse than women who want to do the same thing."
2019.17-1618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,139.12,167.72,"Ms. Karlan -- Ms. Karlan, how do you answer the argument that back in 1964, this could not have been in Congress's mind because in -- in many states male same-sex relations was a criminal offense; the American Psychiatric Association labeled homosexuality a -- a mental illness?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,167.72,170.36,"Well, I think you read the words of the statute."
2019.17-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,206.56,221.48,"How do you -- do you agree or disagree with Judge Posner's statement that the statute should be read to encompass sexual orientation discrimination to ""avoid placing the entire burden of updating old statutes on the legislative branch""?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,221.48,222.76,I disagree with Judge Posner.
2019.17-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,261.96,266.0,"Well, I think we'll have further questions. (Laughter.)"
2019.17-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,266.0,302.72,"What do you do with the argument that this is a non-discriminatory policy because it applies equally to relationships between women and relationships between men? In other words, your friends on the -- or -- or you emphasize that you need to know the sex of the individuals involved before you can determine whether or not there's a violation and that that brings it within Title VII. But what about the response that you do not need to know the sex of the people involved; you just can have a policy against same sex? So you don't care whether the participants are women or men."
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,305.52,313.44,I think that's no different than having a policy that says everyone should comply with the stereotype applicable to their sex.
2019.17-1618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,341.92,342.8,"But there's, Ms. --"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,342.8,343.12,-- but a man can.
2019.17-1618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,344.68,346.72,"Ms. Karlan, there's quite a difference."
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,370.24,378.04,"Justice Ginsburg, the part of Dothard against Rawlinson that rested on disparate impact was the height and weight requirements."
2019.17-1618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,409.32,429.16,"What do you do with the -- the example that was brought up that, unlike race, there are certain distinctions that are not only permitted but maybe even required between males and females, like physical fitness tests?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,429.16,432.76,So those -- I want to answer that question in two parts.
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,474.88,490.0,"Do you think we need exemptions for those BFOQs? It's not just the -- physical fitness standards for different sports, but big issue right now raging the country is bathroom usage."
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,500.92,508.48,"Well, I think the way that they get dealt with is everybody agrees if you have men's bathrooms and women's bathrooms, that's because of sex."
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,550.64,554.24,"Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that maybe how they would see it."
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,562.8,563.28,Sure.
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,563.28,569.32,"How would you deal with those, given that -- that at least those affected might think that they're suffering a harm?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,569.32,571.88,So there's no categorical rule about these.
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,589.48,589.52,No --
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,589.52,589.92,-- ties --
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,589.92,591.32,-- we're not -- we're not -- I mean --
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,591.32,591.6,I know.
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,591.6,592.84,-- we can talk absurd examples --
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,592.84,593.6,"No, but I can --"
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,593.6,594.56,-- or we can talk real world examples.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,594.56,608.04,"I will give you a real world example, which is, it probably doesn't violate dress code to require men and women in business events for the women to wear skirts, but if you required a telephone lineman to wear a skirt --"
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,608.04,608.16,"No, no --"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,608.16,608.72,-- while she's still --
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,608.72,610.84,I understand that. That's not what I'm getting at.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,619.88,620.28,Okay.
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,620.28,621.36,You can offer me help if you want to.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,621.36,622.08,"Yes, yes."
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,624.4,624.8,All right.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,652.6,653.0,Yes.
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,684.52,685.52,"You are not, but another --"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,685.52,685.8,It -- it --
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,685.8,686.8,-- person might be.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,686.8,687.44,Right.
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,688.16,694.6,"Are they reasonable or not? And -- and I'm -- I'm -- I'm just -- I'm wondering, how do you decide those cases?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,694.6,701.84,An idiosyncratic preference does not void an otherwise valid dress code or bathroom rule.
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,701.84,702.32,So is it --
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,702.32,702.76,Ms. Karlan --
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,702.76,703.16,I'm sorry.
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,704.52,705.48,Go ahead and finish it.
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,705.48,723.92,Is it idiosyncratic for a transgender person to prefer a bathroom that's different than the -- the one of their biological sex? Is it idiosyncratic for a transsexual person to wish to dress in a different style of dress than his or her biological --
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,723.92,724.08,No.
2019.17-1618,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,724.08,725.28,Sex? Okay.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,733.56,740.2,"Yes, although I think you'd -- you'd be better advised to ask the question to someone who -- who is representing someone who is transgender."
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,741.72,742.48,Ms. Karlan.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,742.48,743.24,And -- yeah.
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,743.24,745.64,But you're begging Justice Gorsuch's question.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,747.36,748.32,I truly am not trying to --
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,748.32,749.16,-- which is --
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,749.16,750.56,-- beg the question.
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,750.56,774.64,"-- how do we differentiate the two? What is the legal test that you propose to say this is discrimination because of sex, as you said, calling you one thing and your friend another is discriminatory, but it's okay because there's no harm. So what's the test we apply to, say, when it is harm and when it isn't?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,774.64,776.16,Let -- let me try to be clear.
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,776.16,776.72,Let's be --
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,776.72,781.64,"It's not discrimination to call me Ms. Karlan and to call Mr. Harris, Mr. Harris."
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,809.56,810.08,So why --
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,810.08,810.28,-- thinks --
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,810.28,820.76,"-- is a dress code for Hooters that requires all women to wear a scantily -- a scant dress, is that discriminatory?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,820.76,821.92,"Yes, it is."
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,821.92,827.96,Is it discriminatory for the woman who just doesn't want to wear it because it's demeaning?
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,827.96,828.64,"Yes, it is."
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,828.64,840.2,"So how about, is it discriminatory for the restaurant not to hire a transgender man who wants to wear the uniform?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,840.2,841.0,"Well, you're going to get --"
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,841.0,841.48,The scant uniform.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,841.48,844.36,"I -- I mean, I do want to get to the question of sexual orientation --"
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,844.36,844.92,"No, no, no --"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,844.92,845.96,"-- here, but I understand -- I understand."
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,845.96,848.32,"But I think what you're alluding is, and I still haven't heard --"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,848.32,848.56,Yeah.
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,848.56,856.8,"-- the explanation, which is the question of how do we tell what's actionable and not?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,856.8,857.68,"Well, if --"
2019.17-1618,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,857.68,860.76,At what -- when does that discrimination become an issue?
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,860.76,871.8,"I'll -- I'll give an analogy from the race area that may be helpful to the Court, which is, for many years, there was an argument that separate but equal was acceptable."
2019.17-1618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,892.12,892.8,Can I ask --
2019.17-1618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,892.8,920.68,"Would you say the test is is the person injured? Yes, it's a differential based on gender, but most people are not injured by having separate bathrooms. In fact, they -- most people would prefer it. So are you saying that we have to wait for the testing case for the person who might be injured by not being allowed to use the bathroom of the other sex?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,920.68,928.92,I think it highly unlikely you're going to see cases like that. The bathroom issue has been around since the beginning of Title VII.
2019.17-1618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,948.56,949.4,May I ask you to --
2019.17-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,949.4,950.52,Are these -- Justice Alito.
2019.17-1618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,950.52,986.76,"May I ask you to respond to what some people will say about this Court if we rule in your favor? And what they will say is that whether Title VII should prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a big policy issue, and it is a different policy issue from the one that Congress thought it was addressing in 1964. And Congress has been asked repeatedly in the years since 1964 to address this question."
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1027.44,1034.28,"Well, the fact that a loose cannon like Judge Posner says, ""do whatever you feel like"" is not what we're asking for."
2019.17-1618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1058.64,1059.12,We will --
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1059.12,1060.16,-- his body was --
2019.17-1618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1060.16,1070.44,"We would not be deciding a major policy question that was not in Congress's mind in 1964, and then Congress has repeatedly failed to address in the years since then?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1070.44,1072.48,No more than what you did in Oncale.
2019.17-1618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1075.8,1076.32,All right.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1076.32,1077.4,-- Newport News.
2019.17-1618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1077.4,1087.72,"Is there -- is there -- in my mind, there are three basic parts to this case on the other side, to language. You've dealt with that. The parade of horribles, you've dealt with that."
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1110.2,1112.08,Doesn't apply to what kind of --
2019.17-1618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1112.08,1116.24,To German policemen. The meaning is the same.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1159.92,1173.92,"I think the way to think about this is to ask about the specific behavior that's at issue, which is a man dates a man, and then ask: How does that fit within the language? And the best example I can give --"
2019.17-1618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1173.92,1174.28,It fits.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1174.28,1174.52,"No, I'm --"
2019.17-1618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1174.52,1175.48,I give you it fits.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1175.48,1176.56,I'm -- I'm about to explain why --
2019.17-1618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1176.56,1176.64,Yeah.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1176.64,1177.48,-- it fits.
2019.17-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1215.28,1215.64,"Counsel, I --"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1215.64,1217.2,-- rather than children.
2019.17-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1217.2,1223.32,"Several, I think about 23, states have been passing laws to address these -- these issues."
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1248.16,1248.4,Yeah.
2019.17-1618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1248.4,1258.76,"-- that that's not doing that, how do we address that other concern, that at least, I think almost every state legislature that has extended it has felt compelled to address?"
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1258.76,1287.0,"Well, I -- I -- I would say three things about that: The first is this Court has already created an exemption for sincere religious belief for a large category of employers through the ministerial exception. The second is that Congress balanced these issues and has rebalanced them several times in the co-religionist exception. The third thing I would say is to understand this in context, which is 85 percent of American employers are not covered by Title VII at all."
2019.17-1618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1363.56,1363.92,But you gave your --
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1363.92,1371.96,-- and since then a majority of justices -- I mean a majority of judges have held that sexual orientation is a subset of sex discrimination.
2019.17-1618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1371.96,1390.68,"Justice Breyer characterized what I said earlier as conceding that sexual orientation discrimination fits the words of Title VII, but that we should take a broader view of what Congress had in mind. But that was not -- that was not the premise of my argument."
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1419.12,1419.8,Yes.
2019.17-1618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1419.8,1420.6,Okay.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1448.36,1467.64,"But in a case like the two cases before this Court where the employer had hired these men and they were already there, the supposition you made in your question doesn't apply, which is we know this is an employer who's willing to hire men. Indeed, the employer in Gerald -- I mean the employer in Don Zarda's case had only men as skydiving instructors."
2019.17-1618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1476.12,1486.4,The -- the point is that discrimination on the basis of sex in the sense that Congress understood it in 1964 is a different concept from discrimination on the basis of --
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1486.4,1487.0,"Well, in --"
2019.17-1618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1487.0,1487.96,-- sexual orientation.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1487.96,1488.32,-- in 19 --
2019.17-1618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1488.32,1489.48,And that's what you're fighting.
2019.17-1618,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1495.32,1495.36,I -- I'm --

2019.17-1618,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3099.8,3101.48,So I guess I'm thinking of the wrong case.
2019.17-1618,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3101.48,3103.04,"Sprogis against United Airlines, Seventh Circuit."
2019.17-1618,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3103.04,3143.84,"General, could I go back to your opening statement and particularly to the second part of it? You talked about the history of -- of Title VII and some of the subsequent legislative history, and I guess what strikes me, and I was struck in reading your briefs too, is that the arguments you're making, I would say, are not ones we typically would accept. For many years, the lodestar of this Court's statutory interpretation has been the text of a statute, not the legislative history, and certainly not the subsequent legislative history. And the text of the statute appears to be pretty firmly in Ms. Karlan's corner."
2019.17-1618,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3177.48,3177.68,Right.
2019.17-1618,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3177.68,3180.04,-- to predictions. We don't look to desires.
2019.17-1618,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3185.76,3191.96,"Because, Your Honor, I think that what our brief attempts to do, at least, is make a straightforward textual argument."

2019.17-1618,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3209.24,3209.96,And so under Title --
2019.17-1618,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3209.96,3222.08,What is your response to the two-comparator problem we've been discussing and the fact that at least one contributing cause appears to be sex?
2019.17-1618,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3222.08,3223.6,"Well, Your Honor, a couple of responses."
2019.17-1618,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3261.68,3262.28,Is there --

2019.17-1618,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3264.56,3267.2,-- get to in the next case.
2019.17-1618,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3267.2,3271.6,-- in this record showing that the employers would not employ lesbian women?

2019.17-1618,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3292.48,3303.88,Did this go -- the -- the -- the allegation is that the person was discharged when he announced that he was gay.
2019.17-1618,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3311.84,3312.04,Right.
2019.17-1618,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3312.04,3313.96,-- discharging lesbian women.
2019.17-1618,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3313.96,3314.8,I think that's right.
2019.17-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3387.0,3387.32,Sure.
2019.17-1618,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3387.32,3402.24,"Title VII prohibits discrimination based on one of those traits, as long as you treat men and women who are similarly situated with respect to the other trait exactly the same, you're not ""discriminating"" under -- within the meaning of Title VII."

2019.17-1618,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3403.36,3404.08,Thank you.
2019.17-1618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3404.08,3409.28,"Five minutes, Ms. Karlan."
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3409.28,3455.88,"Thank you. Let me start with the question that Justice Ginsburg asked because I think it's illustrative of contemporary sexual orientation discrimination cases. Virtually none of them involve an employer, and neither of the cases before you does, who claims to have an across-the-board policy of firing both all gay men and all lesbians. What tends to happen, and this case is illustrative of this, is a man who also doesn't conform with some other gender-based stereotypes and who is gay gets fired, which puts them in exactly the position that Justice Sotomayor mentioned, which is really devilishly hard to figure out what's going on here. The second point I just want to leave the Court with is, the entire argument on the other side depends on the idea that men who are gay and women who are lesbians are being treated the same."
2019.17-1618,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3474.88,3489.96,"Ms. Karlan, would you address these -- General's statement at the end? He -- he goes back to the comparator should be a woman who -- a -- a man who likes a man and a woman who likes a woman."
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3491.68,3491.96,Yes.
2019.17-1618,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3501.56,3505.96,So give us an example from a case how you can't do that.
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3505.96,3508.52,I'm not sure -- of course you can do it but you don't have to.
2019.17-1618,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3522.72,3532.12,But what if the decisionmaker makes a decision based on sexual orientation but does not know the biological sex of the person involved?
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3532.12,3534.8,"Well, there is no reported case that does that."
2019.17-1618,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3535.12,3535.32,All right.
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3535.32,3535.6,-- think the Court --
2019.17-1618,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3535.6,3535.88,But what if --
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3535.88,3536.52,-- can wrestle with --
2019.17-1618,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3536.52,3548.32,What if it happened? We have had a lot of hypotheticals of things that may or may not have happened. What if that happens? Is that discrimination on the basis of sex where the decisionmaker doesn't even know the person's sex?
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3548.32,3550.72,And -- and how do they know the person's sexual orientation?
2019.17-1618,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3550.72,3554.24,Because somebody who interviewed the candidates tells them that.
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3554.24,3556.72,And they are unable to tell anything about the person's sex?
2019.17-1618,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3556.72,3556.96,No.
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3556.96,3561.0,"So this is Saturday Night Live Pat, as -- as an example, right? (Laughter.)"
2019.17-1618,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3561.0,3562.68,"Well, I'm not familiar with that."
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3562.68,3562.84,Okay.
2019.17-1618,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3562.84,3562.96,But --
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3562.96,3568.92,"Which is the person named Pat, and you can never tell whether Pat is a man or a woman. I mean, theoretically that person might be out there."
2019.17-1618,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3569.8,3570.84,Theoretically what?
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3570.84,3572.76,Theoretically that person might be out there.
2019.17-1618,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3592.48,3601.0,"Well, if that's the case, then I think your whole argument collapses because sexual orientation then is a different thing from sex."
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3601.0,3602.12,Of course it is.
2019.17-1618,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3607.88,3626.48,"Well, let me amend it. Your argument is that sex -- discrimination based on sexual orientation necessarily entails discrimination based on sex. But if it's the case that there would be no liability in the situation where the decisionmaker has no knowledge of sex, then that can't possibly be true."
2019.17-1618,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3626.48,3704.76,"If there was that case, it might be the rare case in which sexual orientation discrimination is not a subset of sex. But in the case where the person knows the sex of the person that they're firing or refusing to hire, and knows the sex of the people to whom that person is attracted, that is sex discrimination, pure and simple. And it's important to understand that -- and -- and this goes back to something that Justice Ginsburg asked during the opening argument, that discrimination against gay men and discrimination against lesbians is not one thing. And in 1964, if you look at the members of Congress's brief, they will tell you if you looked in the dictionary there was no phrase ""sexual orientation."" That is a modern way of combining two kinds of discrimination: Discrimination against gay men, which goes back to Leviticus and the common law, and discrimination against lesbians, which was not part of Leviticus and was not part of the common law. Indeed, in 1964, there were only 16 states in the United States that clearly forbid some act in which lesbians could engage. So the idea that this is one large idea about sexual orientation discrimination in the abstract, without reference to sex, simply burkes the history and burkes the understanding. And if you look at the harassment cases, you will see why this is true."
2019.17-1618,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3708.96,3709.96,"Thank you, counsel."
