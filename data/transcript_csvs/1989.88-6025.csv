1989.88-6025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.807,"We'll hear argument now in No. 88-6025, Reuben Dowling against the United States."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,8.858,11.97,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1989.88-6025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,50.455,57.461,"You're not making any rule, then, that 404(b) doesn't authorize it or should be construed not to authorize it?"
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,57.461,59.711,"In this particular case, no."
1989.88-6025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,67.937,76.853,"Well, of course, the Court ordinarily doesn't want to reach constitutional questions if there's a different... if it's a statutory ground in which to decide it."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,76.853,86.45,"--Well, in this case, if, in fact, the evidence violates the defendant's rights under the Constitution, the court would have to apply a different harmless error standard."
1989.88-6025,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,90.253,92.814,"Yeah, but what if the rules forbid this kind of evidence?"
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,92.814,97.747,"--If rule 404(b), a straight 404(b) analysis for... forbids the evidence?"
1989.88-6025,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,97.747,99.269,Do you argue that or not?
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,99.269,106.566,"We didn't argue it in our... our cert petition, and the reason we didn't is this."
1989.88-6025,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,148.955,149.475,I see.
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,154.918,158.481,We didn't present it in the cert petition.
1989.88-6025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,240.425,244.43,"Well, this wasn't test... testimony that was designed to prove character--"
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,244.43,246.109,No.
1989.88-6025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.109,248.61,"--in order to show that he behaved in a certain way, was it?"
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,248.61,252.294,"No, it was certainly not offered for that purpose; it was offered for the purpose of--"
1989.88-6025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,252.294,256.355,"And I... I don't think... and I don't think we could construe it as offered for that purpose, do you?"
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,256.355,259.478,"--No, I don't believe it was... it had that effect--"
1989.88-6025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,259.478,263.261,"Well, then 404(b) doesn't apply, because the only thing it prohibits is character evidence."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,263.261,269.946,"--Well, rule 404(b) could... it was... it was offered for the purpose of proving identity."
1989.88-6025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,275.721,280.303,There... there are two sentences in 404(b); the first prohibits character evidence.
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,282.606,291.051,"Well, it... it... it... it is, in one sense, but if, in fact... it wasn't offered strictly to that purpose."
1989.88-6025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.745,336.714,"Well, the... the purpose for my making the comment is... and it bears on the constitutional argument that I know you're trying to reach... is that you began by saying, oh, this is other crimes."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,364.703,375.9,"--Had the government merely limited the evidence to the fact that Vena Henry, had she testified, yes, I've seen Reuben Dowling in the company of Delroy Christian, I would think they would have a stronger point."
1989.88-6025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,422.815,441.418,"Well, if the evidence of the... the gun, the mask and accompanying Christian just happens to be in the occurrence of what might have been a crime, that doesn't seem to me to exclude it, unless the 403 balancing rule comes into play, of prejudice exceeding the probative value of the testimony."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,443.34,453.697,You're raising just the 404(b) analysis as to whether the evidence should come in just by mere application of that rule.
1989.88-6025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,482.307,492.755,"But... but... but that's the whole point, not guilty of a crime, but not that he wasn't not with Christian, not that he didn't have a mask, not that he didn't have a gun."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,499.621,501.261,--It goes to the collateral estoppel issue--
1989.88-6025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,501.261,501.442,Yeah.
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,501.442,506.054,--as to whether or not the... the issue of identity had previously been determined by the--
1989.88-6025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,506.054,506.424,Right.
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,506.424,507.786,--by the jury.
1989.88-6025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.212,565.159,Don't you have to show us that the burden of proof at that trial was the same as the government is required to show... get something admit... admitted under the rules of evidence?
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,565.159,574.634,"--Well, I... I... you know, very candidly, Mr. Chief Justice, I would admit, I think that's the government's strongest argument, that there was a different burden of proof."
1989.88-6025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.059,677.724,"But... but in... in Ashe, the court was dealing with... with two successive criminal prosecutions, where the burden was the same."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,677.724,678.415,--That is true.
1989.88-6025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,706.937,710.939,"Well, but, you know that's language that was used by the court in explaining an amendment."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,730.412,735.946,"I don't... I think, as far as when applying it in the civil context, that's true."
1989.88-6025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,832.082,839.037,"From what you say, it scunds as thought double jeopardy is almost subsumed under due process; kind of a general fairness requirement."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,839.037,846.09,"Well, I think, clearly, there are distinctions, but I also think we have raised the due process issue in this case, too."
1989.88-6025,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,865.507,868.068,"May... may I ask you a question, Mr. Tucker--"
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,868.068,868.289,Sure.
1989.88-6025,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.289,869.23,--about the collateral estoppel?
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,883.819,887.621,"The... yeah, I... I... yes, Justice Stevens."
1989.88-6025,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.273,919.474,But there's not enough in the record is there?
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,940.347,940.778,--Yes.
1989.88-6025,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.778,941.028,Yeah.
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,956.198,961.164,"I think... I think a fair answer to that question is, indeed, the record is not clear either way."
1989.88-6025,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.164,961.385,Yeah.
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,961.385,963.789,That's why we would like you to put that burden on the government.
1989.88-6025,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.789,971.442,"So, the issue really is who... if... if... if... if you don't lose on the difference in the burden of proof, the issue on collateral estoppel would be who had... who had the burden?"
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,971.442,975.375,The issue on collateral estoppel would be who had the burden.
1989.88-6025,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.375,980.48,"The government says you should because you're relying on it, and you say they should because it's unfair to do it otherwise."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,980.48,1002.376,"Your Honor, I... I would, in further response to your question, I agree... I think I agree basically that since there's no transcript and it's not clear enough either way, I would suggest that if... if the court extends and... and agrees with us that the principles of Ashe v. Swenson apply, and collateral estoppel applies, that perhaps a remand would be appropriate for that determination."
1989.88-6025,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.409,1034.181,"Well, I'm not sure you would have impeached him on that."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,1040.288,1040.965,I think I said that wrong.
1989.88-6025,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1042.038,1043.217,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,1043.347,1044.398,--his testimony was that he was not in Vena Henry's house.
1989.88-6025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1094.073,1096.845,"Well, it would be kind of odd to come in a mask and a gun, wouldn't it?"
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,1096.845,1115.227,"--I suggest that... that the government's theory that the jury acquitted on the basis that two individuals came with a mask and a gun and a shot was fired in the ceiling, and that was proffered and... by the government lawyer and argued in the admissability of the evidence, clearly defies ration and reason."
1989.88-6025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.725,1303.189,We've upheld the position of the government about the last dozen double jeopardy cases we've written.
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,1308.653,1320.329,"--No, I mean for the... for the rights of innocent defendants."
1989.88-6025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1324.472,1328.554,--could say about a roulette wheel; it has no memory and no conscience.
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,1331.418,1331.867,--The people--
1989.88-6025,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1331.867,1332.768,This court has a memory.
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,1334.999,1354.933,"--The problem that we get into here is that, indeed, a not guilty verdict on this technical burden of proof argument, you know, the government can say that all that means is a reasonable doubt, but somewhere out there, you know, we suggest that there is a lot of people out there, who when the jury finds not guilty, they mean innocent."
1989.88-6025,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.596,1399.174,"That... that... that's just inconsistent with our cases that say that it's not... you know, you're not precluded from bringing a civil penalty action on the basis of a... of a... of a criminal acquittal."
1989.88-6025,0,40588,robert_l_tucker,,1403.789,1408.751,In the civil... I clearly have to draw the line because of civil versus criminal.
1989.88-6025,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1515.636,1516.796,"Surely, Mr. Tucker."
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1517.988,1525.803,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1989.88-6025,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1704.193,1710.947,"Well, Mr. Nightingale, the Third Circuit thought the evidence was not admissable under the rule."
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1710.947,1712.688,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-6025,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1757.43,1768.946,"Well... well, in your view, is this just the misapplication of the rule of Ashe v. Swenson, or is there some new proposition presented here?"
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1768.946,1771.728,The Third Circuit has not relied on Ashe v. Swenson.
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1817.449,1824.895,"Mr. Nightingale, you said that the Third Circuit gave too much effect to the judgement in the prior case."
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1824.895,1825.153,Yes.
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1825.153,1830.108,"Well, your view, I think, is that there should be no effect given to it; it's not a matter of some effect?"
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1830.108,1836.691,The way collateral estoppel and the rules of evidence work is an all-or-nothing proposition.
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.439,1845.678,Right.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1845.678,1848.061,--any evidence inconsistent with a prior judgement.
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1848.061,1851.621,"So their... their error was not it gave you too much effect, it wasn't giving any effect?"
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1851.621,1852.462,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-6025,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1852.462,1859.618,"You would agree, I take it, that they couldn't retry the defendant for the Vena... Vena whatever it was case again?"
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1859.618,1860.547,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-6025,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.547,1862.57,Since that would be the same burden of proof?
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1862.57,1872.467,"Assuming the matter of what was resolved by the prior verdict were... were... would foreclose a... a prior prosecution, that's correct."
1989.88-6025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.953,1910.924,"You didn't... you won the case below it, so I guess you... I suppose you could have filed a cross petition or something?"
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1910.924,1921.942,"Your Honor, we felt that was unnecessary when the case... we believe that we're entitled to defend the judgement of the court below on any ground that we've preserved to this point."
1989.88-6025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1930.31,1934.69,But you want us to disagree with the court of appeals on its constitutional ruling?
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1934.69,1936.992,--We believe that the--
1989.88-6025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.992,1937.522,Don't you?
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1939.793,1940.054,--Yes.
1989.88-6025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1940.054,1941.466,"--as I read your brief, you do?"
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1941.466,1949.133,"Yes, we disagree with the Third Circuit's disposition of the evidentiary question, both as a matter of collateral estoppel and under the rules of evidence."
1989.88-6025,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.133,1953.186,"Let me ask you a question, Mr.... Mr. Nightingale, a kind of a hypothetical."
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1974.491,1975.573,That's correct.
1989.88-6025,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2061.592,2069.668,"Suppose in Ashe, the first prosecution is for robbery in the house."
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2075.59,2076.051,Yes.
1989.88-6025,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2076.051,2083.678,Identity testimony establishes that it was a... that it was... the government did not bear the burden of proof that this person was in the house.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2091.692,2094.263,The theory of the prosecution is that the murder--
1989.88-6025,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2094.263,2096.164,That he was in the house and committed a murder.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2096.164,2098.116,--In the course of the robbery?
1989.88-6025,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2098.116,2098.257,Yes.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2098.257,2098.667,At the same time?
1989.88-6025,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2103.021,2111.807,So then it isn't just related to whether or not the same offense is being the subject of a subsequent prosecution.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2111.807,2113.5,"Your Honor, to reconcile--"
1989.88-6025,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2113.5,2114.819,Which was what your formulation was.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2114.819,2130.309,"--To reconcile Ashe v. Swenson with the language of the double jeopardy clause, one has to conclude that collateral estoppel establishes a subspecies of situations in which, because the same fact is essential to convictions, it can't be relitigated."
1989.88-6025,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2138.905,2145.61,"Well, I'm just asking, is it your position that the subsequent prosecution in the case that I put would be barred by Ashe v. Swenson?"
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2145.61,2145.871,Yes.
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.208,2249.73,"Well, it's more than just Christian and Dowling and the white vehicle."
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2251.533,2252.344,That's true.
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.344,2259.63,"And all of those facts, if it was the same person, it's... it's quite probative of the fact that the... it was the same person in both situations."
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2281.396,2293.253,"Your Honor, I don't believe so, because the... the notion of fairness that you've raised relates to what it is that a judgement of acquittal establishes."
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.016,2295.166,I understand.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2295.166,2301.019,It's unfair only if one assumes that a judgement of acquittal represents a finding that someone else did it.
1989.88-6025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.39,2338.864,But Ashe... Ashe suggests that maybe the acquittal establishes something else... it can establish something else.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2338.864,2361.17,"--I believe that what Ashe establishes is that when a jury... when a jury acquits on the basis of an issue, the absence of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on an issue, the government cannot seek to establish the same issue beyond a reasonable doubt."
1989.88-6025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.17,2376.109,"So the acquittal does do more than... than just say the jury failed to find guilt by... beyond a reasonable doubt; it also may, in certain circumstances, show why the jury decided that way?"
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2377.911,2378.372,Under Ashe v. Swenson--
1989.88-6025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.372,2380.875,--that... that the jury resolved a certain fact.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2380.875,2386.339,"--Under Ashe v. Swenson, the court is required to put itself in the shoes of a rational jury--"
1989.88-6025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.339,2386.659,Yes.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2386.659,2393.254,"--to study the record, the instructions, and attempt to discover what a rational jury must have determined."
1989.88-6025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.535,2419.482,Did the government go through this record and show that... that what you wanted to offer this evidence for hadn't been determined in the prior trial?
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2419.482,2430.41,"--Your Honor, the government rested on the explanation of the assistant, who was a second-hand hearsay explanation of what he understood had been the case in the prior trial, but there's no--"
1989.88-6025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.41,2435.836,But I take it your position is he didn't need to explain at all; that the other side had the burden?
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2435.836,2436.965,--That's correct.
1989.88-6025,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.345,2450.475,I see.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2452.207,2466.216,"The difference in the burdens of proof and the fact that under the rules of evidence, a judgement is an all-or-nothing proposition; it either forecloses the evidence when the conditions for collateral estoppel are present, or it has no place at all in the trial if it doesn't reach that level."
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.189,2753.067,"No, but Mr. Nightingale, isn't it a little more significant than... with the double jeopardy clause and all the rest... than a normal collateral estoppel situation, because the defendant does have certain benefits out of an acquittal."
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2785.553,2800.86,"The... the burden of relitigating, I submit, if collateral estoppel permits relitigation in a civil or criminal proceeding, the burden is essentially the same, in terms of trial time and so forth."
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.963,2872.791,"Well, implicitly they were asked to make that finding, because they were asked to determine that the same person did both... both robberies or both crimes, and that this is the guy."
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2876.922,2885.947,"Well, they were being asked to determine how credible Mrs. Henry's testimony and what probative value it had with respect to the identity of the bank robber."
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2885.947,2886.258,Right.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2886.258,2892.204,"But, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, there wasn't even proof of a crime as such."
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2906.052,2911.428,Limited to the fact that he was in her house with a mask and carrying a gun and wanted to get some money that he thought he was entitled to.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2913.599,2914.688,"--Your Honor, compared to the proffer--"
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2914.688,2915.149,Yeah.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2915.149,2932.021,"--compared to the proffer that the government made in arguing the admissability of the evidence, which involved proof that there was a shot expended, I believe that there was a conscientious effort made here to limit the testimony."
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2935.792,2936.543,I understand.
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2936.543,2939.905,--it was evidence which bore on the identity of the bank robber.
1989.88-6025,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2939.905,2949.903,"It bore on the identity of the bank robber, if this is the fellow that was in her home at that time."
1989.88-6025,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2949.903,2950.975,That's true.
1989.88-6025,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3103.69,3105.523,"Thank you, Mr. Nightingale."
1989.88-6025,2,40588,robert_l_tucker,,3107.816,3108.417,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-6025,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3151.949,3155.482,Because the answer to that is the double jeopardy clause prohibit it's... prohibits it.
1989.88-6025,2,40588,robert_l_tucker,,3155.482,3157.913,--And we suggest the same thing applies here.
1989.88-6025,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3158.564,3159.964,"Yeah, but the language isn't quite the same."
1989.88-6025,2,40588,robert_l_tucker,,3159.964,3175.815,--We would... the courts that have applied Ashe v. Swenson to this situation have basically said that there's really no principle of distinction between Ashe v. Swenson and the situation presented by the admissability of acquitted conduct evidence in a subsequent trial.
1989.88-6025,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3369.667,3371.17,"Thank you, Mr. Tucker."
