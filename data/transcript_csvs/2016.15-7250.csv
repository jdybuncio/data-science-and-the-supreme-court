2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.135,"We'll hear argument next in Case No. 15-7250, Manrique v. United States. Mr. Rashkind."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,8.135,34.735,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A single notice of appeal perfects the criminal -- the appeal of a criminal judgment and sentence even if a part of that sentence is deferred. It doesn't matter whether the appeal is first noticed at the completion, after restitution is decided, or if the appeal is noticed at the outset, after the initial sentencing hearing."
2016.15-7250,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,113.99,131.235,"What about 3(c), which requires the notice of appeal to designate the judgment order or part thereof being appealed? So a notice of appeal can't designate an order that has not yet been made."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,131.235,135.92,"That's correct, yet it's not entirely correct."
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,184.59,193.875,How do you tell the difference between one judgment and an amended judgment? Are you suggesting you don't have to appeal from an amended judgment?
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,193.875,195.06,That's correct.
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,217.43,231.795,"So what happens if your initial appeal ends before the restitution order is actually entered? Have you lost your right to appeal that second, that restitution order?"
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,231.795,234.295,"No, for the following reason, Your Honor."
2016.15-7250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,254.53,256.735,At the outset right after sentencing?
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,256.735,257.3,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-7250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.3,257.815,Okay.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,257.815,261.51,"Right after sentencing, or again after restitution."
2016.15-7250,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,294.28,294.99,Mr. Rashkind --
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,294.99,298.465,Well -- go ahead.
2016.15-7250,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,298.465,315.6,"Mr. Rashkind, as I hear you now, you're saying something different from what I understood your brief to be saying, so maybe I just -- I understood your brief to be principally arguing that this was a consequence of Rule 4(b)(2), and so far, I haven't heard you mention Rule 4(b)(2)"
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,342.87,344.475,I'm really making both.
2016.15-7250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,415.68,441.48,"In your view, if you have ordered an entry of a conviction based on jury verdict, fixing sentence, order of restitution, amount to be determined within 60 days, can you wait 60 days to appeal everything? Or must you file the first notice of appeal within 14 days as to the sentence and the order of conviction?"
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,441.48,449.37,"No, I think you -- certainly, I believe that that was the natural progression; you waited until the completion of the full judgment in sentencing."
2016.15-7250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.37,454.105,You -- you can now wait until the order of restitution before you appeal the sentence and the order of conviction?
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,454.105,457.53,You -- you can -- you can wait until restitution is completed to do that.
2016.15-7250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,457.53,461.615,"Do you understand the government to take that same position? I can ask the government, but..."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,461.615,465.785,I'm not sure that we've -- we've actually briefed it in that very way.
2016.15-7250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,487.14,488.07,"No, no."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,502.5,503.505,Yes.
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,514.57,517.27,"Well, it -- conceptually, at least, that seems odd."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,523.26,523.485,Right.
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,523.485,527.375,"And you say you can appeal that, even though it's not complete."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,539.595,548.395,"Although it may seem like that conceptually, that's precisely what the Court confronted in Corey, precisely what the court looked at in Corey."
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,574.48,590.815,"I'm not challenging your reading of the case, but, I mean, that's a very unusual type of approach when it comes to jurisdictional rules, you know, final enough, you know, and then you get other cases, are they final -- like this one: Is this final enough or not."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,623.49,630.48,"Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the court of appeals never knows what the parties will be arguing in their briefs until they are filed."
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,630.48,630.6,"No, no."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,654.14,662.175,"As a practical matter, it has not been confusing at all to the courts of appeal, which have been -- who have been struggling with this, both before Dolan and after."
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,683.61,693.105,So does the Eleventh Circuit routinely hold their appeals until the restitution transcript is available?
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,693.105,698.475,"At one time, at one time, the Eleventh Circuit actually took the position it had to wait."
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,704.095,705.29,But it waited here.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,706.44,707.39,Because it does wait.
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,718.565,723.245,"Well, I just asked whether they did it routinely, and you said not post-Dolan. So what do they do now?"
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,723.245,727.895,"They do it, but I was saying before, they did it because to them, it was a jurisdictional issue."
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,730.27,730.845,But they still did.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,734.32,735.22,That's correct.
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,735.22,736.66,But they're holding it anyway.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,736.66,738.03,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,738.03,740.395,Do they give up holding it if you ask them to give it up?
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,740.395,752.26,"It -- it doesn't require a true holding, because if we count the days it takes an appeal to go forward, there's 14 days to file a notice of appeal, 14 more to order the transcript, 30 more for the transcripts to come in and --"
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,752.26,752.66,"No, no, no."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,763.365,773.38,"The Eleventh Circuit, as every other circuit, has awaited the outcome of the restitution orders, the restitution answer, before it goes forward to decide the appeal."
2016.15-7250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,825.46,829.9,"Well, I'm not so sure. You're adding at least 90 days under your rule."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,843.37,852.24,"It is not insubstantial, but it is -- it is three months, 7.6 months shorter than the average appeal."
2016.15-7250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,854.91,856.29,The average appeal is too long.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,858.095,861.55,"Well, I don't think -- Your Honor, I would submit you're not adding 90 days."
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,910.725,917.385,"Counsel, you've been talking about how it works, or how you think it should have, but not any statutory reasons."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,943.17,945.94,"That is our argument, Your Honor, that it is."
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,970.425,976.525,"Well, but -- so you're saying the rule doesn't apply, what I understood to be the typical situation when it applies?"
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,976.525,976.85,It --
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,976.85,983.165,"The court announces a decision, you file the -- the notice of appeal, and then they get around to entering it in a couple of days?"
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,983.165,984.695,It does apply.
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1008.96,1013.2,So he hasn't entered a judgment with respect to the amount of restitution.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1013.2,1014.155,That's correct.
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1023.97,1032.675,"But he also hasn't -- he also hasn't announced a decision, and this rule applies to a notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1032.675,1033.35,He has --
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1033.35,1038.075,"With respect to the subsequent order, that -- nothing about the amount has been announced yet."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1038.075,1056.365,"He has announced it in the same way, for example, that the announcement was made in Corey, Behrens, and Firstier. If I may explain: When he says restitution is mandatory, that's like the judge saying in a -- in a bench statement in Firstier Mortgage, I'm going to grant summary judgment."
2016.15-7250,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1087.49,1090.8,But the bottom line was summary judgment.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1097.225,1100.14,"The details, the amount have not been fleshed out."
2016.15-7250,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1104.18,1109.22,But there might not be an appeal when the defendant knows what the amount is.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1123.06,1132.13,"I think that's correct, but that's always correct that no one knows for sure what issues will be raised by the appellant until the brief is written."
2016.15-7250,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1132.13,1149.81,"Did I understand you, Mr. Rashkind, to say earlier that you think you would have an argument even if 4(b)(2) didn't exist? In other words, and another way to say this is suppose we think that 4(b)(2) deals with a different situation from the situation that you're talking about."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1151.36,1151.57,Yes.
2016.15-7250,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1151.57,1153.17,-- or is it dependent on 4(b)(2)?
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1153.17,1154.005,"Yes, we do."
2016.15-7250,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1154.005,1156.97,What's -- what's the argument that's exclusive of 4(b)(2)?
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1156.97,1184.03,"The argument boils down to this: In reading 4(b), there is not a single instance under the Federal rules regarding criminal appeals in which two notices of appeal are required in a single appeal. Every single time the rules drafted encountered the possibility that two notices of appeal might be required, they immediately rewrote the rules to avoid that possibility."
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1206.06,1211.26,"Well, but it's addressed specific instances, as you say, in which the issue may come up."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1213.425,1214.24,It has not.
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1214.24,1216.02,So I -- and it's one of those arguments.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1222.855,1223.46,Part of that --
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1223.46,1225.33,So maybe it doesn't apply in that situation.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1225.33,1227.51,Part of that I think is a matter of timing.
2016.15-7250,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1245.25,1249.61,"That might be true, but still, aren't we to wait until Congress fixes it?"
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1249.61,1250.55,"Well, the rule --"
2016.15-7250,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1250.55,1253.75,"Presumably, Congress sees problems; Congress fixes problems."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1267.35,1272.535,If I may suggest why I think -- I think it would not be Congress so much as the rules' drafters.
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1303.075,1319.075,So what's the legal principle that gives us the authority to create this exception? Let's assume we -- we agree with you that the rules don't cover this particular situation.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1337.12,1349.05,The power is in the rules. The Court decided decades ago that the rules would tell lawyers how to proceed in litigation.
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1436.74,1444.075,"So isn't it easy and not a trap for us just to simply say, file two notices of appeal? That's what the government says."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1454.515,1459.12,"I think a fair answer to that is, of course the court could have such a process."
2016.15-7250,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1468.58,1469.03,"No, no."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1472.825,1476.095,"Well, there are -- there's one that requires it."
2016.15-7250,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1500.405,1501.26,"Well, right."
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1533.23,1536.905,"I think my answer to that is, although that may be intuitive --"
2016.15-7250,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.905,1537.36,Yeah.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1537.36,1540.659,-- the rules don't require lawyers to use their intuition.
2016.15-7250,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1540.659,1542.29,But the rule says --
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1542.29,1543.77,The rule says to follow the rules.
2016.15-7250,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1543.77,1545.47,You're just being literal in the rule.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1557.235,1562.97,"And in this case, it would be from the judgment, because there really are no appeals of right by a defendant from an order."
2016.15-7250,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1562.97,1564.68,From the judgment.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1580.91,1587.535,My response is that that is not the mechanical formulation that the Court provided in Dolan.
2016.15-7250,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1591.28,1592.36,Dolan didn't --
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1592.36,1593.13,-- wrestled with --
2016.15-7250,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1593.13,1594.63,I know whether it answered the question.
2016.15-7250,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1605.94,1612.185,It would be the first time in which two notices of appeal are required in a criminal case.
2016.15-7250,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1633.005,1643.425,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kedem."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1643.425,1655.93,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A criminal defendant may appeal an award of restitution by filing a notice of appeal after the amount is determined and entered against him in the form of a criminal judgment."
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1676.08,1689.49,"May I ask about the criminal rule -- what number is it? -- 32, the provision that says, ""Appealing a sentence."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1697.28,1698.035,That's correct.
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1698.035,1703.95,And Defendant was so advised after the sentence was issued.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1711.88,1713.085,That's correct.
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1713.085,1727.785,So what is your position on whether the Court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the restitution order?
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1727.785,1729.365,"Absolutely, it must."
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1737.19,1738.88,But it didn't happen in this case.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1738.88,1739.44,That's correct.
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1739.44,1743.76,So the Court committed an error and it wasn't harmless.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1743.76,1758.515,"Well, the way the Court has addressed those sorts of errors -- and this was discussed in the Peguero case, which is cited in a footnote to our brief -- is to ask whether the litigant was aware of their opportunity to appeal."
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1766.17,1774.36,"I think in Mr. Rashkind's reply brief, he represents that there was no awareness of the opportunity to appeal."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1818.93,1823.965,"Well, with respect to this Petitioner, I think that that's true."
2016.15-7250,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1832.13,1835.105,So would we find this to be a Rule 32 error?
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1835.105,1835.835,Pardon?
2016.15-7250,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1835.835,1838.41,Why don't we just say this was a Rule 32 error?
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1838.41,1850.33,"If you're talking about harmless error, I think the types of errors that are cognizable under -- I think it's Federal Criminal Rule 52, whether you're talking about harmless errors or --"
2016.15-7250,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1850.33,1852.48,I'm talking about a Rule 32 error.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1852.48,1857.52,I see. Rule 32 errors are dealt with in the manner that was discussed in Peguero.
2016.15-7250,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1870.835,1898.34,"Other than making a Supreme Court case of this issue, given the practices in the Eleventh Circuit where the Court automatically appears to wait for the restitution transcript to come and for these issues to be litigated once -- I'm not going to talk about whether that's efficient or not. They've chosen it to be efficient."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1911.91,1913.41,Not to my knowledge.
2016.15-7250,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1923.53,1923.875,It's just --
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1923.875,1924.37,And I can't --
2016.15-7250,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1924.37,1926.745,-- such a hybrid situation.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1939.745,1940.25,Well --
2016.15-7250,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1940.25,1941.6,So why in this case?
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1941.6,1972.5,"Well, in the Eleventh Circuit, the Court had decided in a case called Muzio -- and that happened in -- I believe it was July of 2014, so before the restitution hearing, but not much before it -- that a criminal defendant in Petitioner's situation had two options: They could either file a notice of appeal after the initial sentencing and then a second notice of appeal after restitution was ordered, or they could wait until the end and file one notice of appeal after restitution."
2016.15-7250,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2022.88,2035.945,"Either in the rules themselves or in the colloquy that takes place in the criminal system, is the restitution part of the sentence?"
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2035.945,2038.28,Restitution is certainly part of the sentence.
2016.15-7250,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2038.28,2043.37,So that Rule 32(b) that Justice Ginsburg quotes is applicable.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2045.94,2046.855,That's correct.
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2065.895,2074.08,"Then why -- why -- you -- I think you answered this, but I didn't grasp what the answer was. The -- the judge makes a mistake."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2088.165,2113.9,"So the Court addressed this in the Peguero case and talked about a situation in which a notice of appeal was not filed, and the Court denied -- advised the defendant to file a notice of appeal and there's a proper procedure that you have to go through and the type of prejudice that you're talking about has to depend in part on the State of knowledge of the criminal defendant and his attorney. But if I could, more directly --"
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2113.9,2119.015,"Well, but if they don't have knowledge, which is what we're assuming here because that was alleged --"
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2119.015,2121.54,So I'm not sure it actually was alleged.
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2138.78,2167.04,"But here, in fact, when the restitution judgment was entered, the clerk of the district court sent that order to the court of appeals. So it was an amended judgment that was sent. The -- the clerk of the court treated it as though it were an amendment to the judgment, and it went to the court of appeals."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2183.355,2215.925,"There's certainly some amount of formalism, but let me explain why I don't think that it's just formalism. The general principle that you can't appeal a decision that hasn't been made I think makes sense and is not only consistent with the rules, but also with the -- the way things normally work in litigation. Let me give you three examples of cases in which you actually would need a second notice of appeal in a criminal case. The first is a motion under Rule 35(a) of the criminal rules to correct a sentence."
2016.15-7250,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2287.08,2296.085,"Under your approach then, if there are four different victims and you -- and the court has seriatim hearings and makes seriatim judgments, there has to be four different notices of appeal?"
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2296.085,2300.41,I'm not aware of any scenario in which a court with respect to --
2016.15-7250,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2300.41,2301.36,That's my hypothetical.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2301.36,2301.66,Sure.
2016.15-7250,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2355.495,2369.15,"The issue here strikes me as -- as somewhat similar to the issue that arises in the civil context with respect to attorneys' fees. You have a judgment and you're entitled to attorneys' fees because you've won, but of course they don't know what those are yet."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2374.58,2377.17,The rule there is you have to file a second notice of appeal.
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2405.865,2412.855,"In the civil context, am I right that sometimes you file a second notice of appeal but you're -- the rules waive fees?"
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2412.855,2413.69,That's correct.
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2413.69,2417.43,"But not here? I mean, it's a little bit odd."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2424.92,2431.05,"Well, fees would not be raised -- would not be waived in the specific scenario that the Chief Justice posited."
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2457.95,2471.435,"You're recognizing that he could file -- you could treat as an amended notice of appeal, so it's one notice of appeal but it's been amended."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2471.435,2511.78,"I think you have to take a step to amend the notice of appeal, because, Justice Ginsburg, as you yourself pointed out, Appellate Rule 3(c)(1)(b) requires the notice of appeal to identify the judgment being appealed, and if you want to see the notice of appeal that Petitioner filed, I would direct you to page 42 of the joint appendix where he states very specifically that he is seeking appeal, quote, ""From the final judgment and sentence entered in this action on the 24th day of June, 2014."" So the -- he's seeking review of the judgment that did not include restitution."
2016.15-7250,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2511.78,2527.495,"Counsel, the Peguero case, I -- do you read that as saying that if there is prejudice to the defendant who wasn't advised of his right to appeal, that defendant is entitled to collateral relief?"
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2527.495,2529.13,I do read it that way.
2016.15-7250,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2529.13,2535.44,"And I suppose the collateral relief is what, reopening the -- the case so that he can file a notice of appeal?"
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2535.44,2574.025,"I think in that case, if you're talking about a case that's cognizable on 2255, I think the remedy could be re-entry of the judgment to give him another opportunity to file his notice of appeal. If I could briefly return just to the Rule 4(b)(2) argument, because I think the text of that rule explains why it is that it doesn't apply to this case. 4(b)(2) refers to entry -- announcement of a sentence followed by entry of the judgment, which I think makes clear that you're talking about precisely the same judgment that was just announced."
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2609.125,2623.94,Why couldn't you treat a notice of appeal as adequate to cover modifications of the judgment from which the appeal is taken? Because that's what this is.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2628.07,2633.62,I think that would be inconsistent with a few existing appellate rules of procedure.
2016.15-7250,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2682.585,2689.795,"You said -- I'm not going to get the phrase right -- jurisdiction over all of the elements of the appeal, or something like that?"
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2689.795,2690.29,That's right.
2016.15-7250,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2692.17,2693.255,Right.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2706.155,2706.49,Sure.
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2784.725,2785.585,Mr. --
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2785.585,2786.38,Yep.
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2786.38,2787.69,Where were you going?
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2787.69,2790.14,"I was going to Rule 52, but I'm happy to --"
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2790.14,2792.9,"Well, maybe this would be a good segue."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2804.57,2805.88,Not in the criminal context.
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2805.88,2806.1,Okay.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2808.12,2808.38,That's right.
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2808.38,2813.93,"-- because you objected. But in the criminal context, that's a non-jurisdictional rule."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2815.58,2816.07,That's right.
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2816.07,2831.89,"Is that correct? And are there requirements as to what counts as a notice of appeal? In other words, suppose I'm a defendant and I miss my 14 days, I don't file a notice of appeal within that time."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2834.16,2834.675,Uh-huh.
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2834.675,2836.9,Does the brief count as a notice of appeal?
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2836.9,2837.34,Yes.
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2841.74,2843.155,In certain situations?
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2843.155,2852.43,"Well, the case -- there's a specific Supreme Court case, the name of which escapes me at the moment, but the Court dealt with it in a pro se situation."
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2857.19,2857.48,Okay.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2870.775,2871.375,That's correct.
2016.15-7250,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2871.375,2872.55,Okay.
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2872.55,2888.71,I would also point out that there's a rule that also allows district courts -- and this is Appellate Rule 4(B)(4) -- to extend by 30 days the deadline for filing a notice of appeal so long as you can show reasonable -- reasonable diligence or good cause.
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2918.4,2928.19,"Why -- why isn't the judge's failure to give the necessary advice, why doesn't that come under Rule 52?"
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2928.19,2936.665,"Well, I'm not sure that the relief that Petitioner is asking for here is a correction for that error."
2016.15-7250,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2942.915,2961.59,"Well, that seems to -- to have another -- yet another proceeding, a 2255, instead of saying, well, the judge forgot to give them the -- the advice, so that was a harmful error."
2016.15-7250,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2961.59,2980.62,"I think, Justice Ginsburg, that would be inconsistent with the way the Court has conceived of its mandatory claim processing rules, in which it has said consistently that a party's failure to comply with such a rule, so long as it's invoked by the other side at the appropriate time, means that dismissal of the claim is mandatory."
2016.15-7250,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3036.044,3041.305,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rashkind, you have three minutes remaining."
2016.15-7250,2,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,3041.305,3056.13,"Thank you, Your Honor. If I may begin with the last point, the reason Rule 3(a)(2) makes the statement it does is because in the civil context, the timeliness, the temporal limits on a notice of appeal, are jurisdictional."
2016.15-7250,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3084.75,3093.53,"So is the government right, however, that the Eleventh Circuit had issued a decision telling you to file a second notice of appeal? Telling the public, not you personally."
2016.15-7250,2,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,3093.53,3095.7,"Well, I disagree that that's what happened."
2016.15-7250,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3150.055,3150.89,What is the --
2016.15-7250,2,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,3150.89,3151.41,The point of the rule --
2016.15-7250,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3151.41,3157.59,Sorry to interrupt you. What is the citation for the case that's not relevant in -- (Laughter.)
2016.15-7250,2,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,3157.59,3164.81,Muzio is -- Muzio is discussed throughout the Manrique decision.
2016.15-7250,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3166.87,3167.445,Okay.
2016.15-7250,2,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,3167.445,3168.18,-- 757 F.3d 1243.
2016.15-7250,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3168.18,3168.38,Okay.
2016.15-7250,2,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,3169.56,3178.665,So I don't think it's fair to say that lawyers were on notice.
2016.15-7250,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3222.645,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
