1993.93-289,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.037,"We'll hear argument now in No. 93-289, John H. Dalton v. Arlen Specter."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,9.356,17.434,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-289,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.227,154.354,"General Days, I would like to ask you what your position is as to the role of the President in this scheme?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,164.339,164.88,That's correct.
1993.93-289,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.96,167.481,All right.
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,173.445,174.026,He does not.
1993.93-289,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.288,176.898,Could the President do that?
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,184.084,186.684,--There is nothing in the statute that would prevent that.
1993.93-289,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.971,199.752,"But in your view, not obligated to review procedurally."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,199.752,202.393,"No, he is not obligated under the terms of the statute."
1993.93-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.393,208.508,Is the Commission subject to the President's direction in any respect?
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,214.932,219.417,There is nothing in the statute that reflects that power on the part of the President.
1993.93-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,266.246,277.483,"General Days, the normal presumption is that legislation and its operation will be subject to judicial review."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,291.622,293.645,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-289,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.009,358.537,"Well, might this be different, General Days, if some sort of individual rights in the traditional sense were involved, as they don't seem to be here?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,358.537,361.627,"Certainly, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1993.93-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,411.242,419.567,"So you didn't put it this way, but basically you're saying this is just a pact, a kind of a modus vivendi between the two political branches."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,419.567,422.869,"That's correct, Justice Souter."
1993.93-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,481.589,493.216,"That's a different response than the one that you gave earlier, that judicial review is out of the ballpark because of national... because national security is involved because these are military bases."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,505.914,508.906,"--Justice Ginsburg, I don't think my responses are inconsistent."
1993.93-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.379,537.426,--Can you conceive of any procedural irregularity so gross as to invalidate the Commission's findings?
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,537.426,554.109,"Justice Kennedy, one pauses when posed a question like yours, but I think that given the structure of the Act and given the history and purpose, there would be no violation that would rise to the level of judicial review or trigger judicial review."
1993.93-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,555.111,555.421,So if--
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,555.421,556.603,--That would be dealt with by the Congress.
1993.93-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,556.603,561.465,"--If the Commission issued a report in 1994, which it's not authorized to do."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,561.465,562.317,That's correct.
1993.93-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,562.317,575.583,"And the President acted... transmitted the list, that would be a... and the Congress refused to act to upset that determination, those bases could be closed without interference from the courts?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,575.583,577.236,"That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.787,617.11,"Mr. Day, at what point in the process would you say that Congress would have the best opportunity to express its concern about procedural shortcomings that are at issue in this case?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,617.11,623.435,"It could do so at the point where it can vote out, enact a Joint Resolution of Disapproval."
1993.93-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,623.435,626.497,"That would be the point at which you'd expect them to react, if at all?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,626.497,627.218,That's correct.
1993.93-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,628.158,629.279,"Of course, Mr.--"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,629.279,629.61,--Yes.
1993.93-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,629.61,631.35,--Senator Specter says they don't have time to do that.
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,644.159,645.791,"Justice Souter, I don't think that's correct."
1993.93-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.576,671.877,"General Days, you could say that about any arbitrary or capricious executive action."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,680.773,681.985,That's correct.
1993.93-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.985,682.526,And be signed by the President.
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,682.526,683.765,Yes.
1993.93-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.765,688.54,So why is this any different from any... any other instance of executive arbitrariness?
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,697.697,698.108,Yes.
1993.93-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,698.108,699.696,If there was any.
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,699.696,701.028,"I understand that, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.044,726.575,"Well, he doesn't really have to."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,735.05,747.228,"Justice Scalia, I think this is a risk that Congress felt it was prepared to take, given the problems that the President and Congress had encountered in the past in dealing with the whole base closure issue."
1993.93-289,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,768.232,778.659,"General Days, in this statute where Congress may, if it disapproves, pass a joint resolution, would that Joint Resolution of Disapproval have to be signed by the President?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,778.659,782.441,"Yes, it would, it would have to accord with the presentment clause of the Constitution."
1993.93-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,782.441,787.894,Does that go for everything now?
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,796.349,802.443,"Justice Ginsburg, it's our understanding, and it was the contemplation of Congress, that this would go through the presentment process."
1993.93-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,802.443,803.174,--And that everything--
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,803.174,804.564,And the charter would dictate that.
1993.93-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,804.564,809.75,"--That everything... that you could no longer have anything, you think, even the Federal rules procedure?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,809.75,819.494,"Well, I think that's a different scheme, Justice Ginsburg, but in this particular case we're talking about an enactment by the Congress, by the entire Congress."
1993.93-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,819.494,820.295,I didn't want to distract you.
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,820.295,822.786,"Well, no, it's certainly an interesting question."
1993.93-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.786,824.598,General Days.
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,824.598,825.398,Yes.
1993.93-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.398,827.781,Would you refresh my recollection on something?
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,831.762,832.703,"No, it has not."
1993.93-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,864.414,866.544,The court of appeals didn't stay... didn't enter any kind of a--
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,866.544,869.726,"No, there is no stay in this particular case."
1993.93-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,914.867,924.784,"--Well, they do... for the activity, the actions of the executive and the legislative branches, they don't, for purposes of judicial review, do they?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,924.784,926.875,--No.
1993.93-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,927.416,928.666,"Oh, you're not... maybe I misunderstood you."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,938.714,943.414,"--No, I'm... that is a problem because if the Secretary--"
1993.93-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,943.414,944.366,"That's not your argument, is it?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,944.366,956.895,"--Well, my argument, Justice Souter, is that when the Secretary of Defense determines that certain bases need to be closed, the Commission makes the recommendation and the President approves."
1993.93-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,960.956,962.308,"Oh, no, I understand that."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,962.308,962.618,Yes.
1993.93-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,962.618,982.78,"But my only point was you're not arguing that if this Court sustains judicial review and if the... an order is entered which will terminate the closure proceedings for Philadelphia, that that's going to affect the closure of every other base that was on the same list with Philadelphia."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,982.78,985.683,"Not necessarily, but they are interrelated."
1993.93-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,986.745,988.324,But there's no... they're not subject to any challenge.
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,989.486,998.783,"--No one's brought a suit, but I think what this lawsuit reflects is one of potentially 82 lawsuits."
1993.93-289,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1016.174,1031.992,"Well, isn't it true also, General Days, that the Commission, in debating the 1993 closings, assumed that the Philadelphia yard was going to be closed, and in... perhaps relied on that in making its decisions as to 1993 closings?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1031.992,1034.654,"That's precisely correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1993.93-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.654,1036.787,"But I must confess, I'm... I must say I'm confused."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1039.078,1039.407,Yes.
1993.93-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.407,1042.57,And certainly the President has to take it as a lump and the Congress has to.
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1048.895,1050.476,That's correct.
1993.93-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.479,1055.989,So that nobody accepted--
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1055.989,1067.848,"--Of one of those pieces of the puzzle in the entire puzzle, and the question would be the impact of that particular determination in favor of the respondents upon the entire list or, indeed, subsequent list."
1993.93-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1067.848,1082.816,"--Well, I might have thought your argument would have been that if we were to permit judicial review, that one possibility is that the district court would have to throw out the entire list in order to be consistent with the statutory scheme."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1082.816,1083.548,"Well, throw out the--"
1993.93-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1083.548,1088.322,Or resort to a si prius doctrine and just save the Philadelphia base.
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1088.322,1104.231,"--Well, it might require a court to throw out the '91 list, the '93 list, and direct the '95 Commission that it would have to carry out its responsibilities without any dependence on the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard being included in that closure process."
1993.93-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1104.231,1112.717,"Well, if we can retreat just a minute from that parade of horribles, let's again assume that we find that there is judicial review."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1112.717,1113.137,Yes.
1993.93-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1113.137,1115.15,That the APA review applies.
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1139.564,1141.535,"I would think not, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1152.674,1153.844,"Well, suppose you want to observe... suppose you want to observe the public hearing?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1153.844,1173.848,"--Well, perhaps there would be a right to go into court to claim that the agency was withholding a right pursuant to the APA or pursuant to the statute, that individuals would be entitled to, but it certainly wouldn't be final agency action under the APA."
1993.93-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.848,1176.44,Can I ask--
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1176.44,1181.543,So it would be wrongly withheld action under the APA by the agency.
1993.93-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1181.543,1200.555,"--General Days, I frankly don't see why your case is any stronger than a case in which the same scheme were set up but it did not say at the end that when the President approves it, he sends it, transmits it to the Hill, and the Hill has 45 days to overturn it."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1220.609,1221.718,That's correct.
1993.93-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.718,1231.255,So what do you gain from the fact that this is a scheme in which he formally had to place it before Congress?
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1235.018,1248.685,"Well, we think this case is controlled by this Court's decision in Franklin v. Massachusetts, that what we have here, apart from the fact that the President wasn't named as a defendant, is basically an effort to get courts to review presidential action."
1993.93-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.749,1315.832,I agree it's important that the President is involved.
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1327.028,1327.588,Yes.
1993.93-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.588,1335.974,"I'm not sure there's any difference between that and this scheme where it says not just 45 days from now, but within those 45 days I'm leaving it on the floor of Congress."
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1335.974,1336.572,Yes.
1993.93-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1377.85,1386.788,"But why doesn't that cut the other way, General Days, that they noticed that NEPA could slow things down, so they made an exception for it, but they didn't make an across-the-board exception?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1386.788,1393.271,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that the NEPA exception doesn't go so much to the question of judicial review."
1993.93-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1427.384,1446.495,"Is it your position with respect to the significance of the express provision for congressional disapproval that it's sort of affirmative evidence that Congress would engage in a review, and hence affirmative evidence, one more bit of evidence for you that that's where the review was to take place and not somewhere else?"
1993.93-289,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1446.495,1466.38,"Yes, Justice Souter, I think that, in sum, this case is really about an effort on the part of the respondents to substitute judicial cherry-picking for legislative and executive cherry-picking, which was a major concern of both Congress and the President when they enacted the 1990 legislation."
1993.93-289,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1468.521,1470.482,"Very well, General Days."
1993.93-289,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1472.194,1476.146,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1533.453,1535.223,"Senator Specter, let me just, if I may, interrupt you."
1993.93-289,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1547.071,1549.874,"--No, Mr. Justice Stevens, it would not be."
1993.93-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.601,1576.199,"Well, then let me ask you, just to be sure I understand the position, you do agree, do you not, that if the President were... found there were procedural shortcomings as to Philadelphia and no other base, he would not have the authority to say I will close everything except the Philadelphia base?"
1993.93-289,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1576.199,1585.786,"Justice Stevens, he could have sent the list back and raised an issue, but it's a practical impossibility in 10 days to take a look at 72 bases."
1993.93-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.482,1624.091,"No, but the point I want to be sure I understand your position on, Senator, is that if I understand you correctly, the Congress could not say because of the procedural violations involving Philadelphia, we will approve the entire package except Philadelphia."
1993.93-289,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1630.326,1634.49,--The Congress could not say the Philadelphia base is excluded.
1993.93-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1677.998,1678.998,"Senator, if Congress--"
1993.93-289,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1689.505,1690.975,"Correct, Justice Stevens."
1993.93-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.975,1691.425,Okay.
1993.93-289,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1691.425,1703.453,"It is a particularly, peculiarly judicial function, and when you say that there may be an interference with all the other bases, that's a question for the court on a remedy."
1993.93-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1703.453,1704.585,"Senator, I don't agree with that."
1993.93-289,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1725.459,1727.97,"Justice Scalia, Congress, as the lawmaker, may do that."
1993.93-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.97,1728.371,Anything at all.
1993.93-289,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1728.371,1733.733,"But within the confines of the Base Closure Act, that was not contemplated."
1993.93-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.895,1741.808,"It wasn't contemplated, but the Base Closure Act calls for a joint resolution and Congress can do anything it wants by a joint resolution so long as it's constitutional?"
1993.93-289,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1741.808,1746.502,"--Well, not the joint resolution, Justice Scalia, which is called for by the Act."
1993.93-289,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1784.589,1798.378,"Well, I think the procedures that Congress would go through for a joint resolution under this Act might be quite different and a good deal speedier than introducing a brand new piece of legislation and having it go through committee."
1993.93-289,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1798.378,1808.532,"--Chief Justice Rehnquist, that's precisely the point, that the resolution of disapproval contemplated under the Act said all or nothing."

1993.93-289,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3346.384,3347.937,"Thank you, General Days."
