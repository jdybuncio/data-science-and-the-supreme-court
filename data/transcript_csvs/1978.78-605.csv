1978.78-605,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,59.486,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Rutherford.
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,61.339,64.896,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-605,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,379.188,380.771,What was the status of the respondent?
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,384.331,408.21,"That's a question for which I haven't good answer if the Court please of the Government raise the question of the jurisdiction of the court and their standing, but it was decided adversely to the Government and it its present posture, we suggest that on a remand, there probably was jurisdiction."
1978.78-605,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.016,417.772,Are these -- the respondents' alleged in their complaint that they want to use it or that they move?
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,417.772,418.165,They alleged that they wish to use it.
1978.78-605,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.165,421.207,They are not producers or sellers?
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,421.207,422.351,They are not producers.
1978.78-605,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,609.313,621.112,"Mr. Solicitor General, what evidence did the District Court have before it as a basis for a finding that this was nontoxic?"
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,621.112,630.67,"If the Court please, the District Court when it initially granted the injunction, I had no evidence before it except --"
1978.78-605,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,630.67,634.659,"But he did make a finding that it was nontoxic, did he not?"
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,639.914,650.387,"Well, the matter went back to the District Court from the administrative hearing and do I understand your inquiring about the second time the District Court looked at it the first time?"
1978.78-605,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,650.387,654.975,That wasn't clear from what I read whether it was the second time or the first time.
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,665.252,674.282,"It's my understanding that the District Court did not take evidence in this matter, but relied on the administrative record that was made."
1978.78-605,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,674.282,676.666,But he did make a finding that it was nontoxic?
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,676.666,692.945,"He made a finding when he reviewed this administrative record that I've just related, which is the next step in the proceeding and what the District Court did was to sustain the Commissioner's conclusion that Laetrile was a new drug."
1978.78-605,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.546,769.934,"Well, isn't there an additional curiosity about the District Court's constitutional holding and that he'd already found that it was covered by the grandfather clause in 1962 so it didn't have to reach that question?"
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,769.934,777.52,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we agree that it was a quite unnecessary finding for the District Court to make."
1978.78-605,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,932.137,937.326,Those last two are really questions for your opposition to propose and I --
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,937.326,938.46,"Indeed they are, but he --"
1978.78-605,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.46,939.868,And they have I take it.
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,939.868,947.31,And he's entitled to urge the Court to sustain the judgment on those alternative grounds and --
1978.78-605,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.31,948.625,And he has presented them?
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,948.625,952.873,"And he has presented them, yes sir."
1978.78-605,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1068.685,1074.345,I suppose you're done to that if it had any tendency of risk of hastening death.
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1074.345,1084.566,"And of course, if it was toxic, if it hastened death, it would be a fortiori that it would be unsafe for the terminally ill patient."
1978.78-605,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1236.404,1242.155,"General McCree, in your view, who has the burden of proof on the grandfather clause issue?"
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1242.155,1247.256,I would think the person who asserted the exemption would have the burden of proof.
1978.78-605,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1247.256,1252.48,Are there any cases that so hold?
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1252.48,1256.479,I can't think of a case it's specifically addresses that question.
1978.78-605,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.858,1426.251,Is that true if taken orally?
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1426.251,1436.827,It is certainly true taken orally and there is no adequate investigation of its consequences when taken by injection.
1978.78-605,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.827,1439.466,"So, you can't say then that it's not toxic?"
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1439.466,1441.407,You cannot say that it is not toxic.
1978.78-605,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.407,1443.382,"Well, you can't say that it is either?"
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1443.382,1444.122,That's correct.
1978.78-605,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.61,1451.015,And this Circuit's order is limited to intravenous?
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1451.015,1454.282,It is so limited and we suggest two things from that.
1978.78-605,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1647.16,1647.384,Very well.
1978.78-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.384,1650.156,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask you one question."
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1665.036,1671.292,I'm not aware that a new drug application has been filed with the FDA for that.
1978.78-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.292,1673.805,I've been told that's used for that purpose.
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1673.805,1675.096,"I've heard that, too."
1978.78-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.096,1675.736,Yes.
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1675.736,1690.726,And I think I have read too that experimental uses has been authorized and I think I read recently that someone who is authorized to use it experimentally have been arrested.
1978.78-605,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1702.381,1707.048,Had any state pass a right to that statute?
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1707.048,1708.49,I'm not aware of any right.
1978.78-605,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1708.49,1713.663,A number of such statutes had been introduced in state legislatures.
1978.78-605,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1713.663,1717.973,"I am aware of that, but I'm not aware that any state has does this."
1978.78-605,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1753.704,1757.384,Yes.
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,1760.05,1763.571,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1929.306,1932.213,"How did this case get to the District Court, Mr. Coe?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,1936.237,1936.97,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.963,1970.433,It was just an administrative.
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1970.433,1974.34,"So, it wasn't the application or administrative review under the Heinemann?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,1974.34,1981.173,"Well, yes Your Honor, I guess you had to call that."
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.173,1985.008,But it what forward just on the administrative record?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,1985.008,1986.839,"Your Honor, it's been backwards and forwards --"
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1986.839,1995.949,"Yes, but I mean as it finally got to -- finally before Judge Bohanon, it -- he proceeded on the administrative record?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,1995.949,1996.333,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.333,1997.285,No new evidence in the District Court?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,1997.285,2001.015,No new evidence was heard.
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2050.373,2053.77,You said the Administrative Procedure Act prohibits that?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2053.77,2054.498,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.498,2058.353,You say that the Administrative Procedure Act prohibits that?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2058.353,2066.091,"No, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals required that the FDA conduct the proceedings pursuant to 554 sub (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act."
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.091,2073.481,So that if you say that 554 sub (c) prohibited the sort of proceedings conducted by the Food and Drug Administration?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2073.481,2080.417,"Actually, sir that refers you to 556 which grants the right of cross-examination."
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2080.417,2088.259,"So, indirectly you say it that is -- what the FDA did here is prohibited by the Administrative Procedure Act?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2088.259,2091.706,By that and as it was espoused by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2091.706,2102.807,"Well, you know I presume the Tenth Circuit has the right to construe the statute but not to impose its own requirements."
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2102.807,2115.637,"The FDA also has proceedings in which generally speaking when a court sends a case to it for review and generally speaking, those requirements are for a more formal type of hearings."
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.941,2123.532,Is that a part of the APA?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2124.25,2139.763,"No, it's part of the regulations for the Food and Drug Act, I believe it's Section 1060 or 1080 of their procedure, left side in our brief, Your Honor."
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2183.761,2187.306,Well what's the matter with that?
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2187.306,2190.537,It just could be correct.
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2190.537,2200.886,"I mean there not just judges, they presumably have some right to decide what positions to take on things."
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2200.886,2205.922,"Your Honor, I think that that is exactly the point the judge was making."
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.635,2228.693,That they simply weren't open even to persuasion by new evidence?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2228.693,2237.063,"I believe that what the court is trying to make, Your Honor."
1978.78-605,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2269.338,2273.085,What was the evidence on its use before 1962?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2273.085,2278.797,"Your Honor, there was substantial evidence on use prior to 1962."
1978.78-605,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2282.549,2286.11,"Commercial use, commercial use and that's the requirement, isn't it?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2286.11,2289.958,"The requirement is commercial use prior to 1962, Your Honor."
1978.78-605,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2322.09,2323.747,"Well, do you need to stop to find it now?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2323.747,2329.924,"At any rate Your Honor, the District Court found that it was used prior to 1962 that was used commercially."
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2372.54,2375.984,What facts did he have before him?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2375.984,2379.131,The facts he had before him were the facts --
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.131,2382.652,"Was it administrative record, that's all?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2382.652,2384.248,That's all he had.
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2384.248,2388.111,"When you say facts, don't you mean testimony?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2388.111,2391.013,"Your Honor, in this case, I do mean testimony and --"
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.013,2408.25,"Well, what case that says -- what case that says that he looks at the administrative record droves out to finding of the administrative body and replaces it with his own?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2410.068,2411.376,"Your Honor, there is --"
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2411.376,2412.792,Isn't that what was done here?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2412.792,2413.697,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2413.697,2415.698,Isn't that what was done here?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2415.698,2418.198,That he threw out the findings and superimposed his own.
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.944,2422.126,And the authority for that.
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2422.126,2433.08,The authority for that are the cases which I've cited under that particular proposition on our brief.
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2434.46,2440.788,Where did he get the fact that the law didn't apply to terminally ill people?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2443.805,2451.0,"Well Your Honor, he didn't find anything in the record, in the record that the law did not apply to terminally ill patients because that would have been (Voice Overlap) on his part."
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2451.0,2452.771,But where did he find it?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2454.448,2463.344,"He determined -- well, as a matter of fact, I think it was the Tenth Circuit that actually made determination of such Your Honor."
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2464.027,2466.546,Where did the Tenth Circuit find it?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2466.546,2468.287,I think they found that based along --
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2468.287,2469.597,You think?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2471.792,2474.174,"Your Honor, I know in my own mind."
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2474.174,2475.501,What do you think?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2475.501,2492.504,"Alright, I think Your Honor that the Tenth Circuit found that the Act did not apply to terminally ill cancer patients because it would be ridiculous to apply the term efficacy to a terminally ill cancer patient."
1978.78-605,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2492.504,2507.072,"Why would it, aren't there pain relieving properties in some drugs that would be used on terminally ill patients?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2507.072,2513.386,"Your Honor, many of the drugs that are used on terminally ill cancer patients do in fact have pain killing effects and generally speaking --"
1978.78-605,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2513.386,2524.858,"Isn't that the function of this agency, this regulatory body to see that any pain relieving drugs are safe and meet all the other standards?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2524.858,2544.613,"It is the duty of the Food and Drug Administration to fulfill its congressional mandate, and it is our position before the Court that the congressional mandate which added efficacy in particular to the Food and Drug Act which came out after the thalidomide tragedies does not have application to terminally ill cancer patients."
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2568.063,2580.669,"Well, what about the Chief Justice's question that even the terminally ill patient may need relief from symptomatic conditions, not a cure, perhaps not even remission relief from pain."
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2580.669,2583.004,I certainly do not disagree with that.
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2584.316,2593.113,Do you think the Tenth Circuit would exempt that and say go down by a few grains of morphine if you feel you needed to relieve the pain?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2593.113,2599.484,The Tenth Circuit ruled strictly relative to Laetrile intravenous form.
1978.78-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2601.66,2603.848,What's your position on that?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2603.848,2609.373,My position as it always has been is that we have terminal cancer patients desiring to use Laetrile.
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2615.082,2619.738,And that the Food and Drug Act doesn't apply to terminal patient?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2619.738,2626.305,That it does not apply to terminally ill cancer patients designed to use Laetrile under their physician's care.
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.305,2627.054,What about Heroin?
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2627.054,2630.864,When and where do you get that from?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2633.009,2633.586,"Your Honor, the statute --"
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2633.586,2636.114,The regulations don't say it.
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2636.114,2637.182,"Oh, I certainly agree with that."
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2637.182,2641.817,"Well, did anybody see it before the Court in this case?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2641.817,2643.512,No.
1978.78-605,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2643.512,2646.17,So it's brand new?
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.17,2650.754,And you would say that same thing as -- about heroin or cocaine?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2650.754,2657.023,"It is my -- no, I do not have a heroin or cocaine case, Your Honor, so I would not discuss that at all."
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.814,2664.854,"No, but you are saying it about oral -- about Laetrile taken orally."
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2664.854,2666.791,"No, we're just discussing the intravenous --"
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2666.791,2674.3,"I know, but I thought my brother Rehnquist asked you about -- wouldn't you take the same position with respect to Laetrile taken orally?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2674.3,2675.387,I would take the same position.
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.387,2679.574,"Yes, yet the Court didn't decide that did it?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2679.574,2681.067,The Tenth Circuit did not decide that.
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.067,2693.89,"Yes, but you would take the position with respect to the oral ingestion as Laetrile but not heroin, even though it's a terminally ill cancer patient who wants it."
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2693.89,2712.468,"It is my understanding totally outside of anything I know from this case that in England, heroin and some other opiates are being used for terminally ill cancer patients and the reason it's being used is because they determine that there's nothing that can be done to help them and it will take them off some of the really mind-deadening drugs."
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.387,2716.27,"I suggest you stay with microphone, sir."
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2716.27,2716.69,I'm sorry.
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2716.69,2724.871,When you answer questions.
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2724.871,2730.583,I would like to address if I may next the constitutional aspect in this particular case.
1978.78-605,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2837.887,2847.751,"Mr. Coe, you seem to concede that the constitutional right would not exist without the doctor's supervision or do you?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2852.141,2858.778,"Your Honor, I have only argued within that context because that is within the context of the lower court's decision and outside of that, I don't think --"
1978.78-605,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2858.778,2877.076,"If you acknowledge that the state can impose a regulatory control for the safety even if the terminally ill of cancer patient by saying the doctor has to supervise it, why would not the Constitution also give the state the power to say well, certain kinds of drugs, heroin, marijuana, whatever it might be, Laetrile, cannot be use for these people."
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2884.136,2905.697,"I think it's somewhat analogous to the decision in Roe versus White in which this Court made the determination that during the first trimester of pregnancy, because of the facts and circumstances produced that there was no justification for a compelling state interest, and therefore, then abortion may be have without any interest to the state at all."
1978.78-605,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2925.741,2937.72,"Just assuming the first of my question, they had been diagnose as terminally ill by the doctor, but then the question is do they -- why did they need doctor supervision to take the drug any more than they need?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2945.361,2950.269,"Your Honor, that is a -- that was a decision rendered by the Tenth Circuit that they have to have medical care."
1978.78-605,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2965.086,2977.137,What if they live -- what if Oklahoma had a state rule that said that be a doctor be guilty of malpractice if he prescribe Laetrile because I have not been approved by the FDA?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2980.218,2981.126,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-605,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2981.126,2981.536,Yes.
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,2981.536,2994.21,"As a matter of fact, Oklahoma is one of the 19 states I believe that has now legalizing this Laetrile."
1978.78-605,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3047.332,3055.435,"Mr. Coe, at this point, you always spoken of the doctor."
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,3063.709,3078.79,"As a matter of fact, Your Honor, the District Court in one of its previous orders in which he instituted the affidavits system which is the system in which an individual to obtain Laetrile has to have an affidavit from his doctor to demonstrate the he has in fact a member of the class."
1978.78-605,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3082.281,3083.098,What is your position?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,3083.098,3091.053,And I do not -- that's my position Your Honor.
1978.78-605,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3113.882,3116.034,Is the Act to the contrary?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,3116.034,3117.111,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1978.78-605,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3117.111,3120.133,Is there a support in the Act for that?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,3120.133,3121.096,That is does not apply?
1978.78-605,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3121.096,3121.986,Yes.
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,3121.986,3129.173,There is no support in the Act itself or anything in the Act just flat out adds terms requirements for safety and efficacy.
1978.78-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3151.638,3154.237,You didn't -- this wasn't your position in the Tenth Circuit?
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,3154.237,3159.069,It was not.
1978.78-605,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3201.788,3206.673,I think the Solicitor General -- part of it was to brief as to --
1978.78-605,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3206.673,3210.008,"Mr. Coe, I have one other question, the constitutional argument."
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,3216.134,3218.947,No.
1978.78-605,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.21,3230.83,But if it's nontoxic --
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,3230.83,3231.374,I'm sorry?
1978.78-605,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.374,3236.971,"But if it's nontoxic, they don't know why it would be equally."
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,3236.971,3247.906,"I do not disagree and nor does this case disagree, nor does the lower court's opinion's disagree with the Act -- with the Food and Drug Act or the intent of it as to safety and efficacy."
1978.78-605,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3273.307,3280.921,"Of course, if it is under the 1962 grandfather clause, then it's permissible for use by anybody, isn't it?"
1978.78-605,1,33798,kenneth_ray_coe,,3280.921,3285.146,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-605,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3285.146,3285.909,Very well.
1978.78-605,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3288.88,3296.393,I just have this Mr. Chief Justice in response to Mr. Justice Blackmun's question and I was unable to give him the citation.
1978.78-605,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3325.089,3329.765,"General, I got one question or rather I need some help."
1978.78-605,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3351.972,3357.046,"I think it could, but this is a constitutional determination that it may --"
1978.78-605,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3357.046,3359.0,That's worried me.
1978.78-605,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3359.0,3360.373,"Worries me, too."
1978.78-605,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3360.373,3362.616,Okay.
1978.78-605,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3362.616,3365.812,"If it please the Court, the Government submits its case on its brief."
1978.78-605,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3365.812,3366.584,Thank you gentlemen.
