1986.86-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.974,"We will hear argument first this morning in Number 86-461, the Board of Pardons and Henry Burgess versus George Allen and Dale Jacobsen."
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,15.343,23.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,326.978,345.024,"General Smith, may I just ask, the statute certainly doesn't give them that right because it says they can't be released unless they meet the time requirement, but it says they shall be released when, in the opinion of the Board, there is reasonable probability the prisoner can be released without detriment to the prisoner or to the community."
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,348.743,373.543,"--Your Honor, under our statute once the Board of Pardons determines that the facts underlying a particular parole application are such that the release can occur consistently with the three criteria the statute specifies, then under our law the Board is required to order release."
1986.86-461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,373.543,376.561,"So, he has a right to release if those conditions are met?"
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,376.561,380.28,"If the Board determines in its discretion that those conditions are met, that is correct, sir."
1986.86-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.28,384.184,What are the three conditions?
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,384.184,405.68,The three conditions are as follows: in Subsection 1 of 36-23-201 the statute states that a prisoner shall be released on parole when in the Board's opinion such release can be effected without detriment to the prisoner or to the community.
1986.86-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,572.072,583.594,"What did the court of appeals say here, that there was an expectation but they didn't prescribe any procedures, did they?"
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,583.594,606.476,The court of appeals did not directly address the question of whether a reasonable expectation of parole release arises simply by virtue of a prisoner satisfying certain time of incarceration requirements.
1986.86-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,632.694,650.072,"And your contention is that because the second criteria is because it requires the opinion of the Board as to reasonable probability that the prisoner can be released without detriment to the community, that is sufficiently subjective so there is no reasonable expectation?"
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,650.072,658.844,The petitioner's view of the statute is that it sets forth three general criteria.
1986.86-461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,692.332,696.386,Doesn't he expect it be decided in his favor?
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,696.386,698.236,That is correct.
1986.86-461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,715.697,723.786,"Well, is it your position that... I guess the complaint here is that the Board not only didn't grant parole but it didn't say why."
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,723.786,725.655,Well--
1986.86-461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.655,728.774,And it doesn't make findings.
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,741.848,749.188,--The statute does not require the Board to make specific findings with respect to a particular parole release application.
1986.86-461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.188,754.89,Doesn't require them to write it down or to say anything to the applicant?
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,754.89,773.719,"The second claim for relief in the complaint states that the due process clause was violated, or is being violated, by the absence of an appropriate hearing process."
1986.86-461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.719,783.492,"And the Court of Appeals, I take it would, finding a liberty interest, does it dictate or did it dictate that there should be a hearing or--"
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,783.492,785.777,"No, Your Honor, it did not."
1986.86-461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.992,814.527,"--May I just be sure I understand your position, General Smith."
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,852.7,857.002,"Your Honor, I believe that question must be answered with reference to the statute itself."
1986.86-461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.844,923.994,"Well, I don't think that answers my question."
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,941.638,944.959,"That is not our position, Your Honor."
1986.86-461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.959,947.742,"Well, what is at stake here?"
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,952.93,966.79,"What is at stake here, petitioners believe, is whether any constraints are imposed upon its decision making process by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1986.86-461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.79,970.325,"--And your answer is no, there are none."
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,976.911,980.299,"That is correct, but as a matter of state law there may be certain enforceable--"
1986.86-461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.299,986.786,But you do have some duties as a matter of state law but you say they are not sufficient to impose any duties as a matter of federal law?
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,986.786,987.036,--No.
1986.86-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1006.998,1033.231,"Mr. Smith, do you take the position that Montana state law requires the state to do exactly what Greenholtz would say are the minimum requirements in any event if it were a matter of federal law; namely, an opportunity to be heard by the prisoner and to give some reasons for denial?"
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1033.231,1048.776,"It is our position that the current procedures being utilized by the Board are consistent with due process requirements, but again that is an issue which has not been litigated."
1986.86-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1048.776,1053.144,Are they consistent with the requirements espoused in the Greenholtz case?
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1065.136,1070.106,"Your Honor, I believe it does."
1986.86-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1070.106,1080.146,"So, what's at stake here is not any change whatever in Montana's procedure."
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1088.152,1090.269,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1090.269,1093.471,It wouldn't alter your handling of the cases at all?
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1093.471,1106.379,"Well, what I would state is that the respondents might disagree with my contention, and it might be a matter of substantial litigation below at the District Court level, or a protected interest to be held created by the statute."
1986.86-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1106.379,1114.052,One of the difficulties for me with this case is the very abstract proposition that's presented.
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1128.644,1143.571,"The case, of course, went to the court of appeals on dismissal of complaint for failure to state a claim, and since it was a singular discrete issue presented and that issue was the only question addressed by the court of appeals--"
1986.86-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1143.571,1146.523,But what did the plaintiffs ask for in their complaint?
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1154.093,1167.603,"--Well, the complaint is particularly skeletal in nature and did not set forth the precise kinds of procedures that the respondents believed would be appropriate under the due process clause."
1986.86-461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1206.542,1217.334,--this lawsuit seeks to compel the Board of Pardons to use proper criteria in determining a prisoner's eligibility and also when it denies parole to explain its reasons?
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1217.334,1218.618,That's right.
1986.86-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.042,1275.122,"General Smith, would you tell me precisely why you think that the discretion conferred upon your prison officials is greater and therefore the expectation of release is less in this case than it was in Greenholtz?"
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1335.427,1356.574,"Your Honor, the statutory construct in the Nebraska statute in Greenholtz stated that a prisoner shall be released unless the Nebraska Board of Parole determined that one of four statutory criteria for deferral existed."
1986.86-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.961,1393.532,"Why is that, because of the ""unless""?"
1986.86-461,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1415.879,1431.721,"The principal difference is a difference which the court of appeals has noted, is that there is under the Nebraska statute, again a presumptive right to release simply upon fulfilling certain minimum eligibility requirements under Nebraska law."
1986.86-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.825,1616.61,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1618.393,1625.465,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.552,1688.872,"What if the parole statute just says, ""You shall""... to the Board..."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1692.324,1700.18,"Justice White, that's essentially the Dumschat case, and this Court held that there was no protected interest."
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1700.18,1709.285,And even though the statute purports to order the Board to either feel like it or not to feel like it?
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1709.285,1717.725,"The statute in Dumschat, Your Honor, was essentially that, that the Connecticut Board of Pardons shall have the power to grant parole."
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.427,1723.379,"Well, in my example there is, it's when you feel like it."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1723.379,1728.247,That would be--
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.247,1729.783,A mandatory standard.
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1729.783,1731.216,--I'm sorry?
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.216,1737.805,"Isn't that a mandatory standard, you have to decide you don't feel like it?"
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1737.805,1751.879,"Your Honor, essentially your hypothetical is very similar to the way that the statute was in--"
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.879,1757.433,How about if the statute says that you grant parole whenever you feel it's in the public interest?
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1757.433,1758.799,--That's a standard.
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.657,1777.161,"The statute says, whenever in your uncontrolled discretion you decide that it's in the public interest."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1777.161,1782.131,--That would be a less favorable case than our case here.
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.237,1805.497,"What if the statute says, within two months after the filing of an application for parole you shall decide whether you feel like it or not and the Board just never... just never does anything."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1817.572,1821.689,"--And as I understand your question, the only criteria is that--"
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.689,1822.289,When you feel like it?
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1822.289,1822.673,--When you feel like it.
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.51,1833.331,"No liberty interest even though the statute says, you have to decide whether or not to grant within two months?"
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1833.331,1839.168,"Yes, I would analogize that to the Dumschat case."
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.911,1866.552,"And you are hinging your case upon the clear distinction between that, and that is do it when you feel like it, and do it only when it's in the best interests of society?"
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1866.552,1868.17,That's correct.
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.604,1871.789,That's a real limitation upon somebody's discretion?
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1871.789,1877.193,"--The statute is, as you read it, Justice Scalia, starts out by saying,"
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.466,1888.584,"""Parole shall be ordered only for the best interests of society. """
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1888.584,1890.451,That's the second restriction.
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1890.451,1893.786,And each of them as to be satisfied?
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1893.786,1895.905,And each of them has to be satisfied.
1986.86-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1895.905,1900.641,"So, it's really just a question of how the statute is phrased, in a sense."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1913.783,1916.401,"No, that would be a liberty interest."
1986.86-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1916.401,1921.722,Then any parole statute in the real world is going to confer a liberty interest?
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1921.722,1923.422,No.
1986.86-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1952.574,1959.597,"Well, of course the place to litigate that would be in the state court, whether they are failing to follow the commands of the state statute."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1959.597,1983.129,"--Under this Court's decision, particularly Hewitt versus Helms which the Chief Justice wrote for the Court, the Court has established the principle that where you have mandatory language ordering an agency that it shall or must do something, combined with a standard, a limitation that creates a federal protected liberty interest."
1986.86-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.129,1987.331,The language in Hewitt against Helms is a good deal different than the language here.
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,1995.103,1998.805,"Your Honor, there were two standards that this Court cited in Hewitt."
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.658,2042.001,"Do you remember the Schecter case, the only case in which this Court has ever struck down a delegation to executive authority on the basis that it was delegation of legislative powers?"
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2060.879,2062.446,Not under the rulings of this Court.
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.446,2071.4,"Which would mean it really is not any control over discretion at all simply to say, ""the best interests of society""?"
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2071.4,2075.138,Meaning it is a control over discretion.
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.138,2081.626,You think Schechter would have come out the other way if it had only said that the President has to act in the best interests of society?
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2081.626,2094.949,"What I am saying is that under the rulings of this Court, it is clear that as soon as you impose that kind of standard on an administrative agency and they must come to a finding that--"
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.949,2097.319,And Schechter would have come out the other way?
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2100.854,2102.29,"--Yes, it would have."
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.956,2110.777,"I thought the President had taken an oath under the Constitution to act in the best interests of society anyway, more or less."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2110.777,2117.883,--What this Court has required in administrative law is an intelligible principle.
1986.86-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2152.204,2192.412,"Well, I would have thought there might... the issue might turn on the degree to which discretion is limited, and your interpretation goes to the outer limits of that and says that virtually any language at all constitutes enough limit on discretion to trigger constitutional rights and it certainly would be reasonable to take a different view of that and say there has to be some meaningful limit to discretion before a liberty interest is triggered."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2192.412,2202.72,"Justice O'Connor, I would agree with that, and the word that I used is a word that I borrowed from Supreme Court decisions, that there has to be an intelligible principle."
1986.86-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2249.332,2254.986,"Well, then maybe we ought to have a pullman abstention here, or a certification back to the Montana courts."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2256.336,2272.031,"For the same reason that this Court went ahead in Greenholtz, because all that is necessary is to determine if there is a limitation and not how massive that limitation is, because that would immediately get this Court into interpreting state law."
1986.86-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2286.874,2292.695,"Not a meaningful limitation on discretion, just any--"
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2292.695,2298.063,"No, I would agree with Your Honor."
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.335,2308.204,"--Well, what about whenever you think the applicant deserves it?"
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2308.204,2313.958,That also would be a more difficult case than we have here.
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.958,2315.758,"I know, but is it a liberty interest or not?"
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2319.428,2321.745,"Yes, I would agree with you, it is."
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.749,2332.467,"All they have to do, though, is... they don't need to explain it to them."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2336.835,2342.906,Not unless there is a protected liberty interest.
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.496,2361.467,"A statute that just doesn't give any standards other than ""deserves""."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2364.836,2368.49,--I would say that that created a protected liberty interest.
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.21,2397.592,"Do you think a statute says, parole a fellow whenever you feel like it, but within two months you have to tell him that you've denied it and you must explain why you feel that you are not going to grant parole."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2400.092,2405.146,I would also say it is a liberty interest.
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.146,2409.383,Even though the only standard is whether you feel like it or not?
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2409.383,2413.919,Especially if you tagged on something that's very--
1986.86-461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.919,2415.035,"Yes, I did, exactly."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2415.035,2421.608,--in which you have to explain because that tells the agency that there is a requirement.
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.069,2440.652,You are creating a quite different theory of law.
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2460.864,2461.399,No.
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.399,2462.449,No?
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2462.449,2463.866,And this Court has rejected that.
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.473,2479.277,We should consult the Supreme Court of the State as to how much discretion there is.
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2482.479,2483.445,"Yes, we can."
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.445,2490.918,"The regulations say, Section 20.25.505, Criteria for Parole Grant Decisions:"
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2507.428,2511.999,"That's right, and that is appendixed to the Greenholtz decision."
1986.86-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2541.934,2544.97,"How could they have gone further than to say, any other factors?"
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2561.062,2575.12,"No, but the critical distinction, Justice Scalia, is this: the Board is allowed under this to consider everything it considers relevant, but once it reaches an opinion its discretion ends."
1986.86-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2638.312,2649.335,"Mr. Pever, if you are that confident about Montana law, why didn't you bring this action in the state court where you could have gotten a decision of the Montana Supreme Court, probably in your favor from what you have said?"
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2649.335,2662.677,"I was aware at the time that I filed this lawsuit about a previous decision from the Montana Federal District Court, the Campbell decision which was a one-paragraph decision."
1986.86-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.902,2678.77,Would the Supreme Court of Montana have been bound by the Federal District Court?
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2678.77,2683.858,"--No... well, the issue here is a federal issue."
1986.86-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2683.858,2696.732,"Well, but what you want is certain procedures or benefits for people who were denied parole, and from what you say the Montana statute would give these, quite obviously."
1986.86-461,1,41856,stephen_l_pevar,,2702.485,2709.658,"Yes, I believe that if I brought this in Montana I would get the same relief that I am hoping to get here."
1986.86-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2887.571,2889.357,"Thank you, Mr. Pevar."
1986.86-461,2,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,2892.392,2901.915,There are just three points I would like to cover in my reply argument.
1986.86-461,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2957.085,2970.225,"Is that, and any relevant reason may be used to deny or to grant parole?"
1986.86-461,2,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,2970.225,2973.277,Presumably both.
1986.86-461,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2973.277,2979.581,"Because I thought you said, it may grant parole for any of the following reasons, ""A"" to ""M"" and then it added, ""for any relevant other reason""."
1986.86-461,2,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,2979.581,2990.103,The administrative regulation states that the Board may grant parole unless it determines that one of four reasons for--
1986.86-461,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2990.103,2993.805,"Are the ""A"" to ""M"" reasons for granting or reasons for denying?"
1986.86-461,2,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,2993.805,3011.683,"--Well, in the second section of that portion, it lists various factors which may be considered by the Board in determining whether to defer or to grant release and the last of those factors is factor ""M"" and it states, ""any other relevant reason""."
1986.86-461,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3064.151,3065.937,"May I ask just this, General Smith."
1986.86-461,2,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,3073.774,3081.778,I think the '55 law changed the procedures and the substantive law significantly.
1986.86-461,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.617,3094.252,Do you think it increased or decreased the amount of discretion in the Parole Board?
1986.86-461,2,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,3094.252,3110.213,--I believe it had no measurable impact on the discretion of the Parole Board since presumably it will make its decision based on the facts and the criteria are so broad as to allow it to make its decision on any factor it deems--
1986.86-461,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3110.213,3113.165,You earlier said you thought it was a substantial change in the law.
1986.86-461,2,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,3114.765,3121.319,--It was a substantial change in the law because it imposed various procedures and it set forth--
1986.86-461,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.319,3124.871,"Purely procedure, no change in the substantive criteria, though?"
1986.86-461,2,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,3124.871,3145.017,"--Well, to the extent that it required the Board to determine that, for example, a prisoner's release was in the best interests of society, I suppose under prior law it could have determined that a release was not in the best interests of society but the prison was too overcrowded so it was going to release the prisoner anyway."
1986.86-461,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3164.114,3165.848,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
