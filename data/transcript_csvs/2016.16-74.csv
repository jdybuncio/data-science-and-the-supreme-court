2016.16-74,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.9,"We will hear argument first -- first this morning in Case 16-74, Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton and the consolidated case. Ms. Blatt."
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,12.9,28.43,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Pension plans for religious non-profits have been exempt from ERISA for over 30 years, whether or not a church established the plan."
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,115.334,128.21,Why? There was a provision that was proposed that would have done very clearly what you think this provision does now.
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,144.25,147.83,It -- it said established and -- and maintained.
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,160.935,161.75,The pension plans.
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,161.75,166.82,"-- covered. Well, plans established by churches and maintained by somebody else."
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.82,173.69,A plan established and maintained by a church includes a plan established and maintained by a church-affiliated organization.
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,173.69,173.82,Right.
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,175.955,176.445,Who?
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,176.445,183.51,It would have excluded plans that -- where the church established and the -- the pension board maintained.
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,184.24,185.065,I'm sorry.
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,192.08,192.38,Right.
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,192.955,195.885,But that's any church plan.
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,204.37,212.405,"Because the problem is that provision, the way it read, required the pension board to not only maintain it, but it would have had to establish it."
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,214.6,218.485,A plan established and maintained by a church-affiliated organization.
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,218.9,219.17,Right.
2016.16-74,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,259.01,266.735,"Well, still, Ms. Blatt, there is a -- you know, there would be a simple way of accomplishing what you think this provision accomplishes."
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,288.565,288.83,Sure.
2016.16-74,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.66,408.76,It's not the problem with your reading.
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,450.235,450.93,Right.
2016.16-74,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,515.295,523.77,"Well, this is a tricky question, but is this the question that was decided by the courts of appeals and is it the question that we agreed to review?"
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,523.77,524.525,No.
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,637.085,661.31,"Ms. Blatt, I -- putting aside that purpose, do you think Congress had in mind a -- corporations that are essentially like every other corporation except they're not for profit? I mean, these hospitals, some of them, like Dignity, the Catholic church has disavowed any formal affiliation with it."
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,661.31,663.03,"Well, let me just -- sorry."
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,663.25,669.99,"Is that -- is that -- do you think that -- I understand the nuns, but you're talking now about an extreme."
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,669.99,674.48,"Well, the nuns established Dignity, and a priest established St. Peter's, or a bishop, rather."
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,677.29,681.09,"The nuns may have, but they're -- no longer are affiliated with the church."
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,681.09,708.895,"I'm happy to argue the facts of Dignity and we can -- I mean, that is an argument the other side on remand. But the place where Congress dealt with your concern about the institution that's not religious enough was not with establishment, but (C)(iv) requires any church plan that's -- that's being maintained by these affiliated organizations to have common bonds and -- common religious bonds and convictions. Now, Dignity itself has that in spades."
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,716.81,718.12,I'm not going to fight over --
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,718.12,718.41,Okay.
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,719.03,719.12,-- that.
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,725.5,726.39,"Well, that -- that --"
2016.16-74,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,726.39,728.85,Or -- or -- or care center.
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,748.18,751.92,"I mean, the Roman Catholic church is itself, I assume, some sort of corporate entity."
2016.16-74,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,785.27,798.545,"Ms. Blatt, I'd like to get to your question about -- the point you raised earlier on about the significance of the interpretation of the IRS, the pension benefit board, and who -- what's the other one? The IRS --"
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,798.545,800.53,"The Department of Labor, IRS, and benefit --"
2016.16-74,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,800.53,800.67,Yeah.
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,800.67,801.765,-- pension benefit.
2016.16-74,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,801.765,814.735,"What are the limits of that proposition? I mean, I don't quite understand, you're saying because these three government agencies interpreted the statute one way, we shouldn't be more -- we should be inclined to interpret it that way?"
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,814.735,815.68,Yes.
2016.16-74,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,821.54,821.71,Right.
2016.16-74,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,832.58,833.65,And -- and I don't see --
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,833.65,833.71,Yeah.
2016.16-74,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,834.56,840.43,"I mean, the statute means -- the statute means what it means, and it's nice that these agencies have interpreted it your way."
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,843.74,844.58,Of course.
2016.16-74,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,851.11,856.935,"Why should it be persuasive? I mean, you faulted, I think, the courts of appeals."
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,866.005,869.725,So let me go back to what our argument is under the IRS.
2016.16-74,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,917.14,917.46,"Well, back to the --"
2016.16-74,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,917.46,919.68,"Well, quite -- quite apart from the IRS reasonable."
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,949.24,950.26,"Well, they're all --"
2016.16-74,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,950.26,950.78,And then -- and --
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,950.78,950.87,Sure.
2016.16-74,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,950.87,955.35,"And the -- and the Respondent says, oh -- oh, the Congress never even knew about these letters, which sounds odd --"
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,955.35,955.46,Well --
2016.16-74,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,955.46,956.22,"-- to me, but --"
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,956.22,983.96,"Congress -- I mean, every -- every religious faith in America complained to Congress. Congress introduced the bills in response to the religious community, and immediately after -- and the Pension Rights Center that's an amicus was testifying, it's -- it's just -- it's silly to think that they didn't know how to use the Internet, at least by whenever the Internet came around, and couldn't figure out -- or go to the library and didn't -- couldn't read a private letter ruling. But I -- I think the significance is -- it's not just even the retroactive penalties."
2016.16-74,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1001.6,1010.395,"My question is: What can you point to, to tell us that the IRS letters were an important part of the motivation for Congress to make this change?"
2016.16-74,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1010.395,1010.82,Okay.
2016.16-74,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1090.08,1107.675,"Thank you, counsel. Mr Stewart."
2016.16-74,1,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1107.675,1118.275,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to first to pick up on a point that Ms. Blatt alluded to when she was describing the -- the history of the statute and its amendment."
2016.16-74,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1268.28,1296.29,"Mr. Stewart, can I ask you about some of the Respondents' hypotheticals where they offer hypothetical statutes that are very similar in structure to this one? And it's pretty clear that you would read, you know, the one about disabled veterans and the one about the two presidential criteria, and it's pretty clear that you would read those sentences their way rather than your way; in other words, as just going to one of the criteria."
2016.16-74,1,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1307.51,1316.275,"I guess I would say about the -- the hypothetical that is used most often -- most often, person disabled and a veteran includes a member of the National Guard."
2016.16-74,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1325.59,1326.72,"I mean, that would seem ridiculous, right?"
2016.16-74,1,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1326.72,1342.35,"I think the instinct -- the -- the context would be such that courts would assume, I believe, that Congress had simply made a -- a sort of scrivener's error, that Congress had used language sloppily. Part -- part of that has to do with the instinct that I -- I alluded to earlier."
2016.16-74,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1389.31,1402.43,"See, I -- I would think that the way that hypothetical works, it's sort of -- we're setting these two criteria, you have to be a veteran and you have to be disabled, and then we're going to say there's a special case of veterans."
2016.16-74,1,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1428.93,1486.775,"I guess I -- all I would concede based on these hypotheticals is that sometimes a provision that is structured in this way will give rise to the natural inference that Congress wanted to do something other than simply deem a particular thing to fall within the whole defined term and that it had in mind a part. But I think, in construing this provision, it may be helpful to look at page 24 of the government's brief which explains -- which kind of clarifies something that Ms. Blatt was referring to earlier, that -- that on page 24 of the -- the government's brief, we lay out the way in which this amendment changed from the time it was first introduced in 1979 to when it was enacted in 1980. And as the questioning in the first part of your argument explained, the original introduced provision said a plan established and maintained by a church shall include a plan established and maintained by a principal-purpose organization."
2016.16-74,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1510.68,1517.15,"The -- the -- the hypothetical would be like this case, or this case would be like the hypothetical."
2016.16-74,1,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1553.25,1553.94,That's not correct.
2016.16-74,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1576.11,1577.61,Sometimes on the hook?
2016.16-74,1,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1577.61,1582.42,"Sometimes on the hook, if the establisher maintains ongoing responsibility."
2016.16-74,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1621.01,1641.87,"Can you -- can you tell me what provision of ERISA -- and I'll ask Mr. Feldman the same thing if I have the chance -- what provision of ERISA explains which entity, if any, is responsible for paying benefits if, for example, a defined benefit plan is unable to do that with the assets in the plan?"
2016.16-74,1,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1641.87,1645.37,I -- I don't believe there is a provision of ERISA that spells that out.
2016.16-74,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1705.855,1708.33,"Well, but I guess that's the question, right?"
2016.16-74,1,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1708.33,1708.67,But -- but --
2016.16-74,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1708.67,1710.405,And the structure is the same.
2016.16-74,1,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1710.405,1713.23,I -- I guess the point I was going to make about -- if I -- if I could finish this?
2016.16-74,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1713.23,1713.53,Sure.
2016.16-74,1,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1713.53,1735.875,-- about the way in which the statute changed from introduction to final passage is that everyone agrees that Congress could have more clearly achieved the objective that Respondent says they were trying to achieve if it had said a plan maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization.
2016.16-74,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1753.05,1762.29,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feldman."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1762.29,1763.18,Mr. Chief --
2016.16-74,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1763.18,1770.27,"Mr. Feldman, I have a starting question, which is I'm torn."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1780.335,1785.11,I think if you look at what Congress was -- this is what I would say.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.55,1864.18,"Well, isn't there -- didn't Congress provide for church involvement by making the employees covered by the principal-purpose entity church employees?"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1864.18,1867.76,"No, it's actually -- well, just -- no, it didn't, actually."
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1882.98,1885.555,"I mean, the -- the church agency employees."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1885.555,1885.85,Right.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1991.45,2003.565,"If that -- if that were so evident, why do the three government agencies responsible in this area -- the IRS, the Department of Labor, the PBGC -- why for 30 years did they take the opposite view?"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2003.565,2020.42,"Well, it's -- they took this view in the early 1980s at a time when they were facing one or two -- I -- I'm not sure they knew at the time when they started down this road what it was going to lead to in terms of the hundreds of hospitals and other businesses that were going to be able to just deprive their employees of ERISA benefits."
2016.16-74,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2020.42,2023.27,But it -- but it led to -- but it led to hundreds of letters from the IRS.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2028.835,2029.71,That's true.
2016.16-74,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2048.44,2061.76,"But -- but nevertheless, it shows that an entity that had one of these plans that -- where there was some doubt was proceeding in good faith with the -- with the assurance of the IRS that what they were doing was lawful."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2061.76,2061.88,Yes.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2070.315,2073.165,"That -- that's standard language in a private letter ruling, isn't it?"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2073.165,2073.83,Yes.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2073.83,2074.11,Okay.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2074.11,2074.57,There's nothing --
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2074.57,2075.76,So there is nothing special about this.
2016.16-74,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2075.76,2084.115,"When this goes on and on quite without reference to the legislative history to which senator said what, which I think is unhelpful."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2107.05,2109.4,"I -- I -- Your Honor, I don't think that that's right."
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2124.89,2129.69,"Well, wasn't Ms. Blatt incorrect when she said that the complaints seek billions of dollars in penalties?"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2129.69,2130.09,Right.
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2132.95,2134.505,What is the answer to my question?
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2134.505,2135.02,Yes.
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2139.31,2142.21,"Well, they -- if you figured out the penalties, would they be billions of dollars?"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2142.21,2143.26,No one has ever --
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2143.26,2146.14,Then how can you say that this is primarily about forward-looking things?
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2146.14,2156.225,Because I think that everybody admit -- admits in this case -- not everybody admits. The statute -- the authority to issue penalties is in the district court's discretion.
2016.16-74,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2174.46,2177.61,And one equity would be the reliance.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2190.92,2192.48,I -- I completely agree.
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2195.66,2196.52,I understand that.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2210.3,2210.94,"No, I'm not."
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2210.94,2214.015,Then how can you say that it's primarily about forward-looking.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2214.015,2214.59,Because --
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2214.59,2215.44,-- remedies.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2215.44,2218.77,I can say that because we don't know the facts of this case.
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2229.98,2230.46,"Well, they had to --"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2230.46,2230.86,-- the penalty --
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2230.86,2236.915,"-- whatever -- whatever reliance was reasonable based on these hundreds of letters, that's one thing."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2243.05,2244.22,Yes.
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2281.93,2282.66,"Well, I'm talking about --"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2282.66,2283.54,It ties it to a --
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2283.54,2298.34,"-- the literal language of (C)(i), and you're now talking about everything else. The literal language of (C)(i) says: A plan established and maintained by a church includes a plan that is maintained by a principal-purpose organization."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2298.34,2298.715,Yeah.
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2298.715,2304.5,"And it's as simple as that, that read literally, it is not required that it be established --"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2304.5,2304.62,And --
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2304.62,2305.62,-- by a church.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2308.38,2311.405,"I -- I -- Your Honor, I respectfully disagree."
2016.16-74,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2358.84,2359.35,"Well, why would you --"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2359.35,2362.45,"-- we're qualifying the B, but we're not doing anything to the A."
2016.16-74,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2362.45,2374.82,"Why would you repeat the requirement of the A? In other words, Congress could have just said a plan maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by one of these organizations."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2374.82,2375.33,And --
2016.16-74,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2375.33,2375.75,Right.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2382.15,2385.405,I -- I actually don't think that that's quite right.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2446.29,2446.75,From your --
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2446.75,2447.18,And there's no --
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2447.18,2455.725,"-- your perspective, what is the practical significance of requiring that the -- excuse me -- plans be established by a church?"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2455.725,2474.225,"I think the practical significance is Congress's purpose here -- and, again, I don't think this is in dispute, and there's no other purpose that's been suggested, was hands off the church. If a church is involved with a plan, we don't -- we don't -- we want to have -- leave them the freedom to be outside of ERISA."
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2479.345,2479.53,No.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2479.7,2480.95,-- no direct involvement --
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2480.95,2493.58,"-- well, but you -- I guess you began with that, and the church is involved to the extent the law says that the principal purpose is -- agency is maintaining that fund for people who are defined to be church employees."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2493.58,2494.32,Right.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2495.035,2498.85,So you can't say the church is not involved in that -- in the situation before us.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2498.85,2499.04,No.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2508.9,2509.6,But the church -- the church --
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2509.6,2511.66,-- zero involvement with this plan.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2520.34,2522.77,"But they have involvement with the church agency, right?"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2522.77,2523.23,They do.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2523.63,2533.77,So I thought the whole concern with the original IRS problem was that the IRS was treating church agencies as if they were not engaged in a church function.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2533.77,2534.05,No.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2534.16,2555.235,"They were saying -- they were saying, okay, the -- the church has an agency whose mission is to, you know, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, all of that, and the IRS was saying, well, that's not a church; it's got nothing to do with it. And now it's changed and those -- those individuals that are engaged in that social mission are treated as members of the church agency."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2555.235,2557.0,They are treated that way so that the --
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2557.0,2557.85,The church agency.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2557.85,2567.06,"They are doing that so that the church can include them in its plan if they wanted. And that -- if the church wants to do that, that's fine and they can do that."
2016.16-74,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2578.19,2578.88,Mr. Feldman --
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2578.88,2579.65,And the churches --
2016.16-74,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2579.65,2610.54,"Let's go to that 1982. Tell me how your reading of the statute includes the organizations that were clamoring and for whom the IRS had said were covered by this provision: The pension boards that were separate from the church, and Ms. Blatt pointed to the sisters, the nuns, who were also seeking coverage."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2615.78,2620.4,I think it actually perfectly matches with those two situations.
2016.16-74,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2644.505,2655.67,But I would have thought that the -- the one thing that seems most clear from a pretty murky legislative history is the church pension boards were supposed to be included in this.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2672.25,2675.61,I -- I really -- I disagree with the premise of that.
2016.16-74,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2720.1,2720.9,What does it mean to --
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2720.9,2721.695,Beg your pardon.
2016.16-74,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2721.695,2729.89,What does it mean to establish a plan? Is -- is -- establishing is all important in your view of it.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2735.84,2739.23,"And as -- as this Court -- the Halifax case, I think, establishes it."
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2839.99,2853.82,"Well, in the situation where the church establishes the plan and then turns over the maintenance of the plan to a principal-purpose organization, the audits would be the books of the principal-purpose organization."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2862.705,2867.905,I -- I would think that it's more than just looking at the books and records at that particular time.
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2878.75,2888.675,"But you say -- where -- where do I look to find that? And where do I look to find the provision that says what you say, which is that the entity that establishes the plan is financially responsible?"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2888.675,2895.52,The -- the financially -- it's financially responsible to the extent that what it says when it established the plan.
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2897.56,2902.72,It's -- it's responsible -- it's responsible to the extent the plan makes it responsible? Is that the answer?
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2902.72,2907.1,"It -- it's -- it's -- under ERISA, plans can't limit their liability."
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2917.25,2918.23,But where is the provision that --
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2918.23,2923.75,"But they still have to make a commitment and that would be governed by, presumably, in the case of non-ERISA plan, by state law."
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2924.08,2934.03,"But where is the provision of ERISA that supports what you said, which is -- it seems to me to be a significant point, that the entity that establishes the plan is financially responsible for the plan."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2935.56,2935.89,It makes --
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2935.89,2937.41,-- that says that?
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2937.41,2943.55,"It -- I think it's -- I can't cite it to you right now, the -- the number, but it's the provision that says you have to carry out the terms of a plan and what it --"
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2943.55,2945.955,I thought Mr. Stewart suggested the opposite.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2945.955,2946.36,No.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2957.59,2961.585,Sue the entity establishing it or the person -- or the entity maintaining the plan?
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2961.585,2964.25,"You could -- you -- first of all, frequently they are the same."
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2965.92,2967.845,"Well, in this case they are not, right?"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2967.845,2970.815,"In this case I think they are, actually."
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2970.815,2974.49,"Well, you're talking about -- I thought the principal-purpose agency is the one that --"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2974.49,2975.03,The -- the principal --
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2975.03,2976.13,-- is the one that's maintaining --
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2976.13,2985.51,"Right, and the principal-purpose agency in these cases is an internal committee of -- of Petitioners, so I don't think there would be any difference in suing -- I think you would sue Petitioners."
2016.16-74,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2991.4,3001.18,Is it -- can an internal committee of a church-affiliated organization qualify as a principal purpose organization?
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3001.18,3023.145,"We believe that it can't. And, in fact, there would be no reason at all for Congress to have -- we -- a part -- according to my friend, Congress wanted to be sure that whoever is maintaining the plan is somebody who is associated with the church. But there was no reason to talk about principal-purpose, employee benefit organizations that are primarily involved in employee benefits if that's what you wanted to accomplish."
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3053.07,3066.295,"Why -- how many -- how many -- how many employees did come in under the IRS interpretation for 30 years that wouldn't have come in had the IRS followed yours, if you know? About, just rough hand."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3066.295,3068.42,I would assume all of them.
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3068.42,3081.24,"I mean, I would like to get a rough idea of what you are talk -- we're talking about, because your argument practically depends on if we keep following the IRS interpretation there will be vast numbers of plans that come in that wouldn't otherwise."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3093.74,3094.16,Right.
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3103.97,3110.27,Why? Why won't they be kept out by the principal purpose definition unless they really are the Little Sisters of the Poor?
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3110.27,3114.85,"They wouldn't be kept out any more than -- than Petitioners in this case, would they? I mean, it would be the same --"
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3114.85,3120.11,"Well, that may be, but there's an issue as to whether Petitioners in this case, which ones come in and which ones don't."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3120.11,3120.925,Right.
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3125.28,3126.325,The answer is you don't know.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3129.02,3129.68,"No, I -- I --"
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3129.68,3135.84,I -- I wanted to get a rough idea of the scope of the practical extent of the two interpretations.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3135.84,3136.16,And -- and I -- I --
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3136.16,3138.125,And I think the answer is you don't know.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3138.125,3140.09,"Well, I -- I don't -- you haven't --"
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3140.09,3140.54,You don't have to know.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3140.54,3144.095,-- all these cases haven't been litigated and I can't say how they're all going to come out --
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3144.095,3144.42,Fine.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3158.42,3160.43,If they're Little Sister of the Poor under the --
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3160.43,3162.36,I'm assuming they are a principal-purpose organization.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3162.36,3163.07,"Yes, then it would be --"
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3163.07,3163.495,Okay.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3163.93,3164.715,-- they're a principal-purpose organization.
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3164.715,3171.4,"-- the Little Sisters of the Poor establish it, and the Little Sisters of the Poor maintain it. On your definition, are they in or out?"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3171.4,3172.19,"They are out, because --"
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3172.19,3172.62,Okay.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3184.25,3185.535,I -- I believe that would be out.
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3185.535,3185.88,Out.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3186.24,3186.57,Because --
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3186.57,3190.62,So you -- you actually have to have the Catholic church establishing itself.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3193.975,3196.68,"That's -- that's right, and the reason is because Congress --"
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3196.68,3196.77,Okay.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3196.77,3202.53,-- what Congress was most concerned about here was not going into the church's books and records.
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3207.85,3208.42,That is true.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3218.37,3221.08,"And if they really are part of the church, I would add one other thing."
2016.16-74,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3221.35,3223.89,"Yes, they really are the church, and they retained a -- purpose."
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3223.89,3226.67,"-- part of the church and they can qualify as a church, that's fine."
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3234.79,3237.41,I thought the whole purpose was to avoid that inquiry.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3244.29,3244.41,I thought --
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3244.41,3251.065,-- because they weren't engaged in sacerdotal or whatever activities that the IRS thought characterized what a church should be.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3251.065,3253.34,I just don't think that that's what the problem was.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3263.65,3265.01,What the -- what was the tenor --
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3265.01,3265.525,-- of that.
2016.16-74,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3265.525,3273.9,What was the tenor of the hundreds and hundreds of letters that -- that Congress received about what the IRS was doing? What did they understand the IRS to be doing?
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3273.9,3284.12,"So, if you look at the 20 -- on page, I think, 10,054 or so of the congressional record -- I don't remember the volume number -- but it's cited by Petitioners and by us."
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3308.785,3313.625,Are you saying that the only purpose of the amendment was to avoid the sunset provision?
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3313.625,3315.19,I think there were two purposes.
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3316.67,3317.05,All right.
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3322.715,3323.88,"That -- well, okay."
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3346.44,3349.8,"Because they honestly would have to do something else, right? And that's what C(i) --"
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3349.8,3349.91,Right.
2016.16-74,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3349.91,3350.295,-- what --
2016.16-74,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3350.295,3380.25,"And the other thing they wanted to do was what Representative Conable called a technical problem, which is they wanted to enable church -- these congregational churches to maintain plans in a different way than they had been -- to maintain plans through this separate agency because that was the way they found it most convenient to do. And that actually explains this language of why they're talking in the first place about principal purpose agencies and why that doesn't apply to -- the churches can establish and maintain a plan, and that's fine."
2016.16-74,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3380.25,3442.065,"Mr. Feldman, why do you think -- I mean, I've -- I have read all your arguments about why the IRS letters are not entitled to deference. But I come at it from a different point, which is it was in part these private organizations, religious organizations, but the IRS, too, who was lobbying Congress to express itself on this issue and take care of what the IRS knew was a problem for all these people. And then all of a sudden, almost immediately after the legislation is passed, the IRS is believing and stating that it's done more than you claim. Isn't that, in itself, evidence -- not the Skidmore deference -- but evidence that the agency believed that the answer was different than you're promoting right now?"
