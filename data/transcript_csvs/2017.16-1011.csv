2017.16-1011,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.04,"We'll hear argument next in Case 16-1011, WesternGeco versus ION Geophysical. Mr. Clement."
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,8.04,23.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted Section 271(f) to address this Court's decision in Deepsouth and to prohibit a specific domestic act of infringement with foreseeable foreign consequences."
2017.16-1011,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,80.8,90.0,"Except there's one feature of this that's -- I mean, it's one -- Congress, in 271(f), wanted the infringer to be liable."
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,120.8,122.36,"We -- we do, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.16-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,242.96,258.96,"Well, Mr. -- Mr. Clement, though, the difference I wonder -- and I don't know, but I wonder -- might be this: That, as Justice Ginsburg indicated under 271(f), fine, you get royalties because it's as if the -- the bits were manufactured here."
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,292.12,299.48,"I don't think so, Justice Gorsuch, and here's how I'd respond, which is we're not collecting damages for the combination itself."
2017.16-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,306.2,313.24,"Well, let's -- let's just segregate out again the -- the royalties, put those aside, okay?"
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,313.24,313.76,Can -- can I --
2017.16-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,313.76,316.4,"And just -- just focus on the profits for me, okay?"
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,316.4,316.72,Okay.
2017.16-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,316.72,321.68,And they arise from a third party's use over which you have no lawful monopoly.
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,329.56,330.32,Sure.
2017.16-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,349.6,350.24,This Court -- this --
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,350.24,351.96,And I see skepticism creeping --
2017.16-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,351.96,352.32,All right.
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,369.84,372.2,"With all due respect, Your Honor, that's Goulds."
2017.16-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,377.56,378.24,In passing.
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,383.68,394.0,"But in Dowagiac, when somebody comes into court and says, I can collect my damages against the Canadian wholesaler, because of Goulds, this Court says: Not so fast."
2017.16-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,394.0,394.44,Right.
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,394.44,435.44,"Because you're suing a wholesaler who did nothing in the United States, nothing infringing, and they specifically say that Goulds is different because there the party, the plaintiff -- the patent holder, sued the right party, the party who made the article in the United States and then was guilty of infringement. If I could get to your point about reasonable royalty, though, I think it's very important to show why that's not a way out here, and my friend's concession on page 35 of his brief, that you can take into account the expected foreign use in calculating the rate for the royalty, is a very damaging concession, because reasonable royalties are not some alternative to damages adequate to compensate for the infringement."
2017.16-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,462.0,469.2,"All that will happen -- imagine you have the converse case. I mean, if we can have a law like this, so can every other country."
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,531.68,533.0,"Well, a couple --"
2017.16-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,533.0,533.92,With effects abroad.
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,533.92,535.4,"A couple of points, Justice Breyer."
2017.16-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.04,539.12,I know.
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,562.72,568.32,"The other thing is, I mean, I -- I would say, you know, I get a couple of pluses because this has also been the rule -- (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,568.32,569.88,This is -- but this has also been the rule --
2017.16-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,569.88,570.32,"Yes, yes."
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,570.32,571.28,-- in the copyright context.
2017.16-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,571.68,571.92,Yes.
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,571.92,574.28,-- the world hasn't ended in the copyright context.
2017.16-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,574.28,574.6,These --
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,574.6,603.28,"And I think the key is, here's the key, which is in all of these cases what you need to have, before you can have any of this liability, is a determination by the legislature that some domestic act of infringement is sufficiently serious that we're going to provide full compensation, even if that has some foreseeable increase abroad. And if that creates some situation where some country has a very idiosyncratic view of what constitutes infringement, then maybe governments --"
2017.16-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,603.28,604.96,It's not idiosyncratic.
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,610.4,611.0,But --
2017.16-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,611.0,620.92,"I mean, there -- there are different views all over the world. Now what's bothering me are not the cases, but I can't find that they are in your favor 100 percent."
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,673.56,679.52,"I want to respond with two things, Your Honor: First of all is, if I understand the concern to be double damages, I think there are ways --"
2017.16-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,679.52,680.84,"No, it's not double damages."
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,688.36,690.96,"With all due respect, there would be no chaos."
2017.16-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,833.08,853.88,"I -- I -- I hear that, but -- but the -- to the extent we're talking about the injury here and the poor French Ambassador, I -- I get that we're -- we're supposed to treat the manufacturer as if it took place here, but how do we pretend that the use on the high seas took place in Lake Michigan? That's where I'm struggling and I -- I could still use your help."
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,853.88,854.16,So --
2017.16-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,854.16,858.44,I -- the high seas and Lake Michigan are -- are just not the same to me.
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,858.44,888.8,"Well, two things, Your Honor: One is, well, I think Congress made it about as clear as it could in 271(f) that it wanted you to treat the infringement on the high seas as if it took place on Lake Michigan. The second thing I would say, though, is it just doesn't matter whether some action by third parties that exacerbates damage is independently lawful or unlawful. I mean, if in hitting the French Ambassador there is then an ambulance service that takes the French Ambassador to the most expensive hospital --"
2017.16-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,888.8,902.48,Help -- help -- help me out with just the language of the statute. You say it's obvious from the language of the statute. What -- what -- what would you point me to? What's your best textual argument to show me that the -- the use on the high seas is to be treated as if it took place in Lake Michigan?
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,902.48,928.84,"Because the violator of 271(f) is liable for either contributory or inducing infringement, whether it's (f)(1) or (f)(2), if they induce a combination that, if the combination occurred in the United States, would violate the patent laws here. So, as the Court said in Limelight, you effectively have a contributory constructive infringement."
2017.16-1011,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,958.72,980.48,"What -- what about -- what about proximate cause? Wouldn't you have to establish at least that the reason that -- that you have -- that the sales that you lost to the foreign, whatever the people who sweep the high seas, that you would have gotten those contracts if they didn't?"
2017.16-1011,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,980.48,980.96,Absolutely.
2017.16-1011,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1006.24,1006.48,So --
2017.16-1011,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1006.48,1019.52,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Tripp."
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1019.52,1025.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I just have a few points I'd like to make in follow-up to that."
2017.16-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1093.48,1112.24,"Then maybe this is an easy case, but what's in the back of my mind, I reverse the idea, see, France has this law that you want here, right? Joe Smith goes to France one day and he makes a tiny particle, which it turns out violates somebody else's French patent."
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1149.8,1150.12,Yes --
2017.16-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1150.12,1151.88,I'm looking for that principle.
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1151.88,1153.8,So I think there's two pieces to that.
2017.16-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1205.64,1210.12,The D.C. Circuit did that with Empagran follow-up in -- in a case which you may not have read.
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1212.52,1213.68,I'm not sure if I have or not.
2017.16-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1214.52,1217.04,"Well, they're -- they're using proximate cause to try to deal with this."
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1219.24,1237.04,"We -- so we think profit, like as in an ordinary tort case in -- in the French tourist hypothetical, in order for her to prove -- obtain recovery of lost wages, she needs to prove that the lost wages were the proximate cause -- were proximately caused by the underlying tort."
2017.16-1011,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1255.56,1272.64,"Well, you do -- you do have to prove, don't you, that -- that this company would have, in fact, made that sale abroad? What happens in a situation where you need a license from a foreign government and there's no evidence that you will necessarily get that license?"
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1272.64,1273.6,"Well, I think --"
2017.16-1011,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1273.6,1275.32,Isn't that too attenuated then?
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1275.32,1284.6,"It may well be, and I think that gets to an important point, which actually in -- in patent cases, it's quite difficult to prove even causation-in-fact for lost profits."
2017.16-1011,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1291.6,1292.2,I have.
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1292.2,1296.48,"Yeah, I mean, this is -- this is quite detailed, and so you have -- you have that."
2017.16-1011,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1335.76,1346.84,"Mr. Tripp, may I ask about your theory for getting to that result, which is different from Mr. Clement's theories, and there are quite a number of theories over on that side of the table."
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1367.92,1377.36,"Yeah, we absolutely do. We're asking the rule -- affirmatively to adopt this rule as a matter of Section 284, the general damages provision that applies all throughout the Patent Act."
2017.16-1011,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1432.32,1459.48,"So -- so just to follow up on this, would you -- would you agree that the -- that the other alternative creates a potential incongruity? Because, if we were to rely on 271(f), we might be in a situation where we're permitting greater damages for someone who only partially manufactured, only partially completed the -- the patent infringement in this country, as compared to someone under (a), who did the entire act here."
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1459.48,1474.12,"Yes, I -- I think that's right, and I think actually the -- the sort of the quintessential, the easiest case are these (a) cases that was Goulds and as this Court understood it in Dowagiac, which is that there was a manufacturer here followed by a sale abroad, right."
2017.16-1011,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1499.28,1521.8,"Mr. Clement has another theory, which just says the presumption against territory -- territoriality doesn't apply at all to damages provisions. Is there a real difference between that and what you're saying? I mean, can you imagine a damages provision where you would say, yes, the presumption against territoriality applies and this is an extraterritorial application?"
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1521.8,1525.64,So I don't think there's a significant difference between the two.
2017.16-1011,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1538.56,1543.56,So it's not something special about this damages provision; you're saying as to any damages provision?
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1543.56,1548.04,I -- I think our rule would apply to any general compensatory damages provision.
2017.16-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1565.36,1565.92,Is there --
2017.16-1011,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1565.92,1569.44,"Well, what is the -- what is the domestic injury?"
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1569.44,1572.76,"The -- I mean, the domestic legal wrong here is the infringement for --"
2017.16-1011,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1572.76,1573.72,"The legal wrong, yeah."
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1573.72,1573.88,Yeah.
2017.16-1011,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1573.88,1580.04,"But this is what makes this case difficult, because there's such a gap between the legal injury, which is --"
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1580.04,1580.6,Yeah.
2017.16-1011,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1580.6,1585.08,"-- ephemeral, and the practical injury, which occurs completely abroad."
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1585.08,1587.44,"Yeah, so I think two responses to that."
2017.16-1011,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1642.2,1663.52,"I -- I had one question the Chief Justice agreed I could ask. Suppose the Petitioner had a foreign subsidiary in the Bahamas and it used that in order to conduct a sweeping operation, so it sells -- it sells the device to the -- to the subsidiary, and the subsidiary then uses it. What -- what result?"
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1663.52,1667.76,If the Petitioner under the facts of the case was basically selling the item to itself?
2017.16-1011,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1667.76,1671.16,"Yes, as a foreign subsidiary."
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1671.16,1676.48,I think maybe in that case it would have difficulty proving lost profits because I'm not sure how big a profit it would get in a sale made to itself.
2017.16-1011,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1676.48,1683.88,But then the facts are the same; the subsidiary loses the job because ION does it itself.
2017.16-1011,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1683.88,1691.12,"I -- I think so long as they could prove causation in fact and proximate cause, that -- that if there's infringement here, they're on the hook for the whole thing."
2017.16-1011,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1691.12,1696.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1696.08,1707.52,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The presumption against extraterritoriality applies with particular force to the Patent Act."
2017.16-1011,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1746.24,1757.0,"Well, suppose there were a different business model and what the Petitioner did was to sell the device to others, rather than to conduct the operation itself."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1770.76,1771.4,Yes.
2017.16-1011,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1803.88,1808.76,But isn't the situs of the contract here? You have the contract to conduct the sweep.
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1808.76,1812.76,So there is importantly no evidence in the record to that effect.
2017.16-1011,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1855.04,1861.32,"I'm -- I'm sorry, I didn't think damages were awarded for a hypothetical."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1894.72,1925.48,"Justice Sotomayor, Petitioner, in fact, did get a reasonable royalty, to the tune of $22 million, which compensates for the act of infringement; that is to say, the initial factual injury from supplying the infringing component from the United States. And that is hypothetical only in the sense that the way a reasonable royalty is calculated, because, obviously, there was no license and no actual royalty, looks at a hypothetical negotiation."
2017.16-1011,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1934.12,1940.28,"Well, if the jury wasn't permitted to find lost profits, because then the royalty might be something different."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1940.28,1943.28,"Well, in fact, in this case, the jury awarded both."
2017.16-1011,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2011.2,2018.2,But -- but it seems to me that you're confining the right of the Petitioner to decide how it's going to use its own patent.
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2023.56,2029.12,"The right that is conferred by Section 271(f), Justice Kennedy, is a limited right."
2017.16-1011,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2087.32,2098.6,"Well, if Congress had prohibited the foreign combination, wouldn't that be the end of the case? Would you still argue that you'd have to analyze whether the damages provision applies extraterritorially?"
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2098.6,2104.16,"Well, I think you would, Justice Alito, for the reasons given in your opinion for the Court in RJR Nabisco."
2017.16-1011,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2131.16,2156.64,"Well, there -- there are differences between this case and RJR Nabisco, which I won't go into, but if -- if you have a liability provision that says there is liability for acts that are committed abroad, what sense does it make to say, well, although Congress thinks there should be liability for these acts committed abroad, we have to analyze the -- the remedial provisions separately to see whether they wanted any remedy for these acts that are committed abroad."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2156.64,2174.48,"I do think, Justice Alito, that that was an aspect of the scheme at issue in RICO insofar as, in the first part of the Court's opinion, the Court essentially construed Section 1962 to reach extraterritorially because certain predicate acts reached extraterritorially. But I do, if you'll allow me to briefly --"
2017.16-1011,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2174.48,2176.0,"Well, just tell me why it makes sense."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2177.88,2178.6,"Well, that's --"
2017.16-1011,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2178.6,2180.56,Why does that make any sense whatsoever?
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2180.56,2204.96,"Well, I think that that actually illustrates why this is an easier case than RJR Nabisco, because what really doesn't make any sense is to conclude that Congress, in regulating only domestic substantive conduct, intended to make foreign damages available as well. And, again, in Deepsouth, this sort of lost profits damages for downstream foreign use was certainly not at issue."
2017.16-1011,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2285.6,2285.8,What are they?
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2285.8,2285.88,Well --
2017.16-1011,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2285.88,2292.08,"I mean, that's -- that's where I'm -- I'm having trouble to be -- actually, to be specific."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2384.76,2421.96,"So I have several responses to the various aspects of your question, so let me attempt at least four of them if I can get them out. The first is that while there is a substantial cleavage between Petitioner and the government, I think that if you look at Petitioner's reply brief in particular, it is clear that Petitioner, like the government, thinks that the same rule should apply to Section 271(f) as to Section 271(a). And, indeed, if you look at the first 10 pages of the reply brief in this argument, an excursus about legal injury, the implication would be the same in the 271(a) context."
2017.16-1011,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2471.04,2476.44,But the liability is -- is imposed on a U.S. entity.
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2492.24,2525.92,"I mean, to be fair, Justice Ginsburg, I think that what Petitioner is trying to do in this case is effectively to hold us secondarily liable for what would be or what might not be an act of foreign direct infringement. But I think that the concern that this case presents is exactly the concern that Your Honor stated in the opinion for the Court in the Microsoft case; namely, in the Court's own words, converting a single act of supply from the United States into a springboard for what would effectively be worldwide damages."
2017.16-1011,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2626.36,2627.6,That is a different --
2017.16-1011,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2627.6,2635.8,"Well, your -- your position is that the Petitioner is not entitled to full compensation for its injury? That's your position?"
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2635.8,2641.4,Petitioner is not entitled to compensation for foreign damages; in other words --
2017.16-1011,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2641.4,2644.16,Which is the full compensation for its injury.
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2651.24,2657.24,"Yes, as a consequence of the application of the presumption against extraterritoriality."
2017.16-1011,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2732.28,2748.64,Isn't that exactly how the copyright law is applied under the so-called predicate act doctrine? The copyright owner can get damages flowing from the exploitation abroad of domestic acts of infringement.
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2753.2,2775.92,"Yes and no, Justice Ginsburg. In the copyright context, the reason why you can obtain profits for things that take place abroad is because the copyright law makes infringers' profits available. And as Judge Hand explained in the original opinion on this issue, infringers' profits are -- are an equitable remedy."
2017.16-1011,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2971.2,2979.64,"I'll think about your hypo, but it seems to me it's as if you got back in the car and then hit him again when he went in Virginia. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2979.64,2980.8,"Well, critically --"
2017.16-1011,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2980.8,2983.36,That -- that -- that would be more like what happened in this case.
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2983.36,2985.4,"We did nothing further, Justice Kennedy."
2017.16-1011,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3046.52,3046.64,Mr. --
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3046.64,3048.04,-- for the initial act of supply.
2017.16-1011,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3048.04,3053.4,"Mr. Shanmugam, what struck me about your hypo is that it's a classic law school proximate cause hypo."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3066.16,3101.32,"So I do want to address that, Justice Kagan. I think that, in my hypothetical, I'm willing to concede that for purposes of proximate causation and going back to Palsgraf and all of those wonderful cases, that I could be held liable for both of those injuries. And, to be sure, this analysis is not entirely disconnected from causation because, as I indicated earlier, the fact that there is subsequent foreign conduct matters to the test. What makes this case different from the earlier French ambassador hypothetical is that the injury is immediate."
2017.16-1011,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3107.96,3109.04,"You could -- you could -- well, go ahead."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3109.04,3129.16,"I do want to address any suggestion that causation is somehow the solution here by making a couple of points. The first is that, with regard to proximate causation, the federal circuit has adopted a quite expansive test which requires only mere foreseeability, I would refer the Court to an en banc opinion called Rite-Hite, which sets out that test."
2017.16-1011,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3162.84,3171.6,"However, it doesn't quite answer it, because the -- your client, I don't want to prejudice your client, but it didn't seem to me he was the strongest case for your argument."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3207.24,3207.68,"Well, that is --"
2017.16-1011,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3207.68,3211.92,"The argument the other way -- and that's argument for you, say: Just cut it off."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3217.4,3217.88,I --
2017.16-1011,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3217.88,3219.52,Anything you want to say about that?
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3219.52,3225.32,"I would like to say two things about that, Justice Breyer. I mean, the first is that this Court has crossed that bridge."
2017.16-1011,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3323.44,3343.72,"I'm sorry, did you say earlier that if this sensor was manufactured and sold from the United States to someone abroad, you -- the infringer, would be liable for that sale, correct?"
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3343.72,3345.76,So the -- yes.
2017.16-1011,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3345.76,3346.52,All right.
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3364.36,3365.76,Because the damages are foreign.
2017.16-1011,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3380.56,3391.48,"Well, the -- the statute by its own is -- is addressing a combination, an intent to have the infringement completed abroad."
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3398.24,3398.64,No.
2017.16-1011,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3409.84,3410.04,Yes.
2017.16-1011,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3410.04,3427.52,"-- did invoke the presumption, but it invoked the presumption to reject a reading that would have given Section 271(f) effectively extraterritorial effect. But, again, just to be clear, I don't think that Petitioner's argument ultimately depends on Section 271(f)."
2017.16-1011,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3518.92,3521.48,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Clement."
2017.16-1011,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3521.48,3530.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd just like to clarify two details and make a couple of points. One detail, my friend mistakenly referred to this case being brought in the Eastern District of Texas."
2017.16-1011,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3541.0,3553.0,"The second point is that -- just to be crystal-clear, and my friend concedes this in Footnote 3 of the red brief, but there were not royalties and lost profits on the -- the same components."
