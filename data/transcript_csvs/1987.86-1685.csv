1987.86-1685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.508,"We'll hear argument now in number 86-1685, Florida versus Hughlan Long."
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,11.062,16.024,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.463,212.591,"Mr. Collette, as a preliminary matter, would you explain to me the mechanics of the plan that led to males receiving lower monthly benefits than females?"
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,218.275,226.95,"Your Honor, it is the result of the mechanics of a defined benefit pension plan."
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.757,444.061,"May I ask at that point, is one of the options available, at least pre-August 1, 1983, a lump sum settlement?"
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,444.061,446.382,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,455.699,464.866,"If there had been, just to clarify the question Justice O'Connor raised, if there had been a lump sum, it would have meant that the female would have gotten a larger lump sum?"
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,464.866,467.439,That is absolutely right.
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,467.439,471.35,Because it's calculated backwards from life expectancy at a fixed rate where they both get the same amount.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,471.35,471.721,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,471.721,472.191,I see.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,472.191,492.746,"I think it is also important to remember that there is no question that the award in this case were it to be implemented, will be paid by the FRS for its 1100 plus FRS participating Florida Governmental employers through increased contribution rates."
1987.86-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.927,1143.948,Are some of them pre-Manhart?
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1143.948,1157.468,"Yes, Your Honor, by the reason of the structure of the District Court's order, both prospective and retrospective adjustment of pension benefits were awarded."
1987.86-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1173.057,1174.669,Including pre-Manhart?
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1174.669,1175.02,Yes.
1987.86-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1193.743,1195.914,And you say all of that was wrong?
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1195.914,1203.63,"Yes, Your Honor, particularly my concern is the pre-Manhart retirees."
1987.86-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1237.574,1247.08,But you say both retrospective and prospective awards were in error under Norris?
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1247.08,1248.11,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1248.11,1248.55,Yes.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1248.931,1258.307,"Specifically in Norris and Justice Marshall writing for the Court on the liability issue, pointed out that the--"
1987.86-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.307,1260.39,With me joining him.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1260.39,1262.752,"--Yes, Your Honor, I'm aware of that."
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1284.917,1287.717,May I ask a question about the pre-Manhart retirees.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1293.892,1294.943,No.
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.943,1301.428,"You mean if they got too low benefits, received benefits before Manhart, those are also adjusted?"
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1301.428,1303.378,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.95,1312.484,Benefits calculated on contributions prior to Manhart.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1312.484,1318.629,The benefits were always calculated using sex distinct mortality tables until Norris.
1987.86-1685,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1318.629,1328.235,But these pre-Manhart people you're talking about are people whose contributions were made before Manhart.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1328.235,1329.034,Yes.
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.034,1329.485,Yes.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1331.237,1350.521,"Benefits, anybody who retired up to the date of Manhart benefits calculated as of date of retirement and payment so if somebody retired in '72, '73, '74, they get a full prospective award for all their--"
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.521,1358.646,"Full prospective award, but they did not get an adjustment of the award that was paid to them between the date of their retirement and the date of the Manhart decision?"
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1358.646,1363.16,"--If I understand, Your Honor--"
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.16,1364.289,"Well, let me put it this way."
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1369.044,1369.434,--Yes.
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1369.434,1373.375,And say they received $100 a month during those three years in benefits.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1376.958,1378.0,Yes.
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1383.923,1384.644,"Well, how can it be?"
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1389.399,1392.621,"No, there was nothing paid back."
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1397.133,1397.644,Okay.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1397.644,1400.365,I think that's what you're talking about.
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.365,1400.526,Yes.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1400.526,1403.718,There was no $100 we're going to--
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1403.718,1409.464,"The only payments that were increased were those benefits that were paid after August 1, 1983?"
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1409.464,1410.072,--No.
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.07,1430.616,"Yes, but all I'm saying is that no one who received a benefit check prior to August 1, 1983 had that check adjusted."
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1430.616,1434.969,That is not entirely correct.
1987.86-1685,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.505,1442.656,Okay.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1467.412,1468.522,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1502.975,1504.125,Just a small point.
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1514.403,1520.377,Very likely.
1987.86-1685,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1549.886,1564.027,"And under the Eleventh Circuit's holding, do any retirees get lower benefits as a result of that holding, or is everything a topping up in effect?"
1987.86-1685,0,18657,charles_t_collette,,1564.027,1568.089,No.
1987.86-1685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1578.076,1579.876,"Thank you, Mr. Collette."
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,1582.447,1589.663,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1685,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1968.744,1969.875,"Just a minute, Mr. Melvin."
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,1969.875,1970.046,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-1685,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1970.046,1975.148,That could have been for the purpose of indispensible parties.
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,1981.094,1991.88,"Your Honor, having tried the case, I can assure that that meaning of that stipulation is as I have just presented it to the Court."
1987.86-1685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2065.748,2080.638,"Well, Mr. Melvin, what language in Manhart informed employers that they were forbidden to apply sex based tables to non-employee joint beneficiaries?"
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,2086.862,2088.413,"I find nothing in that that addresses that issue, either."
1987.86-1685,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2105.496,2107.597,Are we dealing with that?
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,2107.597,2139.407,"In effect, you are dealing with the consequence of the choice of designating a joint annuitant, but the question cannot be isolated in that fashion as is evidenced by the fact that the class primarily consists of males... these are the retired employees themselves who are making this application on behalf of themselves and their joint annuitants, it's not only the joint annuitant following the death of the male who suffers a reduction in the pension payment."
1987.86-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2154.246,2160.831,But the male employee is not suffering discrimination because of his sex?
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,2160.831,2163.095,That is correct.
1987.86-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.999,2169.86,Of somebody's sex.
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,2169.86,2171.981,The sex of his joint annuitant.
1987.86-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.981,2174.105,But that's different from Manhart.
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,2174.105,2174.903,Yes.
1987.86-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2502.352,2504.833,"We didn't do that in Norris, then."
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,2519.236,2520.767,"Yes, you did, in many respects."
1987.86-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.767,2521.819,So you're saying that was wrong?
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,2521.819,2524.059,"No, it's not wrong, I don't think."
1987.86-1685,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2582.629,2590.804,"Mr. Melvin, one sentence in the Court of Appeals opinion in this case, when it's dealing with retroactive relief says,"
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,2609.167,2613.489,"--No, I think that that's being misread there, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3287.348,3290.231,"Mr. Melvin, could I interrupt you for a minute?"
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,3303.951,3306.993,He is the State Retirement Actuary.
1987.86-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3314.329,3314.9,Is he a lawyer?
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,3314.9,3316.089,No.
1987.86-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3321.334,3331.87,"So for all we know, this may be one piece of advice that the managers of the system got, but they may well have taken that letter and consulted with their lawyers."
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,3331.87,3332.21,Yes.
1987.86-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3332.21,3335.953,"And their lawyers may well have told them, you know, Manhart doesn't say this."
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,3343.029,3343.17,Yes.
1987.86-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3392.825,3394.207,Wasn't convinced as to what?
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,3394.207,3395.987,"And in fact, there were lawyers' memos."
1987.86-1685,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3395.987,3397.639,Who had the burden of proof on this?
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,3402.011,3409.777,"I think it's an employer's burden because there is a presumption in favor of retroactivity, a presumption in favor of full relief that extends from your Albemarle decisions and so forth."
1987.86-1685,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3432.564,3433.735,"Your time has expired, Mr. Melvin."
1987.86-1685,1,45559,woodrow_m_melvin_jr,,3433.735,3434.296,"Thank you, sir."
1987.86-1685,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3434.296,3436.647,"Mr. Collette, you have four minutes remaining."
1987.86-1685,2,18657,charles_t_collette,,3436.647,3438.788,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1685,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3470.38,3475.825,The only thing I'd ask about that is did you argue in the lower courts that the State was in the posture of a third party?
1987.86-1685,2,18657,charles_t_collette,,3475.825,3477.125,--No.
1987.86-1685,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3489.985,3500.76,For what purpose did you emphasize that fact when you made this stipulation that the Court could regard the case as though it involved only one employer?
1987.86-1685,2,18657,charles_t_collette,,3503.124,3512.588,"Because in point of fact, the FRS... there is no third party outside the State of Florida that administers the FRS."
1987.86-1685,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3556.129,3557.38,"Thank you, Mr. Collette."
