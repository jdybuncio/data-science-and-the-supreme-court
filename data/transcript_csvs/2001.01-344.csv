2001.01-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,5.656,"We'll hear argument now in Number 01-344, Tommy G. Thompson v. The Western States Medical Center."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,7.43,23.034,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It has long been a fundamental requirement of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that a new drug may not be marketed unless it has first been found by the Food and Drug Administration to be safe and effective for its intended use."
2001.01-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,94.244,101.796,"Mr. Kneedler, a moment ago you say this is based on an existing relationship between the physician, the druggist, and the patient."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,104.191,107.369,"Well, I... it's based on the relationship."
2001.01-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,107.369,109.393,"Well, I could tell that."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,109.393,146.379,"Typically an existing relationship in the sense that the need for compounding often arises where there may be a commercially available product that maybe the physician has prescribed, but it might... or would have otherwise prescribed, but it might contain an ingredient to which the patient is allergic, or it may come in a dosage that would be inappropriate for a child or an older person, and therefore the physician and the pharmacist would consult and say, the pharmacist would be asked, could you modify this in some way, or develop the same drug without the ingredient, so--"
2001.01-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.379,150.094,The plaintiffs here seem to be engaged in a Nation-wide business.
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,150.094,150.837,--Yes.
2001.01-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,150.837,151.541,They're not a corner--
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,151.541,158.639,"No, it is... and the record in the case, the materials submitted in the district court, confirm exactly what you say."
2001.01-344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.225,180.437,"--Well, can't Congress limit the compounding to the ordinary prescription service that we expect pharmacists to be doing?"
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,180.437,182.128,--And that's exactly what Congress has done.
2001.01-344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.325,187.04,"Well, but they added this ban on advertising."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,187.04,197.527,"--Well, if I could explain, the ban on advertising is one of the conditions that confine the exemption to traditional extemporaneous compounding."
2001.01-344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.68,212.138,"Well, don't all those things take care of the Government's interest in problems?"
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,217.794,224.564,"--That condition is essential to protecting the integrity of the new drug approval process, for this reason."
2001.01-344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.883,258.844,"Yes, but what I don't understand is, if Congress can limit in all these other ways the use of compounding of drugs, then why does it need this additional ban?"
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,266.751,274.06,"Well, I... first of all, we think that the court of appeals really misunderstood what the governmental interest here... the... is here."
2001.01-344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.347,299.406,"Well, is there any allegation here that the ads are false or fraudulent, misleading, deceptive?"
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,303.243,307.208,--But that's not really the basic point behind this.
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.787,322.645,And what does manufacture mean?
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,333.791,336.391,--I think that's a very important point.
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.846,346.256,Exactly.
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,346.256,358.766,"But what distinguishes it is that Congress carved out a narrow exception, is the existence of this relationship between the pharmacist, among the pharmacist, the physician, and the patient."
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.766,363.141,"But why does that... why does advert... you see, I don't mind... don't mind."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,397.42,397.98,Well--
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.98,398.806,Why did it have to do that?
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,401.984,417.466,"--It... what it equates with is the marketing of products in the economy, and this is not the only situation under the Food and Drug Act where the advertising that someone does is what triggers regulation."
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.486,480.169,"No, but it wasn't a distinction between manufacturers."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,492.263,493.106,"--Yes, but--"
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.106,495.957,It wasn't an equation of advertising with manufacturing.
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,495.957,508.05,"--Well, what it is, it's an equation of advertising with what triggers the, in that case the prior approval process and in this case the prior approval process."
2001.01-344,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,519.817,521.691,"Mr. Kneedler, would you explain something to me?"
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,562.02,594.159,"The FDA had taken the position for quite a while before the 1997 amendments of at least two decades that pharmacy compounding, at least if it included such an indicia of manufacturing as advertising, or large volumes, a number of things that take it out of traditional pharmacy compounding, extemporaneous, and put it into the basically predetermined or planned marketing of a product, that's the line Congress is trying to draw."
2001.01-344,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,594.159,595.811,"But I mean, there's two kinds of compounding."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,604.728,614.926,"It would be producing a new drug within the meaning of the new drug provisions of the act, it would have been prior to 1997."
2001.01-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,666.128,670.032,What you're doing... tell me if I'm incorrect.
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,719.24,722.955,--Several things in response to that.
2001.01-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,755.749,757.878,"No, but that's based on the size of the market, I take it."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,757.878,765.058,"--No, it's based on the undertaking by the person who is producing, who is trying to put the drug out on the market."
2001.01-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,769.145,783.513,"I'll look at your brief again, but I thought that your whole theory was that advertising is a proxy for market, which is a proxy for manufacturing, versus the compounding."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,785.492,788.835,"Well, it would certainly lead to those consequences."
2001.01-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,802.582,806.175,Which is why advertising is such an imprecise proxy.
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,806.175,821.695,"--No, I... well, with all respect, what the pharmacist can do is advertise his services, his professional services, and what the act does... this exemption in the act does is, respect that professional service and the relationship that grows out of that professional service."
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.695,824.296,Which can produce an enormous volume.
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,845.928,846.587,Yes.
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,846.587,850.136,"And that's going to lead to certainly very, very much increased volume."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,850.136,854.677,But what that does is conform to the line Congress was trying to draw.
2001.01-344,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,894.884,901.777,"I want to go back to Justice Kennedy, because I would like to extrapolate a little bit on your answer to him."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,959.157,959.696,That's exactly right.
2001.01-344,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,959.696,961.47,The one is promotion and soliciting.
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,967.126,973.563,"That's exactly right, and that's exactly what the FDA was referring to and others have referred to as extemporaneous compounding."
2001.01-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,980.539,990.199,"But you have prohibited, or the Government prohibits the pharmacy from advertising to the doctor the availability of this remedy."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,990.199,1001.716,"--The... it doesn't prohibit the availability of the advertising services, which can include, we can prepare a product to remove something to which a patient may be allergic."
2001.01-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1004.317,1004.871,"No, no."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1020.086,1036.722,"--Well, but it... what it can do, though, is advertise in general terms that it can remove, or it can produce a product that is like a commercial one, but while removing ingredients to which the person may be allergic, or dilute a dosage."
2001.01-344,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1039.944,1043.881,"Well, how do we know that, because undoubtedly I think what Justice Kennedy said must be right."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1072.959,1099.015,"--Yes, and I think the most critical thing that tells us that is the new drug approval provisions of the Food and Drug Act itself, which Congress enacted in 1938 and strengthened in 1962 precisely to reach the conduct of people developing new drugs and advertising and promoting drugs that have not been shown to be safe and effective to individuals or to the public at large."
2001.01-344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1101.738,1117.341,"Yes, but when you have the basic provision that compounding can only be conducted in response to a prescription by a physician, it's hard to understand why it has to be accompanied by a ban on truthful speech about it."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1117.341,1118.084,--Well--
2001.01-344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1118.084,1129.785,"I mean, we've had a long history in this very Court of giving voice to the notion that truthful advertising is acceptable in this country."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1129.785,1139.55,--But the new drug approval provisions of the Food and Drug Act rest on the premise that the judgment of the individual physician is not sufficient.
2001.01-344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1145.577,1152.886,"Yes, but presumably compounding cannot be done without resorting to approve... the use of approved drugs."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1160.892,1169.437,"--That's one variation, but again, if you look at the record in this case, there are products that have been compounded that don't resemble that at all."
2001.01-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.128,1190.242,"Mr. Kneedler, isn't it true that... we haven't talked about the severability issue, but as I understand it, the whole statute has been held unconstitutional, because they disagreed with the district court on the severability point."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1190.242,1190.819,--That's correct.
2001.01-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.819,1198.128,"It seems to me that you still can enforce... I would have thought the parties to be arguing the opposite sides of this case, to tell you the truth."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1211.047,1211.996,Yes.
2001.01-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.735,1218.312,Right.
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1218.312,1239.4,"And FDA would have the discretion, and again it's not just mass marketing, it is the situation, as Justice Breyer described, of where the demand comes from, and... but more fundamentally, the act rests on the notion that it is fair to require people who hold themselves out and who attempt to develop and exploit a market to go through the new drug approval requirements."
2001.01-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.4,1253.977,"I understand that, but it seems to me that the... your opponents would be better off if the statute were held to be constitutional than having it held unconstitutional, because you now may prevent them from doing what you're basically saying is the wrong... is marketing new drugs."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1253.977,1276.723,"Well, you make an important point, because Congress looked at this problem in 1997 and, as the committee reports we quote show, it consulted broadly about this and arrived at a consensus about exactly where this dividing line should be between extemporaneous traditional compounding and the traditional kind of promotion of new drugs that the act was directed to."
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.723,1278.126,"Well, maybe you can't do it that way."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1309.062,1309.5,This case--
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.5,1314.042,--it seems to me that the ultimate problem with the case is that the Government is trying to have it both ways--
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1314.042,1314.535,--Well--
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.535,1318.129,"--It's trying to say, it's not enough to have the doctor approve this drug."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1329.396,1341.989,"--The Central Hudson doctrine that this Court has developed for evaluating restrictions on commercial speech, its virtue is that it allows the recognition of these very real problems that regulatory agencies face."
2001.01-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.887,1379.634,"They're talking about Central Hudson and the narrow tailoring notion, or whether it's sufficiently tailored."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1389.832,1405.929,"No, I... again, the new drug approval process of the act rests on the premises that doctors themselves cannot make independent judgments about the safety and effectiveness of products, and that is... that was a very firm understanding of Congress when it passed the new drug approval process."
2001.01-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.929,1407.293,Unless they're druggists.
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1413.981,1440.663,"But the paradigm that the act was directed to is where there is an approved new drug product, or an approved product on the market, and what the pharmacist is being asked to do is tinker with it a little bit by diluting it, by something on that order, to make it... to adjust it but not be in the business of developing new cures, or advertising new cures for existing diseases."
2001.01-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1440.663,1445.476,"No, but I thought just as Justice Scalia did, that you've really got two paradigms in it."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1530.388,1535.755,The volume restriction is on the aggregate number of compounded drugs.
2001.01-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1535.755,1537.53,Then have a narrower volume restriction.
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1537.53,1538.356,But a drug that--
2001.01-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1538.356,1540.873,Why can't a narrow volume restriction work?
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1540.873,1554.908,"--A drug-by-drug volume restriction would be extraordinarily difficult to administer, with thousands and thousands of pharmacies across the country, and having to keep track of particular patient's names--"
2001.01-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1554.908,1557.016,Then have a lower... then why not have a lower aggregate?
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1557.016,1567.79,"--Again, Congress, we think, was entitled to look at the conduct of the pharmacist and take the pharmacist at his word."
2001.01-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1569.852,1578.851,"No, but that begs the question, because you know, the question is, under Central Hudson, is the pharmacist entitled to have his word, and--"
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1578.851,1579.428,"--Well, under--"
2001.01-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1579.428,1587.042,--And why can the object not be accomplished by restrictions in volume rather than restrictions on speech?
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1587.042,1591.938,--Because the restrictions on volume is directed at the overall character of the pharmacist.
2001.01-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.687,1609.687,"Very well, Mr. Kneedler."
2001.01-344,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1609.687,1610.514,Thank you.
2001.01-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.514,1612.372,"Mr. Hoffman, we'll hear from you."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,1612.372,1640.152,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I think in response to some of the Court's questions I would like to give our position, the respondents position and a couple of key points on which there may yet be some confusion, and I start with the proposition of why a compounding pharmacist is not a manufacturer, which seems to be a key point before this Court this morning, and I can understand why."
2001.01-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.675,1681.225,"Mr. Hoffman, I take it all of this is in the record somewhere."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,1681.225,1681.596,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.884,1702.973,May I ask... you have large companies as clients.
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,1714.944,1717.223,"All that is lawful, and all--"
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.223,1719.203,And is that part of the practice that they follow?
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,1719.203,1723.949,"--That is not what they do, except to this limited extent, and I don't want to mislead the Court."
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.937,1767.872,"Under your view of the case, it would be perfectly permissible for them, if they can anticipate a large volume of sales of a particularly tailor-made compound, they could store up a huge inventory and then market it later?"
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,1767.872,1769.275,"--No, Your Honor."
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1769.275,1770.018,Why not?
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,1770.018,1772.868,"My concern is with the word, huge inventory."
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1775.841,1779.472,It's based on a prediction of what the doctors will prescribe.
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,1779.472,1780.875,"--Over the next week or two, yes."
2001.01-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.875,1783.93,Why is it limited to the next week or two?
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,1783.93,1789.958,"Mostly shelf life, and we don't know how long in advance this particular compound--"
2001.01-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.958,1791.749,The shelf life of some of these drugs is only a week?
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,1791.749,1800.277,"--No, we don't know that, but we don't want to go further than a week or 2 weeks for the sake of erring on the side of safety."
2001.01-344,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1818.853,1854.147,"Let me ask you what's going to happen... the Government for some reason did not raise on certiorari the issue of the severability of the advertising provision, so if it is determined here that we should affirm the judgment below, and the cause is not severable, then do we go back to the old regime, which would allow no leeway for compounding?"
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,1854.147,1857.036,"I'm sorry, it would allow no what?"
2001.01-344,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1857.036,1859.265,No leeway for compounding.
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,1864.467,1868.553,"First, we will revert back to the pre-FDAMA area, whatever that was."
2001.01-344,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1944.426,1974.353,"Mr. Hoffman, in doing that, would you take into account what Mr. Kneedler told us this morning, because I put the question to him, what is the difference, and he said, the Government's position is, compounding is a form of making a new drug, that everything fits under the new drug, and that this section is designed to allow a limited kind of new drug-making."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2011.217,2022.074,"And to address that, Your Honor, we turn to 21 United States Code, section 321(p)(1), which defines a new drug, and the Government talks about--"
2001.01-344,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2022.074,2023.965,Where is that?
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2024.591,2026.161,--It's cited in the briefs.
2001.01-344,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2026.161,2027.564,Is it--
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2027.564,2028.861,It's referenced in the briefs.
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.282,2037.595,"--Is the text there, or just the citation?"
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2037.595,2039.164,Just the reference.
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.94,2073.715,"I'm sorry, it's not 5a of the petition."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2074.996,2077.719,"--It's on page 5... I'm sorry, 85a."
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.719,2079.576,"--85a, thank you."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2079.576,2091.382,And in that section it talks about submitting to the FDA for pre-market approval testing to determine safety and efficacy.
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.958,2114.499,"I have difficulty with saying it's so infrequent, on the one hand, and you want to engage in national advertising on the other hand."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2114.499,2116.645,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2116.645,2120.982,"You say it's so infrequently used, but then you say you want the right to advertise nationally."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2120.982,2129.898,"Let us also talk about the national advertising that we allegedly do, and I don't... I think I will come back to respond to the Court's question."
2001.01-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2131.756,2155.616,"You know, you say the national advertising that you allegedly do, well, there's an allegation in your complaint which I presume you don't really want to abandon, that advertising and promotion essential to do business in a market national in scope, and to inform physicians and patients of availability and benefits of the special class, specific classes and types of drugs the plaintiff compounds."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2155.616,2174.025,"But the Government keeps asserting that what we are advertising is finished products, and they try to impress upon the Court, which is absolutely untrue, that the finished product sits on shelves waiting to be shipped out in bulk to individuals or to middle people."
2001.01-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.4,2190.239,"Well, you say in your complaint, you add patients, too."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2190.239,2213.119,"--And to patients, yes, that there are ingredients that are capable of being compounded, and then in working with the physician, a mixture of ingredients, together with the inactive ingredients, will be compounded into a delivery format that's best suitable for a patient, be it a suppository form, an injectable form, an oral form, a pill, a patch form, et cetera."
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2213.119,2217.221,"Mr. Hoffman, what you're telling us is something any doctor would know."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2224.097,2233.302,It is specific in the ingredients that we list as being capable of being put into a compound suitable for a particular patient.
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2233.302,2239.33,"And don't you key it to a particular compound for a particular condition, or a particular kind of patient?"
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2239.33,2246.184,"It will lead to a particular compound in a particular dosage, worked out together between the pharmacist, the patient, and the physician--"
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.184,2246.677,All right.
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2277.392,2282.137,"--We're getting into classes of drugs, and we're getting--"
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.137,2285.331,"All right, classes of drugs and classes of drug-takers."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2286.967,2296.172,"--And if there are classes of patients that require those classes of drugs, physicians do not know, always, what is available for their particular patient, and they have to--"
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.172,2297.658,That's... I'm sure that's true--
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2297.658,2298.484,--Correct.
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2298.484,2309.358,"--and that's a different point, but I mean, this neat distinction between the, in effect, the mass manufacturer and purely idiosyncratic compounding just isn't a neat distinction."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2309.358,2317.144,"And we do not mass manufacture, and for some reason... I apologize terribly that I'm not making that point, because let me explain what we do do."
2001.01-344,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2317.144,2326.365,"Let me just say, my concern here is that you're telling us what the general practice of your particular client is."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2342.862,2343.643,Correct.
2001.01-344,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2343.643,2357.268,"But that's the question that we have before us, and if we affirm the judgment in your favor, you are going to be allowed to do advertising in a lot more specific ways than you now describe, and that's the legal issue we have to decide."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2357.268,2369.9,"That's correct, and given what the Government-asserted interests are, that is to protect public safety, through theoretically ineffective and unsafe drugs, then the ban on advertising doesn't do that at all."
2001.01-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.777,2390.788,"Well, but the advertising ban is surely devoted to keeping demand down, is it not?"
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2390.788,2400.857,"Well, it seems to be, that is correct, and that is a most inappropriate way to address demand, by withholding truthful information from patients and physicians who might benefit from that."
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2400.857,2420.342,"Well, why doesn't it specifically just... what they say, I gather, it's one thing for a doctor, together with his patient, to understand the patient's allergy, or the hesitancy to swallow a pill, and say to the druggist, will you adjust this."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2488.33,2490.727,"There are many wrongs with that, and let me explain."
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2499.682,2502.837,"There's a dialogue, but what they haven't had is the double-blind test."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2502.837,2503.48,Correct.
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2503.48,2506.452,"And Congress in this act says, we don't want dialogue."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2514.997,2523.542,"And the Government won't even change that, their intent of reducing volume theoretically is to protect widespread--"
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2523.542,2526.802,"Oh, it's not quite reducing volume."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2547.979,2561.437,"--Right, and at the end of the day, before any drug can be dispensed, the physician has to write a prescription, he has to approve it, and it makes no difference at which end of the spectrum it commences, because it always ends up with the physician."
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2561.437,2562.18,It makes no difference.
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2576.215,2580.18,What's the harm in the patient going to the physician?
2001.01-344,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2580.18,2598.589,"The harm is that there are no double-blind studies for this particular test, and therefore, while we'll make an exception where the doctor initiates this together with the patient, we don't want Breyer and his friends seeing this on television and putting pressure on their doctors."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2610.56,2622.654,There are innumerable opportunities to preserve and protect the public safety without resorting to First Amendment restriction.
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.654,2626.453,"Of course, the advertising man doesn't just apply that advertising to the general public."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2628.97,2631.737,"I did not hear, I'm sorry."
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.737,2637.394,Does the advertising ban apply only to advertising to the general public?
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2642.428,2643.271,And it's not just--
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.271,2649.487,"My understanding also is that most of your advertising does not go to the general public, but goes to the doctors and medical professionals."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2649.487,2650.313,--That is correct.
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.056,2656.274,So it is not a matter of getting John Q. Public to put pressure on his doctor.
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2656.274,2658.57,--And it is not just advertising.
2001.01-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2717.558,2718.218,"Well, but--"
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2718.218,2718.961,I--
2001.01-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.961,2724.701,"--it's a little less chummy than you make it sound, I think, judging from your complaint."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2746.332,2746.842,--We do.
2001.01-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2746.842,2756.113,"Well, then, your portrait of the intimate relationship between the pharmacist and the doctor I think is a little, perhaps, overblown."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2756.113,2760.738,"It is... with all due respect, Your Honor, it is not, and let me explain why."
2001.01-344,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2791.696,2805.32,"Mr. Hoffman, perhaps I've deflected you before, but you were going to tell us something about this bright line between what's a manufactured drug and what's a compounded drug."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2805.32,2805.979,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-344,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2805.979,2812.008,So how do we tell whether one is a compound and whether it's a new drug?
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2812.008,2827.833,"Under Federal statute, for example, manufacturing is defined as distribution to someone other than the ultimate consumer, and that's found in 21 United States Code, section 360(a)(1)."
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2882.058,2885.773,The definition in 360(a)(1) applies equally to manufacturing and compounding.
2001.01-344,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2885.773,2887.259,"And compounding, yes."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2887.259,2888.085,--I'm sorry.
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2888.085,2897.457,"The definition in 360(a)(1) is a definition of the term, manufacturing, preparation, propagation, compounding or processing."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2897.457,2898.322,Then I may have--
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2898.322,2899.602,It describes them in the same definition.
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2899.602,2900.551,--I may have mis-cited.
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2905.835,2919.953,"Oh, this talks about manufacturing, but it also... what it says is, manufacturing as well as compounding shall include repackaging or otherwise changing the container in furtherance of the distribution."
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2919.953,2920.574,Correct.
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.574,2922.282,It has nothing to do with what we're talking about here.
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2925.98,2927.416,And the other section will be section 374(a)(2).
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2927.416,2929.901,--374(a)(2).
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2929.901,2934.071,"374... actually, it's 374(2), or 360(g)(2)."
2001.01-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2934.981,2936.383,Where do we find these?
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2936.383,2938.24,"Your Honor, I'm sorry, I don't have the reference cites here."
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2938.24,2939.205,"Well, I... you know, I found--"
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2939.205,2940.182,--106(a).
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2940.182,2941.046,I'm sorry.
2001.01-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2941.046,2941.751,106(a).
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2941.751,2946.991,"Well, can I turn to 321(p), which is the other section--"
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2946.991,2949.591,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2949.591,2952.358,"--you cited earlier, and you said that that section makes clear that compounding--"
2001.01-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2952.358,2953.101,--What page are you on?
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.101,2957.022,That's 85a of the Government's petition.
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2964.247,2965.733,No.
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2975.055,2976.302,You said more than it just defines new drug.
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2978.57,2979.684,"--No, but by--"
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.684,2991.385,"And that that's why it's no problem to you if we invalidate the whole statute and you go back to the status quo ante, because you say compounding is not a new drug anyway, right?"
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2991.385,2993.059,--That's correct.
2001.01-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2993.059,2994.34,That was the context in which it came up.
2001.01-344,1,27290,howard_m_hoffman,,2994.34,2994.34,It is not a problem.
2001.01-344,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3368.46,3382.123,"Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress was trying to do here was to make sure that the narrow exemption that it intended did not swallow the critical general rule that new drugs have to be submitted to prior approval."
2001.01-344,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3483.093,3491.721,How does the doctor find out... how does the doctor find out that... he knows that Joe Smith the pharmacist deals with compounding generally.
2001.01-344,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3500.554,3502.002,--That's what he is supposed--
2001.01-344,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3502.002,3502.866,How does he find that out?
2001.01-344,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3502.866,3510.668,"--The pharmacist holds himself out as having pharmacy services and expertise, and that's where the promotion of the consultation and the professional relationship--"
