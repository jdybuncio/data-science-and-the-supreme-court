1978.78-38,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,71.335,We'll hear arguments next in International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers against Foust.
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,75.604,79.344,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-38,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,304.417,306.737,"He knew that, didn't he?"
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,308.958,312.56,"It's not entirely clear, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.78-38,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,322.853,327.154,"Well, it would have been horrible if he knew it was untimely, and then wrote a letter like that."
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,327.154,327.999,No.
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.054,404.778,"In adjudicating this case, do you understand that we shouldn't do so on the assumption that there was breach of duty?"
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,404.778,407.458,"I think you must, Mr. Justice White."
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.862,416.048,"Well, let me ask you another question."
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,428.787,431.712,Let me try to answer that this way.
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,440.096,442.031,"I know, but how about the union?"
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,457.023,457.268,No.
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,462.173,473.224,"So well then what I want to know is, is the question of wrongful discharged open here?"
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,473.224,475.823,We feel it is not open.
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,475.823,479.366,We must assume there was a wrongful discharge?
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,479.366,480.264,I think so.
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.955,503.3,So we judge the case here on the assumption that there was both a wrongful discharge and a breach of duty?
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,503.3,505.013,"I would think so, Mr. Justice White."
1978.78-38,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.013,505.638,And the jury--
1978.78-38,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,505.638,510.953,"So we'd have to reexamine the compensatory damages as well, would we not?"
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,510.953,514.39,If certiorari had not been denied on that I would certainly think so.
1978.78-38,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,514.39,532.787,"And it's your position and no matter how malevolent, or spiteful, or deliberately injurious the intent of the union was, although it may not have been in this case, even if in some other case that were proven, punitive damages can never be allowed as a matter of law?"
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,532.787,548.212,"That is our principal position just as in a 303 action, which is also an action for a statutory tort, no matter how willful or even vicious, as this Court held in Teamsters v. Morton only remedial sanctions are provided."
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.31,711.923,What the language you just referred to literally means?
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,711.923,717.985,"Well we offer Mr. Justice White, two possible explanations for that language in our brief."
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,731.538,735.907,"Well, Vaca said that the damage was caused by the employer?"
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,735.907,736.94,That is correct.
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.94,748.364,"And just a while ago you indicated you didn't think punitive damages, it should be allowed if there were no damages caused by the person I guess whom damages are sought."
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,748.364,758.33,"If the issue were open here Mr. Justice White, we would argue that the award of compensatory damages against the union was plainly improper."
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.33,760.599,Well that was the situation in Vaca?
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,760.599,761.387,That's right.
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.503,763.278,No you have the --
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,763.278,763.687,-- wrong discharge here.
1978.78-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.687,767.744,-- statement that no punitive damages in the circumstances of this case?
1978.78-38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,767.744,769.488,Because there were no damages in the circumstances?
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,769.488,771.571,That's right.
1978.78-38,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.205,879.148,I have a little difficulty with that position.
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,917.405,958.017,Well we think again though Mr. Justice Rehnquist that you have to look to the scheme of the statues and even when Congress amended the Act in 1947 to provide Union Unfair Labor Practices it made no change in its for remedial policy and this Court's decision in Carpenters Local 60 in 1961 was a case where a remedy which this Court held punitive was imposed on a union based on its action vis-à-vis the employees it represented and this Court held the Douze Reimbursement Remedy in that case was punitive and could not stand.
1978.78-38,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.017,985.742,"Well does it necessarily follow, because a union can't be punished for violation of a practice made unfair by the Act of 1947 and an employee or employer can't be punished by the for the Act of 1935 violation, that a union representing an employee and processing a grievance can -- is likewise limited in the damage that can be awarded?"
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,985.742,1015.371,"We think that conclusion does follow Mr. Justice Rehnquist because the entire statutory scheme is one of deliberately providing only remedial relief, and in that case where the Courts have implied the duty of fair representation, we think it would be a quantum leap for the Courts to provide something far beyond anything contemplated by the Congress anywhere in this related group of statues."
1978.78-38,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1113.605,1127.456,"Mr. Cohen, is there any record of the grievance being filed out of time and having been considered in this particular shop?"
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,1127.456,1129.549,"I'm not sure, I understand what you mean by considered?"
1978.78-38,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1129.549,1143.207,"Well, suppose 50 times before a grievance filed two days later had been considered, that would be one thing, if it were uniform and never considered, wouldn't it be different?"
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,1143.207,1147.201,I don't think there is any such showing here.
1978.78-38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1147.201,1148.076,One way or the other?
1978.78-38,0,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,1148.076,1149.535,One way or the other.
1978.78-38,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1317.677,1320.177,Very well Mr. Cohen.
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1322.412,1327.796,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1869.575,1870.813,Mr. Mackey --
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1870.813,1871.375,"yes, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1871.375,1889.156,"All of that transpired before the letter was written, the late letter, could your client had recovered damages from the Union?"
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1889.156,1889.622,From the union?
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1891.562,1892.317,Yeah.
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1892.317,1893.57,"No if they had filed in time, you would have no cause."
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1893.57,1896.891,What was all of that good for?
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1896.891,1897.919,I beg your pardon sir?
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1897.919,1901.653,What is all of that good for us in this case?
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1901.653,1903.216,The question is punitive damages.
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1904.961,1909.036,"He'll sue for any kind of damages, but he couldn't sue for that."
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1915.44,1915.846,No sir.
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1916.068,1919.776,-- I mean his lawyer tells you what you can do with your paper?
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1923.46,1929.812,"I need to ask you sir, if I understand your question correctly, if the Union had filed in time, would Mr. Foust have a cause of action?"
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.812,1930.765,Yes.
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1930.765,1933.833,If the union had filed in time Mr. Foust would have no course of action.
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1933.833,1937.285,And he wouldn't – and certainly couldn't have gotten punitive?
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1937.285,1941.382,No sir.
1978.78-38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.579,1950.261,"Was it ever determined by anybody in this case whether there had been a wrongful discharge that wasn't submitted to the jury, was it?"
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1950.261,1951.272,"No sir, it was not."
1978.78-38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1951.712,1953.805,The judge had kept it from them?
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1953.805,1956.339,The instructions were to the contrary at the request to the union.
1978.78-38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1956.339,1971.731,"What do you think about – I'm just curious about recovering from an Union substantial damages, particularly punitive damages without a determination that there had been a wrongful discharge?"
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1971.731,1979.24,I feel that Mr. Foust should have had the benefit of the determination of the wrongfulness of his discharge.
1978.78-38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.643,1998.07,"Well, Mr. Foust, I would -- suppose that it had been determined in this case that there hadn't been a wrongful discharge, but nevertheless a breach of duty by the Union, what would have been the damages?"
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,1998.07,2002.495,The damages would have been minimum as is suggested by counsel.
1978.78-38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.882,2046.604,"But apparently, there was never any objection in this case at all the instruction, keeping that issue from the jury as to the wrongfulness of the discharge?"
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,2046.604,2049.583,No sir.
1978.78-38,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2230.389,2252.035,"Well, Mr. Mackey is your theory that your punitive damages can be awarded to you under these state law of Wyoming and that Congress has not forbidden it in the Labor Act or that your claim arises for any sort of damages against the Union arises out of the Labor Act?"
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,2252.035,2260.493,Our claim because of the way it was phrased is what is referred to as a statutory tort under the Federal Labor Act itself.
1978.78-38,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.909,2275.602,"Well, I think it's more important than picking names."
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,2295.059,2295.178,No.
1978.78-38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2319.959,2321.402,Had the act never been about --
1978.78-38,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2321.402,2323.157,You would never have any cause of action?
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,2323.157,2329.327,"There would have been no statutory tort, which brings me to the next point that is again now picking names."
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2436.594,2440.289,An unfettered state employer right?
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,2440.289,2441.165,I beg your pardon sir.
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2441.165,2444.439,Does he have a state implied right under common law?
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,2444.439,2447.655,He would have a cause of action under the facts of this case similar to that -–
1978.78-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2447.655,2452.624,Did he have a state implied right under union contract; he wouldn't have had a common law –
1978.78-38,1,43003,terry_w_mackey,,2452.624,2457.798,"Oh, no."
1978.78-38,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2598.293,2602.825,You have anything further Mr. Cohen?
1978.78-38,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2602.825,2619.299,"Briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to comment on two factual aspects. My opponent has referred to the matter of the 1970 grievance, which Mr. Foust attempted to file."
1978.78-38,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2754.457,2766.304,"Mr. Cohen I notice on page seven of the appendix where the amended complaint is set out, that paragraph, one of the complaints is phrased in terms of diversity jurisdiction --"
1978.78-38,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2766.304,2766.442,That is correct.
1978.78-38,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2766.442,2770.116,-- rather than federal question jurisdiction.
1978.78-38,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2785.164,2786.455,I would not think so.
1978.78-38,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2794.03,2797.984,Did the district court recite on what grounds it thought it had jurisdiction or not?
1978.78-38,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2797.984,2799.54,No it did not.
1978.78-38,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2823.74,2827.778,Well now wasn't Farmer a state tort cause of action?
1978.78-38,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2829.839,2831.026,"Yes, that is correct."
1978.78-38,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2885.799,2894.427,"Your sections are too much, well I'm still at the dear sir and brother stage of my knowledge of Labor Law."
1978.78-38,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2894.427,2904.43,"I hope we can take it as given that under the National Labor Relations Act as such the 1935 Act, that only remedial relief is available."
1978.78-38,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.355,2963.021,"What about the 301 law, is it clear that there no punitive damages ever allowed?"
1978.78-38,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2963.021,2964.05,We think so.
1978.78-38,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.387,2972.59,This is against employers?
1978.78-38,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2972.59,2974.421,Again it could be against the either.
1978.78-38,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2980.897,2983.803,And no punitive damages against employee?
1978.78-38,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2983.803,2989.848,I'm not aware of any actual award of punitive damages in any 301 case.
1978.78-38,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.848,2992.694,Well it has it been raised and then rejected or not?
1978.78-38,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2992.694,3001.151,It has -- well it's been expressly rejected by the Third Circuit in the Brooke Shoe decision that we cite.
1978.78-38,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3029.723,3030.354,Thank you gentlemen.
