1984.84-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.82,We will have arguments now in Black against Romano.
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,9.972,23.781,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the respondent, Nicholas Romano, entered a plea of guilty in November of 1976 to two felony counts of the transfer and sale of a controlled substance."
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,192.208,196.01,What was the penalty for the crime?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,196.01,198.279,"--You mean the range of punishment, Your Honor?"
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,199.545,200.529,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,200.529,204.349,The range of punishment for the transfer or sale of controlled substances--
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,204.349,215.907,"No, no, no, no, for the last thing he was convicted of, was charged with, the crime that brought about the revocation."
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,215.907,222.061,"--Oh, the penalty for that crime is, I think, in the vicinity of up to five years' imprisonment, Your Honor."
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,222.961,225.362,Five years for leaving the scene?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,225.362,225.979,"--Yes, sir."
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,231.433,232.483,It is up to five years?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,232.483,232.833,--Excuse me?
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,232.833,234.302,It is up to five years.
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,234.302,235.935,"It is up to five years in Missouri, yes."
1984.84-465,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,253.097,255.316,Where is he now?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,255.316,260.62,"--Mr. Romano, of course, was discharged as a result of the ruling of the District Court."
1984.84-465,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,260.62,261.603,So he is free?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,261.603,262.503,He is free.
1984.84-465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,275.726,276.976,How long did he serve before that?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,276.976,284.665,"He served approximately... he served from... approximately five, a little over five years, I believe."
1984.84-465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,284.665,288.467,"And if the case is reversed, as you would like it to be, what would be the result?"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,288.467,300.275,"Your Honor, our basic contention is that... and as I will get into in much more detail later, is that the revocation hearing was entirely valid, and that being the case, we submit that he should be restored to parole supervision."
1984.84-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,300.275,300.992,Yes.
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,303.894,305.929,It is rather a substantial additional period of time.
1984.84-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,395.003,403.509,How long after the hit and run episode was it before he was apprehended?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,403.509,411.096,After the hit and run it was when he went to the hospital room about 12 hours later.
1984.84-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,421.571,426.223,Any evidence taken on whether he was under the use of drugs at that time?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,426.223,437.779,"No, Your Honor, there is no evidence of that, and of course because Mr. Romano absented himself for eleven hours, we have no idea as to his condition when he was driving, which is not a direct issue in this case, but it is something--"
1984.84-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,437.779,443.349,Anything in the judge's action that indicated that he took that into account?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,443.349,451.938,"--No, Your Honor, it wasn't something that was discussed."
1984.84-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,451.938,459.044,"As a matter of Missouri law, upon a revocation, did the judge actually have any alternative except to do what he did?"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,459.044,463.762,"Well, that is a matter of some uncertainty, Your Honor."
1984.84-465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,509.727,523.885,Has there been any practice in Missouri of violation of a condition of probation automatically to reimpose the prison sentence?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,523.885,525.837,I am not sure I understand the question.
1984.84-465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,525.837,542.198,"When a revocation of probation is sought and the only thing that is established is that there has been a violation of the condition of probation, automatically is there any practice of reimposing the sentence?"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,542.198,544.564,"Your Honor, I really have no statistics on the subject."
1984.84-465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,549.952,550.902,It is?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,550.902,553.104,"Yes, I think that is fair to say."
1984.84-465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.327,734.068,"Well, in the view of the Eighth Circuit, Mr. Morris, was there some way that a trial court could have satisfied this requirement, like making findings of record or something like that?"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,734.068,748.144,"That is how I understand the Eighth Circuit and the District Court's requirement to be, that the court is required to make some sort of record statement by which it can be determined what it was thinking about when it made the decision on sentencing."
1984.84-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.064,878.709,"May I ask, going back to my earlier question, supposing the Missouri law really does allow the judge to exercise a variety of options in this situation, but the judge made a statement on the record that made it perfectly clear that he thought he had no option, that he thought he had to do it as a matter of law, and it later turned out he was wrong."
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,886.28,900.74,"Your Honor, I submit not, because our position is that there is no and should be no constitutional requirement that a judge consider alternatives to incarceration."
1984.84-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.776,912.947,"As long as whatever he does is within the range of permissible conduct at the time, then there is no constitutional review at all?"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,912.947,935.029,"--Well, I admit that is a rather close question, because this Court has acknowledged that, for example, in the sentencing context a sentence can be invalid because the court employs an improper information or improper factual background for its sentencing."
1984.84-465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,935.029,944.234,"Well, in any event, I gather... doesn't, if one is given probation, I gather he has a liberty interest in the probation term, doesn't he?"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,944.234,945.418,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,945.418,950.888,Can that be taken away from him without some kind of process?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,950.888,958.811,"Absolutely, Your Honor, I agree it cannot, but that is exactly what this Court specified in Morrissey and Gagnon, and that is exactly what it has been providing."
1984.84-465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.811,971.386,"I suppose as a practical matter if a defendant was sentenced in what he regarded or had probation revoked in violation of Missouri law, the practical thing to do would be to appeal to the Missouri appellate courts."
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,973.688,975.54,"Your Honor, there are remedies."
1984.84-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,985.611,998.469,"We have been assuming no violation of law, just a misunderstanding of the range of options open to the judge, but he picked one that was within the range, but based on a faulty understanding of the fact that there were other--"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,998.469,998.905,--Your hypothetical.
1984.84-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.905,999.888,--That is my hypothetical.
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,999.888,1000.688,"I mean, there is no evidence of this in this case."
1984.84-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.688,1004.357,"There would be no review as a matter of Missouri law in my hypothetical, I don't think, would there?"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1004.357,1012.213,"Unless... oh, no, not as far as the fact that the judge had not... you know, had... was of the mistaken impression that he was bound by law, no."
1984.84-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1012.213,1014.415,Yes.
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1020.801,1021.935,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-465,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1021.935,1033.709,"And the defendant at that hearing had an opportunity to be represented by counsel, and to argue against the revocation, and--"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1033.709,1034.661,That is exactly what they did.
1984.84-465,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1034.661,1038.796,--address any remarks that he chose to make to the appropriateness of the sentence.
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1038.796,1040.132,Respondent had two attorneys at the hearing.
1984.84-465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1117.465,1134.292,"Tell me, at the revocation hearing, did the respondent's attorneys argue, Your Honor, you can't consider reimposing sentence except as a last resort, you have to consider a lot of other possible alternatives and tell us why you don't adopt one of them?"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1134.292,1134.86,"No, sir, he--"
1984.84-465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1134.86,1136.044,That argument was not made?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1136.044,1140.512,--Nothing regarding the appropriateness of a sentencing decision was said.
1984.84-465,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1282.021,1286.056,"Mr. Morris, what is your position?"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1313.823,1314.492,"The latter, Your Honor."
1984.84-465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.172,1517.155,Isn't there this difference between the two?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1543.805,1544.289,"--Your Honor... well, I will tell you what."
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1573.141,1580.378,"Mr. Attorney General, I asked you before what would happen to this man, and you said he would go back on probation."
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1580.378,1581.314,"Parole, sir."
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1581.314,1581.93,"Oh, parole."
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1581.93,1582.48,I am sorry.
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1582.48,1584.349,"Well, Judge Whipple didn't say that."
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1586.899,1589.134,"Here is the sequence, Your Honor."
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1613.868,1626.609,"Did Judge Whipple in this case send him back and give him 20 years, on Page 108 of the Joint Appendix?"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1627.976,1635.115,"That, Your Honor, is when his revocation was... when his probation was revoked."
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1642.719,1647.522,Is the revocation still in existence?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1647.522,1649.208,The revocation is still in existence.
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1652.743,1657.462,"If you win here, does he get on parole or does he get 20 years?"
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1657.462,1668.52,"Inasmuch as petitioners have released him on parole, and as of the time that his habeas corpus petition was granted he was on parole, all we are asking is that he be restored to parole."
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1671.805,1675.507,What are you going to do with this order of Judge Whipple?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1677.959,1679.811,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think it is a matter of disregarding that order."
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1685.215,1687.081,This is on the revocation.
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1688.933,1690.701,"--Your Honor, as I see it, this is--"
1984.84-465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1690.701,1707.978,"On the revocation the defendant was ordered transported to the reception of the Missouri Department of Corrections at Jefferson City, Missouri, to be kept and confined for a period of 20 years unless sooner discharged according to law."
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1707.978,1709.58,"--Unless sooner discharged, Your Honor."
1984.84-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1709.58,1711.199,Hasn't the parole superseded that sentence?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1711.199,1711.882,Excuse me?
1984.84-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1711.882,1714.734,Hasn't the parole superseded the revocation?
1984.84-465,0,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,1714.734,1720.638,"Your Honor, it is no different than if he were originally sentenced to 20 years, he had done five or whatever he did and was released on parole."
1984.84-465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1801.273,1804.125,Mr. Cherrick.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1804.125,1808.094,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1984.84-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.094,1812.664,Is it clear that your client is now on parole?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1812.664,1814.766,"--Yes, it is clear, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1814.766,1815.682,He is at large.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1815.682,1816.599,He is on parole.
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1979.888,1987.092,"If your probation is revoked, I will have no choice but to simply reimpose the sentence, and you will have to start serving it."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2003.137,2004.103,"Yes, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.909,2034.34,"Then you say that one of the holdings of Morrissey and Gagnon is that a state may not provide by statute for a granting of probation, suspending imposition of sentence, granting of probation on the condition that if probation is revoked for violation of a condition, that you automatically go to jail."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2038.477,2059.39,"Your Honor, we submit that all state and federal courts that have interpreted this issue have held that, and as Justice O'Connor wrote in the Bearden... excuse me... yes, in the Bearden decision, that sentencing courts daily throughout this land consider alternatives to incarceration."
1984.84-465,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2060.656,2061.006,"Yes, of course, counsel."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2084.271,2085.238,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1984.84-465,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2140.942,2158.82,"Well, do you think it is fundamentally unfair to automatically sentence someone to the original sentence that is imposed after the finding on the first offense after the probationer commits a new criminal offense?"
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2158.82,2168.342,"Justice O'Connor, the fact that a probationer commits a crime is not the issue in a probation revocation proceeding."
1984.84-465,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2184.204,2203.682,"My question, though, is whether you think it is a denial of due process to send someone to prison on the original sentence which was on appeal when the probationer commits a new criminal offense in violation of the terms of probation."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2203.682,2204.2,"Well, the court--"
1984.84-465,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2204.2,2205.95,Is that fundamentally unfair?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2205.95,2212.304,"--It is fundamentally unfair if, for example, the probation violation is a technical offense."
1984.84-465,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2287.188,2303.548,Why as a matter of federal constitutional law should a decision to reimpose sentence be initially supported by a conclusion that you are compelled to find that probation has failed?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2316.072,2340.406,"No, Your Honor, that language was from the Eighth Circuit opinion, but our basic point is that there is a requirement that the trial judge look at the facts or the probation violation and see whether it indicated that the probationer could no longer be rehabilitated or supervised in the community."
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2366.656,2372.726,"And the proper criteria in your view, I guess, are mandated by the federal Constitution."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2372.726,2376.095,The process is mandated by the due process clause.
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.095,2377.112,"Well, but the criteria, too."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2399.727,2405.279,"Because, Justice Rehnquist, under Morrissey and Gagnon, the probationer has a significant liberty interest."
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2424.442,2428.56,"Well, but that liberty interest was always freighted with the conditions of parole."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2434.964,2448.308,"That is true, and the only... and the condition of parole or probation in this case that was relevant was the general condition in which Romano stated, I will obey all the laws of the state of Missouri."
1984.84-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2471.756,2476.727,Let me ask you a hypothetical question quite close to this.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2522.356,2533.747,"Mr. Chief Justice, no, because under the facts which you state, that is the classic sentencing situation of which a person is not entitled to significant due process rights."
1984.84-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2549.623,2550.525,How do you--
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2550.525,2550.941,--Pardon me?
1984.84-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2550.941,2551.475,"--Go ahead, finish."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2551.475,2574.891,"But when Judge Whipple then restored Romano's liberty by saying, we, the state believes you can be rehabilitated in the community, that significant liberty interest which, Mr. Chief Justice, you explained and developed in the Morrissey case, that significant liberty interest cannot be taken away without some fundamental due process which protects against arbitrary decisions."
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.891,2589.666,"Well, do I take it that it would not satisfy you if the judge said, I have considered alternatives and find them unsatisfactory, and 20 years?"
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2589.666,2590.3,Justice White--
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.3,2591.852,Would that satisfy you or not?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2591.852,2596.904,--We do not think that there can be any specific formulistic standard as to--
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.904,2603.074,"Well, I know, but let's assume that he made it clear that he has considered alternatives."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2608.712,2609.73,--Not necessarily.
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.297,2611.164,Not necessarily?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2613.016,2617.484,"--Well, under the facts of this case--"
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2617.484,2627.608,"I understood from your colleague on the other side that the court below said he must explain his reasons, not just consider alternatives, but he must explain."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2627.608,2629.625,--We believe that reasons and--
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.625,2630.977,Is that right or not?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2630.977,2637.397,"--Yes, and we believe that reasons and alternatives are nearly synonymous, because probation is by definition an alternative to incarceration."
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.397,2639.916,Well don't run the two things together so fast.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2648.003,2662.329,"It would if the appellate court based on the record thought that the judge had considered the proper criteria, understood the purposes of probation in his decision--"
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.329,2667.166,"Are you familiar with this statement in a case, Townsend against Seay?"
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2727.872,2731.324,"--Justice White, we believe that there must be a record."
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.328,2741.28,"Well, that may be so, but Townsend against Seay was long after that."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2741.28,2750.385,"That is true, but the words of Justice Cardoza, I believe, still have the same force and the same relevance to this case, because in the--"
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2750.385,2757.974,"Well, suppose the judge says, you were paroled, you committed a felony while on parole, and I therefore revoke it."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2762.059,2764.128,--Excuse me.
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.961,2785.225,"The judge says, you were up for consideration of revocation of your parole, you have been convicted of committing a felony while on parole, therefore your parole is revoked."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2785.225,2792.712,"Justice Marshall, the fact that a person commits a felony is not necessarily dispositive."
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2799.699,2800.249,Very well.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2811.507,2828.635,"--Under those facts, we think that there would be no question that the parolee could not be supervised in the community, that he indeed would be a dangerous individual, but that could easily be resolved by a harmless error test on review... on appeal, and in fact--"
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2828.635,2833.687,Wouldn't you be better off if you argued this case instead of 47 others?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2833.687,2834.555,"--That is true, but--"
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2834.555,2836.355,"Well, you have invited it."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2836.355,2844.078,--We do not think that there can be any line drawn as to when under any specific facts alternatives should be considered.
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2844.911,2849.815,And you don't know how much is needed.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2853.183,2874.264,"--We think... we are confident as has occurred in the last 12 years that courts on a case by case basis, which is exactly what has happened, have looked at the facts of each case and determined whether there was prejudicial error, whether there was... whether the probation violation reflected that the probationer could no longer be supervised or rehabilitated in the community."
1984.84-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2874.264,2877.632,That is what you read out of Morrissey and Gagnon?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2877.632,2879.182,"Yes, Your Honor, we--"
1984.84-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2879.182,2888.172,"Well, I have just looked at both of them, and one of us needs to reread them again, because I don't find anything in either of those cases that you have been arguing here."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2888.172,2904.616,--In Gagnon the Court stated that the second step of a prohibition revocation hearing is that the judge should determine whether the probationer should be recommitted to prison or should other steps be taken to protect society and improve chances of rehabilitation.
1984.84-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2920.143,2923.178,What do you think his reasons were on this record?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2930.351,2931.167,But we--
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2931.167,2936.77,"Yes, but you are not complaining about the revocation, are you?"
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2942.238,2944.007,--At the revocation--
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.007,2949.178,You are not saying prohibition shouldn't have been revoked.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2949.178,2953.63,--We are saying that it was simply... we don't know what the judge did in this case.
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2959.066,2965.553,You are not making any factual dispute that he did commit this particular offense.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2967.303,2973.507,--We are willing to defer to the state finding that he committed the offense in question.
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2973.507,2976.509,"Well, didn't he plead guilty?"
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,2976.509,2982.079,"No, he pled not guilty subsequently to the offense and was convicted of careless driving."
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2999.224,3003.345,And that in your view is a federal question in every case?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3003.345,3004.811,--What is a federal question--
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3004.811,3006.297,Can you answer my question?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3008.313,3009.249,--The process?
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.249,3018.955,"No, whether it is a substantial... I use your language, I believe, a substantial probation violation."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3018.955,3022.573,"Yes, that the judge should focus on that criteria--"
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3022.573,3026.192,Is that a federal question in every case?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3026.192,3027.627,--A constitutional question?
1984.84-465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3027.627,3027.944,Yes.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3027.944,3028.927,Yes.
1984.84-465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3070.971,3078.642,"Well, what do you say, Mr. Cherrick, the trial judge should have put on the record here before he pronounced, I revoke?"
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3078.642,3079.226,In this case--
1984.84-465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3079.226,3081.178,Exactly what do you think he should have said?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3081.178,3089.015,"--I think he should have said Romano was driving this car, he hit his friend and drove away."
1984.84-465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3105.309,3106.459,If he had said that much--
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3106.459,3107.509,--That would be sufficient.
1984.84-465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3107.509,3108.395,--you wouldn't be here now.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3108.395,3117.434,"That's true, but the fact is that we don't know what he said, and moreover, we have some indication that he was prepared to revoke probation for any violation."
1984.84-465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3117.434,3121.669,"Even if he had thought all of those things without expressing them, you would not be satisfied."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3124.021,3127.54,"Yes, because if there is no record, there can be no appellate review."
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.54,3132.444,So you think that Chief Justice Warren in his statement in Townsend against Seay was just wrong.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3143.518,3148.636,"If there is a significant liberty interest involved, I think that there must be some protection."
1984.84-465,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3148.636,3151.288,"Well, there certainly was in Townsend against Seay."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3151.288,3160.028,"Well, there is so much discretion that is given to the judge in a probation revocation hearing."
1984.84-465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3181.108,3183.827,"Mr. Cherrick, may I ask you a question that keeps running through my mind?"
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3208.611,3229.041,"No, because while that may have the force of a threat or a deterrent effect, nevertheless if that were the rule in each case, then courts would be prepared to revoke probation for any violation, and that is against the fundamental policies of probation, which is to rehabilitate and supervise people in the community."
1984.84-465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.963,3249.236,"Do you think at the time of sentencing that the defendant is entitled to know that the conditions are not absolute, that if it is a minor violation, that will be taken into account?"
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3259.377,3260.06,--At sentencing?
1984.84-465,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3276.871,3280.807,"Mr. Cherrick, I am just curious about one more point."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3300.887,3317.932,"--Justice O'Connor, as to the remedial question, first, it is supported under Missouri law, and under Missouri law once a probation term has expired, the court must release the probationer from all custody."
1984.84-465,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3376.718,3385.405,"Counsel, what is this memorandum of findings of Judge Whipple on Page 107?"
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3387.671,3390.707,"Yes, but all those findings are as to the evidence."
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3397.194,3411.454,"The court further bases its decision upon the appearance and demeanor of the witnesses and the interests of the witness in the outcome of the trial, and found the victim's mother, father, and sister to be truthful and straightforward in their answers."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3416.59,3431.95,"I want Judge Whipple to say that, yes, there has been evidence of a violation, and now we must consider whether this probationer can no longer be maintained on probation, can he no longer be supervised in the community, is he too dangerous to be--"
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3431.95,3434.136,"And if he just says that, that's it?"
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3434.136,3434.819,--That's correct.
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3434.819,3435.652,That's enough?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3435.652,3440.223,"That's enough, because then we know his decision is not arbitrary, because then--"
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3440.223,3444.775,But he did all he could to say that it wasn't arbitrary.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3447.643,3459.285,"--We believe and we think there is a strong possibility that this judge thought that all he needed to do was find a probation violation, that he need not discuss the second--"
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3459.285,3460.501,"Well, he didn't say that."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3464.171,3465.921,"--Well, he... the record is silent."
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3466.721,3472.208,The judge did not use the words you wanted him to use.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3475.46,3492.089,"Yes, but those words are important, because they reflect whether the judge focused on the proper criteria, and a decision... if decisions... we need a record to be certain that arbitrary decisions are not made."
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3492.089,3497.076,What was not allowed in the record?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3497.076,3498.56,What was not allowed in terms of what?
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3498.56,3500.595,"Yes, you complain that something wasn't in the record."
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3500.595,3502.028,"Right, there was no--"
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3502.028,3504.563,What did you offer that wasn't allowed?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3504.563,3505.998,--Well--
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3505.998,3506.448,What?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3506.448,3508.367,"--no evidence was offered, but this is... we are--"
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3508.367,3510.4,"Well, you didn't offer it, so what are you complaining about?"
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3510.4,3514.104,--Because we believe it is the duty of the sentencing judge.
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3520.758,3522.96,Did you file a motion for that?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3522.96,3523.51,--Pardon?
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3523.51,3530.697,Did you file a motion to that effect before Judge Whipple?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3530.697,3531.347,"No, but--"
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3531.347,3535.951,Is there anything in the record that says you mentioned it to Judge Whipple?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3535.951,3539.237,--It wasn't mentioned because the alternatives were in this case fairly obvious.
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3546.492,3548.042,You want us to tell him.
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3548.042,3554.079,We at least want to know that the judge focused on this criteria.
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3554.079,3555.681,Did you tell him that?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3555.681,3563.185,"No, we didn't tell him that, but that was the law under Morrissey and--"
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3563.185,3566.72,Where is that in the record?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3566.72,3568.089,--Where is--
1984.84-465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3568.089,3572.957,Where is what you told him about what Morrissey says in the record?
1984.84-465,1,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3572.957,3575.793,"--No, we did not inform him about what Morrissey said."
1984.84-465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3575.793,3578.944,Do you have anything further?
1984.84-465,2,32013,john_m_morris_iii,,3578.944,3580.796,"Just one point, Your Honor."
1984.84-465,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3638.483,3639.383,"Thank you, gentlemen."
