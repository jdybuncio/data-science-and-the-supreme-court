2007.07-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.326,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-312, Florida Department of Revenue versus Piccadilly Cafeterias."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,9.059,20.79,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The virtues of reading Congress' grant of the stamp tax exemption, 1146(c), to only post-confirmation transfers is threefold."
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,67.786,69.097,I don't understand that.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,73.299,85.824,"--Well, Justice Breyer, what happens in these situations is that a... for example, a 363 sale order where the property is being sold, in that order there is an exemption granted by the bankruptcy judge."
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,85.824,86.684,But so what?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,104.879,106.129,"Well, that's our point exactly, Your Honor."
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,106.129,106.676,Fine.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,120.671,134.556,"Well, what happens in these situations before confirmation where there is a 363 order that transfers, that the bankruptcy court then says this is entitled to an exemption, at that point in time the State of Florida or whatever State is denied the revenue that would otherwise--"
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,134.556,135.898,"Oh, no, I'm asking you this."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,192.345,193.609,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,193.609,194.155,Of course not.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,278.95,281.199,"Well, two things, Justice Breyer."
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,288.697,290.821,I'm not speaking of the language for the moment.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,315.749,316.342,Sure.
2007.07-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.06,321.011,"I mean, you could say this was Congress, right?"
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,321.011,324.386,--I'm sorry?
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,324.386,325.354,That is not an answer.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,328.212,340.769,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think the practical reason is Congress has created a structured Bankruptcy Code, in which there is a plan confirmation process structure that Congress has provided here."
2007.07-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,349.562,355.075,I suppose one of the reasons would be how far do you go back?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,365.557,367.837,"Well, that's the fundamental problem we have."
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,367.837,369.118,That's the problem?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,374.694,377.144,"Well, there certainly is."
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,378.066,378.644,Okay.
2007.07-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,386.517,398.012,"Well, why does there have to be... there has to be a filing for bankruptcy before you get a plan confirmed, but I didn't understand that to be the threshold before... what does that mean, there has to be a filing for bankruptcy?"
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,401.588,402.119,--Well--
2007.07-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,402.119,406.601,It goes back before then in a lot of cases to look for preferential transfers and things like that.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,406.601,415.489,"--Well, sure, but here what we have is the language of the statute, 1146(c), is keyed in to a key event, which is plan confirmation, the plan confirmed."
2007.07-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,418.332,424.002,I thought your answer to Justice Breyer was saying there's another key event and that's the filing of the petition for bankruptcy.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,424.002,430.764,"--Well, that has... I don't see that as having any relevance as to the authority of the bankruptcy judge to grant the tax exemption."
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,440.743,441.368,What?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,490.021,490.287,No.
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,490.287,492.458,What is the reason?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,494.644,504.734,"Well, as I understand the question, Justice Breyer, you're concerned about the pre-confirmation transfer that ultimately gets wrapped into a plan that's ultimately confirmed and why shouldn't that be occurring?"
2007.07-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.733,506.702,That's what the whole case is about.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,506.702,507.202,--Right.
2007.07-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.59,516.402,He wants a reason why that might be.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,536.442,537.862,"No, in fact--"
2007.07-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.862,542.205,--for someone not to know whether the tax is payable or not for sure until three years later?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,542.205,545.141,"--No, that's exactly our argument."
2007.07-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,545.141,545.766,Isn't that a good reason?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,545.766,550.64,"That's our argument, which is that it is... is not narrowly construing the statute."
2007.07-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.56,560.62,"There's another assumption then that was in Justice Breyer's question about, well, you have to have the petition, the bankruptcy petition."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,568.648,569.474,--Right.
2007.07-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.954,585.516,Absolutely.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,585.516,586.562,--and filing of the plan--
2007.07-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.562,598.199,"You were asked, and I think tried to answer and never got your answer out, and I'd like to hear: What is it you were saying about cases in which pre-confirmation transfers are made and the tax exemption is made?"
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,604.275,605.977,--That's precisely my point.
2007.07-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,612.083,618.596,"Yes, but then the question is, can you nevertheless, in an untimely fashion, eventually get the tax imposed and the tax collected?"
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,618.596,619.829,Possibly.
2007.07-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,626.499,641.697,"Are there also instances... and, again, I'm interested in Justice Breyer's question and Justice Stevens's question, the practical reasons that might have prompted the statute to be drawn in the way that you say it's been drawn."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,652.349,654.159,Yes.
2007.07-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,704.28,708.467,"Counsel, I'm not sure I understand the practical consequences of your position."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,727.068,728.896,--Work in the sense that--
2007.07-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,728.896,735.986,"I mean, will the effect of your plan be that it will discourage people who come along and want to buy a bankrupt business?"
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,735.986,736.298,--No.
2007.07-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,754.526,779.25,"But are you not... are you questioning... what I understand to be the case, it's not at all uncommon for a Chapter 11 these days to have the 363(b) sale of property, then have some kind of global settlement, and then distribute all the assets, never have any kind of reorganization."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,792.51,793.338,There are a number.
2007.07-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.761,832.807,What harm is done?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,838.008,848.55,"--Well, the harm, Justice Scalia, is that in these instances... as I said, in cases where he exemption is being granted unjustifiably, the State has to expend resources on litigation."
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.675,852.204,And it's not the litigation.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,926.018,927.064,--The notice provision is one.
2007.07-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.307,959.693,"What about the solvency of the person who has tentatively been declared exempt from your tax; so, therefore, you can't go get him right away?"
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,971.75,972.89,"--Well, I--"
2007.07-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.89,986.338,"And would it... would it not happen with some frequency that, even though you could have collected the tax three years earlier, by the time it turns out for sure that there's never going to be a Chapter 11 confirmation--"
2007.07-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.338,990.883,"Isn't the tax imposed on the purchaser, not the bankrupt's estate?"
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,990.883,991.711,"--I'm sorry, sir?"
2007.07-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.711,995.241,"Isn't the tax imposed on the purchaser, rather than the bankrupt's estate?"
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,995.241,1003.534,Under... under Florida law it is imposed upon the transaction and is repaid by the buyer or the seller.
2007.07-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1004.221,1011.889,"What I don't understand about the... how the Florida system works, I thought you don't get... you don't get the transfer recorded until you pay the tax."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1014.248,1015.185,--That's correct.
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.698,1025.604,Why can't you just say that?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1039.301,1042.067,"--Well, it becomes an administrative burden."
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1042.067,1043.395,Why is it an administrative burden?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1060.637,1066.041,"Well, again, what is happening with these orders being granted, sometimes the State doesn't even know about it, and sometimes--"
2007.07-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1066.041,1070.93,"Of course, you can't file it if they don't tell the State."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1105.494,1112.913,"--Well, the State of Florida doesn't want to stand in the way of... nor do the other States... in the way of maximizing the value of the estate."
2007.07-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.207,1133.703,"--Mr. Makar, you were going to address, I take it, the assumption that Justice Breyer has asked you to make, which is that the language here is ambiguous."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1138.794,1139.683,"Well, absolutely."
2007.07-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1158.631,1161.614,I don't understand why this is a big deal.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1184.229,1184.838,Well... and then--
2007.07-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1184.838,1188.853,"And that's when you transfer title, and that's when you have to pay the stamp tax."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1188.853,1191.226,"--Well, that, in the ordinary course of things, is what the statute envisions."
2007.07-312,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.66,1201.519,Sometimes don't they want the transfer to be effective whether or not there is a later confirmation?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1208.016,1221.558,"--Well, and that's what happens in some of these cases that are transferred to Chapter 7 or dismissed, where they get the tax exemption and then get out of the Chapter 11 whirl, having gotten the tax exemption, leaving the State to have to unravel what has been done."
2007.07-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1276.13,1276.911,May I just ask this question?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1289.469,1290.204,"--Justice Stevens, it could be both."
2007.07-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1299.092,1302.731,Are there any studies showing how much money you've actually lost by this practice?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1302.731,1303.762,--No.
2007.07-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.879,1323.456,Did I understand you correctly?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1327.658,1328.751,"--Anecdotally, yes."
2007.07-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.573,1354.897,"It would seem to me that, normally, because you do require recording, that there would be... it wouldn't be all that difficult to keep track of all these cases in which there had been transferred pre-confirmation transfers."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1364.221,1367.547,"--Well, that system does not exist."
2007.07-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1375.749,1382.994,"I guess your point is that, as a whole, the virtue of the stamp tax is that it is virtually automatic on recording, and you don't have to send out notices, and so forth."
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1382.994,1383.852,"--Well, absolutely."
2007.07-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1384.979,1386.134,The whole point of the stamp tax.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1386.134,1389.274,"--Absolutely, and it makes it at that point in time certain."
2007.07-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1396.598,1403.455,How long does it typically take from the filing of the petition to confirmation of the bankruptcy plan?
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1403.455,1411.624,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the study I cited to the Court about the number of cases it could be... has data in there."
2007.07-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.361,1455.779,"Is it... another question I had: Is it not true that even under your rule there will be a number of cases that, even though it was clear that the transaction was after the confirmation, there's an issue as to whether it was under the plan?"
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1455.779,1463.338,"That issue could actually arise; and that was the Jacoby case that, in our view, sort of spawned a lot of the problems here."
2007.07-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1479.644,1483.002,I had one question as to operation of the tax in Florida.
2007.07-312,0,38130,scott_d_makar,,1495.871,1498.933,There is a refund mechanism for certain situations.
2007.07-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1511.224,1511.974,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1528.624,1536.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The scarcest and most precious commodity in a Chapter 11 case is cash."
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1602.798,1612.044,"Because you don't know whether that second one will ever be a sale under a plan, which is what the code requires."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1620.884,1624.71,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think that depends on how you define the term ""under""."
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1626.225,1630.459,At the time it occurs it doesn't matter how you define the term.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1636.596,1638.299,"--There has not been a confirmed plan, but there is often--"
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.299,1640.33,It requires under a plan confirmed.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1640.33,1644.406,"--Well, it requires that there be a plan confirmed."
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.983,1650.108,"It says ""a plan confirmed""."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1655.59,1658.215,"--You don't necessarily know, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1658.215,1658.668,You don't at all know.
2007.07-312,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1658.668,1664.867,"In fact, you do know, I presume, on the statistics that the odds are three to one against there being a confirmed plan."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1664.867,1672.88,"Yes, Justice Souter, but that underscores how difficult it is to confirm plans in Chapter 7, why Congress wanted to make it easier by providing this tax relief."
2007.07-312,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1676.097,1680.283,I am... I don't quite follow the leap you just made.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1680.283,1684.171,"--Well, the whole purpose of 1146(a) is tax relief."
2007.07-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1704.084,1720.11,"I thought, Mr. Brunstad, that the question was asked: So the State is not going to get its tax at the time of the asset transfer, because the cash is needed to eventually have a plan that works."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1736.682,1745.21,"Justice Ginsburg, the practice is to escrow the funds so they will be available as an administrative expense if it turns out there is no confirmed plan."

2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1756.596,1758.189,"That is the practice, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1770.153,1790.097,"So there is no case, to your knowledge... not millions of dollars, but there is no case, to your knowledge, where, in fact, people transferred the assets; they thought there would be a plan confirmed; there was no plan confirmed; and then the State was not paid?"
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1790.097,1793.033,"None that I'm aware of, Justice Breyer."
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.446,1820.445,You would have no reason to know the answer to that question.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1830.692,1832.8,"That's because the exemption applies, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-312,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1839.017,1853.62,"Isn't it odd that the... isn't it odd that the Congress would have required, we will assume, this escrow procedure when the odds are three to one against the non-taxability?"
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1866.615,1875.471,"No, Justice Souter, because the purpose of Chapter 11, as we know, is to facilitate reorganization, rehabilitation, saving jobs."
2007.07-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1892.167,1903.662,"Is it often the case... and I don't know, but is it often the case that the people who are engaged in one these asset purchases are, in fact, the creditors themselves?"
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1909.487,1912.47,"Sometimes, Chief Justice Roberts, but not often."
2007.07-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1961.061,1964.903,"Well, I assume that the creditors have an interest in that as well."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1982.723,1986.847,"Chief Justice Roberts, the answer to that question is that the creditors have diverse interests."
2007.07-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2017.803,2020.599,You say the test is whether it is instrumental.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2024.222,2027.018,"That is a standard that we offer, Justice Alito."
2007.07-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2027.018,2028.19,"That is different from ""necessary""?"
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2028.19,2029.595,"Yes, it is."
2007.07-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2031.126,2032.312,"Well, what does it mean?"
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2032.312,2036.983,"Well, basically, Justice Alito, it encompasses almost any pre-confirmation transfer."
2007.07-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2056.007,2061.534,I understand your arguments about the desirability.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2064.347,2065.487,"Well, a couple--"
2007.07-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2065.487,2070.61,Under a plan and you're suggesting that it's under the plan before there is a plan.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2070.61,2078.795,"--Well, the standard... the test at 1146(a) requires that there be a plan confirmed under section 1129."
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.601,2104.456,You missed the crucial... the crucial part.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2108.017,2118.154,"--But we know, Justice Scalia, that in... where the same language is used, in section 365(g), it cannot possibly mean post-confirmation events."
2007.07-312,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2209.086,2220.551,"Is it relevant, as your friend on the other side pointed out, that the particular section in question occurs within the statute under the general heading of ""Post-Confirmation Matters""?"
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2220.551,2221.395,"No, Justice Souter."
2007.07-312,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2251.29,2272.155,"But isn't the... isn't the normal reading, if we're going to give any weight to the placement in the statute at all... and I think we're entitled to give some, that unless there is the kind of clarity that you've just been describing in these two exceptions, that, in fact, the placement there indicates that it is dealing with a post-confirmation matter?"
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2272.155,2281.839,"I think it is entitled to some weight, Justice Souter, but I think it is completely undercut by some of the very provisions of subchapter 3 by their terms apply to pre-confirmation events."
2007.07-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2295.537,2303.392,"Mr. Brunstad, there's an aspect of the way this looks that I don't understand, and you're an expert in this area."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2360.605,2362.165,"That's an excellent question, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.047,2473.12,"What is the section you mentioned earlier that uses ""under"" in a sense that clearly applies to pre-confirmation?"
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2473.12,2475.26,"Section 365(g), Justice Scalia."
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.26,2475.885,"I'm looking for it, and I can't--"
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2475.885,2479.087,We quote it in part on page 38 of our brief.
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.507,2485.382,--Did you make that argument there?
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2485.382,2487.083,Yes.
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.627,2502.187,How does that provision read?
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2503.234,2504.405,"--I do, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-312,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2594.181,2594.571,Why?
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2594.571,2615.28,"--Because the debtor has to elect... the debtor has to make a decision before confirmation so we know what's going to happen to the property, and so the creditor can timely final a claim if it is going to be rejection, because the creditor does not file a claim for rejection damages for rejection of the contract until the assumption or rejection is determined."
2007.07-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2698.014,2704.715,"Your argument there is that ""under a plan confirmed"" means something different than ""under a confirmed plan""?"
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2704.715,2706.543,"--In context, yes, Chief Justice Roberts."
2007.07-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2723.303,2730.112,Do you... do you agree with the proposition that you only go back so far as the filing of the petition?
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2744.216,2757.398,"By statute, Chief Justice Roberts, section 103 provides that the provisions of Chapter 11, in Chapter 11, including section 1146, apply only in a Chapter 11 case."
2007.07-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2757.82,2763.865,"Yes, but we've already shown a willingness to abandon that type of limitation with ""under a plan confirmed""."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2771.704,2786.683,"--The only sections that apply basically to pre-bankruptcy, pre-petition matters, are the avoidance powers in section, for example, the preference actions in section 547, the fraudulent transfer provisions in section 548."
2007.07-312,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2821.279,2822.263,Let me just ask this.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2833.555,2834.79,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
2007.07-312,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.367,2839.054,So it would have to be after the filing of the bankruptcy proceeding.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2839.054,2840.866,"Yes, Justice Stevens, it must."
2007.07-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2891.033,2893.718,How do you know whether to pay the tax or not?
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2905.089,2905.73,"--Well, for example--"
2007.07-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2905.73,2908.197,I assume there are penalties if you don't pay on time.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2908.197,2920.317,"--There's a very practical reason for that question, Chief Justice Roberts, and that is in this case the Bankruptcy Court specifically determined in his order, judge in his order, that the exemption would apply."
2007.07-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2922.567,2926.051,"But this doesn't happen for some time down the road, right?"
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2926.051,2926.409,--Well--
2007.07-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2926.409,2929.751,"Up to, I guess... we were told up to 400 days."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2929.751,2932.517,"--Well, you can't have a sale until the Bankruptcy Court approves it."
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2959.41,2960.504,It's always escrowed?
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2961.504,2963.472,"--It's not always escrowed, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2963.472,2964.003,--Is that a uniform practice?
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2964.003,2968.516,"That is the practice, but it's not uniform because in some cases there's no need for an escrow."
2007.07-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2980.465,2983.136,Is it relevant that this is a tax-exemption provision?
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2983.136,2995.599,"Well, I think it's relevant in the sense that Congress was clearly intending here to grant tax relief to Chapter 11 debtors to facilitate the Chapter 11 process."
2007.07-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3029.68,3039.394,Why shouldn't we look to see how it was in the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the Federal State tax exemption?
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3070.945,3076.489,That's the limitation that the United States wanted to add to section 267 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898.
2007.07-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3109.508,3114.239,"Well, what was... what did section... I'm not talking about... you mentioned 267."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3120.534,3122.673,"I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?"
2007.07-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3122.673,3128.452,Section... 26 U.S.C. 4382(b).
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3128.452,3130.56,4382(b)?
2007.07-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3130.56,3130.967,Yes.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3130.967,3132.795,Was that the revenue provisions--
2007.07-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3132.795,3134.763,That was in the 1954 Code.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3136.995,3139.245,"--That one I'm not certain of, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3139.245,3147.367,I thought that said that the tax exemption was limited to transfers post-confirmation.
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3147.367,3150.304,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3162.408,3177.652,"Maybe you can straighten me out, because where I get this from is the brief for the State, and it's at page 17, mentions the now-repealed 4382(b)."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3177.652,3181.227,"--That may, Justice Ginsburg, have been a mirror provision."

2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3259.149,3260.476,"--Yes, Justice Scalia?"
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3260.476,3266.412,"You know, we've said in other opinions no... no statute pursues its purposes at all costs."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3286.763,3304.6,"Well, that... that's true in general, Justice Scalia, but if Congress had really wanted to narrow the purpose here to post-confirmation, it would have surely used the temporal limitations it used, for example in section 1127, where the Court said before... the Congress said before confirmation you do this; after confirmation you do that."
2007.07-312,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3311.206,3320.874,"Maybe, but ""under a plan confirmed"" seems under normal interpretation of language to me to mean under a plan that has been confirmed."
2007.07-312,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3320.874,3323.841,"Well, I think, Your Honor, as the Court stated in Ardestani, quote,"

2007.07-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3462.1,3462.427,All right.
2007.07-312,2,38130,scott_d_makar,,3472.502,3475.58,"Well, I'm not sure I am following."

2007.07-312,2,38130,scott_d_makar,,3508.519,3508.769,--No.
2007.07-312,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3519.156,3527.184,So your argument is that you don't have a rejection of the executory conduct... contract... until the plan is confirmed?
