1985.84-1903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.706,The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Puerto Rico Associates against Tourism Company of Puerto Rico.
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,15.86,18.712,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,179.282,186.971,"Ms. Soto, didn't the Superior Court Judge substantially restrict the literal language of the statute when he interpreted it?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,186.971,193.875,"Yes, it did, Your Honor, but it did not cure the unconstitutionality of the statute as we would argue."
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.875,196.41,"Well, what's left of the statute now?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,207.968,217.491,The statute as construed still prohibits completely all information if it's addressed to the residents of Puerto Rico.
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,227.481,234.218,"Well, is it media advertising that it now covers, as the court below has construed it?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,234.218,234.785,"Well, Your Honor--"
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,234.785,241.456,What if a matchbook with the name of the casino came into the hands of a resident of Puerto Rico.
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,245.676,253.949,"--According to what the Judge decided, if it was aimed at the tourists it would not be prohibited."
1985.84-1903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.545,337.436,"Isn't your First Amendment argument the same, though, whether the statute distinguishes between ads aimed at tourists and ads aimed at Puerto Ricans?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,344.007,345.04,That's what it does.
1985.84-1903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,345.376,350.26,"Well, it doesn't ban ads aimed at tourists?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,350.26,358.433,"--As the Court rewrote it, which we understand is what the Court did, and it is impermissible in our view."
1985.84-1903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,366.122,379.847,"While I have you interrupted, your general submission is that the First Amendment requires... or forbids stopping any ads about any legal business?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,379.847,396.058,"If it's an absolute ban and it leaves no channels open of communications to the residents of Puerto Rico in this case, and the activity is legal, we understand that unless there is a substantial interest by the government, which has not been proven in this case, it is unconstitutional, yes."
1985.84-1903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.058,400.926,"Well, what if... would you say it would be unconstitutional for Puerto Rico to say,"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,408.782,416.971,"We have no quarrel whatsoever, Justice White, on having more speech on it if we have to, rather than silencing and keeping the people uninformed altogether as a means."
1985.84-1903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.971,429.695,Under your argument would it be unconstitutional if Congress forbade all advertising of cigarettes?
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,429.695,434.516,"In the case of cigarettes, I find a substantial distinction in that cigarettes--"
1985.84-1903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.516,437.116,It's not illegal to smoke.
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,437.116,438.634,--It is not illegal to smoke.
1985.84-1903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.634,440.753,It's not illegal to manufacture cigarettes.
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,440.753,442.17,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,442.703,452.894,"Why would a... why, under your argument, would a complete ban on cigarette advertising be bad or good?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,452.894,454.244,--I haven't said that it's good.
1985.84-1903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,457.145,457.58,Why?
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,457.58,461.416,"--Well, first of all it is harmful to your health according to studies."
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,472.655,482.58,Don't you think that Puerto Rico could prohibit gambling altogether and make it illegal because Puerto Rico could determine that it's bad for the citizens?
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,482.58,484.18,"--Yes, I do, Your Honor, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,494.055,494.405,Well--
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,494.405,496.305,"--Through speech, control it."
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,496.305,505.445,"--Well, suppose you have a state like Alaska that has legalized the use of marijuana, personal use of marijuana."
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,509.497,524.674,"I think once having legalized it... I am not familiar with the case of the marijuana statute in Alaska, but once having legalized it, I think it can be restricted through a means and manners restriction."
1985.84-1903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,535.382,545.403,"So, it would be unconstitutional then to forbid ads about cigarettes, smoking, as long as smoking is legal?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,545.403,546.855,As long as smoking is legal.
1985.84-1903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,554.526,557.895,What about marijuana?
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,557.895,560.013,"That would be the same thing with marijuana in that case, then."
1985.84-1903,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,605.442,614.215,"May I ask this question, publications in the United States magazines and newspapers do circulate in Puerto Rico, don't they?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,614.215,615.167,"Yes, they do."
1985.84-1903,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,615.167,617.536,"New York Times, Time, Newsweek and so forth?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,617.536,618.585,Yes.
1985.84-1903,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,618.585,626.391,Does the statute ban... would the statute ban your casino from advertising in those publications?
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,626.391,629.426,The statute did ban all kinds of media.
1985.84-1903,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,641.651,651.173,"Under the construction of the Superior Court, your, client could run items in publications in the United States if it's circulated in Puerto Rico?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,651.173,652.79,"Yes, under the construction of the Court, yes."
1985.84-1903,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,652.79,656.827,"In other words, if the ban is limited to local media?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,656.827,659.445,"Correct, under the construction."
1985.84-1903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.004,785.075,"Ms. Soto, were all four of these instances after the Superior Court Judge issued his ruling?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,785.075,786.509,"Yes, Your Honor, they were all there."
1985.84-1903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,786.509,792.18,"And are they all, in the views of your opponent, so far as you know, consistent with the Superior Court's Judge's ruling?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,792.18,793.046,Yes.
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,847.165,857.873,"Ms. Soto, I thought the fines were imposed before the Superior Court made its final interpretation of the statute?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,857.873,858.473,That is correct.
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,860.241,863.443,You just told Justice Rehnquist it was after.
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,863.443,864.143,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,870.263,888.742,"It was my understanding that the determination of the Superior Court when it in effect rewrote the statute, if that's what it did, that the Judge did that after all these fines he did impose?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,888.742,889.142,--Yes.
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,895.129,904.652,"Well, then, why shouldn't we proceed with the argument over what's left of the statute, rather than what happened before?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,904.652,907.02,--These were the facts that brought the case up.
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,926.865,927.767,"Well, didn't--"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,927.767,929.25,--as it was is the one that should be construed by this Court.
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,929.25,936.373,"--But, aren't we bound by the interpretation of the statute by the courts in Puerto Rico?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,936.373,938.806,"I don't think that has been decided, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,947.812,959.988,"If the action came from a state, would we not consider as binding the interpretation of the statute by the court below?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,959.988,962.838,--I think you would in matters of local law.
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,964.19,971.344,"Would the state cross-appeal, or make a cross-filing here about the court's interpretation?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,971.344,972.046,--No.
1985.84-1903,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,972.046,978.866,"No, so don't we... shouldn't we just follow the ruling of the court below as a matter of local law?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,978.866,989.591,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because the state deference will not preclude the Court... this Court's role as the final arbiter of the Federal Constitution, when it means the invalidation of a statute."
1985.84-1903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,989.591,996.161,But all Justice O'Connor is asking about is the matter of how the statute is intended to read.
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,999.297,1002.332,Not if it clashes with the Constitution of the United States.
1985.84-1903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1002.332,1008.053,"No, no, but as to how broadly the statute sweeps."
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,1010.754,1012.37,"If this Court decides to defer, yes."
1985.84-1903,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1026.364,1028.382,May I ask you a question at this point.
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,1042.107,1046.511,"If it's addressed to the residents of Puerto Rico, everything that has to do with a casino is still prohibited."
1985.84-1903,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.48,1060.835,"One of the incidents was being fined, as I understand it, for this press conference with the black ribbon across the slot machines and so forth, and the word ""casino"" appeared in the story."
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,1064.655,1070.809,"--I think so, because that's precisely why I brought the example of a recent case that happened just this December."
1985.84-1903,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1518.478,1525.482,"--Ms. Soto, before you sit down, of no importance but is this the old Condado Beach Hotel or a new one?"
1985.84-1903,0,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,1525.482,1527.001,"No, it's a different one, Your Honor."
1985.84-1903,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1532.57,1536.106,Thank you.
1985.84-1903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1536.106,1540.724,Mr. Saldana.
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1540.724,1545.128,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1903,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1619.509,1624.244,"Mr. Saldana, what do you say is left of the statute?"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1631.667,1640.422,"--That is the question, precise question, that must be addressed in the first instance."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.482,1707.484,"But may I ask you, just on that right now."
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1707.484,1707.85,Yes.
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.85,1712.552,Supposing... could they advertise in a local newspaper?
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1712.552,1714.438,"They could, yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1714.438,1714.904,They could?
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1714.904,1721.107,"They could, provided the advertisement is not addressed to residents."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1723.359,1727.811,But if the newspaper... supposing you have a newspaper of general circulation in San Juan.
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1744.29,1756.981,"--I would say that if in the advertisement, Your Honor, it is stated that this advertisement is addressed to tourists and not to residents, that that leaves it permissible."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.981,1764.82,"Even though 99 percent of the people who buy the newspaper are really not tourists, it's still all right as long as they put in the ad,"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1768.022,1774.709,"Well, nobody but tourists are invited to visit the casino."
1985.84-1903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1788.452,1791.988,But they don't prohibit them?
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1795.023,1796.558,"Oh, yes, sir."
1985.84-1903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1797.625,1799.76,"Well, what does the advertisement say,"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1805.58,1823.875,"--No, they are saying, you legally can go but the demand for gambling among residents should not be stimulated artificially, should not be increased by advertisements from casinos."
1985.84-1903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1879.946,1882.663,"Well, in some places it is."
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1885.015,1887.182,"Yes, but there is no tourist--"
1985.84-1903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1887.182,1888.117,You don't need a passport?
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1888.117,1897.073,"--Normally don't need passports in Puerto Rico, and we don't have any ID cards issued by the government."
1985.84-1903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1897.073,1906.113,There's no law that prohibits local persons from gambling in a casino in Puerto Rico?
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1906.113,1907.296,That is true.
1985.84-1903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1907.296,1909.765,It's just as legal as going to church?
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1909.765,1911.933,Yes.
1985.84-1903,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1911.933,1925.757,"Mr. Saldana, what is this most recent criminal investigation that's going on concerning the Posadas that has arisen since the Superior Court interpretation?"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1925.757,1929.494,It does not concern Posadas at all.
1985.84-1903,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1939.117,1942.136,"All right, and for what activity is it?"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1942.136,2005.978,"--The advertising appeared in a newspaper when the New San Juan Hotel was opened, and the New San Juan Hotel has a casino and they published a 35-page supplement in a newspaper about the wonderful new casino and all of its facilities, and one of the pages was an advertisement describing in detail the gaming facilities, how many tables, gaming tables they were, what the roulettes were, what the card games available there were, and that it was the best casino in all the world."
1985.84-1903,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2007.928,2014.567,And would it have been all right if they had added in it that local residents shouldn't read it?
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2017.786,2026.725,"--In my view, if that advertisement had been addressed to tourists exclusively, there would be no prohibition."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.321,2155.758,"I suppose that would be rather expensive advertising for one community to have to advertise in a national publication in order to distribute locally, wouldn't it?"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2155.758,2157.943,"Well, it is a restriction, Your Honor."
1985.84-1903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2201.539,2209.727,"Would you say the average tourist in Puerto Rico knew there was gambling, before he went?"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2209.727,2212.779,"--No, no, sir."
1985.84-1903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2216.215,2221.05,"Isn't that the reason he went, for the average tourist?"

1985.84-1903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2231.175,2232.391,Two or three.
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2232.391,2236.145,"--Yeah, but... no, I don't think so."

1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2263.462,2264.962,"--I have no idea, Your Honor."
1985.84-1903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.962,2266.164,Just guess.
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2266.164,2282.758,"I know that the hotels in Puerto Rico, there are 13 gambling casinos, ten of them in the San Juan area, and three of them outside."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.312,2394.447,"Mr. Saldana, let me ask you a question about procedure in Puerto Rico."
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2406.922,2407.374,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.374,2411.642,"And secondly, it said, considering the writ filed as a revision, it is denied."
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2418.529,2419.398,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.398,2422.633,"So, to what extent, then, have they... is there a precedent?"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2429.654,2441.578,The rejection of the appeal for lack of a substantial constitutional question is equivalent to an affirmance of the Superior Court--
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.578,2444.88,As to being no constitutional violation?
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2444.88,2446.082,--That is so.
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.082,2451.118,"But not necessarily an affirmance of its interpretation of the statute, I take it?"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2451.118,2467.329,It is an affirmance of the... it is like an affirmance by this Court of a judgment when the appeal is summarily dismissed.
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.329,2468.062,Right.
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2477.585,2486.374,"It ultimately dismissed the complaint, but in its interpretation it went a very long way."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2486.374,2493.196,"Yes, but the judgment of the Supreme Court merely affirmed the judgment, which was dismissing the complaint, is that right or am I wrong?"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2493.196,2499.116,"Well, it affirms the judgment and the reasoning, and the reasoning is--"
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.116,2500.316,The reasoning?
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2500.316,2501.968,--Yes.
1985.84-1903,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2671.078,2690.476,"Mr. Saldana, in the Superior Court's opinion, in its Conclusion of Law 13, the Superior Court said that the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States are applicable to the controversy."
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,2699.581,2700.831,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3096.39,3101.908,"Mr. Saldana, may I ask you another question about the procedure in this case."
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,3128.558,3151.504,"Well, I interpret that, Your Honor, to mean that the enforcing agency can change... can adopt new rules as to things that are not decided in the opinion, but the Court was not telling the enforcing agency, ""You can change my judgment"", because they it would be a nullity."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3151.504,3152.173,"But he says,"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,3155.725,3175.956,"Well, yes, I interpret that, that they may be amended to include new things, to make new provisions, but that the judgment it renders, the declaratory judgment, is of course valid and binding between appellant and the tourism company."
1985.84-1903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.956,3177.339,I see.
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,3177.339,3189.029,"Now, we... going back to the merits, the issue here is simple in a sense."

1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,3241.664,3249.501,"--Yes, so that the only alternative would be to get rid of casino gambling, because I believe that Puerto Rico--"
1985.84-1903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3249.501,3252.12,"You'd lose all the taxes, wouldn't you?"
1985.84-1903,1,35152,lino_j_saldana,,3252.12,3264.96,"--We lose... we would lose, Your Honor, not only the taxes but the help that casino gambling tourists give to the tourism industry in Puerto Rico."
1985.84-1903,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3332.522,3336.309,"Do you have anything further, Ms. Soto?"

1985.84-1903,2,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,3481.334,3482.27,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1985.84-1903,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3482.27,3482.886,Was that in the--
1985.84-1903,2,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,3482.886,3483.636,It is on the record.
1985.84-1903,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3487.89,3491.509,"--It's in your reply brief, but it was not in the record before the trial court because it didn't happen before?"
1985.84-1903,2,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,3491.509,3492.742,"No, it didn't happen before."
1985.84-1903,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3501.298,3507.119,May I ask you just one more question that puzzles me about the... what is all this business about the use of jackets by men?
1985.84-1903,2,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,3508.803,3524.847,"That was a [inaudible] question that arose while the case was being tried by the judge, whereby they required a jacket to go into the casinos to the men, while they didn't require proper attire for women, and the court found that it was unconstitutional."
1985.84-1903,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3529.884,3532.586,Was that a challenge that you and your client had made against--
1985.84-1903,2,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,3532.586,3536.805,"We have made a claim but the court became aware of it, and thought it was unconstitutional and--"
1985.84-1903,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3536.805,3540.04,--And just sort of threw it in the... okay.
1985.84-1903,2,36604,maria_milagros_soto,,3540.04,3547.779,"--The problem... the problem still exists with the statute as construed, in addition that it can't be changed."
1985.84-1903,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3596.343,3597.443,"Thank you, Counsel."
