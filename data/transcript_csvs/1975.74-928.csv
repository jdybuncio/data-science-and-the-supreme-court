1975.74-928,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,37.649,We will hear arguments next in United States against Dinitz.
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,42.115,45.076,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.63,229.654,"Mr. Rupp, was the opening statement made before any testimony was presented or at the closing of prosecution's case?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,229.654,233.354,"Yes, it was made before any testimony was presented."
1975.74-928,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,285.532,290.178,I understood he was excluded from the courtroom and the building and told do not ever come back?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,290.178,291.474,That is correct.
1975.74-928,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,291.474,295.352,Is that disbarment?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,295.352,299.973,"Well, Mr. Wagner had never been admitted to practice before the Northern District of Florida."
1975.74-928,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,304.176,307.165,"Such as barred, not disbarred?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,307.165,308.395,"Yes, and not by double jeopardy."
1975.74-928,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,308.395,314.674,"Do you have any other case where a man was told to get out of the building, a lawyer?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,314.674,317.442,"Well, I cannot cite you a specific case."
1975.74-928,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,326.974,328.222,I said the building?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,328.222,329.949,Or from the building.
1975.74-928,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,330.088,332.399,I said out of the building?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,332.399,343.167,"Well, it seems to me that the formulation used by the Court in this case to exclude Mr. Wagner from the courtroom may have been too colorful."
1975.74-928,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,347.401,352.061,"It was not just colorful, if he came back in he would be arrested, it is not just colorful?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,352.061,356.352,"Had he returned to the courtroom, it is at least arguable that he would have been in contempt of court?"
1975.74-928,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,356.352,359.173,"He told the marshal, you make sure he gets out the building?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,359.173,363.712,"That is correct and on this facts, we submit to you that that was appropriate."
1975.74-928,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,365.567,373.61,"You mean every time a lawyer annoys the judge, he should be abolished from the building because you said all he did was annoy him, that was your word?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,373.61,379.092,"What I said was that during the motion to suppress, he had annoyed the judge."
1975.74-928,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,499.348,508.424,"Mr. Rupp, does the record show whether the alternatives that were presented by the judge included the possibility of a continuance?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,508.424,511.139,"Yes, it does show that."
1975.74-928,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,558.729,562.232,"As a matter of fact when he was actually tried, he tried himself?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,562.232,562.978,That is correct.
1975.74-928,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,578.952,587.619,Was the respondent given the option of electing to have a continuance?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,587.619,596.178,"The session in chambers was suspended to permit him to consider not only the propriety of a mistrial at that point, but other options."
1975.74-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.98,640.976,"You do have some problem with the continuance once the jury has been empaneled, do you not, because you could not simply go to another jury, it would have to be at least during life of that jury panel that the case was retried?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,640.976,666.148,"That is correct and I do not know what the life of this jury was, although perhaps should have a further point here and that is that the court was concerned about publicity that had attended this case, publicity in the press and at the time that he ultimately declared a mistrial, he referred specifically to the publicity as posing in his view a problem."
1975.74-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,910.342,914.404,Were either Downum or Gori motions by the defendant for mistrial?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,914.404,919.842,"No, in both of those cases the mistrial was declared by the court sua sponte."
1975.74-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,919.842,929.773,"We have never held in this Court, have we, after the defendant himself moved for a mistrial that the re-prosecution was barred by Double jeopardy in any particular case?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,929.773,931.524,"No, you have not."
1975.74-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,948.293,958.612,How do you read that language as overreaching as meaning to as trying the defendant of a very possible favorable verdict from the jury?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,958.612,960.438,That is correct.
1975.74-928,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,973.938,978.611,That is by deliberate misconduct on the part of the prosecutor?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,978.611,979.486,That is correct.
1975.74-928,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,979.486,985.689,"But wait because you remind -- refresh my recollection just a movement over the facts in Jorn, who moved for a mistrial there?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,986.335,987.949,It was sua sponte as well.
1975.74-928,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,989.961,997.122,"Mr. Rupp, what happened to the rule that in order to have Double Jeopardy, you now have to have a jury, you would had to call a witness, what happened to that rule?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,997.122,1002.585,"Well, that is still the rule in cases that are tried to the Court."
1975.74-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.299,1216.62,How much weight do you accord to the fact that the defendant moved for mistrialt?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1216.62,1218.588,I attached very significant weight to that.
1975.74-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.588,1227.867,Do you think you will have a different position if the court itself had on its own motion said in view of the circumstances here I declare a mistral?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1227.867,1229.276,Declare a mistrial.
1975.74-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.777,1233.601,But now?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1233.601,1251.382,"Now, if this case were being measured pursuant to manifest necessity standard as we argued in our main brief, we believe that the declaration of a mistrial by court sua sponte at the point at which the mistrial was declared was justified by manifest necessity in the ends of public justice."
1975.74-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1251.382,1258.656,"And I suppose you would arrive at that result, whether you consider the exclusion to be error or not?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1258.656,1259.237,That is correct.
1975.74-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1291.076,1306.801,"Let us assume that it was error and then make a manifest necessity argument, would it not be just that the judge realized that it was error and that there was inevitable error in the record and rather than waste everybody’s time and energy and --"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1306.801,1307.11,Money.
1975.74-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1308.749,1310.449,That is what you mean by manifest necessity?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1310.449,1311.655,"Yes, that is correct."
1975.74-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1311.655,1318.454,"Manifest necessity is not the same when the defendant moves for a mistrial, say as when the prosecutor moves for a mistrial?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1318.454,1332.603,"No and this Court has recognized that there is a very significant difference when it is the defendant who moves to take the trial away from the tribunal then empaneled, the jury then empaneled and the Court act sua sponte."
1975.74-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1347.251,1351.157,Your brother argues that the motion was involuntary?
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1351.157,1353.161,Yes.
1975.74-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1353.161,1363.376,"But I take it your response would be even if it was, there is no error in declaring mistrial because it would have been quite valid even if there had been no motion?"
1975.74-928,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1363.376,1364.22,That is correct.
1975.74-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1364.22,1374.968,"But you would have been up against Jorn, had it not been a defendant’s motion here, in a way that you are at least arguably not when the defendant moves?"
1975.74-928,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.968,1384.248,"Well, not if you had to put aside the motion on the grounds that it was involuntary or had been coerced or something?"
1975.74-928,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1384.248,1399.07,"Well, If we exclude from consideration the fact that the respondent in this case moved for a mistrial, we would be in a position of having to assess the circumstances that exist when a mistrial was being considered by the manifest necessity standard."
1975.74-928,1,23658,fletcher_n_baldwin_jr,,1807.581,1809.933,"Had the defendant found guilty, Your Honor?"
1975.74-928,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1809.933,1811.058,That is the only occasion.
1975.74-928,1,23658,fletcher_n_baldwin_jr,,1811.058,1816.956,And there is no attorney present or his chief trial counsel has been removed?
1975.74-928,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1816.956,1828.399,A lawyer has made a motion for a mistrial and the judge after considering it denied it and the man is tried and found guilty?
1975.74-928,1,23658,fletcher_n_baldwin_jr,,1828.399,1846.216,"If indeed that occurred in the instant case and if the judge elected as his option to continue on with the trial and to force the only other retained counsel, Mr. Meldon to proceed, then we would have had a Sixth Amendment right to question issue, right to counsel issue."
1975.74-928,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1850.891,1853.563,"Well, there would be no double jeopardy case at all?"
1975.74-928,1,23658,fletcher_n_baldwin_jr,,1853.563,1855.118,That is correct.
1975.74-928,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1855.118,1859.36,"You say, you would have a good case on any grant of a mistrial?"
1975.74-928,1,23658,fletcher_n_baldwin_jr,,1859.36,1864.919,"It is arguable that we would have at least have a case on the Sixth Amendment, the right to counsel."
1975.74-928,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1864.919,1869.065,"Well, how would you decide the issue?"
1975.74-928,1,23658,fletcher_n_baldwin_jr,,1869.065,1871.226,I am sorry Your Honor.
1975.74-928,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.226,1873.201,How would you decide it?
1975.74-928,1,23658,fletcher_n_baldwin_jr,,1877.244,1882.825,"I would think, yes, Your Honor it was clearly, it struck at the heart of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel."
1975.74-928,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.825,1885.998,So It is not just arguable in your opinion that would have violated his right to counsel?
1975.74-928,1,23658,fletcher_n_baldwin_jr,,1885.998,1893.912,"In my opinion it would have violated his right to counsel and it would appear that this is the opinion of the en banc court below, the Fifth Circuit."
1975.74-928,2,32657,john_p_rupp,,3726.55,3727.958,"No, nothing further, thank you."
1975.74-928,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3727.958,3728.472,Very well.
