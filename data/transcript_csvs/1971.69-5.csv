1971.69-5,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.241,"-- Overmyer against Frick Company, Mr. Brown, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1971.69-5,0,38625,russell_morton_brown,,8.241,10.74,Thank you.
1971.69-5,1,25441,gregory_m_harvey,,1512.414,1516.715,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3443.19,3445.149,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1971.69-5,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3445.149,3450.948,You wish to take issue with any of the factual aspects emphasized by Mr. Harvey?
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3450.948,3454.367,"I do not believe so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.69-5,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3502.409,3502.853,Mr. Brown?
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3502.853,3504.219,Yes sir?
1971.69-5,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3504.219,3509.141,Let me on what Mr. Harvey has been presenting to us (Inaudible).
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3542.114,3543.402,I think Mr. Chief --
1971.69-5,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3543.402,3573.733,"Because you are argued earlier that the arrangement affected by the lawyer was the breach of his professional responsibility and yet your client entered into this with his eyes open for a quid pro quo, the release of the mechanic's liens and all the rest of it all, knowing that this is precisely the way that the security has to be enforced, that it would be enforced?"
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3573.733,3581.028,"If Your Honor please, Mr. Justice Brennan, that on its face appears to be the thrust of the fact."
1971.69-5,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3591.667,3594.895,I was not suggest to you that is your client must have known.
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3603.071,3608.804,"Now, that relates, Mr. Justice Brennan, to the merits that should be determined in the trial court."
1971.69-5,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3608.804,3614.482,"I know, but you are asking us to say that this procedure, the filing of this case is in unconstitutional."
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3616.603,3622.864,Exactly! Precisely! That is the constitutional issue and it is our position --
1971.69-5,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3622.864,3633.994,"It is certainly not, now that you put yourself with your eyes open, is it, in that position, would you not either have waive to estoppel it or something based on that kind of fact situation?"
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3633.994,3638.006,"Well, let me put it this way Mr. Justice Brennan."
1971.69-5,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3647.552,3651.304,"I know, but that is not this case as I understand it."
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3651.304,3651.769,"No, it is not this case."
1971.69-5,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3651.769,3668.221,It was the second note that was substituted for an earlier note that Frick had one form of security and they swapped it for this form of security and surely your client has to know in giving this form of security of what that man said?
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3668.221,3673.855,"We knew what it meant, Your Honor, and he had to pay this obligation, but I submit."
1971.69-5,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3673.855,3681.3,"I suggest he also knew that if he defaulted, it meant that Frick could do exactly what it did here?"
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3681.3,3693.067,"And then it would go into Court and try to get a hearing on the valid defense it had on the merits, but it never got that."
1971.69-5,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3693.55,3710.981,"(Inaudible) it just waived the particular proceeding or form which had presented claim, just could not present it, just waived his right to present the judgment in the form in which the judge -- presented was a claim?"
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3710.981,3719.526,"In Manzo and in Griffin, this Court has held that that will not measure up to constitutional standard of due process."
1971.69-5,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3720.967,3725.1,"Well, Manzo never waived his right to notice?"
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3725.1,3726.205,I beg your pardon?
1971.69-5,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3726.205,3729.939,Manzo never or I do not know which one is the father (Voice Overlap) I do not know which one is the father?
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3729.939,3732.165,"No, he was the father, yes Your Honor."
1971.69-5,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3732.165,3737.858,"And Manzo never waive his right to -- at least in that case, he did not ever purport to?"
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3737.858,3745.716,"Well, it was said in that case that he had forfeited his right because he had not kept in touch and supported the charge."
1971.69-5,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3745.716,3747.449,"That is a forfeiture, that is not a waiver."
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3747.449,3755.372,"Well, that is right, but the Court said that you cannot adjudicate these rights without notice and an opportunity to be heard."
1971.69-5,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3755.372,3760.531,"Well, if you have not notice, why was this action filed in the Southern District?"
1971.69-5,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,3760.531,3763.794,This was to restrain them from going ahead.
