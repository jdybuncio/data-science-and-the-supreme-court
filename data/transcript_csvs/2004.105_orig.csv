2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,7.43,12.593,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court:"
2004.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,129.332,131.106,"Mr. Draper, correct me if I'm wrong."
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,142.13,143.738,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2004.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,147.824,153.359,So they do use 10 years of figures to determine what the relevant year's water would be.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,153.359,155.421,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.966,176.514,"This will begin in 2007, as I recall."
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,177.257,179.858,"That is the special master's proposal, yes."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.858,200.541,"--And what I don't understand is even... even if we agree with you that it should be done annually, why... why wouldn't you propose that it be done annually using the previous 7 years' experience that we now have and then, you know, ultimately by 2007, we can use the previous 10 years?"
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,210.777,227.124,"Your Honor, I couldn't agree with you more in the sense that we should begin now with the accounting so that you look each year at the results of this standard, which has been approved by the Court, for compact compliance in that year only, and if... if you accumulate it--"
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.124,227.495,No.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,239.634,258.581,"--Your Honor, averages will tend to smooth out the results and will hide the effects during dry years, which is when the farmers in Kansas, who are the beneficiaries that Kansas intended to benefit... and both parties realize that."
2004.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,259.946,263.744,But your method... your method will over-emphasize the dry years.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,289.417,294.247,"--Your Honor, I believe the... the result is the... is the opposite."
2004.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,314.642,321.534,"That's the method that you're attacking, but if you were to do it year by year, wouldn't it be just the reverse?"
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,321.534,326.94,We don't believe that aspect of the model would be any different if we're doing it year by year.
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.482,362.978,"Do you... do you dispute what... what the master found here, that the methodology is more accurate on a 10-year average than it is year by year?"
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,362.978,365.29,"No, Your Honor."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.752,377.467,The actual year-by-year results.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,377.783,383.866,"--Yes, and I should point out that it's impossible to know what the right answer is."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.272,408.387,"Yes, but I... I--"
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,408.387,408.924,And no one knows what that is.
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.924,433.527,"--I understand that... that the master concluded that even as to a particular year, the model will be more accurate if you use the average from the previous 10 years than if you just applied the model to a single year, that even as to the real results for that single year, the model will be more accurate if you use a 10-year average."
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,433.527,436.128,"Your Honor, I don't understand it that way."
2004.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,459.451,471.672,Is part or all of the objectives of both the... the decree and the 10-year model to conserve subsurface reservoirs?
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,471.672,476.169,"Not... not directly, Your Honor."
2004.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,489.505,498.626,"Well, then... well, then why isn't... if... if that's so, why isn't it that Colorado shouldn't get credit for the wet years in... in... on an average?"
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,511.713,514.147,"--I think in general, Your Honor, you are... are correct."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.698,559.268,I... I thought that the compact specifically provided there shall be no allowance or accumulation of credits or debits for or against either State.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,559.268,561.618,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.618,564.674,"Well, how does that comport with what you just said?"
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,564.674,579.534,"Under those circumstances, the water that would be delivered to this offset account in John Martin Reservoir is not a credit that's accounted under the compact for that year."
2004.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,595.593,599.885,I don't... I don't understand that statement.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,609.339,613.593,"I think your formulation, Your Honor, is... is more correct."
2004.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,613.593,613.965,Okay.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,613.965,618.301,"It would be there to be used, and it would not be a credit for accounting purposes."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.794,629.734,"Well, if it's not a credit for accounting purposes, then they're going to owe you just as much the next year even though... even though you had more water the previous year."
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,629.734,634.564,"This is under the assumption, Your Honor, that they have already met their obligations in the current year."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.564,635.407,Yes.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,635.407,643.769,And it will be available as a practical matter to meet their obligations in a subsequent year and be accounted in that subsequent year.
2004.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,671.239,672.831,"Well, then why are you using a 10-year model at all?"
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,672.831,674.129,--It's not a 10--
2004.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,674.129,676.629,It seems to me what you're... what you're saying is forget the 10 years.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,677.455,679.313,"--That's what we are saying, Your Honor."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,691.573,693.515,Why don't you do it on a monthly basis?
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,707.382,725.298,"Well, it... it could be done that way, and in fact, Your Honor, Colorado uses parts of this same model in its own administration of groundwater pumping, the same groundwater pumping for purposes of protecting Colorado surface water users, and it requires replacement of water on a monthly basis."
2004.105_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.038,870.662,The master found that the role of the river master in the Pecos case was quite different than the role of the river master you want to have appointed here.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,876.135,878.735,"Your Honor, we do not agree with that."
2004.105_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,878.735,880.554,You don't agree with what?
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,880.554,891.45,"With the description of the Pecos River master as being... as having only ministerial duties, and I can explain why."
2004.105_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.45,892.359,Please do.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,892.359,892.565,Yes.
2004.105_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.309,950.567,"The Pecos master can simply apply this formula, can he not, and get the results that the compact requires?"
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,950.567,961.424,"He... he is to apply the formula, Your Honor, but there's a great deal of judgment, professional, expert judgment that needs to be exercised in order to apply it."
2004.105_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,980.493,986.808,"Well, one of the reasons I'm curious is that I believe the Pecos master is an engineer."
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,987.718,988.627,That's correct.
2004.105_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.627,990.69,He's also the cheapest master we've ever had.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,999.03,1000.516,"Your Honor, I don't believe so."
2004.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1002.662,1004.891,What's the difference--
2004.105_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1004.891,1005.157,No.
2004.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1005.884,1018.144,"What... what relation do you or... yes... working relation do you anticipate, if... if the river master is appointed, between the river master and the commission?"
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1020.949,1036.265,"Your Honor, no, he would not formally interact with the commission, just as the Pecos River master does not formally interact with the Pecos River commission."
2004.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1036.265,1040.64,"--Well, what can... what can the river master do that the... that the commission or authority can't do?"
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1058.844,1060.869,"It is a process difference, Your Honor."
2004.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1061.407,1064.956,"But for that, you wouldn't be asking for a river master then."
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1064.956,1080.271,"--Well, if there were an authoritative way, such as a river master, by which the annual recurring exercise of judgment could be accomplished, we would not need the river master."
2004.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1081.181,1084.069,But aren't you bypassing what Congress set up?
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1101.243,1113.215,"--That decision also requires unanimity, Your Honor, and in the one case I'm aware of, Kansas' suggestion of doing an arbitration was rejected by Colorado."
2004.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1122.669,1123.412,But you're saying Congress--
2004.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.412,1125.064,"Mr. Draper, could I ask you what is a matter of procedure?"
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1134.558,1140.396,"Your Honor, we have suggested that it be set up just as you have set up the Pecos River master."
2004.105_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.297,1150.161,Directly.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1150.161,1150.716,Directly.
2004.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.716,1152.102,--And the special master would be out.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1178.851,1202.052,"Your Honor, I believe in both of those cases, the... the special master was recommending the appointment of a river master, but I would point out that in setting out the criteria for appointing a river master, the Court did not refer to that factor as... as being part of the consideration."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.052,1212.538,"As I understand the system you propose, the river master's decision would be appealable to us, and we would review it de novo."
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1213.048,1219.53,"We're suggesting the same scope of review as on the Pecos, which is clearly erroneous."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.877,1247.188,I'm very loathe to deprive either of the States of their... their right to have this Court decide matters between them.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1247.188,1252.595,"Your Honor, this would not deprive either State of that right."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.588,1259.754,"Well, it would if they can only come here and... and overturn the river master if he's clearly erroneous."
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1263.098,1272.657,"--Well, there... as I say, the Court... the Court may set the review threshold as it sees fit."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.657,1275.812,I... I had thought that your proposal was de novo review.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1279.511,1291.605,"Your Honor, I would... I would say that we have... we have mentioned the clearly erroneous review standard because it was in the Pecos framework."
2004.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1297.428,1300.15,--Suppose the commission decided to appoint an arbitrator.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1307.459,1323.555,"As under the Pecos, Your Honor, if the... if the compact administration, as it's called in the... in the Arkansas Basin, is able to come to a resolution of an issue, then that would... that would take care of that issue."
2004.105_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1342.752,1353.277,"Well, then it would seem to me, procedurally at least, the river master would have if not the legal, at least the practical obligation to refer things first to the commission."
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1353.277,1360.047,"Your Honor, the referral of matters to the commission is why we're here in the first place."
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1371.98,1372.435,That was the deal.
2004.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1372.435,1372.99,Your... yes.
2004.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.004,1374.543,That was the deal they came to.
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1389.048,1399.556,"Your Honor, I don't believe that this is an end run any more than the enforcement of the compact is an end run around the administrative body that is set up in many of these compacts."
2004.105_orig,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1410.291,1415.903,"No, but you... you agree that this is the... the authority here is more than a keep-in-touch group."
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1432.871,1447.11,"That is the... that is the nub of our argument against reliance on the Arkansas River Compact Administration, that you can't look at it to settle differences about the implementation of this Court's decree."
2004.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1447.11,1448.225,What did the special--
2004.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,1448.225,1448.491,That is a--
2004.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1448.491,1458.999,"--What did the special master mean when he said he recognized the unanimous vote problem, but he said, but the climate may be changing?"

2004.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1498.546,1501.063,So there was nothing tangible behind his--

2004.105_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2289.965,2292.194,And... and I think that's what's before us here.
