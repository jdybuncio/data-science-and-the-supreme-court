1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,11.349,14.301,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,150.24,152.601,Are you to talk about the statutory provisions?
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,152.601,155.232,"Yes, Justice White, as I am."
1992.92-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.583,186.612,In the what scenario?
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,188.144,188.485,I'm sorry.
1992.92-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,227.568,234.745,In what... and you rely on 1322(b)(2).
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,234.745,237.927,"I rely on 1322(b)(2), yes, Justice White."
1992.92-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,241.78,249.565,"Well, you say... you say that 1322(b)(2) prohibits modification of the terms of the mortgage."
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,249.565,252.386,"It prohibits plan modification, Justice White."
1992.92-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,264.704,273.6,"Well, by extending the time for payments you certainly are... are modifying the terms of the mortgage, aren't you?"
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,273.6,276.121,"No, Justice White."
1992.92-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,276.121,279.333,"The plan... the plan provides for extended payments, doesn't it?"
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,279.333,282.686,The plan provides that in order to effect a cure--
1992.92-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.686,283.385,Uh-hum.
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,283.385,288.66,"--Under section 1322, the cure must be effected within a reasonable time."
1992.92-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.66,289.459,Uh-hum.
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,289.459,291.512,That is not further defined in the Code.
1992.92-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,301.878,308.983,"Well, certainly the acceleration clauses in the... in the mortgage... typical mortgage, then, are... are set aside."
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,308.983,319.409,"Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, the... the... what is set aside is the right to immediately foreclose and accelerate."
1992.92-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.847,331.598,You say that requires that?
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,331.598,341.856,"I'm saying that if the debtors choose to avail themselves of the cure provisions of paragraph (b)(5), that it is the Code and not the plan which constitutes the modification."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.408,353.292,"But the plan says how... how far deferred it's going to be, doesn't it?"
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,353.292,354.241,The plan--
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,354.241,356.144,The Code doesn't... doesn't provide for an automatic answer.
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,356.144,356.485,--No--
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.485,358.485,So it's either done by the plan or it's not done.
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,358.485,360.836,"--That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.092,371.836,Well you can say that about any treatment of anything under the plan.
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,376.998,378.168,Uh--
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.168,382.882,"So, I mean, I don't know why this is any different from any other indebtedness under it, as far as that goes."
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,382.882,388.036,"--I do acknowledge your point, Justice Scalia, and that is... that is a valid point."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.328,405.396,"Can I ask... it seems to me that the crucial language in this is... it seems to me that the crucial language is whether... what we're really arguing about is whether this is an allowed secured claim provided for by the plan, right?"
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,405.396,410.591,"I do not necessarily acknowledge that as being a correct statement, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.591,410.832,You don't.
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,410.832,411.292,I think that--
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.292,412.542,"Well, what do you think the crucial language is?"
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,412.542,429.024,"--I think that by virtue of effecting a cure under section 1322(b)(5), the debtors elects to maintain payments, and hence as to the maintained payments there is a continuation of the preexisting, prebankruptcy contract."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.968,444.061,"Well, it... I'm... let me begin with 1325, anyway."
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,461.555,464.576,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.576,471.149,"And you were arguing, at least at one point in your... in your brief, that this is not a claim provided for by the plan."
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,479.036,479.454,Yes.
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.027,484.449,Well--
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,484.449,500.389,"However, it is my position that section 1325 is not even invoked when a cure under section 1322(b)(5) is effected, because maintenance of the payments implies with it necessary contractual payment of interest on the allowed secured claim."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.389,506.553,"--If that is so, how do you explain the language of 1328, which says that"
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,529.169,531.169,"Yes, Justice Scalia, it does."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,540.406,540.836,"Well, I do."
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,542.738,559.817,"--My belief is that Congress, in section 1328, indicated that where there will be a... a continuation of a long-term debt past the end of the plan, it would be inappropriate, whether secure or unsecured, to... to allow a discharge."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.474,579.911,"Do you have some interpretation of that language, of 1328, that is consistent with your argument here?"
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,579.911,582.642,"No, Justice... Mr. Chief-Justice, I do not."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.511,613.573,So then you feel that 1325 may be inconsistent with that part of 1328.
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,613.573,615.193,"To that extent I do believe it is, Your Honor."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.503,1071.393,"And would you say that if they adopted such a provision and such a provision provided for 10 percent interest, and the legal rate of interest that would otherwise apply under the Bankruptcy Code was less than that, that they'd get the higher amount of interest?"
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1071.393,1071.974,"--I do, Your Honor."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1071.974,1072.415,In bankruptcy?
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1072.415,1076.395,"Yes, Justice Scalia, I believe that it would by reason of section 1322(b)(2)."
1992.92-621,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.395,1077.326,Uh-hum.
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1077.326,1090.514,"And I believe the... the courts that have followed the position of the petitioners here have determined that where the contract of the parties calls for interest, interest must be paid on those arrearages."
1992.92-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1093.177,1104.054,"Well, if you're going to follow just the contract, certainly if the mortgagee here had been allowed to accelerate, the accelerated principal would have borne interest, would it not?"
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1104.054,1106.545,Yes.
1992.92-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1109.037,1116.811,"So to that extent, the mortgagee is being deprived of something that he would have had under the contract."
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1116.811,1119.163,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct."
1992.92-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1127.148,1127.598,Yes.
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1132.792,1135.474,With respect to whether or not interest should be paid.
1992.92-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1135.474,1136.996,But not to the other provisions.
1992.92-621,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1136.996,1137.845,Not to the other provision.
1992.92-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1150.134,1151.716,"Very well, Mr. Carpenter."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1153.699,1157.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1269.185,1269.793,Excuse me.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1273.466,1274.347,506(b).
1992.92-621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.347,1275.389,(B) only has that application.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1275.389,1283.413,"506(b), Justice Scalia, gives you interest under Vanston, pre-Code, from postpetition up to the time of confirmation."
1992.92-621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1283.413,1289.288,"When you concluded that, you said so (b)(5) only has that application, and I thought you were talking about 1322(b)(5)."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1289.288,1300.755,I'm talking about... 1325(b)(2) is the time value statute that applies to the forced loan that is brought upon the mortgagee.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.685,1719.127,What section do you rely on specifically to give you a right to interest?
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1719.127,1721.518,1325(b)(2).
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.518,1726.503,You don't think 506(b)'s got anything to do with it.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1726.503,1727.873,506(b).
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.873,1728.293,(b).
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1728.293,1736.248,506(b) is the oversecured creditor postpetition right to be paid interest.
1992.92-621,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1759.074,1773.464,"Do you... do you accept the Government's argument in its footnote 7, I guess, that 506(b) wouldn't apply after confirmation because it has the effect of, in effect, allowing a claim, and the time for that has then passed?"
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1773.464,1785.211,I adopt the Government's interpretation that 506(b)... (b)(2) provides only for interest postpetition.
1992.92-621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1785.211,1792.096,"Of course, they say the opposite on page 15, so you can... you can... you can adopt their view without losing anything."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1793.746,1795.236,Thank you.
1992.92-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1795.236,1800.452,Do you... will you tell me again the section that you say you rely on?
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1803.714,1816.601,"1325(b)(2) is found at page A-5 of the petitioners' petition for certiorari, set out in full there on page A-5."
1992.92-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.328,1829.47,Wait... wait a minute.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1831.52,1833.891,A-5 of the petition for certiorari.
1992.92-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.891,1834.412,"Well, whereabouts on A-5?"
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1834.412,1844.95,"(ii) under... under (B) on A-5, where it starts ""the value""."
1992.92-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1844.95,1845.72,"Yes, okay."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1845.72,1854.776,"""As of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan on account of such claim is not less than the allowed amount of such claim. """
1992.92-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.776,1865.093,That's... that would be section 1325(a)(B)(ii).
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1865.093,1865.955,(a)(B)(ii).
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.592,1916.265,"So, for what period or periods of time are you asking interest?"
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1916.265,1919.487,"Well, actually, since I'm an oversecured creditor."
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.487,1920.138,Yes.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1920.138,1928.904,"I'm entitled to that minimal amount of interest from the time the petition is filed until the plan is confirmed, which is normally a month or two."
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.264,1950.307,"And there's no question, at repetition you would have a right to interest."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1950.307,1952.29,There's no question as to that.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.033,1957.624,"Yes, yes."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1957.624,1970.81,"I think under 1325, an undersecured creditor is likewise entitled to interest, even though... and, see, it's not even mentioned whether you're an oversecured creditor or an undersecured creditor in 1325."
1992.92-621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.252,1979.055,"You say there's no question about your right to it if... prepetition interest, but under State law you wouldn't get interest on the arrearage, would you?"
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1979.055,1979.866,"--Oh, yes."
1992.92-621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1984.819,1987.223,On the... on the arrearage.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1987.223,1988.082,On the arrearage.
1992.92-621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1988.082,1989.714,Even though it's not provided for in the contract.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,1989.714,1990.165,Right.
1992.92-621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.166,2013.179,But you can't forum shop for your home mortgage.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2014.268,2019.293,"Well, if you move out of State and you get another venue and they don't object--"

1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.526,2026.827,You have to... you filed a claim in this case.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2026.827,2027.227,Yes.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.227,2033.913,"And you asked for... you asked for interest on the arrearages, I suppose."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2033.913,2034.404,Yes.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.404,2037.776,Was it allowed as a secured claim?
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2037.776,2038.034,It's an allowed claim.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.837,2041.056,"All right, all right."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2042.718,2046.933,That was not handled in the lower court.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.714,2050.123,Yeah.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2050.123,2052.793,--Because I hate to come back on what interest rate.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.793,2053.355,That's all right.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2053.355,2055.679,"Is it going to be State law, is it going to be Federal law?"
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.989,2067.922,So what... 506... 506 gives you interest postpetition.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2067.922,2068.563,Yes.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.563,2069.495,At what rate?
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2069.495,2071.636,Quiet.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.687,2073.978,All right.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2074.498,2076.429,"Commonly, it's market rate, 8 percent."
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.429,2077.159,"--All right, all right."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2083.755,2084.326,Yes.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.873,2096.293,Right.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2096.293,2097.072,--Where Congress has been silent.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.672,2112.243,"Now, do you support the judgment of the Tenth Circuit?"
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2112.243,2113.174,"Yes, I do."
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.174,2114.346,And the rationale?
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2114.346,2115.656,No.
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.1,2124.832,So you want it affirmed on another... on another basis.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2124.832,2125.403,Yes.
1992.92-621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.403,2130.316,"I think... fees and expenses, was there interest allowed on those too?"
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2130.316,2133.377,"Yes, because that's part of my, quote, allowed claim."
1992.92-621,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.377,2134.339,That's part of your allowed.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2134.339,2156.161,"That's something that really should be hammered across, is that when I file a claim, I file a claim for interest, I file a claim for $35,000 due on the mortgage, then if... I file a claim also for the arrearages, which can be interest, taxes advanced, insurance advanced, court costs, and attorney fees."
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.844,2165.818,So you think if we just... if we followed the rationale of the Tenth Circuit we would be in error.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2165.818,2168.81,"I don't want to say that, Justice White."
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.775,2178.998,But you wouldn't mind... you wouldn't mind if we agreed with the Tenth Circuit.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2178.998,2179.726,"No, sir, no."
1992.92-621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.726,2183.539,"But you do... but under the Tenth Circuit rationale you wouldn't get interest on the fees, would you?"
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2183.539,2184.68,"Yes, I would."
1992.92-621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2184.68,2186.902,I thought they relied on 506(b).
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2186.902,2191.436,"Well, but under 506(b)... and I don't want to trample on Justice O'Connor's comma."
1992.92-621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2191.436,2192.395,But the fees are after the comma.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2192.395,2194.968,But in 506(b) they all go together.
1992.92-621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.968,2196.418,"Oh, no, the comma--"
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2196.418,2198.299,Interest is an unqualified right.
1992.92-621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2198.299,2201.251,"--You ignore the comma in 506(b) for your purposes, then."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2203.404,2206.165,"Well, in Ron Pair the comma was not ignored, no."
1992.92-621,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.349,2212.73,"Yeah, I understand."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2212.73,2218.962,"No, I got interest on all of that and I think I'm entitled to interest under it, and would be under the Federal rule."
1992.92-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.962,2230.77,"Mr. Johnson, I don't see anywhere in your... either of the questions presented by the petitioner for certiorari, where any question regarding the rate of interest is presented."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2230.77,2240.136,"No, but in deciding this case, I believe that the Court should grab that one feature, because it's a very integral part of the question."
1992.92-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2249.061,2250.513,You mean a Federal rule of interest.
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2250.513,2268.376,"Yeah, the Federal rule of interest, and you're going to apply a uniform rate of interest, and it will either be, one, contract rate, market rate... the contract rate is, after all, what the parties bargain for... or you will apply a Treasury bill rate over--"
1992.92-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.376,2271.008,Did you brief the... did you brief the question of the rate of interest?
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2271.008,2272.718,"--No, sir, I did not."
1992.92-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.718,2277.392,"And you're asking... so you're asking us to decide it without it being raised in the petition for certiorari, without your having briefed it."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2277.392,2283.246,"I'm doing it under the equity powers of this Court, that in order to decide a case you will decide it completely."
1992.92-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.949,2294.302,"Well, you say on the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, which is Federal law."
1992.92-621,1,34653,lawrence_ag_johnson,,2294.302,2297.265,--But the Bankruptcy Code is silent as to the rate.
1992.92-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2316.957,2319.348,"Thank you, Mr. Johnson."
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2321.351,2332.567,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-621,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.338,2396.579,"Well, you say... well, never mind."
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2396.579,2397.771,"In our view, section--"
1992.92-621,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.771,2399.03,You seem to say that on page 15.
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2406.507,2410.759,"--Occasioned by the pendency of the bankruptcy case, by which I refer to the pendency--"
1992.92-621,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.759,2411.438,--That's not what you say on 15.
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2420.574,2421.986,--I stick with footnote 7 and I meant the portion--
1992.92-621,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2421.986,2422.517,Okay.
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2422.517,2426.489,--That sentence referred to the portion of the cure that occurs before the plan is confirmed.
1992.92-621,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2511.554,2515.527,But why... I don't... isn't that always the case?
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2522.883,2533.428,"But the question of the part after the comma is that if the agreement does not provide that you're entitled, for example, to collect compensation from a debtor for a certain type of fee, for example title searches."
1992.92-621,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2548.639,2552.841,"But if it does provide for that, it is part of the claim anyway."
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2552.841,2554.293,It is part of their allowed secured claim.
1992.92-621,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.293,2555.482,So it's a strange provision.
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2555.482,2559.686,"It is a strange provision, and I think the Court's opinion in Ron Pair reflected that."
1992.92-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2658.191,2665.134,"If it is so clear that it covers the compensation for delay in payment, why do you suppose they didn't tell us how to figure out the interest rate?"
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2665.134,2672.549,There are no provisions in the Bankruptcy Code that discuss the topic of exactly what the rate of interest should be.
1992.92-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2698.876,2708.363,"Of course, if we'd ignored the common interest rule in... after interest in Ron Pair, we wouldn't have this problem, because the interest would have been set by the instrument itself then."
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2708.363,2713.747,"If Ron Pair had been decided the other way, that would deal with the problem for pre... preconfirmation."
1992.92-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2713.747,2714.408,"We wouldn't have this problem, yeah."
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2714.408,2722.403,"But it seems quite clear... I think you would agree that under section 1325(a)(5), somebody is going to be receiving compensation for delay under that provision."
1992.92-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.425,2793.358,"Tell me, what is the provision that disallows interest generally again?"
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2793.358,2796.2,It's section 502(b)(2).
1992.92-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2796.2,2797.161,502(b)(2).
1992.92-621,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2797.161,2802.044,"If there are no further questions, I thank the Court."
1992.92-621,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2802.044,2803.586,"Thank you, Mr. Mann."
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2806.446,2812.71,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2865.075,2869.328,Does that mean you think the legislative history is against you?
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2869.328,2871.839,"No, Justice Stevens, I do not."
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2930.897,2932.65,Excuse me.
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2943.667,2944.708,That--
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2944.708,2945.159,You--
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2945.159,2946.428,"--I disagree, Justice Scalia, I'm sorry."
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.428,2947.209,--What?
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,2947.209,2949.189,I disagree for this reason.
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3002.895,3005.567,May I ask you a question on this modification issue?
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3027.411,3037.728,"Only upon application to the bankruptcy court, Mr. Justice Stevens, relating to relief from the automatic stay under section 362."
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3037.728,3038.97,I see.
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3039.691,3039.929,And--
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3039.929,3048.464,"--But after... I'm assuming after confirmation of the plan, and they go... makes payments say... I think under this it's 5 years, wasn't it, to pay this off, or whatever period."
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3048.464,3048.885,--I don't--
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3048.885,3056.01,"But 2 or 3 years later he misses a payment, and then the mortgagee would still have the right to accelerate, wouldn't they, to foreclose."
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3056.01,3056.961,"--He would have the right, yes, Justice--"
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3056.961,3058.12,Subject to approval of the bankruptcy court.
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3058.12,3058.801,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3061.683,3066.326,So there has not been a modification that included a surrender of the right to accelerate.
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3066.326,3070.199,Not a complete and total surrender for all purposes.
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.199,3071.941,"Just a postponement of it, if they--"
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3071.941,3076.413,"Postponement pending maintenance of the payments under section (b)(5), 1322(b)(5), yes, sir."
1992.92-621,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.413,3092.064,"--Mr. Carpenter, I had... I had understood that the purpose of 1322(b)(2) was to give some special status to home mortgages, to make that an especially attractive investment."
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3108.233,3109.435,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-621,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3109.435,3114.458,Why would Congress want to single out home mortgages for that special disability?
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3117.44,3119.462,I don't know that it makes it unattractive.
1992.92-621,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3152.572,3158.646,"Well, it can be modified, but only in one way, to the advantage... to the advantage of the... of the debtor."
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3158.646,3159.357,I think--
1992.92-621,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.357,3167.322,"By... by extending the payments and allowing no interest on those payments, whereas every other oversecured creditor, you have to allow interest on the payments."
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3167.322,3168.754,"--That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-621,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3206.308,3218.957,"But why should Congress... you're saying Congress may favor the general creditors, but why should Congress single out the home mortgagee for disfavorable treatment as compared to other secured claimants?"
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3218.957,3234.765,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, they were singled out for especially beneficial treatment under section 1322(b)(2) because under a Chapter 13 plan a ny claim of any sort, other than a home mortgage, may be modified, and that is usually to the... to the detriment of the creditor."
1992.92-621,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3243.243,3245.233,"Well, other than the ways you say it can be."
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3245.233,3248.806,"--The deacceleration and the... and the holding off of foreclosure, yes, sir."
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3305.411,3311.057,"Mr. Carpenter, your adversary says that they would get this interest as a matter of State law, so it wouldn't be expansion."
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3311.057,3327.337,"That is... that statement was made, Mr. Justice Stevens, but in actuality the... the interest that was provided... that was mentioned, the Treasury rate plus 4 points, is the State judgment rate, not a default rate."
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3343.68,3346.16,"No, but if they did foreclose and you got a judgment, then they would get this interest, wouldn't they?"
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3346.16,3352.853,"Yes, for the brief period of time until such time as the sheriff was able to appraise, sell--"
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3352.853,3353.584,Right.
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3353.584,3355.864,"--The property and the court confirmed it, under Oklahoma procedure."
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3357.487,3361.368,"Well maybe so, but at least conceptually it does compensate them for the delay."
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3361.368,3363.321,"Under that scenario, yes."
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3390.139,3391.618,Do you agree... let me just be sure I understand.
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3397.092,3399.345,"--It is not applicable because, Your Honor--"
1992.92-621,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3399.345,3404.748,"Now, do you agree, though, that if it were applicable, it would compel a payment of interest on the arrearage?"
1992.92-621,3,20717,david_w_carpenter,,3404.748,3407.801,"--No, sir, I do not believe that it would be applicable even--"
