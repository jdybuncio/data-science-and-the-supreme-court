1984.83-1437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.772,"Mr. Peterson, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,10.772,35.304,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the facts of this case are important to this Court for two reasons: One, to decide this case and; two, to evolve, to develop, to define the principles that should be applied in the future."
1984.83-1437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,346.32,350.891,"Was there any request for injunctive relief in this case, or was it just a damages action?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,350.891,355.426,"Justice Rehnquist, the complaint in this case did have injunctive relief."
1984.83-1437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.327,383.445,You prevailed on that point in the trial?
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,383.445,384.979,We prevailed on that point.
1984.83-1437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,384.979,390.016,"Well, then you're talking about... how much was awarded in the way of damages?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,390.016,394.235,"The award damages in the aggregate is $60,000."
1984.83-1437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.235,401.491,"Well, how can a court award $173,000 attorney's fees, where all the plaintiff recovered was $60,000?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,405.876,413.03,"Well, the trial court, of course, has not, Justice Rehnquist, at this point awarded $171,000 or $173,000."
1984.83-1437,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,564.16,565.927,"Mr. Perterson, can I ask you this one question?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,568.446,579.27,"--One hundred and fifty dollars an hour for the lead attorney, Your Honor, and the trial judge, Judge Shadur, did review this and felt that $150 was appropriate."
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,625.099,634.34,"How did you... when you made your offer, the $100,000 offer, you said it included attorney's fees, but you picked out an amount, didn't you?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,634.34,636.173,"--No, I did not--"
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.173,637.023,"Oh, you did not."
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,637.023,637.625,--No.
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.625,640.244,I thought you just said that it includes attorney's fees.
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,640.244,641.394,That's right.
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.394,648.831,"And it was only after the trial judge figured it up that he came up with the $32,000?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,649.766,676.75,"The way it works, as I see it or I envision it, and this case, I think, is an excellent fact case for this Court to see how this whole thing evolves, at the moment that Judge Shadur entered judgment on verdict for $60,000, we didn't really know, in my opinion, we really didn't know whether or not the offer at that very moment did exceed the result finally obtained."
1984.83-1437,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.94,823.744,It's only the sum of the two components if the offer included fees.
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,826.862,834.266,"Well, I think that the Sixth Circuit, Justice Stevens, in Hutto v. Finney would stand for that proposition, yes."
1984.83-1437,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,853.513,856.215,"But you could have made a clearcut offer, couldn't you?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,856.215,857.515,It is a clearcut offer.
1984.83-1437,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,857.515,863.785,"You could have said blank dollars plus blank dollars for fee, couldn't you?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,865.885,871.272,"I would have to at that point, as a practical matter, have to guess not one thing but two things."
1984.83-1437,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,879.295,881.997,"But it would have stopped us from having to guess, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,881.997,890.0,"Oh, I don't think this Court has to guess because this Court isn't going to see the case until there's been an adjudication on the fee."
1984.83-1437,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,894.72,902.326,"Well, don't we have to guess whether you made an offer of $100,000 for both or one item?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,905.043,906.428,"--Not in this record, you don't."
1984.83-1437,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,906.428,908.98,"Well, what do we determine?"
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.98,910.747,"Well, your offer was for both, wasn't it?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,910.747,911.532,It sure was.
1984.83-1437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,916.218,917.734,What's the pertinent language there?
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,917.734,928.276,"The pertinent language there is: ""for a sum"",... that is an adjective phrase, if recall my grammar in grade school..."
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.58,975.34,"Is it settled under the rule that the judgment that is actually recovered... when you are making the comparison, is it settled that you take the damages, the actual damages that are awarded plus attorney's fees as the figure to compare?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,975.34,977.357,Is it settled?
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.195,1008.728,"What if you had made an offer of $60,000, excluding attorney's fees, you offered to settle the substantive issue for $60,000, and then there had been awarded $50,000 in damages and $50,000 in attorney's fees?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1008.728,1009.594,Well--
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.594,1015.882,"Would the rule have applied to you then, or do you know?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1015.882,1035.978,"--I could... I believe what I could do, Justice White, is make the offer without including attorney's fees or, as you put it, excluding attorney's fees... I think it means the same thing... and if I had done that, the result obtained would have been $60,000 compared to the $100,000."
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.449,1044.984,"I know, but I'm still interested in what do you compare."
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.984,1054.94,"If you made a $60,000 offer excluding attorney's fees, what figure do you compare that with after a trial?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1054.94,1057.625,--You compare it with the judgment on verdict.
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.625,1060.927,"All right, but that doesn't... wouldn't include attorney's fees."
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1060.927,1061.544,It would not.
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.544,1062.295,All right.
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1076.186,1079.722,"Pay it now or pay it later, I guess it what is sometimes, said to be."
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.411,1092.632,But you would only be liable for attorney's fees accrued before the date or your office.
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1092.632,1093.248,Sure.
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.248,1097.167,You wouldn't be paying for post-offer.
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1097.167,1098.286,That's correct.
1984.83-1437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1098.286,1101.571,"Let me see if I understand you, Mr. Peterson."
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1108.557,1109.593,Any way you want to.
1984.83-1437,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1194.096,1218.544,"Mr. Peterson, under Rule 68 I gather that a prevailing plaintiff who gets a judgment less favorable than the defendant's offered judgment has to pay defendant's costs accrued after the offer of settlement, as well as absorb the plaintiff's own costs and attorney's fees."
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1228.586,1230.002,We did in our post-trial motion.
1984.83-1437,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.756,1241.477,Do you think you are entitled to those under Rule 68 in your version of it?
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1241.477,1249.832,"Well, as I understand the body of law that's developed on that there is a different standard for the defendant, apparently, under 1988."
1984.83-1437,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1249.832,1254.717,"Would you think 1988 cuts in and says no, you can't get them?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1254.717,1265.406,"It's not an absolute prohibition, but apparently the standard under the body of law that this Court has developed for a defendant is different under 1988 than it is for the plaintiff."
1984.83-1437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1265.406,1270.993,"Well, why wouldn't Rule 68 prevail in its special circumstances over 1988 in that situation?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1270.993,1277.48,"Well, because the attorney's fee component has to come from somewhere, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-1437,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1293.858,1299.996,"Well, are you not entitled to it because you're not the prevailing party under 1988, or what?"
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1299.996,1301.012,Okay.
1984.83-1437,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1327.579,1335.169,And you think you can or cannot use Rule 68 to get... for your post-offer costs?
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1335.169,1350.779,"Well, I think Rule 68 would authorize, in this set of facts, my recovery of costs, 1988."
1984.83-1437,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1367.556,1373.394,"Well, it could be significant and certainly we would have to have that in mind, I suppose."
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1373.394,1373.727,--Yes.
1984.83-1437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.066,1384.383,Costs but not attorney's fees?
1984.83-1437,0,21350,donald_g_peterson,,1384.383,1388.22,"Conventional costs as opposed to the attorney's fee type costs, yes."
1984.83-1437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1388.22,1392.338,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Peterson."
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1395.04,1409.549,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is a very practical on, whether Rule 68 must be read in a way that rewards a lawyer even at the expense of his client."
1984.83-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.737,1547.104,Excuse me.
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1563.182,1569.585,"--If I had to choose between those two words, I would say that it's procedural."
1984.83-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1577.941,1582.56,But Judge Posner apparently thought that was important because of the limitations on what the rules can do; that's the reason I asked the question.
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1582.56,1588.897,"Well, I understand that, but I suggest that Judge Posner is incorrect on that, for two primary reasons."
1984.83-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.041,1860.691,Why did they break it down?
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1860.691,1861.41,Excuse me?
1984.83-1437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1861.41,1865.528,"Why did they break it down, so that the judge could enter a judgment?"
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1866.278,1872.532,"The fee request was made for pre-offer fees of 34,000 some-odd dollars."
1984.83-1437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.762,1902.051,"So you think under the Rule, under Rule 68, you can make your offer in either of two ways... including attorney's fees or excluding attorney's fees?"
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1902.051,1907.122,"Well, we think that in order to make a valid Rule 68 offer you have to make it including attorney's fees."
1984.83-1437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.122,1908.022,You have to?
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1909.224,1924.084,"Because in a case in which attorney's fees are subject to recovery, such as in 1988, because the offer must include costs then accrued."
1984.83-1437,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1931.571,1946.599,"If that's your position, then you would disagree with the response given to me by Mr. Peterson in my question to him about the recoverability of post-offer costs of a defendant."
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1946.599,1947.932,In a 1988 case?
1984.83-1437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.605,1996.413,"Well, I take it the petitioner seemed to think that you could make the offer just for the amount of the damages and not include attorney's fees."
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1996.413,2000.484,"Well, I'm not sure he said that, since his offer did include attorney's fees."
1984.83-1437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.852,2013.207,"Well, I am sure that in my thoughts I thought he said he could make the offer just for the amount of, just for damages, not including attorney's fees."
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2013.207,2014.493,Well--
1984.83-1437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.493,2016.659,You disagree with him?
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2016.659,2017.611,--I disagree with that.
1984.83-1437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.432,2033.121,"You think, then, it's not only that this is a proper kind of an offer but it's the only kind of an offer to be made in a 1988 case, including attorney's fees?"
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2033.121,2033.805,--As a Rule 68.
1984.83-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.013,2045.546,"The Rule doesn't quite say that, though."
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2056.67,2057.836,"With costs then accrued, that's right."
1984.83-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.836,2060.272,"--But the verb that precedes it has a ""may"" in it."
1984.83-1437,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,2063.657,2070.128,"No, the validity of the offer is not in issue in this case, additionally because there's no cross petition that's been filed."
1984.83-1437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2087.823,2098.313,Mr. Stone.
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2098.313,2102.431,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2212.152,2215.271,Do you see any ambiguity in that?
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2215.271,2216.806,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2237.054,2241.521,"Well, if the offer were accepted, there wouldn't be any more services to be performed, would there?"
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2241.521,2245.457,"That may very well be true, Your Honor."
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2245.457,2246.092,May very well?
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2256.531,2261.752,"If judgment were entered thereupon, and there were no further proceedings."
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2261.752,2264.304,What other proceedings could there be?
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2270.608,2279.647,"If I understand your question, Your Honor, it is to the effect that if the offer were accepted and judgment entered by consent there could be no further attorney's fees in the case."
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2279.647,2284.95,Just sending somebody down to the courthouse to file the papers; wouldn't that be about all?
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2284.95,2287.652,That would be about all.
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2334.467,2349.227,"You don't agree with your friends characterizing that proposal as an offer to pay $100,000, divided up any way you want between counsel and client, client and counsel?"
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2353.029,2358.749,"I think it can be read that way, Your Honor, and we do not make--"
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2358.749,2359.966,What other way could it be read?
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2359.966,2371.723,"--We do not make a big point, Your Honor, nor do I wish really to urge that this Court's decision should turn upon the validity or invalidity of the offer."
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2402.444,2403.86,One more hypothetical.
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2403.86,2404.127,--Yes.
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2404.127,2422.006,"If you had accepted the offer under your practice in your courts, what would you have done... tried to agree with the client on the division of the $100,000 or, if you couldn't agree, then submit it to the court and let the court fix the fee?"
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2425.623,2428.892,"I think those are the two alternatives that occur to me, Your Honor."
1984.83-1437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2527.841,2536.864,"No case from this Court, Mr. Stone, has ever decided that there is a reasonableness requirement in connection with Rule 68, has it?"
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2536.864,2538.197,"No, there is none, Your Honor."
1984.83-1437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.489,2606.774,What seems to be the natural consequence of Rule 68?
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2606.774,2635.194,"--One of the problems, Your Honor, in reading Rule 68 in conjunction with any provision that provides for reasonable fees, or for doing anything on the basis of a flexible standard that can be adapted to the facts and circumstances and equities of a particular case, one of the grave difficulties is the mandatory language of Federal Rule 68, which allows for no discretion to be exercised."
1984.83-1437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2760.092,2767.947,"Mr. Stone, are you speaking of the dimensions of the award in this particular case, or just generally the relationship between the amount of fees and the amount of costs?"
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2767.947,2768.797,"Both, Your Honor."
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2782.873,2785.29,What's the breakdown here?
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2787.159,2788.542,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2809.69,2810.857,How much are the costs?
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2810.857,2823.932,"--I believe $41,000, or approximately $40,000 was broken down... was claimed by way of costs, of which the trial judge disallowed a portion."
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2823.932,2829.169,"It seems a staggering amount in this setting, but we will check that."
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2829.169,2846.78,"Your Honor, this was a long, hard-fought case, as counsel for the petitioner has said to the Court, involving eleven days in court and innumerable pre-trial motions, fully briefed, many post-trial motions, fully briefed."
1984.83-1437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2852.184,2866.294,"Well, do you think if you recover, if you represent a plaintiff and recover a judgment for $50,000 or $60,000 for the plaintiff, do you think you can bill the plaintiff $170,000 for your attorney's fees?"
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2866.294,2874.982,"--I think normally not, Your Honor, but I can think of certain kinds of litigation where that might very well be done."
1984.83-1437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2887.374,2895.463,"Well, don't you think the ordinary principle of a billing is that the fee has to have some relationship to the amount recovered where all that's at issue is damages?"
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2895.463,2917.643,"If all that were issued, Your Honor, were the private parties' recovery, that argument would be more persuasive, but, as has been stated in opinions of this Court, the civil rights plaintiff enters the court wearing the mantle of the public interest, seeking to vindicate the public policy as well as the injury to private rights."
1984.83-1437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2917.643,2921.863,And that justifies an award of attorney's fees three times the amount of damages?
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2921.863,2945.979,"I should suggest, Your Honor, that no case has set a fixed ratio or a fixed maximum to the ratio that attorney's fees may bear to recovery, and there... but there are cases in which attorney's fees awards have exceeded the amount of damages awarded to the client."
1984.83-1437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2945.979,2947.596,Any approved by this Court?
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2947.596,2966.892,"None comes to mind at this moment, Your Honor, and... but I do recall the case, I believe, of Cooper v. Singer, decided by the Tenth Circuit en banc recently, in which that was the case."
1984.83-1437,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2972.63,2985.538,"Well, in these cases where, according to you, they are doing the government's work and they are acting as private attorneys general, and for that reason you pay them five times what the Attorney General gets?"
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,2990.675,2998.613,"Your Honor, the function... it is the responsibility of the trial judge to set a reasonable attorney's fee."
1984.83-1437,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3004.601,3011.088,"The trial court should give attorney's fees of three times what he gets, the judge gets?"
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,3011.088,3013.021,--The--
1984.83-1437,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3013.021,3016.207,I am just wondering where you go on this.
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,3016.207,3030.649,"--The guidance offered by Hensley v. Eckerhart, Your Honor, was not in terms of ratios, fractions, multiplying factors; it was in terms of hours spent reasonably."
1984.83-1437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3033.518,3039.505,"Well, did Hensley really get into any of the issues we're dealing with here under Rule 68?"
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,3039.505,3052.748,"I think, Your Honor, that Hensley gave the trial judge a starting point to reach what other cases have called a lead-star figure, from which variation can then be made on a variety of factors."
1984.83-1437,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3122.142,3136.486,"Mr. Stone, excuse the interruption, but just to clarify for my benefit, if you would, we have attorney's fees being requested here by each party, in effect."
1984.83-1437,2,43672,victor_j_stone,,3148.81,3160.451,"If I recall correctly, Your Honor, defendant made a post-trial motion in which there was a request made for determination of attorney's fees, but no specific sum was mentioned; is that correct?"
