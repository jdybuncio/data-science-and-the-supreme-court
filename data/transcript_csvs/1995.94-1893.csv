1995.94-1893,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.951,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-1893, United States, the Federal Communications Commission v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company, and National Cable Television v. Bell Atlantic Corporation."
1995.94-1893,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,16.903,21.066,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1893,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1933.052,1938.805,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1893,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1962.483,1967.054,"Mr. Tribe, is this a facial challenge?"
1995.94-1893,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1967.054,1968.855,"Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-1893,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1968.855,1975.279,And do we have to look at it for its validity as of the time it was enacted?
1995.94-1893,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1975.279,2006.301,"Well, I think as in Baker v. Carr there are a few things that with changes can suddenly become wholly irrational, as this one did, but I think even if you try to turn the clock back to 1984, this law would have completely failed to fit the alleged objective, so I don't think you need to reach the moving target question, because it seems to me this law has always been facially invalid, and facially invalid for reasons that I think were implicit in one of your questions to Mr. Wallace."
1995.94-1893,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.301,2015.348,"Well then, would it be appropriate for us to examine the constitutionality as of the date of enactment, and then just ignore all this subsequent history?"
1995.94-1893,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2015.348,2015.659,No.
1995.94-1893,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.288,2044.49,"Well, but things change."
1995.94-1893,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2051.385,2052.216,"That's right, and there is none."
1995.94-1893,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.216,2057.571,"Well, we can say there could be a situation if, you know, everything went back to the way it was, that would be a situation that--"
1995.94-1893,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2057.571,2058.6,A meteorite hit--
1995.94-1893,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.6,2059.38,--Whatever.
1995.94-1893,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2059.931,2061.663,"--I mean, my--"
1995.94-1893,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.663,2063.366,--That's why there's a stock market.
1995.94-1893,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2065.188,2074.623,"--Yes, but it is our position, Justice Scalia, that because of the way this law is written and because of what it means, there really are no circumstances in which it could be constitutional."
1995.94-1893,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.623,2074.774,All right.
1995.94-1893,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2075.495,2076.446,And that relieves the--
1995.94-1893,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.446,2077.815,--Even when it was initially enacted.
1995.94-1893,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2078.056,2078.397,--That's right.
1995.94-1893,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.397,2080.107,--And you're willing to defend that position.
1995.94-1893,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2080.107,2081.139,And I'm willing to defend that position.
1995.94-1893,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4080.454,4082.715,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.94-1893,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4211.02,4213.383,I don't think he's saying that.
1995.94-1893,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4238.411,4271.072,"--Well, the Third Report and Order gives them the right to participate on video dial tone, precisely what it was that the Fourth Circuit posited at the urging of respondents as the less restrictive alternative that could have been adopted to accomplish the Government's purposes, and yet they're resisting the fact that this has been achieved now through administrative interpretation and application of the waiver provision--"
