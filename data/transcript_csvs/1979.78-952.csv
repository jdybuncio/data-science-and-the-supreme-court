1979.78-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,37.443,"We will hear argument next in 78-952, Rush v. Savchuk."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,43.019,47.042,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,230.767,232.221,By what?
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,232.221,235.177,"By ignoring, I say."
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,238.747,240.783,Misunderstanding.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,240.783,243.854,"I would like to use that word, yes, sir."
1979.78-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,339.19,344.003,Your brief indicates that this plaintiff has now moved out of the State of Minnesota.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,344.003,352.084,"Yes, he has emigrated again to Pennsylvania so that means I think he has lived in three states in six years."
1979.78-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,449.667,451.875,You had a divided vote on the court.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,451.875,452.633,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1979.78-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,452.633,454.195,You had a divided vote on the court.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,454.195,464.135,"Yes, the vote was 6-3, Mr. Justice Otis dissenting, and Madam Justice Wahl writing the majority opinion."
1979.78-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,464.135,469.755,"A hundred years ago, Minnesota didn't have a guest statute, and am I correct in assuming that it still doesn't have one?"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,469.755,472.557,"No, sir, Minnesota has never had a guest statute."
1979.78-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,476.966,481.543,"And you also do not have a direct action statute, as Arkansas does?"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,481.543,484.429,"No, we do not have a direct action statute."
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,658.616,672.279,"Mr. Adamson, I assume -- maybe I should not -- that your principal client is the insurance company rather than the individual and there could be a conflict I suppose here."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,696.86,700.967,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I would like to answer that question in two parts."
1979.78-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,704.91,708.677,"I am not suggesting an ethical problem, but there is an economic --"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,708.677,719.008,The economic problem -- this is what would transpire if jurisdiction were allowed in this case and Mr. Rush would refuse to cooperate in his defense.
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.158,727.12,For the policy limit?
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,727.12,728.145,Yes.
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.145,729.95,But he could not be held in contempt of court?
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,729.95,731.462,"No, sir."
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.462,736.015,So really it is in the nature of a suit against the insurance company on the policy.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,736.015,740.143,But if Mr. Rush were to avail himself of that privilege of not cooperating with his insurance company and what have you --
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,740.143,744.23,And the insurance company could sue him.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,744.23,751.943,-- there would be quite a problem about enforcing that judgment against the insurance company because of his breach of the insurance contract of cooperation.
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,751.943,761.851,"Well, suppose at the outset of the litigation he said I am simply not going to go up to Minnesota and if you want to terminate your coverage, go ahead and terminate it, and they terminate the coverage."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,765.621,778.804,"If I understand your hypothetical, of course, a termination of coverage as of the time Mr. Rush told State Farm he didn't want any more to do with it would not affect the period of time when there was coverage at which time the accident had happened."
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,778.804,781.421,But would it not extinguish their duty to defend?
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,781.421,782.346,"No, sir."
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,782.346,787.285,They have a duty to defend even if he breaches his obligation to cooperate?
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,787.285,790.081,"Even if he breaches his obligation to cooperate, yes, sir."
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,790.081,791.259,They then still have the duty to defend?
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,791.259,791.975,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.975,793.868,I see.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,794.488,798.815,"That period is very brief, as I understand it."
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,798.815,800.094,I see.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,809.023,812.75,"There is not a shadow of doubt in my mind about that, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.75,813.134,Yes.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,813.134,814.922,He could not be.
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,814.922,825.996,"Well, there is not a shadow of doubt in your mind that the Minnesota court was wrong in this case either, as you submitted it to us, but what do you think the Minnesota courts would hold?"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,836.646,843.887,They have held that they have quasi in rem jurisdiction over Mr. Rush to the extent of the liability policy.
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,843.887,845.263,To enter a judgment against him.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,845.263,847.22,There is no in personam jurisdiction in this --
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,847.22,851.863,-- to enter a judgment against him to the extent of the limits of liability of the liability policy.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,851.863,854.435,Yes.
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,854.918,866.628,Don't you think it might follow in view of the Minnesota court that the Minnesota court had the power to punish him for contempt for refusing to obey a subpena?
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,866.628,868.413,"No, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart, I do not."
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.413,870.483,You don't --
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,870.483,871.84,There is just no basis for it.
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,871.979,876.917,"Well, you think there is no basis for the Minnesota court opinion in this case."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,876.917,880.602,I want to answer your specific question without getting off on this tangent here.
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,887.494,889.146,Nothing more than a notice and a request.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,889.146,893.177,"Yes, they can request him but they can't subpena him because of the limitations of the state lines."
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,893.177,894.905,And the penalty is a default judgment.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,894.905,902.063,"Default judgment, a civil penalty which is imposed in that way but not to put him in jail or fine him or do something of that nature."
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.063,907.665,The judgment that may be entered against him is not a personal judgment.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,907.665,908.231,"No, sir."
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,908.231,916.955,It is in a sense that it would -- the judgment entered would not be enforceable against him in another state.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,916.955,920.54,"If we are talking about a default judgment, the answer to that is no."
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,926.933,936.432,"Well, say a judgment is entered and the person who gets the judgment prefers to enforce it in Indiana, against him personally."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,936.432,939.442,"Mr. Justice White, is this a default judgment or --"
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,939.442,940.84,"No, it is after a trial."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,940.84,942.057,It is an adversary judgment.
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,942.057,943.764,And he has never shown up.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,943.764,944.971,All right.
1979.78-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.957,965.46,"Well, because he doesn't want to fight with you because he has just heard you say in court that if Rush doesn't show up there may be a terrible problem of enforcing your liability on the policy."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,965.46,973.475,"But the point that you raise that hadn't occurred to me, I suppose if State Farm went bankrupt in the interim he might go to Indiana looking for Mr. Rush."
1979.78-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.475,976.135,"Well, what is the basis for personal jurisdiction of it?"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,976.135,982.632,"There isn't any, if I understand your question, Mr. Justice White."
1979.78-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.632,986.029,That is the question I had and I am not sure I quite got your answer.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,989.762,991.345,I don't know.
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,997.16,998.095,But the race is now the security.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,998.095,1000.871,The race is the policy so I suppose it wouldn't work.
1979.78-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.169,1037.215,"I know, but you would at least concede that they couldn't sue them on that judgment for over the $50,000."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1037.215,1037.849,I don't know.
1979.78-952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1040.604,1042.223,Suppose it is.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1042.223,1042.38,He goes over --
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.38,1044.563,What if they were relying on Housley?
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1044.563,1050.601,He goes over to North Dakota and he says I have a deficiency and you have a gold mine over here.
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1050.601,1050.706,"Well, it may be but --"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1050.706,1052.342,You've had your day in court --
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.342,1072.013,"-- it is a different question though I think whether they can -- if they started an independent action, a new action in Indiana and relying on Park Lane or some doctrine of collateral estoppel, but they couldn't rely -- just take this judgment in Indiana and sue on it."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1072.013,1074.862,I would start a brand new action and seek collateral estoppel against him --
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1074.862,1077.179,Would you suggest that?
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1077.179,1078.646,-- and say you have had your day in court and --
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1078.646,1082.311,"Well, it may be but that would be in a new lawsuit."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1082.311,1083.215,"Yes, sir, it would."
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1083.215,1086.096,But how about this judgment?
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1086.096,1086.84,This judgment --
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.84,1089.225,The million dollar judgment that --
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1089.225,1093.991,"The Minnesota judgment in Minnesota is worth $50,000 and no more."
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1093.991,1096.134,"Well, is it worth any more in Indiana?"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1097.975,1098.701,I can't answer that question.
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1098.701,1104.229,"Say you started a suit on that judgment in Indiana, like you normally would to collect a judgment."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1104.229,1112.999,"He shouldn't be able to, but I don't know the answer to that because of the very, shall we say, unusual jurisdictional basis that we have here to begin with."
1979.78-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1130.936,1132.79,"Mr. Adamson, may I ask this question of you."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1132.79,1134.691,"Yes, Mr. Justice Powell."
1979.78-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1134.691,1155.0,"Assume that the plaintiff in this case, in order to protect himself against the possibility that Minnesota would not have taken jurisdiction, had simultaneously instituted a personal damage suit in Indiana, the situs of the accident."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1157.098,1175.553,"Well, if he had commenced the lawsuit in Indiana prior to the running of the Indiana statute of limitations, of course it would change the situation and he would have a valid in personam action going for him in Indiana and he wouldn't need a quasi in rem proceeding in Minnesota at all."
1979.78-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1181.103,1203.676,"Well, he may have thought it more convenient to litigate in Minnesota but just as an anchor to win with, he may also have sued in Indiana so that if his insurer paid $50,000 in Minnesota, the plaintiff still might recover the rest of that million dollars you mentioned in Indiana if you had a solvent defendant, if this was a 20-year-old young man --"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1203.676,1204.207,That's right.
1979.78-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1204.207,1207.87,-- presumably incapable of responding to further judgment.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1224.906,1231.697,"Again, since there is no determinations by any court in this area, I would be just giving you my expert opinion."
1979.78-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1243.738,1245.009,Nobody knows.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1245.934,1250.664,No one knows what the Minnesota courts would do in that area.
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1250.664,1265.162,"Mr. Adamson, where do you suppose the limitation imposed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota that this procedure is available only to residents of the forum state came from?"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1265.162,1283.274,"They told us in their opinion -- I think it was the first subject opinion, where Chief Justice Sheran made it clear that without the plaintiff's connection -- we are using International Shoe language now -- without plaintiff's connection to the state of Minnesota, Minnesota was --"
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1283.274,1286.057,"You mean by residence, by being domiciled there."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1286.057,1297.019,"That's right, by being a resident citizen of the state of Minnesota, without plaintiff's connection with the state of Minnesota, Minnesota would lack sufficient contacts with the suit to justify jurisdiction."
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1299.12,1305.662,"But the sufficient contacts, as you are submitting, has to do with the defendant and not the plaintiff."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1305.662,1306.717,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1341.459,1362.728,"Well, would the Minnesota court under its present decision after the remand under Shaffer say that a resident of Minnesota can sue a defendant in any other state anywhere?"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1362.728,1380.216,The Supreme Court of Minnesota in both of its decisions held that a resident may sue a non-resident involving any tort which occurred anywhere in the world providing he can get garnishment jurisdiction over the insurance company within the state of Minnesota.
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1381.886,1390.478,"Well, what I am curious about is does Minnesota law require any contacts on the part of the defendant with the state?"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1390.478,1392.523,None whatsoever.
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1392.523,1394.322,Except through his insurer.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1394.322,1402.131,Except through the vehicle of the fact that the happenstance that his insurer happens to do business in the state of Minnesota.
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1402.131,1403.318,That's it.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1403.318,1404.894,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1404.894,1405.789,I said that's it.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1405.789,1405.948,That's it.
1979.78-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1405.948,1409.687,"It depended on property there, i.e., his interest in the insurance policy."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1409.687,1409.911,Yes.
1979.78-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1409.911,1427.576,"Of course, what he owns is precisely the protection of an insurance policy and what he owns is the promise of the insurance company to defend him against such suits as this."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1427.576,1429.218,"That's right, and to pay --"
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1429.218,1437.279,"It certainly is not just some chance property, something that is actually bought to defend him against suits."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1437.279,1446.269,"But the point is, Your Honors, that as in Shaffer, the insurance contract itself is not the subject matter of the litigation."
1979.78-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.917,1470.868,"But nobody bought the stock in order to provide for -- in order to provide a way to respond to litigation, but that is what this insurance policy was bought for, one of the reasons."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1470.868,1474.8,Let me live dangerously and suggest a hypothetical to you.
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1502.083,1510.181,"Well, are you suggesting that pre-Shaffer that this would have been all right?"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1510.181,1512.043,Which would have been all right?
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1512.043,1513.572,The Minnesota result.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1513.572,1518.268,"Well, we were contending that it was the wrong -- before this Court had --"
1979.78-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1518.268,1528.702,"I know, but the way you depend on Shaffer you would think that it would have been quite proper before it."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1528.702,1538.321,"Well, the reason we are depending so on Shaffer is that, of course, it is an utterance of the highest court in this land in a quasi in rem jurisdiction case and it carries extreme --"
1979.78-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1538.321,1544.359,"I don't blame you, but even before Shaffer your arguments sound like it would have been bad."
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1549.853,1560.389,"Oh, you mean is the doctrine of Seider v. Roth what we are talking about, now the Minnesota garnishment rule and what have you, is that a bad thing before Shaffer?"
1979.78-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1560.389,1560.79,Yes.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1560.79,1562.339,It certainly was.
1979.78-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1562.339,1564.832,"Under what, International Shoe or --"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1564.832,1586.547,"I would say under International Shoe the trend of the case law, as Mr. Justice Marshall so clearly pointed out, was all going in this direction with this mechanical -- you see, up until Shaffer the underpinning of all of these Seider v. Roth cases was Harris v. Balk, just that naked power over the property in the state."
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1603.612,1626.719,"Mr. Adamson, on the Shaffer point, suppose that instead of an insurance policy the defendant had a bank account over the years and just kept $50,000 in the state and had no other contact with the state, would you say that under Shaffer the plaintiff could get jurisdiction, quasi in rem jurisdiction to the extent of $50,000?"
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1626.719,1634.459,"Under Shaffer, if the bank account had nothing to do wish this litigation, that the only purpose was to acquire jurisdiction and to collect the judgment --"
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1634.459,1635.09,That's right.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1635.09,1642.234,"-- under Shaffer he would have no right to garnish that bank account, none whatsoever, as I understand Shaffer."
1979.78-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1642.234,1642.318,But there would be a chance in --
1979.78-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.318,1645.065,But under Harris v. Balk he would.
1979.78-952,0,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,1645.065,1650.067,"Yes, sir, most definitely."
1979.78-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1652.208,1658.02,Very well.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,1667.415,1674.62,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1929.917,1940.045,Do you agree that the defendant as an individual had no contact with the forum?
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,1940.045,1941.763,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1941.763,1956.288,"And isn't it something of an over-simplification to say that the insurance company comes in and calls the shots, with the duty to settle, the duty to cooperate and so forth?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,1966.377,2003.273,"Well, maybe the choice of words, ""calling the shots,"" is incorrect to use that term, but the plaintiff after the automobile accident occurred and the defendant gives notice through his insurance carrier from that time on, myself or as attorney for the plaintiff would then only contact -- the only contact we have is the attorney really for the insurance company, even though he is representing the defendant through the policy."
1979.78-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2037.046,2054.141,"You have never run into a case where the defendant individually hired his own lawyer because he felt the insurance company was refusing a reasonable offer of settlement and insisted that the insurance company settle, where the insurance company is unwilling to settle?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2054.141,2056.904,"Yes, in bad faith."
1979.78-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2056.904,2062.63,Or where there was a risk of a judgment beyond the amount of the coverage.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2062.63,2064.851,"That may be true, Your Honor, too."
1979.78-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2099.437,2102.9,"Mr. Borkon, I am not sure I follow your argument."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2122.089,2122.566,Had been a what?
1979.78-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2122.566,2141.331,"Had been a Rockefeller, with many millions of dollars that could have paid any deficiency judgment, would you have dealt if you had the case originally with the insurance company or with the counsel for the wealthy defendant who could pay a million dollar judgment?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2141.331,2142.757,Well --
1979.78-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2142.757,2156.873,I don't understand whether you are saying that Minnesota has jurisdiction in this case only because the only party likely to respond to any judgment anywhere is the insurance company.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2156.873,2166.514,"Well, it is to get jurisdiction is proper because the insurance company is the one doing business in Minnesota."
1979.78-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.958,2214.998,"But if the statute of limitations had not run in Indiana in the case that I put to you, you would have had to advise your client to sue in Indiana, wouldn't you?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2214.998,2218.472,"If there would be unlimited resources, depending on his injuries."
1979.78-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.472,2219.356,Yes.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2219.356,2224.001,That's right.
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2224.001,2236.16,"Mr. Borkon, do you agree that if the insurance company should go bankrupt you could not -- assume you got a $50,000 which I guess is the policy limit, you could not collect the judgment from the defendant individually?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2236.16,2239.809,"Well, I would agree with that because of the --"
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2239.809,2240.911,The quasi in rem.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2240.911,2244.119,-- the quasi in rem is the race of the insurance policy that --
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2244.119,2255.58,Would you also agree that the individual defendant should defy any court order and not risk contempt if he just didn't show up and just didn't respond to any notice or anything like that?
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2255.58,2257.406,I would agree with that.
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2257.406,2271.913,"And if you got a judgment for a million dollars in Minnesota and the policy limits were $50,000, you couldn't enforce the million dollar judgment personally against the defendant in Indiana?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2271.913,2273.347,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2280.169,2291.242,I take it you haven't agreed not to use this judgment as binding on him in a separate suit in Indiana.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2291.242,2292.443,"Well, we have."
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2298.6,2310.239,"I know in Minnesota, but what if you went to -- have you agreed not to sue him for anything in addition in Indiana?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2310.239,2312.793,Yes.
1979.78-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2312.793,2317.167,"Didn't you sue originally for more than $50,000?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2317.167,2323.204,"Well, it was sued and then it was amended to bring it within the $50,000."
1979.78-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2323.204,2328.559,"You brought it originally for $125,000 or $150,000 as I recall."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2328.559,2332.661,"It was $125,000 plus the 110 following the garnishment statute."
1979.78-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2332.661,2333.336,I see.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2333.336,2342.116,"Then after State Farm answered the supplemental -- well, first they answered that they owed no doubt."
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2356.983,2365.43,"But how did you agree not to sue for more in Indiana if -- let's assume you got your $50,000 judgment in Minnesota."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2365.43,2366.289,That's correct.
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2366.289,2373.538,"Now, in what form did you agree not to sue for more in Indiana in a separate suit?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2373.538,2385.51,"Well, we stipulated following the Minnesota law that we would have to agree to the $50,000 judgment in Minnesota and that you wouldn't be suing him."
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.51,2386.289,Why?
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2388.572,2390.801,"Well, it is because we --"
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.801,2400.789,"Just because you can only collect $50,000 in Minnesota, why does that mean that you are barred from suing for the balance of what you claim your injury was in Indiana?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2400.789,2404.251,"Well, we have agreed to it in this case."
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2404.251,2407.793,In this case you aren't giving up anything because the statute had run in Indiana.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2407.793,2411.437,"Well, they both have run now, of course, but we don't know --"
1979.78-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.437,2415.166,"But when the case came to you, the statute had run in Indiana?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2415.166,2416.059,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.059,2418.774,The statute is longer in Minnesota?
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2418.774,2421.151,The statute has run in Minnesota as well.
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2421.151,2425.01,"I know now, but when you instituted the first action."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2425.01,2426.816,The statute in Minnesota had not run.
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2426.816,2427.933,How about Indiana?
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2427.933,2429.278,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2429.278,2434.72,So the statute in Minnesota was longer in a personal injury case than it is in Indiana?
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2434.72,2437.95,"That's correct, six years in Minnesota and two years in Indiana."
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2437.95,2444.213,And also you have the doctrine of comparative negligence rather than contributory negligence.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2444.213,2448.578,"That's correct, Your Honor, and we don't have the guest statute."
1979.78-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2448.578,2455.078,"And if you can find a state with a longer statute of limitations, you can file another suit now, couldn't you?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2455.078,2464.051,"Well, we are saying that at least from our viewpoint that we would only take a case where our plaintiff is a legitimate resident of Minnesota."
1979.78-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.716,2468.159,And how he is in Pennsylvania?
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2468.159,2482.075,"That's correct, Your Honor, but he was there five years afterwards, plus it is at the time he brings the lawsuit and I think in this day and age, a wholesome young man that had business opportunity elsewhere than in Minnesota."
1979.78-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2482.075,2485.821,And also a favorable statute.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2485.821,2498.227,"Well, I would have to say that I don't know if he knew that because we didn't have the case when he moved and for sometime afterwards."
1979.78-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.853,2513.101,"Well, how could the state of Minnesota's law apply to this accident?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2513.101,2515.049,Through the insurance company.
1979.78-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.947,2530.344,"What you are really saying is it doesn't matter whether there was an accident or not, aren't you?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2530.344,2570.346,"I am saying that Minnesota could follow the Shaffer case with no problem because it is a particular statute that the Minnesota courts or the legislature at first recognized and said when it comes to automobiles and automobile liability insurance, this will be the law, and we can still follow Shaffer and International Shoe because they are looking at the cases in Minnesota and saying that the minimum contacts have been met, that you can't take --"
1979.78-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2570.346,2570.797,"Oh, I get what you mean."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2575.451,2576.89,"That's true, Your Honor."
1979.78-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2576.89,2583.937,"Oh, now I see."
1979.78-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2583.937,2591.885,Does your client have accident insurance with -- he was injured -- or do you know?
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2596.656,2597.834,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2597.834,2606.439,"And he suffered some injuries and he had some medical expenses, I suppose."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2607.341,2608.561,I think the medical --
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.561,2611.282,Or do you just think that is irrelevant?
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2611.282,2620.531,"Well, it could be for quasi in rem jurisdiction, but I think that the --"
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.531,2625.048,"Mr. Borkon, could I ask you a question on an assumption on the policy terms."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2652.677,2653.477,"Well, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.163,2668.173,"But maybe Indiana would let them write, because some states have considered this kind of litigation and decided not to adopt this kind of statute."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2668.173,2668.431,That's correct.
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2668.431,2677.752,"And in those states I assume they would permit -- say Indiana might well permit that kind of policy to be written and issued in Indiana, but that is what it said."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2687.371,2688.356,It probably would.
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.356,2693.197,It rests entirely on the terms of the contract between the insurance company and the insured.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2693.197,2695.538,Plus I don't think you can leave out the plaintiff.
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2698.97,2703.803,"Yes, but there is no duty to defend and the mere fact that the plaintiff lives in Minnesota certainly is the sufficient basis for it."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2703.803,2705.8,Correct.
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2715.102,2720.349,You don't have to answer if you have no contacts in Minnesota though.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2724.554,2730.612,"Well, he has no risk in this case because he is not going to give up anything."
1979.78-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2735.705,2737.11,I understand.
1979.78-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2737.11,2744.38,"But if you were uninsured, you would have no risk in Minnesota either."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2744.38,2755.955,"Well, you would have no risk but to say that we -- it is rare if at all that we would take a case where the defendant is uninsured."
1979.78-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2755.955,2758.436,"Well, I wasn't asking whether you would take the case."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2771.358,2771.958,That's true.
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2771.958,2783.141,"Well, that is true about all in rem and quasi in rem jurisdiction if the defendant doesn't own real or personal property in the jurisdiction, there cannot be in rem or quasi in rem jurisdiction."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2783.141,2784.734,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2820.636,2828.219,"Mr. Borkon, in the original papers, the insurance company took the position that the debt was zero, as I understood it, because it was a contingent liability."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2828.219,2829.245,Right.
1979.78-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2829.245,2833.311,"They never did deny that they had an obligation to defend though, did they?"
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2833.311,2837.146,"No, they never denied that."
1979.78-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2837.146,2841.286,"Nor an obligation to pay, a conditional obligation to pay."
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2841.286,2843.224,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2928.297,2931.259,Apparently there are no further questions.
1979.78-952,1,22014,edward_h_borkonz,,2931.259,2931.738,Thank you.
1979.78-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2931.738,2934.911,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Adamson?"
1979.78-952,2,37365,oscar_c_adamson_ii,,2934.911,2961.992,"Very briefly, I have listened to my friend and I have not heard him touch at all upon what is, of course, the keystone language I believe is the Shaffer opinion, and that language is if a direct assertion of personal jurisdiction over the defendant would violate the Constitution, it would seem that an indirect assertion of the jurisdiction should be equally impermissible."
1979.78-952,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2976.315,2976.939,"Thank you, gentlemen."
