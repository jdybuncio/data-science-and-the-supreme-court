1975.74-1529,0,31468,joel_lewittes,,182.598,184.025,"He was there as patient, Your Honor."
1975.74-1529,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,381.027,397.588,"Mr. Lewittes, does the New York make what I think of as a customary distinction between the first-degree murder and the second-degree murder that first degree would require a predisposition as well as intent, while at second-degree intent would be sufficient without predisposition or premeditation?"
1975.74-1529,0,31468,joel_lewittes,,397.588,399.292,That is correct.
1975.74-1529,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,605.779,607.632,It was not orally argued.
1975.74-1529,0,31468,joel_lewittes,,607.632,609.24,It was not
1975.74-1529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,609.24,614.716,"If you know about the tendency of the application for Certificate of Probable Cause, did your office know?"
1975.74-1529,0,31468,joel_lewittes,,614.716,616.755,We did not know at that time.
1975.74-1529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,616.755,617.201,"Although, this was --"
1975.74-1529,0,31468,joel_lewittes,,617.201,622.671,That is correct.
1975.74-1529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,622.671,625.945,"Does a statute or rule require notice, I wonder?"
1975.74-1529,0,31468,joel_lewittes,,625.945,627.381,I do not believe that it does.
1975.74-1529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,652.051,660.061,"(Inaudible), is there any practice at all relating the notice that you are familiar with?"
1975.74-1529,0,31468,joel_lewittes,,660.061,667.477,I can say Justice Brennan that there is no hard and fast rule.
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1648.632,1653.019,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.74-1529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1705.352,1708.114,You mean that that (Inaudible) circumstances rule?
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1708.114,1708.584,"I do, your Honor."
1975.74-1529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1708.584,1710.867,Do you think the Second Circuit did?
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1710.867,1711.513,Yes.
1975.74-1529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1711.513,1712.24,In this case?
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1712.24,1715.615,"In this case, very definitely Your Honor, if I may explain."
1975.74-1529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1715.615,1719.96,How do you explain the Court relying on Rule 11 in the McCarthy case?
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1719.96,1724.682,"No, I do not think that this case stands for proposition as counsel has suggested that this means that every --"
1975.74-1529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1724.682,1727.906,"McCarthy decided in the opinion, it is not?"
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1727.906,1731.875,The opinion says that the plea must be voluntary.
1975.74-1529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1750.36,1759.272,The crucial elements of those of the totality of circumstances starting I suppose with the fact that he had counsel or you would concede that was --
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1759.272,1761.703,That would be pertinent very definitely Your Honor.
1975.74-1529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.366,1766.289,But you have to inquire whether this was experience Counsel?
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1766.289,1767.533,Yes.
1975.74-1529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1767.533,1769.568,Do you think its passes those two tests here?
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1769.568,1775.636,"Yes, I have no quarrel with the conduct of the defense counsel here."
1975.74-1529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1811.019,1821.277,"Mr. Lynch, Judge Port originally found that it had been a voluntary and intelligent plea, and then the Second Circuit reversed."
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1821.277,1821.964,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.964,1830.716,And at Page 10 that very short opinion of the Second Circuit or at Page 10A of your petition.
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1849.535,1861.502,"It certainly suggests that the Second Circuit thought it was important, but that does not mean I believe that in deciding this case Judge Port looked only at that issue."
1975.74-1529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.12,1897.869,But then let me interruption you and then go ahead and answer as much.
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1928.347,1935.812,"I respectfully disagree, Your Honor, because in Judge Portâ€™s original decision there had been no evidentiary hearing."
1975.74-1529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.837,1956.343,He does not say he did though.
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,1956.343,1958.774,Oh no! That is true.
1975.74-1529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.208,2065.871,What you can say that is just the other side of the -- but requiring on guilty plea -- you are supposed to put on the record if the elements that go to guilty plea.
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,2065.871,2068.426,Under the Federal rules as I understand them that is correct.
1975.74-1529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.426,2070.195,It is under Boykin too.
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,2070.195,2070.731,Yes.
1975.74-1529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.731,2080.956,"Under Boykin, and so may we assume that the Judge put up record the elements that he relied on in overturning the guilty plea?"
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,2082.322,2094.563,"Yes, I think you may assumed that I would like to have you also assume what I think is a valid assumption that when a Judge says I am going to take into consideration all of the circumstances that is what he does."
1975.74-1529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2097.826,2099.68,First time or the second time.
1975.74-1529,1,31425,joseph_e_lynch,,2099.68,2101.115,The second intent.
