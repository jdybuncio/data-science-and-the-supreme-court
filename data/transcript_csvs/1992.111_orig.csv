1992.111_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.488,"We'll hear argument next in No. 111 Original, the State of Delaware v. the State of New York."
1992.111_orig,0,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,45.382,48.963,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1992.111_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,142.967,146.978,Why does this occur so often and generate so much revenue?
1992.111_orig,0,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,146.978,163.988,"It occurs, I believe, because of the activities in the securities markets, that you have an issuer who's maintaining a record, you have securities which are traded, and they sometimes get traded in semibearer form."
1992.111_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.896,311.685,"Mr. Lyons, if we were to apply the rule and the backup rule and the doctrines enunciated by this Court in prior cases, does that mean Delaware would prevail here?"
1992.111_orig,0,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,311.685,312.656,Delaware would prevail--
1992.111_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.656,317.699,"I mean, it's the State of incorporation of the holder--"
1992.111_orig,0,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,317.699,318.65,--Yes.
1992.111_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,318.65,319.842,--Of the dividends.
1992.111_orig,0,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,319.842,322.603,"Yes, it would, and New York would prevail as to the--"
1992.111_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.603,326.695,Treating the holder as the creditor--
1992.111_orig,0,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,326.695,327.536,--As the debtor.
1992.111_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.536,328.137,--Debtor.
1992.111_orig,0,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,328.137,329.697,"As the debtor, yes, Your Honor."
1992.111_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,346.43,353.613,"Well now, the Special Master didn't take that view and didn't treat the broker as the debtor."
1992.111_orig,0,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,353.613,383.994,"He came close to acknowledging, if Your Honor please, that the broker was a debtor under State law, and he said the State law was technical and that what we needed here was a Federal common law, and under Federal common law, even though it wasn't the case under State law, and I think that's quite clear... there's a litany of reasons why it's clear... we will treat the issuer as being the debtor."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,979.773,987.928,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.93,1022.523,Why is that fairer?
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1027.596,1056.053,"Well, the Master's notion was that, since these are basically funds that are stuck among intermediaries who have no beneficial interest in those funds, it would be more equitable to return those funds to the States of the issuers and benefit their citizens, because they generate it, if you will, through their investment, the underlying securities."
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.053,1057.475,"Well, maybe we could give it to the Federal Government."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1062.868,1068.161,"Well, Your Honor, that may be... that would be another approach."
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1068.161,1069.363,"That's another approach, I agree."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1069.363,1076.255,What we're asking for is that it be distributed pursuant to the straightforward rules as they currently demand.
1992.111_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1076.255,1080.268,"Yes, why isn't it fairer to just follow the Court's precedents here?"
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1083.441,1085.882,"I believe it is fairer, Your Honor."
1992.111_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1114.584,1124.898,"Well, I suppose Congress can certainly step in and change the formula and maybe if 48 States are out there asking them to do it, it wouldn't be too tough, would it?"
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1124.898,1152.468,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I would suggest... New York would suggest if there's something particularly unfair in this particular context about distributing or escheating these funds pursuant to the existing black letter escheat rules as set down by this Court, we would suggest that institutionally it would be better if it were left to Congress to make those changes as it did with respect to the Western Union money orders."
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.954,1243.516,"Between you and Delaware, or not?"
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1243.516,1246.147,On the backup rule there is no dispute.
1992.111_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1296.272,1297.392,"Well, did the Master--"
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1297.392,1297.842,--As it relates to our theory.
1992.111_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1297.842,1306.578,"--Did the Master determine that the money we're talking about, as to that money, the creditors are not known?"
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1308.578,1309.68,That's correct.
1992.111_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1309.68,1321.017,"And what you're arguing is for the application of some sort of presumption to determine who the creditors are, is that it?"
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1321.017,1322.018,"No, Your Honor."
1992.111_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1322.018,1322.469,No.
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1322.469,1355.809,"There are three elements to our factual contention that the brokers can be identified, the creditor-brokers, and the first contention, or the first element, is that brokers' nominee float results from the exchange of physical certificates between brokers and banks, and the failure of the recipient broker or bank to reregister that certificate into its own name or nominee name before the record date."
1992.111_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1451.723,1452.224,"Well, in--"
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1453.313,1466.543,"Prove that the addresses on the debtor broker's books would identify a creditor-broker with a trading address in New York in almost every instance, so we're not--"
1992.111_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1466.543,1471.194,Won't that simply get you in most instances to yet another holder?
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1473.865,1476.469,"--I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
1992.111_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1476.469,1492.789,"If you follow your process and you get to the now hidden set of books, they're going to... or follow the books and you get yourself to a hidden entity, that entity is simply going to be another holder, isn't it, it's not going to be the issuer in many cases?"
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1499.475,1500.804,"No, Your Honor."
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.431,1540.07,But it won't tell you whether the creditor-broker that you say can be identified is holding... would have been trading on his own account or for somebody else.
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1540.07,1548.496,"--Not necessarily, but the primary rule as it currently stands does not require the exploration of ownership."
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.072,1563.876,"You don't have to get to the beneficial owner under the primary rule, even as we've applied it."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1563.876,1565.085,That's correct.
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1565.085,1566.007,You just get to the record only.
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1567.208,1580.006,"Well, first of all, I should point out that the creditor-broker identified on the debtor-broker's books is the apparent owner, may be the beneficial owner."
1992.111_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1586.59,1605.583,"Well, we don't know, whether we follow your theory or whether we follow the theory that Delaware wants, but the fact is, we have no more reason to believe that following your theory is going to result in a more ultimate equity than if we simply stop where Delaware would have us stop."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1605.583,1629.841,"Well, if... the express purpose of the Court's primary rule as we understand it, at least heretofore, is that it be effectuated where it can, and we're asking for an opportunity to do that, and we believe that we have raised an issue of material fact on this record that would warrant additional discovery in that regard."
1992.111_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1629.841,1634.712,What was the Master's position on this argument?
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1634.712,1647.221,"Well, the Master concluded that the creditor is the beneficial owner, which is at variance with the traditional understanding that the creditor is the apparent owner, the obligee, the party entitled to enforce payment of the debt."
1992.111_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1668.734,1685.506,Did you claim to the Master that if you were allowed this discovery you had any hope of proving that you would be closer to the real beneficial owner if you were allowed to follow your statistical analysis for the purposes of the primary rule?
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1685.506,1690.538,--The beneficial owner has been paid.
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.743,1797.288,"You're saying the Master just misunderstood this system that goes on, because he said... I thought he said that neither these... he treated the Delaware and New York entities as intermediaries who had no beneficial interest in these funds, and you say he's just wrong about that."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1797.288,1799.739,"--Yes, I... that's correct."
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.457,1821.705,"I thought he also offered you the opportunity... maybe I'm wrong about this... offered you the opportunity to put in whatever evidence you could about who, indeed, the real owners are."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1826.147,1842.686,"We were allowed within the general parameters... I mean, our theory, in order to prove it, we submit, we concede, we have to trace... we have to have an opportunity to trace the actual transactions."
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.939,1880.352,"Well, what was lacking?"
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1891.891,1906.59,"Well, what the Master told us we could do is that we could trace... we could do this, but it has to be done on an individual case-by-case basis and you have to be able to establish who the beneficial owner is."
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1910.403,1918.327,"--Well, no, I thought he... I thought he found you didn't even prove that in the overwhelming number of cases this is going to be the situation."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1918.327,1919.978,--Well--
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.978,1926.852,"I mean, I'm not sure... he didn't even buy the fact that you had proved the generality to be true, and whose fault is that?"
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1926.852,1938.991,--No... the brokers testified that they don't make the effort to determine... to do the tracing or to discover who the creditor is.
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.633,1961.805,"Well, it seems to me there are two problems."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1968.551,1969.111,Correct.
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.111,1973.633,"--One by one, that you should be able to generalize and apply some statistical generalization."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1995.298,1995.698,Well--
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.698,1999.639,"--And that's a problem of proof that is your problem, not his."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,1999.639,2017.561,"--Justice Scalia, the Master disagreed with our initial predicate... premise that nominee float is the primary cause of the overage that results in escheating to New York or another State under the application of the primary rule."
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2025.716,2027.759,And there's testimony to the contrary--
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2027.759,2029.921,"--There is, but--"
1992.111_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.921,2031.062,--And he just wasn't persuaded.
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2031.062,2067.313,"--Well, I think what is... what certainly goes to our raising a material issue of fact is that the DTC experience, where they have experimented, and this is in the record, with a certificateless security for the last 3 years, or for a 3-year period, there was no unresolved overage, which really bolsters and confirms the testimony that nominee float, these physical certificates floating around that are not reregistered before the record date to the new owner, is the principal cause of the overage."
1992.111_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.313,2073.648,"Well, this is basically a factual argument you're making, Mr. Boone, not a legal argument."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2073.648,2088.447,"Well, our argument proceeds from the premise that the... under the primary rule that the creditor is the apparent owner, which the Master disagreed with, so it is a mixed law-fact argument."
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.716,2134.048,"Well, he couldn't possibly have thought that you had made out a credible case for your New York broker-creditors, as you would have them, really had a beneficial interest in these proceeds that you're claiming, because what he ended up saying was that your position was wholly irrelevant to... in terms of his disposition of the case, which he couldn't have said if he thought that you had made out a case for beneficial ownership in any of these proceeds."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2134.048,2148.117,"--Well, again, we're talking about... the basic problem gets back to the contradiction of the Master's finding that the overage that we're speaking of is caused... brokers routinely pay their customers."
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.117,2148.588,Yes.
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2148.588,2150.518,The Master did not--
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2150.518,2151.68,That's right.
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2151.68,2152.81,--Find... make that finding.
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.81,2153.291,That's right.
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2153.291,2156.253,We submit that the record will refute that.
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.253,2166.389,"Which means that your brokers in New York really should be recognized as the beneficial owners, because they had already paid their customers."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2166.389,2173.613,That's... they are beneficial owners in the sense that the funds are owed to the broker.
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.613,2183.761,"And you would not owe... and those funds that are owed to you, you would not owe to somebody else because you'd already paid them."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2183.761,2185.521,That's correct.
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.521,2185.982,Yes.
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2185.982,2195.659,"And Your Honor, I would ask that with respect to retroactivity that because this Court is engaged in an original jurisdiction rulemaking, there is no need for retroactivity."
1992.111_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.659,2196.38,Thank you--
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2196.38,2196.838,The laws are being changed.
1992.111_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2196.838,2197.95,"--Thank you, Mr. Boone."
1992.111_orig,1,29088,jerry_boone,,2197.95,2198.731,Thank you.
1992.111_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2198.731,2200.033,Mr. Nash.
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2200.033,2213.892,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.111_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2373.186,2384.404,"Well, I thought our precedents would look to the State of incorporation if it's a corporation that you're looking to at all."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2384.404,2386.185,With respect--
1992.111_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2386.185,2387.306,Isn't that so?
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2387.306,2388.936,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1992.111_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2388.936,2392.359,And the Master recommends not adhering to that precedent.
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2392.359,2402.594,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor, with respect to his second recommendation of whether you change the locational test from State of incorporation to principal executive office."
1992.111_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2417.544,2428.912,"Well, as to that, would you concede that under most State law the broker intermediaries might be considered the debtors?"
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2428.912,2439.87,"I would concede that the broker intermediaries would be considered one of several debtors for a single transaction, exactly as the Master held."
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2555.536,2564.021,"You're suggesting that we should decide in all of these cases, as a matter of Federal law, who owes what to whom?"
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2564.021,2566.913,--That is not the issue faced by the Court.
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.504,2568.833,"No, but why not?"
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2578.57,2592.749,--The purposes of State debtor-creditor law were for purposes entirely unrelated to the principles underlying escheat priority between the States.
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2610.441,2616.344,You think it had no reference to what the State... who the State thought the debtor and creditor were.
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2621.538,2622.409,That is correct.
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.146,2638.249,"Well, I'll ask the question I asked earlier."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2644.574,2647.356,Because that would not be fair under the criteria--
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2647.356,2648.285,It wouldn't be fair because of what?
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2649.366,2650.418,"--No, it would not be--"
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2650.418,2652.068,Because some other people have some rights to this money.
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2652.068,2684.298,"--It would not be fair because this Court's equitable criteria indicates that if the person entitled to the funds cannot be found, then the contra party ought to be the entity that created the wealth and the property that has been abandoned, and if you cannot return it to the true... to the State of the true owner which has the asset, if you will, then instead of it being in limbo or going to the United States of America, it ought to go back to the State where the activities took place that created the wealth which is now lost."
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2684.298,2685.951,Do we always look to the true owner?
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2699.009,2699.84,That is correct.
1992.111_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2716.71,2718.012,"You mean... well, okay."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2744.349,2746.62,No.
1992.111_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2757.175,2769.254,"So that the rules we lay down in these cases, and I do mean lay down, since they seem to be made up, are... just bind litigants State against State, so to speak."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2769.254,2781.402,"That is correct, but New York statute would not be constitutional if it would then seek to take property from its citizens inconsistent with the rules of this Court, because--"
1992.111_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2781.402,2790.658,"Well, then you're saying that our decisions do bind not just States versus States but a New York private litigant against the State of New York."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2790.658,2798.963,"--It does, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to whether New York has the power to take from that citizen."
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.417,2902.672,"But of course, the same thing would happen if we were not talking about an intangible here but we were talking about personal property that was owed from one person to another and it was handed over, transferred from one State to another physically, whatever State it happened to be in when the music ended would be the State that would have authority to escheat, wouldn't it, and you'd say, gee, that's purely arbitrary."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2902.672,2908.796,Physical property has always been escheated where found.
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2908.796,2909.918,Exactly.
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2926.136,2932.201,State power over physical property depends upon the location of the physical property.
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.464,2955.195,"Could it be any number, literally?"
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2962.06,2965.253,"--No, but many States touch upon the intangible property."
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.555,2984.745,--It sounds--
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,2984.745,2999.163,"--But many States have citizens who touch the intangible property before the transaction is completed, and each would have the power to escheat, and the question before the Court is, which State should have the equitable superiority."
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2999.163,3011.993,"--That sounds very much like the contacts theory that was explicitly rejected in Texas v. New Jersey, the kind of theory that is used in conflict of laws, and we explicitly said that's a bad rule."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3011.993,3014.454,I respectfully disagree.
1992.111_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3042.623,3046.254,"Well, it did also reject the contacts rule, because there'd be several States with contacts."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3049.486,3051.399,"That is correct, Justice Stevens."
1992.111_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3106.164,3110.148,"Mr. Nash, can I ask you a question that's probably in the papers, it just slips my mind."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3113.01,3114.819,They do not.
1992.111_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.014,3121.805,Thank you.
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3121.805,3149.714,"The Master's recommendation that the locational test be changed to State of principal executive office does depart from precedent, unlike his first recommendation that precedent controls, and that the State of the issuer rather than the State of the intermediary has escheat priority."
1992.111_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3149.714,3151.794,"None of the parties urged that, did they?"
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3151.794,3153.214,They did not.
1992.111_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.214,3163.322,But 44 States now agree that he resolved that issue satisfactorily.
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3163.322,3171.487,"That is correct, and four additional States have not filed exceptions to that aspect of the recommendation."
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3323.326,3324.967,Why principal executive office?
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3345.17,3347.483,"You are correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3421.02,3425.212,"Some of those filings, as I understand from the briefs, change every year."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3439.862,3447.948,--The statements made in the briefs are gross exaggerations.
1992.111_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3476.966,3485.262,Isn't there just a particular date of a particular year that property becomes escheatable?
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3485.262,3504.743,"That is correct, and the Master's proposed decree states that the principal executive office shall be deemed that set forth on the SEC filing within the 12 months preceding the escheat period, so you have to look merely to one principal executive office per year."
1992.111_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3617.938,3622.213,Does the record show how much total money is at issue--
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3622.213,3625.104,--The record--
1992.111_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3625.104,3628.597,--If New York has to disgorge?
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3635.13,3636.301,"--Yes, Justice White."
1992.111_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3676.136,3681.04,So its roughly... it's been at least $100 million a year.
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3681.04,3685.362,Since 1985 that is the average.
1992.111_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3709.327,3711.299,How much money was involved in that case?
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3711.299,3714.781,"I do not recall the number, but far less--"
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3714.781,3715.822,"Something like $26,000, wasn't it?"
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3715.822,3717.064,--Far less sums.
1992.111_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3717.064,3718.925,Not quite as powerful a case for--
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3718.925,3722.818,"But it is a rule of law at the moment, at least."
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3722.818,3725.888,"--We weren't really changing the prior decision in that case, either."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3743.182,3775.062,"The Court may take judicial notice of the fact, again, by running through the same data bases that our firm ran through, that approximately 21 percent of the dividends paid by New York Stock Exchange companies... I think it was in 1990 or 1989, I forget, were paid to New York companies that have principal executive offices therein and under a State of incorporation rule I believe there were approximately 10 percent would--"
1992.111_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3775.062,3784.018,"So they probably do... they'd probably have to turn over less, or disgorge less under the rule that you propose as opposed to the State of incorporation."
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3784.018,3799.288,"--That is correct, and there is also a practical limitation, as the Master found, and that is the records really do not exist once you get much... sometime in the mid-1970's to--"
1992.111_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3799.288,3808.602,"How about Delaware, comparing the two tests?"
1992.111_orig,2,17915,bernard_nash,,3808.602,3825.556,"--Comparing the two tests, Delaware has... would receive somewhat less than 1 percent of the money under a State of principal executive office rule and somewhere between 40 and 50 percent of the money under a State of incorporation rule."
1992.111_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3835.379,3837.172,"Thank you, Mr. Nash."
1992.111_orig,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3839.703,3840.805,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.111_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3991.042,4005.182,"Mr. Lyons, why would stare decisis here apply less to statutory interpretation rather than the more relaxed form that applies to constitutional interpretation and to common law?"
1992.111_orig,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4005.182,4011.747,"--Well, because this... in most constitutional interpretation the Congress can't change the rules."
