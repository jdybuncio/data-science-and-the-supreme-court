2018.18-15,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.72,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-15, Kisor versus Wilkie, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Mr. Hughes."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,7.72,18.96,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government now appears to agree with our principal contention, deference does not apply in this case."
2018.18-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,30.36,36.16,Even if the best reading of the statute is the SG's in this case?
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,36.16,37.28,"Well, Your Honor, we --"
2018.18-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,37.28,43.12,"Making -- making that assumption, why do we need to reach that broader issue?"
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,43.12,45.96,"Well, Your Honor, we think we have the best reading of the regulation."
2018.18-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,46.72,49.0,"I know you think that, but this was a hypothetical."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,49.0,66.48,"Well, Your Honor, the Federal Circuit below rested its decision on complete reliance on Auer deference, so we think that that is the principal question that was presented by the Federal Circuit. So we think the first order of business is to determine whether or not the Federal Circuit was correct in deciding that Auer deference resolved this case."
2018.18-15,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,66.48,87.12,"But the government tells us it's really beside the point because not only -- well, either the regulation is unambiguous or, if there's any ambiguity, the Federal Circuit's reading, the -- the Veterans Administration's reading is by far the better reading."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,87.12,92.72,"Your Honor, the Federal Circuit, though, relied on Auer deference because the government asked the Federal Circuit to do so."
2018.18-15,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,116.84,130.08,So could you turn to the government's argument where they -- they -- they seem to concede that Auer is wrong but want us to retain some -- some reduced or revised version of it? Why shouldn't we do that?
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,130.08,166.52,"So, to begin with, Your Honor, we certainly think the government's argument is better than the status quo, and we understand it to be a version of deference under which deference would not apply in this case, in the vast majority of cases coming from the Veterans Court, so we certainly think it's superior to what currently exists. We don't think, though, it's the -- ultimately the right answer for a few reasons. The first is the most important practical and legal problem with Auer deference is it is a circumvention of the notice-and-comment requirements that Congress has imposed generally in the APA, as well as in particular statutory schemes, including this one. The government's rule still allows agencies to put a thumb on the scale without providing --"
2018.18-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.52,169.52,"I'm sorry, but that -- that's not quite true."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,217.56,247.4,"Well, Your Honor, I agree with all of that, which is to say the agency can do these things, it can be precedential with respect to the agency, it can bind future agency adjudicators. The only question is, for that agency activity to also subsequently have legal binding effect in court, what did Congress intend the procedures for the agency to undertake for the agency's action to have prospective force of law? And, again, I think the agency's, the VA's, own conduct here indicates that when it wishes to have the force of law, it acts through --"
2018.18-15,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.4,248.0,But does it --
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,248.0,249.0,-- notice-and-comment rule-making.
2018.18-15,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,249.0,257.16,-- does it really have the force of law? Because we made it plain that Auer does not call for blind deference.
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,267.32,289.8,"Your Honor, there's certainly limitations on when Auer deference applies, but the maintenance of Auer deference means that there are a range of cases in which the agency's views that did not go through notice and comment, did not provide the public safeguards, still will have binding effect on the courts. And it's that range of cases that this is one of which we think is -- is the ultimate problem with Auer deference and why the Court should depart from that doctrine."
2018.18-15,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,289.8,303.36,"Well, only -- only with some degree, and it's a matter of debate how much of a degree, but only with some degree of sanction by -- by the court, right? At least the court has to determine that the agency's interpretation is a reasonable one."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,303.36,312.8,"That's true, Your Honor, but what happens in cases like this is the regulated public is not able to participate in the underlying law-making process that leads to the ultimate rules."
2018.18-15,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,373.52,374.56,"Of course, they didn't --"
2018.18-15,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,374.56,375.6,If we searched through --
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,375.6,386.04,"But, as a practical matter, you've read the SG's brief, I mean, there are hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of interpretive regulations."
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,407.6,409.16,"Right, exactly."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,445.56,463.32,"Well, a -- a few responses to that, Your Honor. To begin with, we think that Auer deference forces the agency to ask the wrong question because, under Martin and Pauley, what it allows the agency at that interpretive stage to do is to determine what it thinks the best policy is, rather than what the best reading --"
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,463.32,524.28,"You read -- also read, everybody cited them here, all these studies that show what you say is a problem can be sometimes a problem, but rarely, and that the judges have a lot of power to reject unreasonable rules, inappropriately considered rules, they didn't think about it, rules that change position, rules that are not clear, all these interpretations, you don't have to take Auer literally, and later cases have not. And so do you -- what is your real objection to taking those later cases and saying, of course, judges are in control; of course, they reject what is unreasonable; of course, they reject what is inadequately considered; of course, they reject things that are just changed without explanation, but, in general, recognize that the FDA knows more about moieties than you do, Judge, and there are 800 judges, and they all think moiety means something different."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,524.28,533.92,"Your Honor, the critical shortcoming of that is the lack of notice and comment because I am sure the FDA knows quite a bit about active moieties, but the regulated public may have a --"
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,533.92,544.48,"So you want to take seven years on -- or three years or two years on each of the million interpretive rules? By the way, they'll just go to adjudications, where we have even less control."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,544.48,550.08,"Well, Your Honor, I think what the APA reflects is the balance this Court recognized in Perez that agencies have a choice."
2018.18-15,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,560.76,568.2,"Yeah, Mr. Hughes, do you -- do you think the FCC knows a lot more about the meaning of the word ""relevant"" than federal district judges?"
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,568.2,568.8,"No, Your Honor."
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,573.28,583.32,"Do you know why 56d or 554d, which is the separation of functions provision of the APA, it has an exception for rate-making, which is the FDA's job."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,589.4,589.96,Well --
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,589.96,591.08,But there's an exception.
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,608.56,624.68,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the exception for rate-making is precisely our point, which is to say, when Congress has provided agencies authorities to act in a particular manner and has given agencies that delegated authorization, we agree that that's an area in which agencies can exercise their delegated authority if it's been provided by Congress."
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,624.68,642.52,"But the individual rates, I mean, and changes in the rates and changes in the conditions of the railroad cars and -- and acting under -- there are millions. We know there are millions. So how do you propose to deal with those millions? Every one of them goes through notice-and-comment rate-making?"
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,642.52,654.16,"Your Honor, I think -- well, again, in the rate-making context, as Your Honor points out, Congress can establish different specific rules in specific circumstances. What we're discussing are the default rules that generally apply."
2018.18-15,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,669.32,670.2,If it was --
2018.18-15,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,670.2,683.0,"If Auer were overruled, would an agency's interpretation, particularly in areas requiring a great deal of scientific or technical knowledge, be entitled to no deference by a court?"
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,683.0,692.84,"No, Your Honor, I think if Auer were overturned, Skidmore would apply. And Skidmore, as this Court has articulated, has exceptional importance, particularly in areas where an agency --"
2018.18-15,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,692.84,700.64,"Well, Skidmore -- Skidmore deference is -- is really no deference because it -- it applies only when it's persuasive, which is true of any argument."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,700.64,712.56,"Well, in the context of a highly technical or reticulated statutory scheme where it's not the ordinary business of judging like the meaning of relevant, but something like active moiety, and the FDA can explain that it's brought its scientific consensus to bear."
2018.18-15,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,712.56,713.84,"Well, that sounds like State Farm."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,724.64,724.88,"Well, I think --"
2018.18-15,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,724.88,725.16,If anything.
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,725.16,752.0,"-- Your Honor, it's to say in one of those technical contexts, if a court is going to arrive at a different result from the agency, the court needs to have a pretty serious reason as to why it's doing so. It has to articulate real rational reasons on the record as to why it is rejecting the agency's admitted authority over particular scientific and technical areas. So Skidmore does show the respect that's due a coordinate branch of government. We think that's the appropriate alternative solution."
2018.18-15,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,752.0,775.84,"Mister -- Mr. Hughes, may I ask you about stare decisis, because you're asking us to overrule two decisions, Auer and Seminole Rock, and -- and really 10 or 12 more over the past half century where the Court has talked about Auer deference or Seminole Rock deference. And -- and -- and what is the basis for that? Congress could have done this at any time."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,795.68,809.88,"A few answers, Your Honor, but, to begin with, I don't think there's distance with the government on that point because, under the government's test, Auer deference, in the case of Auer, the Court should not have applied deference. Under the government's view, there needs to be a principle of fair notice."
2018.18-15,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,809.88,819.08,"Well, you know, there might be a problem of a lack of adversarialness here, but I'm asking you -- I can also ask the government -- but I'm asking you."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,819.08,835.32,"So setting aside the government's position would require overturning a dozen cases on its own. To -- to -- to move to the point, I think stare decisis has substantially less effect in circumstances where, first, it was an underlying judge-made rule and not something that was a statutory, constitutional interpretation of its origin. And, second --"
2018.18-15,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,835.32,836.4,I -- I don't understand that.
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,857.76,872.92,"Well, Your Honor, I think that was true in -- in -- in both Pearson and Wayfair and other cases the Court's decided where the Court recognized that Congress could step in and change the rule, but the Court has repeatedly said in those cases that when the underlying issue stems from a -- a decision of this Court --"
2018.18-15,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,872.92,874.8,"Well, there aren't very many of those cases."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,883.12,885.08,"So -- so good reason, Your Honor, is two-fold."
2018.18-15,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,893.32,902.44,"Well, reliance is a kind of plus factor, and we can talk about reliance either way, but, I mean, usually we look to something terrible that's happening: This is unworkable."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,918.32,919.0,"I do, Your Honor."
2018.18-15,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,927.32,932.64,It didn't have any underpinning? Its underpinning is obvious. Its underpinning is everything that Justice Breyer talked about.
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,951.04,965.84,"Your Honor, I think it's just impossible to reconcile Auer deference with the judgment that's reflected in the APA, that when an agency is going to put on its policy-making hat, which undoubtedly the agency can do, there's an ability for the public to be able to participate in that process and provide their views."
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,965.84,987.44,"You're right, you're right that it says in the APA, it says, you're absolutely right, that when a judge decides a case, and it has to do with the meaning of the regulation, it says the judge, the reviewing court shall determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action. That's what you're relying on."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1022.8,1029.44,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think that there's any evidence that the APA somehow silently adopted the -- the doctrine of Seminole Rock."
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1031.44,1060.52,"Well, the evidence would be that if the Attorney General's manual that discusses the APA goes through prior cases that they intend to change, I'm not saying perfectly, but to a considerable degree, and, by the way, Seminole Rock is not there. And so we have both the language which doesn't say -- it says shall determine, but it doesn't say how to determine."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1068.44,1079.48,"But, Your Honor, if we look to the Attorney General's manual of 1947, as you allude, that actually, I think, cuts strongly in our favor because that explains that interpretive rules do not have the prospective force of law."
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1081.64,1082.08,"Yeah, that's right."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1082.08,1084.96,"-- of its Chrysler Corp decision, which is carried forward to Perez."
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1084.96,1088.44,"No, I agree with you, you're right about that, but I don't see this being interpreted."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1108.08,1108.4,And --
2018.18-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1108.4,1113.6,"After all, the agency knows about old Lysol, whatever it is, and we don't."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1113.6,1117.72,And I want to be clear. We do not believe that the court needs to ignore what the agency says either.
2018.18-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1127.4,1189.6,"I -- you know, everybody's talking about this being the rule since Seminole Rock and Auer, but I go back to cases in the early 1800s, and -- and one -- I just pick one of 1850, where the Court said the foregoing construction, being the one adopted by the Department of Public Lands soon after the Act of 1832 went into operation, we should feel ourselves restrained, unless the error of construction was plainly manifest, from disturbing the practice prescribed by the Commission of the grand Land Office. And I have a series of other cases throughout the 1800s where the courts were basically talking about you take the interpretation of the agencies unless some manifest error was present. So Sturgeon and Auer are not more recent manifestations."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1278.68,1316.48,"Thank you, Your Honor. I'd like to respond both to the point about the history as well as the stability point. To begin with -- with Your Honor's initial point about the underlying history, I agree if we look prior to the APA, there are cases that suggest in the statutory context that a department or agency's interpretation of the statute deserves binding deference. But, in the APA, Congress decided that there needed to be procedural protections to safeguard the interests of the public through notice-and-comment rule-making to provide the public the ability to participate in that law-making function that happens within the agency. That was one of the critical innovations of the APA that imposed on past practice as a matter of congressional direction, and we think that's what's lacking here."
2018.18-15,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1316.96,1352.52,"Counsel, to get back to the -- a little bit to the stare decisis question, I -- I think the issue depends at least in part about how much of a change you're making. And one of the things I have trouble getting my -- my arms around is, if you start with Auer and recognizing the limitations on Auer that -- you know, that have accumulated over the years and you're changing from that to Skidmore deference, which I find hard to get my hands around too -- I think I know more what a moiety is than I know what Skidmore deference is. (Laughter.)"
2018.18-15,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1352.52,1358.24,And I -- I just wonder exactly how much of a change at the end of the day you're talking about.
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1358.24,1380.96,"Well, once we take into account SmithKline Beecham and Gonzales and the Court's consistent narrowing of Auer, I -- I think Your Honor is right that Auer has been narrowed to the point where it does have substantially less practical effects today than it does previously. But I will say Auer is still used in a way that injects inconsistencies and instability into the legal system that I -- I believe also responds to Justice Sotomayor's --"
2018.18-15,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1380.96,1383.96,"Well, I suppose it depends -- I mean, it depends on the agency."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1426.92,1427.24,"Well, I -- I think --"
2018.18-15,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1427.24,1429.32,"And as I say, maybe that's the problem, but --"
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1429.32,1456.96,"Your Honor, I do think that imprecision is quite the problem, but as long as Auer and Seminole Rock remain, that suggests that there will be a range of rules, I think a narrowed set of rules, but some rules that, if they make it through the gauntlet of Auer and Seminole Rock, do have the prospective force of law without going through the procedures that Congress identified that need -- that the agencies should undertake to have that force and effect of law. And I think this case is an example. I'd point the Court to another case recently that -- that highlights the instability."
2018.18-15,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1495.56,1496.0,And what about --
2018.18-15,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1496.0,1496.52,On the question --
2018.18-15,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1496.52,1505.32,-- what about the lower courts? Let's -- let's say your argument is accepted and Auer is overruled.
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1521.96,1530.8,"So I think from this Court's cases, we still have stare decisis, but to Your Honor's question about the lower courts, I -- I think the courts would have to wrestle to see if -- whether or not Auer was the rule of decision."
2018.18-15,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1540.8,1559.52,"But are you saying that there would be wholesale cases before the lower courts, lower courts that had relied on Auer, and the losing party then says, Court, vacate that decision because you premised it on Auer, and Auer is not good law?"
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1559.52,1569.16,"I think parties could potentially advance arguments along those lines, Your Honor, but I don't think that increases instability any more than exists in the status quo, when those decisions are already subject to revision by the agency."
2018.18-15,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1569.88,1574.48,"Your -- your argument is that notice and comment solves everything, right? I mean --"
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1574.48,1578.84,"Well, I think notice and comment is the scheme that Congress implemented into the APA as the one --"
2018.18-15,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1578.84,1583.04,"In other words, this issue would go away if the agency did notice and comment for the guidance that --"
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1583.04,1594.8,"Well, prospectively, what our argument would -- would lead to is an area where there is far more prospective stability because once the -- a court decides the meaning of a regulation, that has durability, unless the agency changes the reliability --"
2018.18-15,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1594.8,1617.48,"Can I get your reaction to the -- the thought that the lower courts have made notice-and-comment rule-making too difficult through various requirements, requiring detailed explanations, making it hard to change regulations that have gone through notice and comment? Do you have a reaction to that? Because that may be one of the reasons that has pushed them into the more guidance rather than notice and comment in the first place."
2018.18-15,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1617.48,1621.44,"Well, Your Honor, I think notice and comment is what Congress required, and that's what the Court should adopt."
2018.18-15,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1634.6,1638.96,"Thank you, counsel. General Francisco."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1638.96,1659.28,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Seminole Rock deference raises some problems in some applications, but it's been on the books for decades, it has significant practical benefits, its practical problems can be addressed by reinforcing reasonable limitations on the doctrine. I'd therefore like to address two key points."
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1691.28,1704.08,"Mr. Francisco, as I understand it, nobody left before us alive is willing to take Auer literally and it's just a matter of how -- how much revision to it we've already made."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1741.48,1744.92,"No, I absolutely think it is and it's a workable standard, Your Honor."
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1762.28,1765.96,"Well, people fight over whether there's ambiguity and what ambiguity means."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1767.84,1768.12,Right.
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1768.12,1771.68,They fight over how consistent is consistent.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1789.52,1789.92,Well --
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1789.92,1796.44,"-- not -- not -- not an agency. And under the rule you propose, every agency could define relevant evidence differently."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1796.44,1797.24,No.
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1797.24,1809.24,"What is -- what is -- well, if they have enough expertise, we're going to -- we're going to go down that road. And I -- I -- I guess I'm just wondering, at what point does this whole edifice just fall upon itself?"
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1809.24,1809.4,Sure.
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1810.12,1813.8,And lawyers will -- will enrich themselves and do well with this kind of test.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1816.44,1816.76,Sure.
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1862.56,1863.2,"Well, on that --"
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1863.2,1863.76,The government --
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1863.76,1865.36,They can rely on the agency.
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1865.36,1875.36,"-- on that -- on that, and I'm sorry, but, you know, you say -- you keep saying how much of a benefit it is for regulated parties and their reliance interests, private reliance interests."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1930.48,1947.96,"Well, Your Honor, I think that it benefits both those private reliance interests, and there are a lot of private reliance interests that aren't represented here before the Court, as well as interests in stability and political accountability. But, if I could sort of use an example to illustrate the point, suppose you've got a rule that is genuinely ambiguous."
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1984.04,1990.4,"Judges -- judges disagree all the time, though, on the threshold question of whether something's ambiguous to begin with."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2012.16,2013.76,So there are two parts to that question.
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2020.96,2022.92,"It happens all the time, all the time."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2022.92,2026.84,And that's not a problem that Seminole Rock creates or a problem that Seminole Rock can solve.
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2065.52,2074.68,Do you agree from your study of this issue that the impediments to efficient notice-and-comment rule-making have pushed the government into doing more things in this manner?
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2074.68,2078.72,"Your Honor, I'm not prepared to -- to -- to say I agree or disagree with that."
2018.18-15,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2086.16,2091.36,"Do you happen to know what the average notice-and-comment rule-making is, how long it takes?"
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2091.36,2092.92,"Your Honor, I don't know the answer to that question."
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2094.24,2100.16,I haven't seen a large decrease in notice and proposed rules --
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2100.16,2101.44,"No, Your Honor, I haven't."
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2101.44,2102.2,-- in the Federal Register.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2102.2,2104.28,"I -- I haven't. And -- and -- and, again, though, the --"
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2104.28,2114.56,Your -- your -- your opposite -- your colleague on the other side talked about one notice and comment that received 45 changes.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2119.28,2121.32,"Oh, it's definitely still being used, Your Honor."
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2134.32,2136.32,I -- I -- I do think that --
2018.18-15,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2136.32,2149.76,"Counsel, one of -- as a practical matter, one of two things happens: The judge gets deeply into the question before him or her and does the work and comes up with something that looks like the right answer."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2167.08,2171.68,"Your Honor, I think you ought to adopt ours, because we -- (Laughter.)"
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2171.68,2173.6,-- because we actually place an --
2018.18-15,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2173.6,2176.64,"Ours, you mean yours, or Auer the case? (Laughter.)"
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2176.64,2178.96,"The -- the position of the United States, Your Honor."
2018.18-15,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2187.44,2195.8,So you think what the judge ought to do is do all -- extensive amount of work and come up what looks to him or her as the right answer?
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2195.8,2206.2,"I think what the judge needs to do is an extensive amount of work at the front end to determine if there is, in fact, genuine ambiguity within the language of the rule itself, much as like it's required to do under Chevron."
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2207.04,2236.88,"But the problem is -- the problem is that the judge, or judges, could come up with an interpretation that says the agency's interpretation of the regulation is wrong, and this is a really important interpretation, it has real effects on many people, and it's wrong, but, nonetheless, rule for the agency under your theory because -- and under the Chief Justice's question -- because there's some ambiguity in it and, therefore, defer to the agency, even though the judges might unanimously think it's wrong."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2239.4,2244.12,"No, Your Honor, because, again, I don't think that is quite the nature of the inquiry."
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2246.04,2247.88,I think that -- I think that I disagree.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2252.28,2252.92,Okay.
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2254.92,2264.16,"Which is the point I don't think this is the -- I don't think the government's reading is the best reading, but it's sufficiently ambiguous that I'll rule for the government."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2265.08,2265.28,Yeah.
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2266.16,2267.56,-- on big cases.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2267.56,2294.88,"So I guess I have a couple of responses to that. First of all, in our search for what the best reading is, I think that often the agency's interpretation is highly relevant to understanding what the best reading is of a complicated regulatory regime. Secondly, I think it is often the case that there is -- it is not clear what, in fact, the best reading is when you are facing multiple reasonable constructions. And that, again, is the virtue of Seminole Rock."
2018.18-15,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2323.6,2362.88,"Should we be concerned about the effect that either overruling Auer and Seminole Rock or taking your position will have on cases in which courts have interpreted regulations based on those principles and now, whichever course we take, those will be thrown into doubt? And if that's a real concern, is it more of a concern -- is it much less of a concern if we take your proposed route than if we overrule Auer and Seminole Rock completely?"
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2362.88,2381.64,"I think it's far less of a concern under our rule because -- under -- under the United States' rule, because, under my friend on the other side's position, every single regulation that's currently on the books whose interpretation has been established under Seminole Rock now has to be relitigated anew."
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2382.16,2393.0,"Well, I guess I don't -- I don't understand that response, because it seems to me you've made the point that there are going to be a great many regulations where the outcome would be the same with or without Auer."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2395.56,2395.96,Uh-huh.
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2395.96,2398.16,So we'd have to know how many of those there are.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2418.36,2427.04,"Well, I think that one thing that doesn't require speculation is to know that their position would be more disruptive than ours, because theirs would require everything to be revisited."
2018.18-15,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2472.56,2473.36,"Well, when you say --"
2018.18-15,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2473.36,2475.56,"General, a similar --"
2018.18-15,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.56,2479.64,"I mean, ""best"" has come up about 50 times, and I'm a little curious about that."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2531.88,2538.6,"Certainly, I would say yes -- certainly, I would say yes in the context of Seminole Rock itself because that really does underscore our key point."
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2544.04,2544.12,Do you --
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2544.12,2557.32,"-- all of the ordinary -- after applying all of the ordinary tools of construction, it's subject to multiple reasonable readings. And in that context, we do think it promotes democratic accountability by vesting it in a more politically-accountable agency."
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2557.32,2569.92,"That's why I have a problem with Justice Kavanaugh's use of the word ""bad"" interpretation, because bad interpretation sounds to me like an unreasonable interpretation."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2577.24,2579.88,"By the requirement that it be genuinely ambiguous, like --"
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2579.88,2582.4,"A, genuinely ambiguous and, B, reasonable."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2582.4,2583.72,"Reasonableness. Yes, Your Honor."
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2583.72,2604.32,"Reasonableness can't, I don't think, mean a bad interpretation that's not consistent with the statute or -- or not consistent with either the text, the context, et cetera. So, if it's reasonable, then there has to be a basis for the interpretation in the statute."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2604.32,2606.4,"I -- I think I generally agree with that, Your Honor."
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2635.08,2648.48,"You agree -- you agree, I think, with taking Footnote 9 of Chevron, using all the tools of statutory construction, and -- before you conclude that the ambiguity remains in this context? I think you've said that a few times."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2648.48,2652.8,I -- I absolutely think that is part of the -- the genuine -- determining genuine ambiguity.
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2652.8,2660.12,"And when you do that, you usually eliminate or greatly reduce the number of cases where there remains an ambiguity."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2660.76,2689.68,"And not only that, but you also reduce the range of ambiguity, because a reasonable interpretation has to fall within the zone of ambiguity that remains in the rule after you apply those ordinary tools of construction. And so that's why -- and I know my friend on the other side didn't really get into the separation of powers issue, but that's why we don't think that there's any substantial separation of powers question here, because the agencies are, in fact, subject to substantial control by both Congress and by the courts."
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2689.68,2690.36,"Well, that's --"
2018.18-15,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2690.36,2708.36,"General, can I ask about a slightly broader version of Justice Alito's question? He asked about reliance, but thinking about all the stare decisis factors, when I started asking Mr. Hughes about them, he immediately said: Well, the government has just as big a problem on those factors. So does it?"
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2708.36,2788.08,"Absolutely not, Your Honor, because what we're arguing for is that Seminole Rock be retained in its core applications, which, frankly, we think are the areas where it is the -- the most important, both to regulated parties and to agencies. And it is always more faithful to -- to stare decisis principles to retain a doctrine at its core, while perhaps imposing limitations on the edge that simply recognize that, in the course of practical application, practical issues have been identified. And that's why we think that you ought to reinforce the requirement of genuine ambiguity, you ought to reinforce the -- the requirement that you wouldn't apply it to inconsistent interpretations, and we don't think the agency should get Seminole Rock deference for secret, private interpretations. It ought to give public notice of its interpretation, as it did in Seminole Rock itself. But we think that when you have those principal limitations, you've largely addressed the practical problems of Seminole Rock, and what you're left with, in our view, are the practical benefits of Seminole Rock. So even if you think it was wrongly decided as an original matter, it's got significant practical benefits, its practical problems are manageable, it's been on the books for decades, and this is something that Congress could fix if it believed that this Court has misgauged legislative intent in adopting the Seminole Rock doctrine."
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2788.08,2789.44,You -- you said give public notice.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2790.92,2791.96,Yes.
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2791.96,2795.04,"I think the other side would say just add ""and comment."""
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2795.04,2799.16,"Your Honor, and I think that's exactly their position."
2018.18-15,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2801.08,2802.76,And what's -- and what's wrong with that?
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2802.76,2808.84,"The seminal feature of Seminole Rock is, of course, that you don't require notice and comment."
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2830.52,2840.32,"Well, Mr. Francisco, you keep telling us about the benefits of that, but the benefits of notice and comment are, among other things, people will know prospectively what rules govern them --"
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2840.32,2840.84,Yes.

2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2906.52,2909.28,"Well, Your Honor, there's a -- there's a -- there are a few things built into that."
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2923.32,2923.56,So Auer is gone then.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2925.68,2925.88,I --
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2925.88,2926.88,Because that's what happened in Auer.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2926.88,2927.2,No.
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2927.2,2928.24,It was an amicus brief.

2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2935.2,2935.88,That's good enough?
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2935.88,2949.36,"-- satisfies the public notice requirement, because it puts the world on notice that this is, in fact, the agency's position. But, to go to your larger point, I think, as this Court held in the Martin case, Seminole Rock deference reflects a --"
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2949.36,2962.52,"A person who litigates against the government for years, for his disability benefits as a veteran of the United States, is on public notice when the case arrives here and you file an amicus brief?"
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2962.52,3002.32,"Well, Your Honor, we are much less concerned with the outcome of this particular case than we are with preserving Seminole Rock in its core applications. But, to go to this particular case, remember, the VA has a system where the VA itself is charged with assisting veterans through what can sometimes be a complex process. And, here, it was the VA itself that identified the potential reconsideration pathway that would have provided the -- the veteran with the benefit of retroactive benefits and the VA itself that also explained why it didn't apply to the veteran. So I think, in this particular context of this case, this -- this was a very fair process."
2018.18-15,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3013.52,3014.28,If we were --

2018.18-15,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3014.84,3027.92,"-- if we were writing on a clean slate, what would you say is the basis for any version of Auer or Seminole Rock? Is it based on some kind of delegation theory, or what is its -- what is its conceptual basis?"
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3027.92,3060.68,"I think the best conceptual basis is what this Court gave it in the Martin case, and that's where it said that Seminole Rock rests on a presumption of legislative intent, that Congress presumed that courts would defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of its otherwise ambiguous rules as part of its delegated rule-making authority. Now I think that members of this Court may debate whether that was or wasn't an accurate understanding of legislative intent, but this late in the day, I don't think that's any longer the relevant question because it's been on the books for decades."
2018.18-15,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3060.68,3075.64,"And -- and usually those kinds of presumed legislative intent are based on other views, right? They're based on a view -- of course, Congress is presumed to want the agencies to do this because -- fill in the blanks."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3083.08,3084.08,I think that's fair.

2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3160.8,3162.64,"-- a couple of points, Your Honor."
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3172.56,3173.08,By the way --
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3173.08,3174.28,But the -- the graver issue here --
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3174.28,3188.16,-- the biggest argument that your adversary has is that the agency didn't take into account the -- the assumption that interpretations should favor veterans.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3188.16,3188.68,Uh-huh.
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3188.68,3189.8,So deal with all of that.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3189.8,3190.04,Sure.
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3222.56,3225.28,Do you think their reading is unreasonable or not?
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3225.28,3225.36,We do.
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3228.2,3236.44,"Let's say we disagree with you on that because it is the usual interpretation of relevant evidence found in the Federal Rules of Evidence, so it's not crazy."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3236.44,3259.84,"So -- so I'm going to my -- that would -- my second point would be -- help address that. Assuming you've got some ambiguity and it would otherwise trigger Seminole Rock, under Seminole Rock and Chevron, you only defer if the determination reflects the considered judgment of the agency as a whole. And given the way the VA Board is structured, there are something like 98 members of the VA Board."
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3284.24,3284.6,Wow.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3284.6,3284.92,-- as a --
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3284.92,3295.92,So you would have this Court and -- and -- and courts across the country judge agency decisions as to how considered they are?
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3295.92,3297.24,"No, Your Honor. That's simply --"
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3297.24,3302.2,Isn't that a -- isn't that a bit -- asking a -- a bit of inter-branch disrespect?
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3302.2,3303.52,"I don't think so at all, Your Honor."
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3309.4,3310.12,"No, in Mead --"
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3310.12,3310.6,It's actually --
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3310.6,3313.44,"No, in Mead, we said that if -- if Congress didn't delegate it in those cases."
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3318.64,3319.48,But I think both --
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3319.48,3322.12,And -- and -- and a judge has to decide how considered --
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3322.12,3322.48,Yeah.
2018.18-15,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3322.48,3324.0,-- the agency decision is.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3324.0,3324.2,Right.
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3401.84,3420.64,"So, if I'm understanding your views, in answer to Justice Gorsuch, you're basically saying a decision by, let's assume, a BIA court is not enough, unless a BIA what?"
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3420.64,3420.88,"No, not --"
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3420.88,3423.84,Unless the agency heads --
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3423.84,3424.68,"No -- yeah, not -- not at all."
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3424.68,3426.04,Tell me when they count --
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3426.04,3426.12,Sure.
2018.18-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3426.12,3426.68,-- and when they don't.
2018.18-15,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3426.68,3428.48,"Not at all necessarily, Your Honor."
2018.18-15,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3463.0,3467.32,"Thank you, General. Three minutes, Mr. Hughes."
2018.18-15,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3467.32,3477.32,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And I'd like to begin, and we thank the General for the clear recognition here that deference does not apply in this case or other cases like it."
2018.18-15,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3538.84,3545.6,"What do you -- what is your answer to the delay? And -- and what do we do in the interim, one year, two years, three years?"
2018.18-15,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3545.6,3547.12,"Well, a few things about the delay, Your Honor."
2018.18-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3625.28,3640.72,"By the way, your -- the General said, if we adopt your interpretation and rescind Auer deference in total, that every case that relied on Auer deference would be subject to new litigation."
2018.18-15,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3640.72,3645.96,"Well, Your Honor, I think, as I explained with the Marsh example earlier, all of those cases are already fundamentally --"
2018.18-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3645.96,3646.12,No --
2018.18-15,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3646.12,3646.4,-- unstable --
2018.18-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3646.4,3649.92,-- but they're still going to come to court for courts to decide if that's true or not.
2018.18-15,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3664.16,3664.88,"If I may, Your Honor?"
2018.18-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3664.88,3665.28,Yes.
2018.18-15,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3665.28,3687.56,"I don't think that increases any instability in the aggregate because the existing circumstance is completely unstable. However, if prospectively Auer does not apply, that is what ultimately leads to stability, because interpretations of regulations would just be like interpretations of statutes that would have binding effect absent the agency or Congress going through the process that's constitutionally and statutorily prescribed for amending the underlying text."
2018.18-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3687.56,3689.36,"Thank you, counsel, General."
