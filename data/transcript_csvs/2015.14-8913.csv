2015.14-8913,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.44,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-8913, Molina-Martinez v. United States. Mr. Crooks."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,8.44,43.37,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As this Court recognized in Peugh v. United States, the United States Sentencing Guidelines remain uniquely central to Federal sentencing even where the district court ultimately chooses to sentence outside the Guidelines. Because of the strong anchoring effect of the Guidelines, as also recognized in Peugh, the natural effect of an erroneously high Guideline range is to skew a defendant's sentence higher than it would have been under the correct range."
2015.14-8913,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,58.67,100.285,"Mr. Crooks, you didn't cite 18 U.S.C. 3742(f), and I wondered why, because it reads: ""If the court of appeals determines that the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the Sentencing Guidelines, the court shall remand the case for further sentencing proceedings with such instructions as the court considers appropriate."" So this seems to say that, if the incorrect -- there was an incorrect application of the Guidelines, then a remand is mandatory."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,100.285,120.219,"It -- it does appear to say that, Justice Ginsburg; however, I believe in this Court's decision in Williams v. United States, the Court said that Guideline errors are nonetheless subject to the normal doctrines of harmless and plain-error review and not subject to automatic reversal."
2015.14-8913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,120.219,125.09,And -- and so it's not clear that there was a Guidelines violation here.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,136.56,147.7,"There was a misapplication of the Guidelines, but harmless and plain-error doctrines apply to determine the remedy for that violation or misapplication."
2015.14-8913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,147.7,149.01,"Well, there was a miscalculation."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,157.38,158.29,We believe --
2015.14-8913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,158.29,159.595,-- is this quibble wrong?
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,159.595,170.095,We believe that there was a misapplication because the Guidelines were incorrectly calculated with respect to the defendant's criminal history.
2015.14-8913,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,196.07,211.1,"Well, you say that when there is a -- excuse me -- a miscalculation of the Guidelines range, that should give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the miscalculation affected the sentence that the judge imposed."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,211.1,212.25,"That's correct, Justice Alito."
2015.14-8913,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,212.25,219.275,And what does that mean? Does that mean that the -- the burden of persuasion shifts to the prosecution?
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,219.275,237.35,"We believe that the Court's opinion in Olano actually supports a conceptualization that it simply gives the defendant an alternative way to satisfy his burden of persuasion, which is done in a generalized rather than a case-specific way."
2015.14-8913,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,237.35,270.445,"Well, suppose there's no evidence, as -- as will -- may very often be the case. Suppose the judge says -- imposes a sentence within what the judge believes to be the Guideline range but says nothing whatsoever beyond that, and it turns out that that is not the correct Guidelines range, so that there's no evidence one way or the other about what the judge would have done had the judge understood the correct Guidelines range. What outcome in that situation?"
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,270.445,282.08,"In that situation, typically the result would be that the third prong of plain-error review would be satisfied and the defendant would have shown an effect on his substantial right."
2015.14-8913,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,282.08,287.025,So that means that the burden of persuasion in that situation is on the prosecution.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,287.025,302.88,"Again, we may be quibbling about terms, but we believe that the defendant satisfies his burden of persuasion with generalized evidence tending to show the -- that the natural effect of a Guideline error is to affect the sentence."
2015.14-8913,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,302.88,311.88,I -- I don't think I understand the difference between general and specific. Evidence is evidence.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,342.89,344.42,"We would, Your Honor."
2015.14-8913,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,351.72,358.03,So what changed the judge's mind in terms of the facts? He gave you the max when it was 80 to 100.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,362.054,376.51,Because the fact that the Sentencing Commission gave a different range in its expert advice and its expertise is something that this Court has recognized factors heavily into district courts' decisions.
2015.14-8913,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,376.51,388.46,"Let's assume I don't believe there's a presumption, okay? It's very hard for me to understand what difference between 70 and 100 and 80 and 100 could make."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,441.07,459.165,"But on the other hand, Your Honor, in this case, despite Mr. Molina-Martinez's criminal history, the district judge imposed the bottom of what he believed the Guidelines to be, despite the government's request for a sentence at the top end of the Guideline range."
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.62,479.435,"Mr. Crooks, let -- let me ask you this: You fail to object to the erroneous use of the -- of the Guidelines."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,501.35,509.625,I believe under Rule 52(a) there is in effect a presumption of nonharmlessness that the government must rebut.
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.44,520.995,To show that the error was harmless is the same as saying there is a presumption that it wasn't harmless.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,520.995,522.44,I believe --
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.44,523.24,That's -- that's not the --
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,523.24,523.5,-- the facts --
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.5,525.06,-- not the way I normally talk.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,532.105,532.58,But --
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,532.58,533.935,The government is wrong.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,533.935,542.81,"But if the government makes no effort to do anything with respect to harmlessness, then the case will be reversed, or there will be --"
2015.14-8913,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.81,548.245,"The -- the government -- the government says that you are, in effect, making this standard harmless."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,561.085,568.875,"It is, but -- in a way, but only for the limited class of errors that are Guideline range errors."
2015.14-8913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,574.59,596.93,"Under Justice Alito's questioning, he asked if -- isn't it true that you have the burden of persuasion at the outset to show that there was a miscalculation? Once you meet that, his question was does the government then -- I believe his question was -- does the government then have the burden of persuasion to show no error."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,615.93,620.29,"I don't think the word ""presumption"" is absolutely necessary."
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,653.26,672.17,"Where have we done that before? I mean, we had dictum in United States v. Olano, which said that there may be a special category. There may be a special category of forfeited errors that can be corrected, regardless of their effect on the outcome."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,689.99,715.23,"Well, the lower courts -- this Court has not found a presumption since Olano, but the Court did give careful consideration to whether a presumption should apply to the particular type of error at issue in Olano. But more importantly, the lower courts have looked to what this Court said in Olano, and in a tiny handful of -- of errors, they have adopted just such a rebuttal."
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.23,720.765,That's more important? That the lower courts have established the law for us?
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,720.765,721.51,It's not --
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.51,727.885,"It seems to me we establish the law, and we have never found anything to come within that language in Olano."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,730.36,740.52,"We believe that it's not wrong, and that the lower courts' decisions, of course, do not bind the Court, but they are expressive of the experience of the lower courts."
2015.14-8913,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,740.52,744.12,"But, Mr. Crooks, if I could take you back to your answer to Justice Kennedy."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,779.01,800.83,"We agree, Justice Kagan. Unfortunately, the Fifth Circuit did not, so. But we do believe that -- that however you conceptualize it, the draw, the pull of the Guidelines is because of the unique centrality of the Guidelines sufficient to establish the reasonable probability of a different result."
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.83,819.97,"What good does it do to say that the Guidelines are advisory, which is what we have held, if, when you mistake them or when you don't apply them properly, you automatically get a reversal, which is what you're arguing here? Does that sound like an advisory Guideline?"
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,819.97,822.52,"Well, Justice Scalia, we disagree."
2015.14-8913,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,854.035,858.71,How did this -- how did this error come to light? Everybody missed it in the district court.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,866.995,880.275,"Well, actually, it was missed initially, even on appeal, because I wrote an Anders brief, and the defendant wrote a response and pointed out that one of my factual premises was incorrect."
2015.14-8913,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,880.275,885.345,So the defendant -- the defendant brought -- detected the error.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,885.345,886.07,Correct.
2015.14-8913,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,906.9,941.12,"Your argument has some appeal on the facts of this case because the judge sentenced the defendant to a sentence at the bottom of what the judge understood to be the Guideline range. But would your argument apply to any sentence that was within both the original and the correct Guideline range? Suppose the judge here had sentenced your client to 87 months, which I -- I think is the top of the correct Guideline range."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,963.6,988.25,"Our answer is that whenever the range changes in the absence of any other indication, you should infer that the sentence -- there was at least a reasonable probability that the sentence would change. There may be other contextual factors besides the high end of the Guidelines that would allow the government to show that in fact it wouldn't have made a difference."
2015.14-8913,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,999.56,1000.005,Why would you --
2015.14-8913,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1000.005,1016.365,"I was -- I was just going to say under that -- I suppose the defendant really wouldn't insist on a resentencing if that were the -- those were the facts, would he? In other words, it was incorrectly a maximum of 87 and he got the maximum, you say, oh, well the correct one could give you up to 96."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1020.595,1029.775,"If he believes that he could get more -- but if -- for example, in this case the incorrect range was 77 to 96."
2015.14-8913,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1038.055,1075.595,"How about -- I mean, the question is, if the judge -- the judge thinks it's 77 to 96 and chooses 87, which is within that range, and it turns out the correct range is 70 to 87, so the 87 is within the correct range as well -- it's the top of the correct range -- what -- what reason would there be to infer -- why would there be a natural probability that the judge would have given a lesser sentence if the judge thought that the top was 87 as opposed to 96? The judge obviously thought in that situation the correct sentence is -- is 87."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1075.595,1084.06,"With respect, I have to disagree with your premise because I don't believe judges just pick numbers."
2015.14-8913,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1095.84,1106.105,"Here's an example: Suppose a person -- everybody -- presentence report, government, defense lawyer, prosecutor, everybody -- thought he's in column 2."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1158.955,1161.345,That -- that is the issue.
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.74,1166.37,Let's factor in the fact that you did not object.
2015.14-8913,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1184.02,1184.395,Yes.
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.395,1193.13,"But -- but where you or defense counsel has, in effect, assisted the Court's error, it seems to me we demand more."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1193.13,1201.55,And the Court does demand more. It is much more difficult to secure relief on plain-error review because of the other prongs of the rule.
2015.14-8913,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.55,1205.205,"But anyway, we've got progress, because it does make sense."
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.78,1224.445,"It's not a matter of punishing the lawyer, is it? It's a matter of establishing a system --"
2015.14-8913,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1224.445,1225.13,"Yes, that's right."
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.13,1237.135,-- that induces lawyers to make objections when objections are proper and -- and not to mousetrap the -- the Court into -- into error by -- by not -- by not objecting.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1237.135,1238.88,But we have --
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1238.88,1243.945,What are the other two elements that you think serve that purpose?
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1243.945,1248.71,"Well, first, the second and the fourth prong is the answer to your question."
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.19,1251.97,But what are the second and fourth prongs?
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1251.97,1257.95,"The second prong is that the error must be plain, which means it's not subject to reasonable dispute."
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.95,1261.635,"Well, that's no big deal. It -- that doesn't satisfy my problem."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1261.635,1264.2,"Well, many Guideline errors are not."
2015.14-8913,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1298.905,1301.49,It's not disputed here. Everybody missed it.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1309.82,1310.91,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-8913,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.91,1317.45,It's -- it's not enough that the lawyer did not intentionally do it.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1328.93,1344.65,"But I would suggest, Justice Scalia, that it is still far more difficult to secure relief on plain-error review, even with the tweak to the third prong that we're suggesting, than it is to just make the objection in the first place."
2015.14-8913,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1344.65,1357.47,"Well, can you give us an example of a Guidelines error that would qualify for -- qualify as a plain-error except for its failure to satisfy the fourth prong of Olano?"
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1357.47,1358.27,Yes.
2015.14-8913,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1421.43,1422.58,Who would apply --
2015.14-8913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1422.58,1429.855,"Well, in that case would you still send it back to the district judge to ask him in the case you just put?"
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1429.855,1431.28,The --
2015.14-8913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1431.28,1437.89,"We're trying to -- let's assume that we're going to give you some relief -- that was far from clear, but let's assume that."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1446.885,1449.13,The case that I just described?
2015.14-8913,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1449.13,1450.3,Yes.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1450.3,1459.53,I -- I don't know whether I necessarily agree with that application of the fourth prong of plain-error --
2015.14-8913,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1459.53,1462.73,Who applies the first prong in the first instance? Is it --
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1462.73,1463.955,The court of appeals.
2015.14-8913,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1463.955,1474.08,"So you're saying that even if the court of appeals gets through the first three, it doesn't remand for the district court to -- to apply the fourth test."
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1476.755,1477.67,Correct.
2015.14-8913,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1484.2,1495.55,"So I would think that the answer to Justice Kennedy's question is if the court of appeals really thinks it's not going to give relief because of the fourth prong, why would you bother remanding it?"
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1495.55,1496.45,Why -- why would the court --
2015.14-8913,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1496.45,1501.235,Why would -- why would the court of appeals bother remanding it? They could legitimately say it doesn't matter.
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1511.48,1527.385,"The court of -- if the defendant does not -- if the court of appeals is not satisfied that the defendant has met his burden on the fourth prong, it will not be remanded; the judgment will be affirmed. And I would like to save the remainder of my time for rebuttal."
2015.14-8913,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1527.385,1543.83,"And may I just ask you to answer the government's position that if there's no presumption, it's not in your question presented so -- so that you will lock into the way you phrased the -- the question, that ""should an appellate court presume""?"
2015.14-8913,0,42514,timothy_crooks,,1543.83,1585.515,"Just very briefly, our answer is that the Court in the cases we cited in the reply brief has gone on to consider the merits of a case after deciding a legal question presented by the Petitioner. And certainly, the Court always has the power and the discretion to address a question, even that was not in the question presented or addressed in the court below. And here, the court below undisputably addressed it, and even if the Court does not endorse the presumption we ask for, it would be useful guidance to the lower courts on the application of the third prong."
2015.14-8913,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1585.515,1592.89,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Meisler."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,1592.89,1624.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should not adopt the presumption that all misapplications of the Sentencing Guidelines are presumptively prejudicial, for three main reasons: First, a presumption is not supported by this Court's plain-error precedence or general principles of appellate review for harmlessness. Second, presumption is unnecessary, because courts of appeal are capable of discerning prejudice on a case-specific basis. And third, a presumption ill-serves the policies -- policies that underlie Rule 52(b); in particular, they need to induce timely objections in the district court."
2015.14-8913,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1624.06,1628.25,I -- I am concerned about getting hung up on the labels.
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,1650.59,1658.54,"I think, Your Honor, this Court's decisions in Olano and United States v. Vaughn resolve that question, and makes it clear the burden is on the defendant under plain-error review."
2015.14-8913,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1666.05,1669.235,"But let's say that's right: Yes, the burden is on the defendant."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,1684.97,1694.01,"And so our -- our answer, Your Honor, is that the -- there's no -- I guess what Mr. Crooks calls a ""generalized showing."" I think it has to be done on a fact-specific basis."
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1694.01,1695.2,That is fact-specific.
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,1810.035,1819.19,"Well, I think -- I think, Your Honor, there's a -- there's a number of points in there, and to my mind that's a question of how much weight to give the bare facts of the error. Of course the error in this case is you used the wrong range."
2015.14-8913,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1832.98,1858.735,"Can you -- can you give a concrete example of what you mean? I mean, in my -- my intuition is the same as Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan, that if you -- if you apply the wrong Guidelines, then there's a reasonable probability that he would have received a lower sentence. But you say he has to show -- what would he have to show, concretely? Give me an example of what is a reasonable probability that he would have received a lower sentence."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,1858.735,1859.02,Right.
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.88,1894.63,There will be many.
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,1929.34,1929.88,Well --
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1929.88,1932.125,"Say -- I mean, it's -- I -- I don't see this as special."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,1932.125,1938.445,"Well -- well, I think it is -- it was -- it is special, because, of course, it would be the first-ever presumption of prejudice that this Court recognizes in --"
2015.14-8913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1938.445,1939.71,"Well, that's because you're using --"
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.71,1940.14,The range --
2015.14-8913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1940.14,1960.325,"-- that's because you're using the term ""presumption."" You don't have to use the term ""presumption."" You can say that this defendant has met his burden of persuasion. We make the assumption here, we -- a few of us have practiced under the Guidelines -- maybe none of us -- that the Guidelines are the beginning point in almost every sentence."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,1986.74,1990.8,"I'm not sure that's how plain-error review has ever been conceived of, Justice Kennedy."
2015.14-8913,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2015.05,2023.875,"Well, haven't we already answered that question in Peugh? In Peugh, the question was whether the likelihood was going to rise to the level of a significant risk."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2064.44,2093.065,"I -- this -- I think there's two points on Peugh, Your Honor. The first one is that Peugh itself, in footnote 8, says that this is a -- this is an ex post facto error that implicates constitutional concerns. And the Court said, in their regular Chapman v. California harmless-error analysis, Petitioner concedes that when it's a nonconstitutional Guidelines error, under Williams v. The United States in Rule 52(a), you do the regular harmless-error standard. We think it follows from that, that when the error has been forfeited, not preserved, and there's no constitutional concerns, do the regular plain-error analysis. And I think it --"
2015.14-8913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2093.065,2101.235,"In regard to -- are you telling us that even if there's a significant risk that this sentence was too high, in this case there can be no relief?"
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2101.235,2102.16,"Not at all, Your Honor."
2015.14-8913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2102.16,2103.37,Is that the government's position?
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2103.37,2110.95,"Not at all, Your Honor. If -- if the defendant makes a case-specific showing of a significant risk or a reasonable probability, then the defendant would clear prong three of the --"
2015.14-8913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2110.95,2125.71,"What the -- you think the two are equivalent? A risk and a probability are -- are interchangeable? We're -- we're -- we're going to change our -- our law now, so that plain error is overcome by just a significant risk?"
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2125.71,2127.72,"I -- I don't -- I don't think so, Your Honor. And if I could just --"
2015.14-8913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.72,2129.11,"No, but -- but -- but you've accepted it."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2129.11,2129.22,Well --
2015.14-8913,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.22,2134.09,You seem to say that significant risk and reasonable probability are one and the same.
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2135.775,2149.01,"This was going to be the second part of my answer to Justice Kagan, which I actually think that the -- framing it in terms of risk, looking at how Peugh analyzed the issue actually lines up almost exactly with how this Court handled the error at issue in Marcus, Marcus from 2010."
2015.14-8913,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.26,2195.95,"Now, does that individual showing, can it be made on the basis purely of the mistake in the Guidelines, there is no extraneous evidence? If you have a case where the erroneous range is 20 to 40 and the judge gives 20, and the correct range is zero to 20, is that a case in which the defendant has established plain error?"
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2195.95,2199.15,With the caveat that we'd want to know a little bit more about the -- the facts and circumstances.
2015.14-8913,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2199.15,2204.635,"I don't want to know anything more about it because if the judge is within the Guidelines, he doesn't have to say anything more about it."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2204.635,2210.97,"I think, Your Honor, if that's all you knew, if it was truly -- it's all you knew, I would say that the defendant probably has -- has met his burden in that case."
2015.14-8913,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2210.97,2211.23,Okay.
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2233.855,2237.27,I think I can give you a concrete answer without knowing more about the facts and circumstances.
2015.14-8913,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2238.11,2249.51,"That's -- that's why I don't understand why it's one answer, zero to 20 and 20 to 40, and another answer when it's zero to 30 and 20 to -- when it's halfway as opposed to just at the bottom."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2249.51,2249.77,Right.
2015.14-8913,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2279.42,2285.115,"But in -- in most Sentencing Guidelines cases, certainly in this case, the judge says nothing."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2316.9,2318.985,"Well, I'm not sure, Your Honor, that's the bulk of the cases."
2015.14-8913,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2319.56,2324.81,But you would agree that at least there are many cases where the judge just sentences within the Guidelines.
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2324.81,2327.24,"There are many cases, but I think you run into the same problem as in Davila."
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2333.89,2335.99,"We're not changing -- well, you've heard the argument."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2386.235,2386.85,But --
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2386.85,2389.385,So why is this so difficult?
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2389.385,2397.41,"It's important, Justice Breyer, to recognize -- as I understand your -- your -- what you've posited, that is a shift in the risk, whether you call it the risk of nonpersuasion."
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.41,2398.45,"Well, you know, you --"
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2398.45,2401.42,"Absent the government coming forward with something else, the defendant wins."
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.76,2406.925,"Well, you're saying it's a shift in the risk."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2469.59,2471.19,"I think it does matter what it is, Justice Breyer."
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2471.19,2472.25,Of course it matters what it is.
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2472.25,2472.77,It matters what it is.
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.945,2478.155,"Well, it doesn't say that in Olano."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2480.805,2481.505,But --
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.505,2483.33,-- in Rule 52(b) --
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2483.33,2485.14,"Yeah, substantial -- that the substantial --"
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2485.14,2506.93,"It says ""a plain error that affects substantial rights."" And if it is the case, factually, as this Court has said it is, that applying the Guideline that you apply makes a difference to the sentence, that does affect substantial rights."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2514.735,2516.39,"I think it's quite different, Your Honor."
2015.14-8913,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2547.03,2552.1,Don't you usually -- don't you usually have a plea colloquy or something in the record in those types of cases?
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2552.1,2552.47,You do.
2015.14-8913,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2554.075,2554.85,"Well, no."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2570.41,2572.86,I do want to dispute one other -- I think the key factual premise there.
2015.14-8913,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2589.82,2621.595,"If we -- if we accept the -- the proposition that in every case in which there is an incorrect identification of the Guidelines at the time of sentencing there has to be a remand, unless the government can prove with some sort of evidence that it was harmless, would there be any difference between the standard in a case where there was an objection and a case where there was no objection?"
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2621.595,2624.485,"Not on prong three, Your Honor, as far as I can tell."
2015.14-8913,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2643.75,2643.98,But these --
2015.14-8913,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2643.98,2647.195,"Well, but there are the other factors under the Olano test."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2647.195,2647.95,"There are, Your Honor."
2015.14-8913,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2682.73,2713.605,"To the extent that our decision is influenced by our considerations of what kind of a burden, say the Petitioner's proposed rule would put on the resources of the Court, is there anything we can look to or can you or your co-counsel or your colleague for the Petitioner tell us how often Sentencing Guidelines occur in 20 percent of the cases, 5 percent of the cases? And when they do, is it that disruptive to ask the district court, what would you do? Remand."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2713.605,2714.74,A couple points.
2015.14-8913,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2766.47,2780.135,"What you have not put in your brief, I don't think, is that they have, in several circuits, created a system where there is a limited remand for purposes of finding out just what the judge thought about it."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2855.17,2855.87,"I -- I do, Your Honor."
2015.14-8913,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2897.49,2898.04,I see -- I see --
2015.14-8913,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2898.04,2908.53,Does it matter -- does it matter that this kind of error is never strategic? This is not an objection that a lawyer would deliberately hold back.
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2924.545,2931.91,"I think the issue, Justice Ginsburg, is really incentives at the margins, right, that in these kind of cases it's one -- and that's what both Dominguez Benitez and Puckett say."
2015.14-8913,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2945.25,2952.075,"You know, so much of this is the use of that word ""assumptions,"" ""presumptions""; but both sides are doing it."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,2987.635,3002.63,"If that's what the Fifth Circuit were doing, I -- I would agree with Your Honor. We don't think there should be a presumption either way. I think the Fifth Circuit has -- as other have -- circuits have -- have treated overlapping-range cases a bit differently and have suggested that in those cases, because the judge's sentence still aligns with the Commission's recommendation, we're just going to require a bit more."
2015.14-8913,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3006.44,3008.555,So let's go to Justice Alito's point.
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,3036.845,3038.02,We don't think so in this case.
2015.14-8913,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3083.27,3084.06,Except the judge --
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,3084.06,3084.55,-- happens.
2015.14-8913,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3084.55,3091.385,"-- knew that he could have departed upwards under the old Guideline, because this criminal history was pretty serious."
2015.14-8913,1,62642,scott_a_c_meisler,,3105.465,3105.79,Right.
2015.14-8913,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3186.57,3191.475,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Crooks, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.14-8913,2,42514,timothy_crooks,,3191.475,3237.64,"With respect to Justice Kennedy's question about the burden on the district courts of resentencings, we would point out that several lower courts in opinions we cited in the brief have pointed out that a resentencing is not all that burdensome, especially in light of the benefits of assuring that defendants are not serving more prison time than the district court wanted them to do. I did also want to address the government's point about -- the government touched on the issue of overlapping ranges versus ranges that don't overlap. And we just wanted to point out that the effect of the Guidelines is the same, regardless of whether the correct and incorrect ranges overlap or not."
2015.14-8913,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3327.775,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
