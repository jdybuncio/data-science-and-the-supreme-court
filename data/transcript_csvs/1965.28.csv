1965.28,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,22.064,"Number, 28 Louis Katchen versus Hyman D. Landy, Trustee in bankruptcy."
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,22.064,22.785,Mr. Chief Justice --
1965.28,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,22.785,23.675,Mr. Winner?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,23.675,27.823,– and may it please the Court.
1965.28,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,177.772,182.596,Mr. Winner that what you just said is what you draw from most recent decision of the Tenth Circuit?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,182.596,182.969,Yes sir.
1965.28,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,182.969,184.762,And you're referring to a decision in this very case --
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,184.762,187.41,"Yes sir in the Katchen case, yes sir."
1965.28,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,449.496,454.192,Do the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applied in the proceedings before referee in bankruptcy?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,454.192,456.721,I think not sir.
1965.28,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,459.835,461.848,"Yes, that's what I meant to my question --"
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,461.848,464.268,In their full scope I think not.
1965.28,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,464.268,473.751,So then when we talk about permissive and compulsory counterclaims you mean claims which would be if this were an ordinary civil action in the District Court?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,473.751,475.341,Yes sir.
1965.28,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,496.309,497.548,It did apply that test?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,497.548,498.711,"Yes sir, they applied that test."
1965.28,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,498.711,511.621,Which maybe perfectly proper not by analogy but by definition the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not in full force and in -- apply the action before the referee in bankruptcy?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,511.621,515.777,"I believe that is correct, Your Honor, I think clearly it is."
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,956.03,960.838,"Well Mr. Winner, this is not a strange in the bankruptcy act, how about a set-off?"
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,960.838,963.422,"Set-off is specifically covered I think, Your Honor."
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.422,966.223,Well I grant you it is specifically covered --
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,966.223,969.013,Preferences as in the same claim--
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,969.013,979.051,I know I'm just saying the Bankruptcy Act does [Inaudible] subject creditor who risk with the set-off without any kind of a trial you're talking about?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,979.051,984.685,That I cannot question but the Bankruptcy Act does not do that--
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.685,994.398,Under the extent -- under the extent that a set-off would be involved here -- into that order.
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,994.398,998.666,"If it had been a set-off, yes, but that isn't the contention here."
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.666,1005.022,Well I know because the amount claimed by the creditor is larger than his claim as applied?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1005.022,1007.631,"Yes, but here is something that think Your Honor --"
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.631,1010.384,Was that set-off in the rise for preference?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1010.384,1011.431,Sir?
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.14,1018.94,Do you think the trustee could make the claim with a set-off and a preference?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1018.94,1020.87,I doubt it.
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.87,1023.34,Because that preference has to be determined first?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1023.34,1024.217,Yes sir.
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.335,1028.846,Can he base it on a debt owed by the creditor of the bank?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1028.846,1029.368,Yes.
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.368,1029.702,Certainly he can.
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1029.702,1030.904,Certainly he can.
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.904,1038.307,And before that you have to find -- you have to adjudicate the debt [Inaudible] in a summary proceeding?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1038.307,1040.058,"Let me point out, Your Honor --"
1965.28,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1040.058,1042.205,Normally a jury trial would be --
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1042.205,1047.364,"More important, Your Honor -- there's something I think Your Honor is overlooking."
1965.28,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1136.675,1143.781,"Mr. Winner, the trustee or suitor could recover the preference in the state court?"
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1143.781,1145.835,Under the present statute yes sir.
1965.28,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1145.835,1151.883,Would they have a constitutional right to a jury trial in the state court?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1151.883,1178.16,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I have been dreading that question like the question [Inaudible] [Attempt to Laughter] Under Parker against Clinton which was decided by the Supreme Court of Colorado, the Supreme Court of Colorado held many years ago that there is no constitutional right to a jury trial in Colorado."
1965.28,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1219.726,1223.483,Has there ever been any suggestions yet in the Seventh Amendment?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1223.483,1224.391,"No sir, I've been saving –"
1965.28,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1224.391,1224.984,-- of the defendant –
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1224.984,1232.128,I've been saving that one and nobody has suggested that yet but I think that is probably the logical conclusion which must follow --
1965.28,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1232.128,1235.044,Do we have to decide that in this case?
1965.28,0,24741,fred_m_winner,,1235.044,1236.768,"No sir, I couldn't get that into this case."
1965.28,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1319.196,1321.086,Mr. Creamer.
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,1321.086,1326.005,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.908,1843.268,"Mr. Creamer, you have gone much farther than the Court of Appeals I take it that the bankruptcy of the Court jurisdiction over any kind of the claim whatsoever --"
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,1843.268,1844.242,No.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.242,1844.559,Well against the creditor who files a claim?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,1844.559,1846.357,Not any kind of whatsoever.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1884.548,1888.461,Although your argument was under jurisdiction --
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,1888.461,1893.748,"I would tend to think logically, it might tend to do so."
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.327,1949.82,"Mr. Creamer, I – I – doesn't the Bankruptcy Act provide that a claim may not be allowed if a creditor has received the preference?"
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,1949.82,1951.876,Yes.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1951.876,1960.154,Is – is one of the obligations of the Court or the referee and the Trustee to determine whether this received the preference before the claims about?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,1960.154,1961.842,He must do so.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.399,1981.065,"Is it the – was – was the dissent below suggesting that in order to disavow a claim based on the receiver of the preference, a trustee must file a plenary suit somewhere to have it determined?"
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,1981.065,1985.811,"Yes, that seems to be implicit in Judge Philips' decision and in fact --"
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.811,1988.47,I was saying – I would think the same would be true of a setoff?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,1988.47,2003.827,I can see no reason why it wouldn't accept that it seems to be conceded every place that it's ever argued but the setoff whatever this maybe as though it were some kind of anything summarily determinable but you don't know what one is.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.781,2319.129,Well then you would – do you or don't you reject the distinction between so-called related and unrelated counterclaims -- that permissive or compulsory counterclaim?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2319.129,2324.569,"Yet on the basis of permissive and compulsory counterclaim, I reject it entirely."
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.569,2325.251,Why?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2325.251,2328.986,Because I don't think it has any particular applicability.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.1,2345.362,Well what's inconsistent between Rule 13 in the bankruptcy rule?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2345.362,2347.084,There isn't anything inconsistent at all.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.084,2347.991,Well why wouldn't – well why wouldn't they apply that?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2347.991,2352.65,Except but I don't think you need to import Rule 13 into the matter.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.976,2356.92,Doesn't the general order 37 say that the rules do apply where--
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2356.92,2361.529,Where they're applicable or where they can logically be made to fit in any of that.
1965.28,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2361.529,2363.539,Nearest maybe something like that.
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2363.539,2364.004,I'm sorry.
1965.28,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2364.004,2364.961,As near as maybe.
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2364.961,2366.972,As near as maybe right.
1965.28,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2649.893,2651.928,May I ask you – may I ask you –
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2651.928,2653.23,"Yes, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1965.28,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2653.23,2668.795,"In terms of Colorado law if the action had been brought not in the Bankruptcy Court, the action on the counterclaim, would the defendant had been entitled to the jury trial?"
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2668.795,2670.956,In a Colorado state court?
1965.28,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2670.956,2671.878,Yes.
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2671.878,2675.256,As a matter of absolute right?
1965.28,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2675.256,2676.604,As a matter of the law?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2676.604,2682.838,"As a matter of procedure it would not be necessarily the case, no."
1965.28,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2694.77,2695.217,And this is a--
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2695.217,2701.247,"But then we thought to be an equitable counterclaim situation or an equitable accounting action, he might very well not --"
1965.28,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2701.247,2715.555,Well let's – let's take this – the trustee brings an action against Mr. Katchen to recover the $5000.00 or whatever it was paid to this bank –
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2715.555,2716.038,He could request –
1965.28,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2716.038,2718.114,Would he – would he been – he could have?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2718.114,2721.963,And he would probably have gotten it if they were no more than that involved.
1965.28,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2721.963,2725.758,"Yes, it seem to me that that was so."
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2746.707,2748.87,"If he had requested one, yes."
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.32,2868.412,Well do you have any case that indicates a set-off maybe predicated on a preference?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2868.412,2872.219,"Yes quite a number of the circuits do, they're all detailed."
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2872.219,2876.967,All of the ones – all of the ones which would allow a preference that--
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2876.967,2877.355,Correct.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.355,2879.439,-- a counterclaim one of the preferences would this set-off--
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2879.439,2892.729,"Would allow to set-off as well in some of those which would not allow some of them specific, as in the Fifth and Seventh said that there maybe a set-off but it's dicta language I think in the Fifth and Seventh."
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.556,2918.642,Well I take it that you would say that forever there's a preference a trustee may assert against the – against the claimant that the summary jurisdiction reaches the determination of that preference when it's asserted by the trustee no matter what the preference relates to.
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2918.642,2920.167,I think that's true.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2927.873,2932.776,If you are right then the permissive compulsory thing just won't work?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2932.776,2936.827,I don't think it's a really logical basis for determining it.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2951.532,2954.151,How about the – how about fraudulent liens and transfer and things like that?
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2954.151,2955.822,Fraudulent liens and transfer --
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2955.822,2959.134,Which in Court of Appeals apparently would also let the assertiveness of the --
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,2959.134,2963.224,It treats them exactly as it treats the preferences.
1965.28,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2993.008,3003.52,"So if a secured creditor asks to file a claim in bankruptcy which he may not do but what if he does and the trustee says, “Look your lien is no good against me."
1965.28,1,25074,george_louis_creamer,,3013.713,3020.448,It might very well follow and would follow from the language of Tenth that that would be adjudicable.
1965.28,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3054.454,3057.98,Mr. Winner.
1965.28,2,24741,fred_m_winner,,3057.98,3075.051,"The Court please, Justice White's last question has been expressly answered by this Court. It was answered in Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller versus Fox."
1965.28,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3075.425,3076.202,Answered in what?
1965.28,2,24741,fred_m_winner,,3076.202,3076.878,Sir?
1965.28,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3076.878,3078.42,Answered in what?
1965.28,2,24741,fred_m_winner,,3078.42,3083.293,Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Company versus Fox.
1965.28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3141.146,3145.161,"Well, we're really talking about the District Judge?"
1965.28,2,24741,fred_m_winner,,3145.161,3146.803,Here or --
1965.28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.803,3152.251,Whatever you're talking about that district judge at summary jurisdiction that's not been created.
1965.28,2,24741,fred_m_winner,,3152.251,3153.656,"Mr. Justice White, I think not."
1965.28,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3165.212,3166.477,He does not get a trial --
1965.28,2,24741,fred_m_winner,,3166.477,3167.324,No sir.
1965.28,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3167.324,3168.955,Very limited reviews.
1965.28,2,24741,fred_m_winner,,3168.955,3180.39,"Yes, sir a very limited review and my experience of trial before referees and bankruptcy and I mean no slurs but my experience is that they differ somewhat --"
1965.28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.39,3181.888,As some of us think –
1965.28,2,24741,fred_m_winner,,3181.888,3182.416,"A big pardon, sir."
1965.28,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.416,3184.011,Their summary out there.
1965.28,2,24741,fred_m_winner,,3184.011,3233.01,"They're -- they're indeed summary and I say in conclusion, I do not think that you can condition -- that you can impose upon a man who sees fit to file a lawful claim in a bankruptcy state the irrevocable and unavoidable penalty that if you filed this claim, by way of a club held over your head, you cannot have a plenary trial as to any claim for preference, which is asserted against you."
1965.28,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3275.559,3282.688,We will adjourn.
