1980.79-1380,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.904,We will hear arguments next in Harris against Wilson.
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,104.054,107.489,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1380,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,240.372,244.353,"In total dollars, how much are we talking about, any idea?"
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,244.353,250.96,"--In terms of the particular benefit at issue here, while we've stated--"
1980.79-1380,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,250.96,254.303,"Overall, overall to the government; how much annually?"
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,254.303,262.565,"--We've stated the figure would be in the vicinity of 30 million dollars, although it's difficult to compute it with--"
1980.79-1380,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,262.565,263.269,Annually.
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,263.269,264.159,--precision.
1980.79-1380,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,264.159,265.97,"Incidentally, Appellee Wilson is no longer in the case, is he?"
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,265.97,266.673,That's correct.
1980.79-1380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,290.523,293.803,"Mr. Schulder, could I just ask one question--"
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,293.803,294.615,Surely.
1980.79-1380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,294.615,308.469,"--following up on what Justice Blackmun said, in computing the 30 million dollars, do you just take the number of persons in mental institutions who, and multiply that by the $25 figure, is that how you do it?"
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,316.216,323.76,"No, that's the only cost that was considered here, but it was done on a, I believe, a nationwide basis."
1980.79-1380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,329.696,334.553,--Can you translate the 30 million to the number of persons?
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,340.362,355.888,"As I was saying, Section 1611(e)(1), the statute at issue here provides for an exclusion from SSI benefits generally, of all persons who are residents in public institutions."
1980.79-1380,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,499.111,505.453,"This Court has never held that mental illness is a suspect classification, has it?"
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,505.453,505.937,That's correct.
1980.79-1380,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,544.828,545.672,"Well that's pretty much the Boren test, I guess, isn't it?"
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,545.672,546.17,That's correct.
1980.79-1380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,679.273,680.195,I have some difficulty following that argument.
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,697.672,700.561,--But that's not the classification at issue here.
1980.79-1380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.561,713.151,"But I'm just, I'm just directing my question at your point that because they get initial eligibility by reason of mental illness, therefore nothing else done by reason of mental illness can be based on mental illness."
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,713.151,731.471,"That may be true, that merely because a class of people are included within the statute initially and then not given equal treatment with other beneficiaries, that would not necessarily mean that the statute did not discriminate against them."
1980.79-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,773.343,778.327,There are a large number of non-mentally ill people who do not.
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,778.327,778.765,That's correct.
1980.79-1380,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,778.765,789.541,"Well, Mr. Schulder, if you admit people to schools you can't discriminate, can you?"
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,801.114,801.786,"Well, we're not--"
1980.79-1380,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,801.786,803.176,Aren't you saying we didn't discriminate as much?
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,803.176,804.784,--No.
1980.79-1380,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,848.955,857.716,I thought you said that the reason that was not discriminatory was because they did recognize them in one instance?
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,857.716,865.385,"Well, but as I explained in answering Mr. Justice Stevens' question, we're not saying that--"
1980.79-1380,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,865.385,867.026,I don't see the difference between that and the school.
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,873.538,877.864,"--Well, what we're saying is, that the District Court's finding--"
1980.79-1380,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,877.864,883.175,"To put it more precisely we'll let you in the school, but you can't get the $25 that everybody else gets."
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,885.095,897.294,"--Well, what we're saying here is that this legislative scheme does not manifest or reflect any kind of antipathetic attitude on the part of Congress toward the mentally ill."
1980.79-1380,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,914.865,916.193,Who are not mentally ill?
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,916.193,917.162,--That's correct.
1980.79-1380,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,925.705,928.954,"Mr. Schulder, let me go at it another committed to public mental hospitals."
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,937.746,939.871,"No, it certainly would not be."
1980.79-1380,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,939.871,943.838,I was wondering whether you're bogging down on the first point.
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,945.213,967.954,"Well, we would argue that if the SSI exclusionary provision is read together with the medicaid eligibility provision that sprecifically applies to the appellees, the only factors that are really at issue here are age and presence in a public mental institution."
1980.79-1380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.96,1166.282,"--Do I correctly understand that if Congress did fund the mental institution program with Medicaid, that the government would concede that they could not constitutionally deny the mental patients the $25?"
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1166.282,1167.922,"Well, under the operation of the statute--"
1980.79-1380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.922,1186.257,"I understand the statute would take care of it, but assume that they have adopted a plan... with an amendment that provided federal funding for mental institutions and for these mental patients, but nevertheless, retained the exclusion of the $25 for these people... as I understand your argument, that would be unconstitutional and irrational."
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1186.257,1190.256,--I believe it probably would be and we would--
1980.79-1380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.256,1190.6,Yes.
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1194.739,1194.941,--That's correct.
1980.79-1380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1194.941,1205.844,"And does that mean that there is a presumption that the state is given the equivalent of $25, or just the mere fact that because it's a different source of funding, we don't care whether they get the $25?"
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1205.844,1218.994,"I think the latter would be the proper consideration, although the amicus brief filed by the States of New York and Pennsylvania point out that... at least, the State of New York does provide this type of benefit out of its own funds."
1980.79-1380,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.568,1229.287,"Well, that's why New York is against you, here."
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1230.255,1230.708,--That's correct.
1980.79-1380,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1297.119,1303.787,"Well if Congress inadvertently enacts a piece of legislation, does that make it unconstitutional?"
1980.79-1380,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1303.787,1306.942,"Not necessarily, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1380,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1328.794,1331.87,"Very well, Mr. Schulder."
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1334.495,1338.665,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1380,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.706,1443.685,"Did I correctly understand Mr. Schulder to tell us that the Court has, through summary affirmance upheld the constitutional validity of the Medicaid?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1443.685,1446.34,"That's correct, in Legion v. Weinberger."
1980.79-1380,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1446.34,1446.761,Okay.
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1446.761,1452.431,And we are not taking issue with Medicaid exclusion.
1980.79-1380,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1465.942,1466.861,Right.
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1471.548,1471.782,That's right.
1980.79-1380,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1611.242,1612.444,What's that got to do with--
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1621.737,1622.565,Yes.
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.374,1642.526,Well what has the... the benefit that goes with the receiving of the $25 a month got to do with the constitutionality of the statute?
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1642.526,1654.693,"It demonstrates that the Appellees needs for the items are identical and Appellees are identically situated vis a vis the purpose of the statute, as the people who are receiving the benefits."
1980.79-1380,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1656.036,1666.282,"So in your view then, the record shows that people in public mental institutions do not receive similar items?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1666.282,1667.656,--That's correct.
1980.79-1380,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1676.215,1685.993,"No, I didn't say the same $25, but I meant similar care provided by the institution."
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1685.993,1690.663,"It was Congress that made the determination that medical institutions, by and large, do not provide these items."
1980.79-1380,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1752.326,1755.84,"Well on that basis, why is New York on your side of the case?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1755.84,1763.306,"--New York is on our side of the case, representing the interests of the residents of its mental hospitals, as is Pennsylvania."
1980.79-1380,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1776.471,1778.815,"Just some good charitable, generous approach?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1778.815,1781.173,Correct.
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.173,1794.887,"But not, you can't rule out the fact that if they got in from the federal government, their own treasuries wouldn't have to bear any of the cognate responsibilities?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1794.887,1800.556,"Well, it's not clear to what extent their own treasuries are bearing any of the responsibility now."
1980.79-1380,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1800.556,1802.212,"But they must be bearing some, are they not?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1802.212,1805.351,"Now, yes, they must be bearing some of it, Your Honor."
1980.79-1380,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1805.351,1808.381,Something more than a token.
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1808.381,1817.861,"Well, it's... it varies from institution to institution."
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1895.706,1909.777,But surely you don't deny that the Congressional statutory scheme as written has the effect that the only way your clients can get the money is to hold it unconstitutional?
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1909.777,1910.918,"No, we don't deny that."
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1916.9,1925.131,"Well, but if you don't have legislative history, you have legislation which prevents it?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1925.131,1926.459,--That's correct.
1980.79-1380,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1968.051,1978.423,"Are you going to mention this new classification that the District judge referred to, the quasi-suspect classification?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,1978.423,1981.578,"Yes, I intend to, Your Honor."
1980.79-1380,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2230.29,2237.395,"Mr. Weill, I am puzzled by the private mental institution."
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2240.971,2248.626,"--The person might have Medicare paying part of the bill, there are some people eligible for Medicare but not social security."
1980.79-1380,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.398,2274.146,I see.
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2277.942,2279.925,There's nothing in the record that says.
1980.79-1380,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2282.955,2284.704,--Necessarily be what?
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2284.704,2285.157,Rare.
1980.79-1380,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2285.157,2285.782,Rare.
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2324.407,2334.543,"Well it's not a situation that normally arises, it would depend on the structure of the federal statute."
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2334.543,2343.806,Supposing they were virtually identical and Congress simply chose to spend its money on the one in Utah rather than the one in Wyoming?
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2343.806,2349.615,In that situation there's no violation of equal protection.
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.615,2350.725,Well why is there in yours?
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2350.725,2375.932,"If there were a statute that said anybody could work on a federal dam except... they had to be employed or be a contractor for a federal dam, except women, or except blacks, or except persons who were in a mental institution within the last ten years; that raises equal protection questions."
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2402.359,2419.306,"What sort of entitlement is it that you say Congress has created here, since, as I understood it, reading the statute as written, your class is clearly excluded?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2419.306,2421.383,That's correct.
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2453.589,2454.182,Well--
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2454.182,2454.823,--that's inconsistent with the program.
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2454.823,2455.213,--they don't want to pay out the money?
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2455.213,2460.337,Well that's never been held by this Court.
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.819,2466.942,Well what about the Dandridge case?
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2466.942,2467.395,--Pardon me.
1980.79-1380,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2523.311,2528.902,"What if it's only 20 million, or 10 million; what's... how... what's that got to do with it?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2528.902,2529.793,Pardon?
1980.79-1380,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2529.793,2533.821,"What if it's only 10 million or 20 million, not 30 million?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2533.821,2546.285,"Well, I was just answering the previous question."
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2574.603,2585.803,"Not a desire to harm, that was a withholding of food stamps, as I recall, from people whom it was felt, Congress felt, shouldn't have food stamps."
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2596.941,2611.187,"--Well, the things like line-drawing as I understand it, are elements that go into why this Court gives some deference to legislative judgments, because the legislature has to draw lines."
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2611.187,2615.419,"Well presumably, we give a great deal of deference."
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2615.419,2615.747,A great deal of deference.
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2648.313,2651.827,"Well, do you--"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2658.012,2661.121,"In this case, yes."
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.121,2661.949,Yes.
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2661.949,2679.081,"The legislative, both the House and the Committee reports are both... provide not only no reason for the exclusion, they provide no basis for suggesting that Congress understood that the exclusion was occurring."
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2679.081,2679.581,That's right.
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2679.581,2699.293,"While the Court, the Court could certainly look beyond what Congress says, in identifying a rational basis for discrimination, if there is one, there are situations where legislative silence or confusion simply reinforced the conclusion that the discrimination is not a product or any rational Congressional scheme."
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2735.061,2754.771,"Well if the government is right about the average stay in a private mental institution being 41 days, one would think that many people who have been in private mental institutions, are capable and eligible to vote if they wish to vote, in most elections."
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2754.771,2766.143,"Well, the median stay is 41 days, but voting disqualifications don't necessarily relate in most states, simply to being in an institution."
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.232,2781.775,Are you suggesting that all of these people who are denied benefits will never again be allowed to vote?
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2781.775,2782.353,"No, I'm not suggesting that."
1980.79-1380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2782.353,2792.616,"Well, and if they were sufficiently offended by the Congressional classification, wouldn't they register their protest in the ballot box?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2792.616,2802.471,"Well, some of them might eventually, although, by that point they have presumably moved on to other interests."
1980.79-1380,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2802.471,2804.393,Do you have any information that any of them are organized?
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2804.393,2805.922,Well--
1980.79-1380,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2805.922,2809.749,Any insane people... do you know of any organizations of insane people?
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2809.749,2814.013,"--None of any significance, that I know of."
1980.79-1380,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2840.112,2846.032,But I understood you are not arguing that heightened scrutiny is required here.
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2846.547,2854.262,"No, we are arguing that the Court can and should first invalidate the statute under the rational basis test."
1980.79-1380,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2875.253,2875.894,Quasi-scrutiny--
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2875.894,2876.363,Well that's--
1980.79-1380,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2876.363,2878.253,--Quasi-heightened scrutiny?
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2878.253,2889.029,"--The District Court used the phrase quasi-heightened scrutiny, in Wengler this Court used the phrase heightened scrutiny, and I'll stick with this Court's phrase of heightened scrutiny."
1980.79-1380,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2933.699,2941.009,"Mr. Weill, do you contend that the number of people in the... affected by the judgment has anything to do with this argument?"
1980.79-1380,1,33678,james_d_weill,,2941.009,2944.694,"No, I don't."
1980.79-1380,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3024.974,3038.781,I would just like to address myself briefly to Mr. Weill's argument that Section 1611(e)(1) is inconsistent with the objectives of the SSI program.
1980.79-1380,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3088.87,3090.808,"Thank you, gentlemen."
