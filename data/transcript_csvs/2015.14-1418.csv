2015.14-1418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.79,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 14-1418, Zubik v."
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,9.46,19.98,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Little Sisters of the Poor and their co-petitioners face a dilemma that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act does not allow."
2015.14-1418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,52.06,73.17,"Could you explain to me the analogy with military objectors during the war? Many of them felt that -- genuine belief; they were pacifists -- that if they registered as pacifists, that that would mean other people would have to serve in their lieu."
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,89.85,92.11,"Oh, I -- I don't think it is, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-1418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,114.74,116.515,Let's stop there.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,116.515,117.08,Okay.
2015.14-1418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,117.08,148.495,"To the extent that a conscientious objector's good faith belief is that, ""If I register, someone will serve in my lieu,"" what burden is it on the government? Meaning, if -- if you're looking at it in terms of strict scrutiny, the government sends out how many notices to people to come and serve? Ten -- you know, 1,000, 1,200."
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,164.25,177.25,"I think it would, because I think it would be very difficult to administer that kind of system if either you couldn't even know about the objection or you couldn't take any steps on the government's part to fill the spot. But I think what's critical --"
2015.14-1418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,177.25,191.025,"Well, then, isn't that the same thing here? If you don't know who can pay, or who -- who's not eligible, or who's eligible to pay, how does this system work?"
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,191.025,207.05,"Well, two things, Your Honor. One, this is perhaps the unique government program where the government can provide an exemption without actually requiring somebody to opt out, because that's exactly what they do for the churches, for the integrated auxiliaries, and the religious orders --"
2015.14-1418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,207.05,212.19,The churches have to tell us that their church plans -- have to tell the government their church plans.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,216.665,216.96,That --
2015.14-1418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,216.96,218.85,How is that different from military service?
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,218.85,229.955,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, that's just not true with respect to the churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and the religious orders that stick to their knitting and only engage in religious activity."
2015.14-1418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,255.12,256.65,"Well, but the client, then --"
2015.14-1418,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,256.65,265.445,"You -- you -- you began, Mr. Clement, by saying that the government mischaracterizes your position, and I was just not quite sure where that argument was taking us."
2015.14-1418,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,271.025,272.8,"-- again, what we are talking about? (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,272.8,279.225,"I would be delighted -- delighted to do that, Justice Kennedy. My point was simply that my clients do not object to objecting."
2015.14-1418,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,312.08,314.545,"Well, Mr. Clement, that might be so."
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,352.275,360.78,"Two things, Justice Kagan. First, it would only qualify as a substantial burden if the objection requirement was enforced with massive penalties."
2015.14-1418,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,363.26,363.43,Yes.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,382.19,391.57,"I understand, Justice Kagan. That brings me to the second part of my answer, which is I think the right way to understand that hypothetical -- and I was explaining to Justice Kennedy, it's just a hypothetical."
2015.14-1418,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,391.57,406.45,"Well, it's a hypothetical that's directly implicated by your very theory of the case, because your theory of the case says that everything depends on a person coming in saying this is against my religion, and that being the end-all and the be-all."
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,406.45,408.36,"Well, I don't think that's our position."
2015.14-1418,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,427.78,429.2,You're just not answering the question.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,429.2,437.75,"Well, I'm trying -- I'm trying to, with all due respect, which is that brings to -- if you have everything else the same, that brings you to the second part of the RFRA analysis."
2015.14-1418,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,465.97,497.64,"So if I understand that answer, it's that if a person had a sincere religious belief that objecting to objecting was a form of complicity, then that would control, and you would have to go to the second part of the analysis, which is to say, is there a compelling interest test? Has the government's response been narrowly tailored? But essentially, the objecting -- the difference between objecting to objecting and your clients' position is not a difference at all with respect to the burden analysis."
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,497.64,504.94,"Well, I do think my clients' objection is distinguishable from the hypothetical, because this is not an objecting to objecting."
2015.14-1418,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,520.82,530.48,"I guess what I'm saying, Mr. Clement, is I understand the factual distinction that you're making, but the factual distinction doesn't matter given your own legal analysis."
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,530.48,556.14,"I don't think it does based on this Court's precedents either, but even if I'm wrong about that, you could certainly write an opinion that says there are three legs to the stool in this case. There is the fact that the government demands more than an objection, the fact that it enforces it with massive penalties, and the reality that if that happens, then they are going to hijack our health plans and provide the coverage against our will."
2015.14-1418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,556.14,581.49,"What I don't understand, Mr. Clement, is when will any government law that someone claims burdens their practice ever be insubstantial? Because every believer that's ever come before us, including the people in the military, are saying that my soul will be damned in some way."
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,604.915,606.045,Two things --
2015.14-1418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,606.045,607.72,-- that won't be a problem?
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,607.72,624.84,"Two things, Justice Sotomayor. The first is that I do think that what you're saying about the government not being able to function under the substantial burden and then the least restrictive alternative analysis, that's exactly what Justice Scalia said for the Court in the Smith decision."
2015.14-1418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,634.56,659.585,"Well, it's the side of the debate that settles, which is if we are not asking you to do anything except identify yourself, and if who is going to do the action is either the government or a third party, that that's the balance that we have struck, that it's not a substantial burden if someone else is going to do the act that you're objecting to."
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,659.585,670.095,"Justice Sotomayor, if the only action involved is a third-party action like in part of the Bowen against Roy case or in the Lyng case, you're right, that's not a substantial burden."
2015.14-1418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,688.31,693.755,But they -- what other than -- who is the TPA? Who is the insurer? That's all.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,693.755,695.08,That's what they say they need.
2015.14-1418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,695.08,698.94,And then they have an independent contract.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,716.065,723.58,"Justice Ginsburg, that's true if and only if we provide the form, because it's not just the information on the form."
2015.14-1418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,730.23,731.64,It's not an authorization.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,746.365,748.69,"It makes all the difference, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.14-1418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,772.44,790.43,Because the government has another interest at stake in -- one thing you said and I want it clear that this is not involved at all. No one doubts for a moment the sincerity of the belief of your client and all the others.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,834.095,841.68,"I agree, Justice Ginsburg, but just because they call it an accomodation doesn't mean it's immune from RFRA analysis."
2015.14-1418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,869.76,870.12,It doesn't --
2015.14-1418,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,870.12,875.88,You started to talk about -- you started to talk about self-insured plans.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,886.9,908.12,"In both cases, Your Honor, it becomes a plan instrument, and I think -- you know, the government thinks that our notification in this case is the functional equivalent of the EBSA 700 Form, and the reason they required a form -- and this shows you it's not really an opt out, because the way the regulations were originally designed, you didn't raise your hand and tell the government, I object."
2015.14-1418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,916.835,918.12,And that's out now.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,918.12,921.61,"Well, no, it's not out. That's actually still one of the ways that you can apply --"
2015.14-1418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,921.61,922.68,"Yes, but you don't have to do that."
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,924.3,933.65,"Well, the alternative, thanks to this Court in its interim relief, is that we now can file an objection that the government treats exactly the same way."
2015.14-1418,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,971.21,986.035,Is the -- is the essence of your argument that -- and your objection is that the contraceptive coverage is -- is being done through the health insurance that you contract with?
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,986.035,989.2,"That's -- I think that's a fair description of it, Justice Kennedy."
2015.14-1418,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1025.44,1043.73,"Do we accept the -- your clients' view on complicity, or do we have a polygraph analysis and see how far the causation go? Do we just accept your view on complicity and then just see whether or not the accomodation is possible on this and that's the least restrictive?"
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1043.73,1053.44,"I think that's the role that your courts have had for the Court, because I think they don't want to get in the role of having the truth detector test, and that -- and that's not just the Hobby Lobby decision."
2015.14-1418,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1101.33,1102.71,Are you finished?
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1102.71,1103.975,"Yeah, I am."
2015.14-1418,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1103.975,1106.87,All right.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1268.47,1279.47,"I'm going to try, Justice Breyer, and then I'm going to try to reserve my time for rebuttal. So what I would say to you is you're exactly right, that Smith was a much more administrable world, but Congress --"
2015.14-1418,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1279.47,1281.18,Then -- then tell me how to work it.
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1281.18,1281.69,Absolutely.
2015.14-1418,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1293.59,1296.72,"No, the Quaker, the Quaker. You think that wasn't a substantial burden?"
2015.14-1418,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1296.72,1297.39,"No, no, no."
2015.14-1418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1346.11,1347.28,"Thank you, counsel. Mr."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1356.25,1368.105,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government here has the same interest that it has with respect to every other employee in this country who doesn't get contraceptive coverage from an employer-based plan."
2015.14-1418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1426.63,1453.49,"Are you suggesting that once you have this category, the church, then any other organization, religiously-oriented organization, has to come within that same category as the church itself? The government can't treat the church as special and give it an exemption that it doesn't give to religious-oriented organizations?"
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1453.49,1456.23,"No, Your Honor, I'm not necessarily suggesting that."
2015.14-1418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1484.44,1499.57,"Yes, the government could do that, but does it have to? That is, can the government say we are going to treat the church itself ultra protected? Religious-oriented organizations are protected, but not at that same level."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1499.57,1502.39,"Your Honor, no, I don't think they can do that in the context of this regime."
2015.14-1418,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1510.6,1512.355,The same with a university?
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1512.355,1513.55,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2015.14-1418,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1513.55,1514.71,The same with a university?
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1514.71,1523.085,"I think with a university, yes, Your Honor, because, again, when you look at how Congress has drawn the lines, universities get the Title VII exemption from -- for religious hiring."
2015.14-1418,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1524.63,1529.945,"Well, but then you're answering really to the affirmative in -- to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1536.805,1538.33,"Not quite, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1558.76,1566.78,"It's going to be very difficult for this Court to write an opinion which says that once you have a church organization, you have to treat a religious university the same."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1568.89,1570.56,"And, Your Honor, we're not suggesting that."
2015.14-1418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1591.73,1638.915,"I thought there was a -- a very strong tradition in this country, which is that when it comes to religious exercises, churches are special, and that -- you know, we have said this most recently in Hosanna-Tabor, but it's a long line of cases which says that there's something very special about churches themselves. And -- and if you're saying that every time Congress gives an exemption to churches and synagogues and mosques, that they have to open that up to all religious people, then the effect of that is that Congress just decides not to give an exemption at all. And that's why there are some people who are extremely strong RFRA supporters who have deserted this cause right here, Professor Laycock among them, because of the mortal danger that it poses to churches."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1638.915,1647.415,"And, Your Honor, just to be clear, I am not suggesting that whenever you give an exemption to churches, that exemption has to apply to all other religious organizations."
2015.14-1418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1677.02,1679.39,But the grandfather is traditional.
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1712.325,1713.43,"Not at all, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1734.18,1769.45,"Couldn't Congress, or perhaps the Executive, survey the employees of churches and of other -- of religious nonprofits and categories of religious nonprofits, the Little Sisters, a big university, and determine the percentage of employees in each of those groups who are members of the religion and draw a distinction among those groups based on -- on that survey? Couldn't Congress do that?"
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1769.45,1772.52,"Justice Alito, they could do that, and they could do many other things, as well."
2015.14-1418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1772.52,1784.015,"Well, we could also just -- why don't we assume that if they are part of the -- if the majority are part of the religion, that they are not going to buy contraceptives? That's their religious tenet."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1787.015,1787.99,"Well, Your Honor, because I think --"
2015.14-1418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1787.99,1802.815,"We are worried because there are some women who don't adhere to that particular religious tenant, and who have -- we perceive the government has determined, have a real need for contraceptives."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1802.815,1809.01,"And, Justice Sotomayor, I think that goes to the larger problem with the government's case here, which is the utter absence of evidence."
2015.14-1418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1810.62,1830.045,"What is the utter absence? there is plenty of evidence that was relied upon to show that when contraceptives are provided to women in a seamless way, that the number of unintended pregnancies dramatically falls, as does the number of abortions."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1841.25,1855.45,"But, Justice Sotomayor, that problem, the problem with seamlessness or whether you call it the problem of burdensomeness, that's the problem that exists not just with respect to the employers of Petitioner's employees, but with respect to every other employee who, like Petitioner's employees, also --"
2015.14-1418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1855.45,1889.87,"But you know that we exempt certain employers of certain size from Title VII, and it's not because we don't believe that racial discrimination is a bad thing, and it's not that we're not committed to eradicating that problem, but because at a certain point, we have assumed as a society, or as a government, that you can't do everything. So you can't take care of the health needs of a hundred percent of women, but you can of a significant number."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1896.475,1925.95,"Because I think it means one of two things: Either the government is willing to tolerate all of the problems it identifies for Petitioner's employees with respect to the employees of grandfathered plans -- and we understand that there are about 44 million of those -- with respect to -- respect to the employees of small businesses, with respect to the employees of religious employers, the unemployed and the self-employed. Either they're willing -- if they're willing to tolerate the problems with all of those people, then it really does question whether they have a compelling interest in forcing these particular Petitioners to comply."
2015.14-1418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1991.74,2005.235,"Mr. Francisco, I have to admit to not quite understanding this argument, that -- it seems as though the most important laws, the laws that serve the most compelling interests, are -- often have exceptions in them."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2032.355,2033.86,"I don't think that's right, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2039.25,2041.665,It's lower and lower every single year.
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2041.665,2045.33,"It's got lower for the first couple of years, and it's leveled off in the last two years at about --"
2015.14-1418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2045.33,2046.0,If you make any change --
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2046.0,2046.56,-- 25 percent.
2015.14-1418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2046.56,2059.25,"If you make any change in your health plan, then you're out from under the grandfather, and every employer is going to make changes in the health plan."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2067.935,2084.84,"Yes, Your Honor, except that they allow -- they allow employees to raise copayments at the rate of medical inflation without losing status, and they allow you to continue adding employees to the plan without losing grandfathered status, which I think partly explains why it's leveled off at about 25 percent over the last couple of years."
2015.14-1418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2111.75,2114.86,"Here is the incentives that you would put in place, Mr. Francisco."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2142.31,2164.43,"No -- Your Honor, I think what it means is that when the government claims an interest, the overwhelming interest to force Petitioners -- organizations like Petitioners to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs, then yes, when it says we're going to exempt some organizations for purely secular reasons, some organizations for political reasons, and other organizations for religious reasons, then it does have to --"
2015.14-1418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.43,2171.315,I see your point is that -- let's imagine a widespread government program filled with exemptions.
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2187.885,2188.77,"Sure, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2188.77,2189.13,Okay.
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2204.9,2205.61,"Sure, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.04,2206.13,Okay.
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2236.0,2239.63,"And Justice Breyer, these are finely-grained factual -- factual issues --"
2015.14-1418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.63,2240.48,"No, they're not."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2242.12,2262.99,"But -- but I think that when you're looking at a regime like this one that has both religious exemptions, that has large exemptions for totally nonreligious reasons, and that has the exact same problem that the government claims Petitioners present, with respect to all the other employees in this country, who just like Petitioners' employees, don't --"
2015.14-1418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2262.99,2267.415,"I got where you're going with your exemptions, but that's not the thrust of my question."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2305.52,2307.35,"And I'd agree that's a tough line, but I think the --"
2015.14-1418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.35,2308.6,What -- what is the right line?
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2308.6,2312.5,I don't think there's a clear line for what things do we -- we require and what things we don't require --
2015.14-1418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.5,2313.77,Give me a hint what the direction is. (Laughter.)
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2313.77,2347.3,"I think the way the law works -- I think the way the law works is it says are you allowed to require them to do this particular thing that violates their beliefs? And in making that decision, you look at what the -- how the government is treating other similar situations. And if here the government is in fact saying, with respect to all of these other people who also don't get the coverage from their employers, we're willing to tolerate it or else willing to address the issue in other ways, then under RFRA the answer is you have to look to those other ways to see whether they're sufficient for these employees or whether they're uniquely insufficient for these employees."
2015.14-1418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2347.3,2370.185,"Mr. Francisco, may -- may I ask a question? Is there any accomodation that the government would offer that would in fact result in women employees of your clients, or students of your clients, getting health care as part of an employer-based plan or a student-based plan, getting contraceptive coverage? Is there any accomodation that would be acceptable?"
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2370.185,2374.28,"Your Honor, the accommodations that we've listed in our briefs would all be acceptable --"
2015.14-1418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2374.28,2375.445,"No, no, no."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2386.449,2395.36,"Your Honor, if by submitting this notification or any other notification we got the same treatment as the religious employers, then this notification would be acceptable."
2015.14-1418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2395.36,2395.46,No.
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2415.41,2419.72,"Your Honor, possibly so, possibly not, and if I could explain."
2015.14-1418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2433.74,2436.12,"Well, what might be acceptable if it puts enough distance?"
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2436.12,2436.725,Sure.
2015.14-1418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2450.47,2452.96,So your answer to Justice Kagan is wrong.
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2485.47,2499.35,"Not necessarily, Your Honor. Again, as Mr. Clement was saying, if there was an uber-insurance policy where Aetna was the company that the government picked to provide contraceptive coverage to all women in this country, and we happened to use Aetna, I think we'd probably be fine."
2015.14-1418,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2499.35,2500.83,Paid for by the government?
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2500.83,2501.515,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2503.72,2516.915,"But Justice Kagan's question was these college students, they want to get the same coverage that -- that is available for all other conditions. You -- you -- as far as I understand, you're saying no."
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2524.93,2525.13,Uh-huh.
2015.14-1418,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2525.13,2528.46,-- it is insuring the religious organization.
2015.14-1418,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2541.875,2547.615,"And Justice Ginsburg, I'm trying to be careful because we have many clients that have many different views."
2015.14-1418,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2590.17,2602.425,"Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2602.425,2630.43,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The accommodation that Petitioners challenge in this case strikes precisely the sensible balance between religious liberty and compelling governmental interests that Congress sought when it enacted RFRA. As this Court recognized in Hobby Lobby, the accommodation seeks to respect the religious liberty of Petitioners by exempting them from the contraceptive -- contraceptive requirement, and to respect the interest of Petitioners' employees --"
2015.14-1418,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2630.43,2647.075,And is it fair for me to infer from the way you open your remarks that you concede that there is a substantial burden here? And the question then is what is a permissible accommodation? What's the least restrictive alternative? Do you concede that there's a substantial burden?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2647.075,2650.76,"We do not concede there's a substantial burden, Justice Kennedy."
2015.14-1418,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2680.97,2685.61,"Well, do -- do you question their belief that they're complicit in the moral wrong?"
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2685.61,2686.725,"No, we do not."
2015.14-1418,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2686.725,2690.09,"Well, then -- then it seems to me that that's a substantial burden."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2695.97,2735.665,"So, look, I'm -- I'm happy to discuss the substantial burden further, but I do want to go to what I think is the critical point on the question of how RFRA scrutiny applies, if it does apply, and it's this: Mr. Francisco spent a lot of time talking about the various alternatives that the government might be able to use instead of the accommodation, and I think there's a real problem with every single one of them in that every single one of them defeats the very purpose for which Congress imposed the preventive services requirement, not just with respect to contraception, but with respect to all preventive services."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2780.22,2786.43,"That's -- in other words, your compelling interest is not that women obtain the contraceptive services."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2810.655,2812.23,"Yes, I understand that, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2855.11,2865.67,"The point is that it's the form in which the services are provided that you object to, not the fact that they be provided or not, because that's not the question."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2910.93,2913.06,"I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.14-1418,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2942.73,2946.5,"But you're saying, don't worry, religions, you're not complicit."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2947.37,2947.9,No.
2015.14-1418,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2967.83,2977.0,It seems to me then the analysis has to be whether or not there are less restrictive alternatives and if -- is this the least restrictive alternative?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2977.0,2984.97,"Well, as I said, Your Honor, if RFRA scrutiny applies, then this certainly is the least restrictive alternative."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2984.97,2986.17,"Well, let me mention one of them."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3016.34,3018.685,It has precisely the problem.
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3025.03,3041.095,"What -- what type of a burden does that impose? Is it because these -- these Exchanges are so unworkable, even with the help of a navigator, that -- that a woman who wants to get free contraceptive coverage simply has to sign up for that on -- on one of the Exchanges?"
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3041.095,3041.74,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3041.74,3044.21,So she'll have two insurance cards instead of one.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3055.865,3056.36,"Yes, of course."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3056.36,3057.515,-- for dental or vision.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3057.515,3069.05,"For the very reason that the employee has to go out and get a separate policy, even in the world that doesn't exist now, because those policies can't be sold on Exchanges now --"
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3069.05,3072.54,"Well, we can talk -- we can talk about that in a minute, but continue with that."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3072.54,3092.45,"But even in that hypothetical world, that is not equally effective at achieving the government's interest, because the whole point of this provision is that you get this care from your regular doctor as part of your regular health care without any barriers, including any co-pay barriers. And I think -- think about -- consider this, please, from the perspective of the woman employee."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3132.71,3138.12,But why would that be? He would be -- he would be paid under the -- under the contraceptive plan.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3138.12,3140.07,Because it wouldn't be her regular doctor.
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3148.62,3159.93,"Well, you don't think that they would be willing to sell them if you subsidize them at 115 percent, which is what you were doing in the case of those who provide services under self-insured plans."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3159.93,3188.61,"But the whole point here, Justice Alito, is that Congress wanted to eliminate -- even what were perceived by most of the small barriers, like a 5 or $10 co-pay, because the medical experts said that even though small barriers -- even when you're getting it as part of your regular coverage, even those small barriers work as a sufficient disincentive that many fewer people use contraception than would otherwise, and that -- and the barrier -- and the system that Your Honor is positing, imposes a significantly greater barrier even in a --"
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3188.61,3193.855,What about the women -- what about the women in grandfathered plans --
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3193.855,3194.89,Well --
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3194.89,3200.26,-- under -- in grandfathered plans that offer no contraceptive coverage? What about them?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3200.26,3203.555,"So grandfathered plans, let's talk about them."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3223.435,3225.64,"But, you know, in the long run we're all dead."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3227.98,3247.11,-- in -- in the interim? What was the reason why Congress did not require contraceptive coverage right away under the grandfathered plans? It required coverage right away under the grandfathered plans for 25-year-olds so that they could get coverage under their parents' health insurance plan.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3277.14,3289.49,"Your Honor, when Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, it made -- it didn't impose an immediate requirement that every building be retrofitted so that access to the disabled was possible."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3366.07,3375.65,"Well, but to -- to come back -- to come back to the point that you were making about the Americans with Disabilities Act, that certainly is a good point for the Americans with Disabilities Act."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3394.41,3394.635,No.
2015.14-1418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3427.85,3438.335,"General, can we go back to the substantial burden question? And I think that Justice Breyer has been talking about how to draw this line."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3509.93,3510.77,"Yes, Your Honor, that's --"
2015.14-1418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3510.77,3534.8,"Because here, what the religious groups I understand are asking is the government not to use its regulatory power with third parties who don't have a religious objection, and forcing a burden on the women who its trying to help, third parties that don't have the same religious objection, and burdening them to do other things."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3534.8,3557.89,"I think that is the essence of our position on substantial burden, Your Honor, and I believe that trying to answer Justice Breyer's question about where that comes from, I believe it comes from Lyng and Bowen, which both recognize that there is an objective limit in Lung. For example, the Court said that the -- it did not doubt that the -- the government actions were going to have a devastating impact on a religious exercise of the --"
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3557.89,3567.685,This is -- this is not just a case of the government dealing with a third party based on the Petitioners' objection.

2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3694.52,3696.24,They are -- they are not third parties.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3701.93,3702.24,Right.
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3702.24,3704.545,It seems to me that the balance is pretty clear.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3737.75,3741.235,I think it is one fair understanding of the case.
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3741.91,3743.095,Is there a fairer one?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3743.095,3745.62,"Let me put it this way, Mr."
2015.14-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3766.03,3768.31,"Now, you aren't giving up on the substantial burden?"

2015.14-1418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3882.58,3883.75,"Well, then what do I do?"
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3883.75,3908.075,I think -- I think we're urging a more incremental approach that recognizes that the principles articulated in Lyng and Bowen apply in a situation where the government is acting -- making arrangements with third parties in order to fill a regulatory gap that the -- that has been created by the government granting an exemption to a religious entity.
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3908.075,3920.44,Could you -- could you address Mr. Clement's hypothetical about where the -- the government would come into a -- an unoccupied room in the Little Sisters facility that's not being used for anything.

2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4043.43,4044.54,So I --
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4044.54,4056.0,"So the difference between that and Mr. Clement's hypothetical is that one involves something tangible, physical property, and the other involves something that's intangible."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4056.0,4056.28,"Well, I think --"
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4056.28,4057.06,That's the distinction.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4057.06,4059.36,"Well, it's not just that it's like intangible property."

2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4130.515,4133.44,"So this gets to the question of the church exemption, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4182.43,4190.895,"The difference, of course, is, as you -- it's properly phrased in the briefing, is the accommodation is the way in which the organizations comply with the mandate."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4196.27,4196.49,But --
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4196.49,4197.455,They are exempt.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4197.455,4214.205,"The reason we drew the line is because we think -- and I think Professor Laycock's brief is quite instructive on this point -- is that while there -- no line is perfect, and I'm sure this line isn't perfect, and there's going to be some overlap between entities that maybe you think of -- or look closer to being on one side of the line than the other."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4233.94,4242.23,You have to draw the line? Is it -- could you apply the same requirements you apply to the Little Sisters to the church entity itself?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4242.23,4255.065,"And so I -- I think we could, Your Honor, yes, under -- I think under -- I think we would -- it would be an appropriate accommodation, and I think if we had the same compelling interest, and we'd make the same narrowly tailored means argument."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4261.62,4261.69,No.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4272.195,4272.595,Right.
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4363.8,4376.285,"Well, for the employees who have to buy the plans on the Exchange because they work for a small employer and the employer doesn't offer health insurance, does that arrangement frustrate the government's compelling interest?"
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4376.285,4377.08,No.
2015.14-1418,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4419.04,4428.65,"That just underscores that the church plans here, religious organization plans here, are, in effect, subsidizing the conduct that they deemed immoral."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4428.65,4452.93,"So, Your Honor, I think the answer to that is that they're not subsidizing it, because the way in which this plan is structured, the way in which the accommodation is structured, is that they are not to -- employers are not to bear any financial burden for the contraceptive coverage that has to be provided without charging the employer, and funds have to be segregated, and all activity has to be segregated."
2015.14-1418,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4460.43,4465.035,"If it's so easy to provide, if it's so free, why can't they just get it through another plan?"
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4465.035,4470.31,"Well, because they have to sign up for a second plan and pay for a second plan, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4501.03,4510.61,"So it comes down to a question of who has to do the paperwork? If it's the employee that has to do it, that's -- that's no good. If it's the religious organization that has to do it, that's okay?"
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4510.61,4512.33,"I think it's a lot more than that, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4516.07,4518.02,"They're on the Exchanges, right?"
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4518.02,4520.53,"But -- but, Your Honor, put yourself in the position of this --"
2015.14-1418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4520.53,4522.14,They're not on the Exchanges.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4522.14,4522.72,So --
2015.14-1418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4522.72,4523.78,That's a falsehood.
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4532.49,4533.39,Is that true with respect to --
2015.14-1418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4533.39,4534.53,We're creating a new program.
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4534.53,4537.5,Is that true with respect to every policy sold on the Exchanges?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4537.5,4538.05,Yes.
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4539.26,4540.58,What about pediatric dentistry?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4540.58,4541.7,"Well, except for that one."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4541.7,4542.72,"Oh, except for pediatric dentistry."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4542.72,4543.03,But that's a --
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4543.03,4549.07,"So you could have a separate health coverage product sold on the Exchanges. You, in fact, do it already."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4549.07,4551.65,"You couldn't do it under current law, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4551.65,4557.204,"Well, the way constitutional objections work is you might have to change current law. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4557.204,4582.09,"But in this circumstance, I think, you don't need to get to that question of whether there is an obligation to change current law because even if you did have a second contraceptive-only policy available on an Exchange, that would be precisely the kind of barrier that Congress is trying to eliminate. You have two policies instead of one policy. That creates the disincentives."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4587.7,4588.23,"No, no, no."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4593.95,4594.43,Well --
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4594.43,4599.76,"You said, yes, it is a hassle to go to the Exchange, although it's - you know, I've heard about how easy it is."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4614.915,4615.23,Right.
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4615.23,4621.18,It's a question whether you want the employee to sign a paper or you want the Little Sisters to sign a paper.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4629.665,4630.01,No.
2015.14-1418,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4655.13,4657.27,That's why it's necessary to hijack the plans.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4657.27,4670.05,"It's -- Your Honor, it's -- it is why the -- it is why the government's interest is advanced in the -- in the least restrictive manner, in the most effective manner."
2015.14-1418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4670.05,4693.21,"Is this right? Is it that the reason I get that you don't want to have the women to have to ask for the coverage is because vast numbers of women will, quite a few who have religious objections won't, and then there will be that middle set of people who are inertia bound."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4722.885,4723.73,I think that the --
2015.14-1418,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4723.73,4723.98,All right.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4745.79,4747.34,"And that's all -- that's all correct, Your Honor."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4757.015,4769.0,Couldn't the Executive deal with the problem of what's available on the Exchanges at the present time in this way: Policies are available that provide comprehensive coverage.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4793.96,4794.31,No.
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4795.48,4801.57,Why would that not be -- why would that not be a valid exercise of your enforcement discretion?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4801.57,4803.65,"Well, it -- I don't think it would be."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4821.14,4823.34,"Well, I understand you're saying it would be inadequate."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4823.34,4824.545,-- health care with regular doctors.
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4824.545,4830.78,But why would it be not something that you could do in accordance with your understanding of executive power?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4830.78,4836.05,"Well, I don't -- I don't think that it would address the problem, Justice Alito, because it would --"
2015.14-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4836.05,4864.15,"Could you -- could you, General Verrilli, explain the difference between the employer filing a form, identifying an insurer -- say, Aetna or Blue Cross -- that covers contraceptives for many other people that it insures, the difference between that notice and the woman who now doesn't have this coverage, has to go out affirmatively and get it from someplace else? Is it just a matter of filing --"
2015.14-1418,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4864.15,4879.185,"-- the form for her, or is there a real difference between -- between an employer saying we're not going to cover contraceptives, just our insurer's name, and the woman who suddenly doesn't have it as part of her package and has to go out --"
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4879.185,4879.8,Right.
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4886.21,4886.63,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4889.28,4907.31,"The difference is this: It's not just about filling out paperwork; that if you're a woman employee, you go to your regular doctor, you say you have a medical condition -- I -- that puts me at risk of being pregnant, or I just want contraceptive coverage, or I need contraception to treat a medical condition."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4917.1,4917.29,All right.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4922.3,4927.69,The -- I understand the interest to be avoiding complicity in what they consider to be sin.
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4929.52,4934.01,Which way -- which way does RFRA cut in -- in analyzing that balance?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4934.01,4961.285,"I think RFRA cuts, in this situation, quite decisively in favor of the government here because the interests are compelling. And the -- and as we've tried to explain, none of the alternatives that the Petitioners have proposed have come anywhere close to being equally effective in ensuring that women get this coverage. And so -- and the obstacles that -- that you get told by your regular doctor, I can't help you, I can't even counsel you about this."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4984.95,4998.3,Why do you assume that the doctor to whom the women would go for other services under the plan would be unwilling to provide those services under a plan -- under a separate plan that covers contraceptives?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4998.3,4998.6,"Well, that would --"
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4998.6,4999.54,Why do you make that assumption?
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4999.54,5001.17,"Well, that would be a happenstance."
2015.14-1418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5012.39,5016.57,"General, the -- we've used -- the hijack analogy has been mentioned."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5021.35,5021.8,All right.
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5045.41,5048.71,Maybe if I could follow up on your answer before you do.
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5052.95,5061.03,"When you're hired by one of the religious organizations, you get a brochure or a package with all your insurance coverage and, you know, everything it is."
2015.14-1418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5076.46,5088.67,"Mr. Francisco, I think, earlier said if Aetna offers a separate policy giving insurance, that he thought that that would be an adequate -- an adequate accommodation."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5088.67,5092.87,So I think that that raises all the problems identified.
2015.14-1418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5092.87,5093.12,"No, no."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5117.675,5117.795,No.
2015.14-1418,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5120.69,5127.705,"Well, it is two policies instead of one because the contraceptives are being provided by government regulation."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5134.85,5137.88,"Well, I think -- I think if it's a separate policy, you're going to have to apply and pay separately."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5182.955,5205.9,"Before you sit down, General Verrilli, could I just ask you this informational question about this particular situation of the Little Sisters? Their regular third-party administrator also will not provide -- has said it will not provide the coverage if -- even if they were to comply with the -- the form of the notice requirement."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5227.84,5237.665,"No, we don't think so. If I could, just in closing, what I'd ask this Court to do is to weigh the alternatives that have been put before you here on this case."
2015.14-1418,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5305.82,5308.42,"Well, that's one way of characterizing what's involved here."
2015.14-1418,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5338.685,5350.735,"What I would say to that, Your Honor, is that, I think, essentially what eight court of appeals have said, which is that RFRA requires a sensible balance."
2015.14-1418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5376.54,5377.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr."
2015.14-1418,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,5381.09,5393.33,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A few points in rebuttal. I'd like to start with the universities, Justice Kennedy, because I don't think it's the case that just because Congress exempts churches, that it has to exempt the universities."
2015.14-1418,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5447.29,5461.43,"But going back to that line-drawing problem -- and that is in a brief that's been mentioned several times, the Baptist Joint Committee -- our leading proponent of RFRA discusses this line-drawing problem."
2015.14-1418,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,5463.045,5466.7,"No, I would say that that gets me to the next point."
2015.14-1418,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5499.56,5509.19,"Would it have been better to say, churches, you've got to tell us you're going to claim an exemption, because not every church is religious, has the same religious tenets."
2015.14-1418,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,5530.325,5531.79,Let me answer both questions together.
2015.14-1418,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5650.535,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
