1986.85-5915,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.224,"We'll hear arguments first this afternoon in No. 85-5915, Brenda E. Wright et al. versus the City of Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority."
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,14.76,17.878,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-5915,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,47.231,56.087,"Mr. Woodward, from what you say I gather that's a somewhat different test than the test for an implied cause of action under a federal statute?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,56.087,57.287,"We believe that it is, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,75.881,77.183,And why do you say that?
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,77.183,85.237,"Well, looking specifically at the pieces of the Cort versus Ash test, some of them just don't seem to fit very well."
1986.85-5915,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.491,146.977,"Certainly it is as a practical matter kind of awkward to have two different tests for such closely related things, isn't it?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,146.977,149.012,"Well, there is some awkwardness."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,203.849,205.966,Where there is a state involved.
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,205.966,207.718,"Where a state or a state actor is involved, yes."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,207.718,211.087,This is the class of cases that 1983 applies to?
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,211.087,211.72,That is correct.
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,262.37,267.506,It's only if there is some identifiable federal legal right involved?
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,267.506,268.306,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,291.639,293.657,"Well, your opponent certainly challenges that."
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,293.657,296.526,"Well, I think in some respects he does."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.75,309.316,"Well, your opponent thinks that the right ought to appear in the statute."
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,309.316,311.452,"Well, I think it does, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.418,337.353,You don't think you have to rely on the regulations?
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,337.353,338.053,--Pardon?
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,338.053,340.055,You don't think you have to rely on the regulations?
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,340.055,348.577,"We don't have any reservations about reading that together with the statute, but we think that there is adequate strength in the statute itself if we had to do that."
1986.85-5915,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,796.567,804.137,"Well, Mr. Woodward, that's assuming that there is a substantive right enforceable by these plaintiffs at all, isn't it?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,804.137,805.923,"That is quite correct, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-5915,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,805.923,823.218,And are we really locking here only at an alleged right that HUD itself created with regulations in 1980 and then withdrew in 1984?
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,823.218,824.101,"I think not, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,833.757,838.31,"You don't rely, then, on the HUD regulations for the creation of this so-called right?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,838.31,839.727,We don't rely solely upon them.
1986.85-5915,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,848.933,854.087,"Well, there certainly isn't anything in the Brooke amendment very specifically about these utility costs, is there?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,854.087,855.004,That's correct.
1986.85-5915,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,855.989,861.676,"So we really have to focus on the regulations, and that was for a very short span of time, wasn't it?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,861.676,878.469,"--Well, it was for a four-year period, Your Honor, during which there was discussion about whether to change them, during which at any time HUD had the authority to waive these regulations as applied to this particular housing authority or as to housing authority generally... housing authorities generally... and did not do so."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,881.304,888.343,"If the regulation was consistent with the statute, it had the force of law, didn't it?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,888.343,889.493,"That is our position, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.445,898.349,Has there been any claim that the regulation is invalid?
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,898.349,900.515,"There has been no claim whatsoever of that, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.178,933.855,"So I suppose you would, or do you... if you say that the statute itself requires the inclusion of utilities, HUD would not be free to say that it doesn't?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,933.855,935.588,"--I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.588,943.044,"But you don't think, you don't think HUD would have the authority to take a contrary position under the statute?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,943.044,947.763,"I think that is so, Your Honor, because of the nature and purpose of the Brooke amendment."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.763,958.72,"Of course, it isn't fatal to your case, I don't suppose, for you to answer the way, if you answered the other way and said that HUD could interpret the statute either way."
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,958.72,964.541,"Well, it may not be fatal to our case because they have not done so, of course."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.545,971.095,I see.
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,971.095,974.73,And the reason is that the legislative history contemporaneous--
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,974.73,979.051,So you think a contrary regulation would very well be invalid?
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,979.051,980.401,"--I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.637,1037.839,"Mr. Woodward, if you... you're suing for money as I understand it in this case?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1037.839,1038.672,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.672,1044.593,"And if you prevail in this case, would your opponent have a claim over against HUD?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1044.593,1046.278,"I'm not sure of that, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.907,1067.525,I'm not suggesting you would.
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1072.394,1073.078,--That's correct.
1986.85-5915,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.078,1078.582,"So that if you get a little more money out of your opponents, it seems to me they have to get that money from HUD."
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1078.582,1080.149,"That is probably the case, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1083.384,1085.236,"So they're not the typical trustee in this situation then, are they?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1085.236,1085.603,Pardon?
1986.85-5915,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.603,1090.224,They're not a typical disinterested trustee insofar as they might have views on what should be done?
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1090.224,1095.759,"Certainly not, and they're hardly a trustee as to the tenants' own money, which is really what's at issue here."
1986.85-5915,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.036,1112.72,"And HUD has never actually tried to take a formal position in this litigation, have they?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1112.72,1115.255,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.49,1146.209,Has HUD taken a position whether or not 1983 is available to your client?
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1146.209,1152.215,"--I don't know that they have taken a position specifically with regard to this issue, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.215,1157.166,To say that they don't have much authority themselves at all.
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1157.166,1157.532,--That's it.
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1161.986,1167.89,"And hence, the Congress could never have intended their regime to displace 1983?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1167.89,1174.644,"--Well, we would prefer not to be held accountable for the extent of their authority, but only for the extent of our clients'--"
1986.85-5915,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.644,1174.961,"Well, I know."
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1184.936,1186.752,"--That certainly points in that direction, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1237.018,1240.553,"Of course, one of the questions here is whether there is a vested individual right, isn't it?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1240.553,1241.92,"That is a legitimate question, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1279.012,1288.783,"It's phrased in terms of what HUD will contribute to the local housing authority, not in terms of just an across the regulation, across the board regulation, isn't it?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1288.783,1301.425,"Now, I believe that ultimately it is tied into that, but my recollection of the regulation is that it does give absolute sort of legislative commands to the Housing Authority about how it must perform its duties."
1986.85-5915,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1321.339,1332.079,"Mr. Woodward, excuse me for interrupting you, but I'd like to ask whether, is your position that any individual tenant could bring a Section 1983 action about any complaint he had?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1343.204,1346.156,"That would be a very broad assumption, Justice Powell."
1986.85-5915,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1346.156,1348.089,"Yes, but I want to know where the limits of your argument lead us."
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1348.089,1349.941,I don't think we need to go that far.
1986.85-5915,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1349.941,1350.508,I understand that.
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1350.508,1350.941,And the reason is this.
1986.85-5915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.318,1398.089,"You mean these tenants have a right to get the utilities paid for, but they don't necessarily have a right to have the utilities working?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1398.089,1404.826,"--Well, I'm not going to assume that they might not, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.348,1414.633,That's not a very appealing argument in the next case.
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1420.787,1421.887,If they don't work.
1986.85-5915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.887,1422.906,--if they don't work?
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1422.906,1432.595,"If in that case it can equally be shown that that's tied... and I think it probably can, to follow the implication of your question... that it is tied to a right, then in fact we may have an enforcement problem."
1986.85-5915,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1472.387,1472.903,"You say ""sue""."
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1477.207,1480.576,"Well, it is my understanding state courts have an obligation to entertain any federal claim."
1986.85-5915,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.695,1490.182,"And as I understood the Fourth Circuit, it assumed that, A, there was a substantive right and, B, it was enforceable in state court."
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1490.182,1491.883,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1503.608,1506.81,"Well, why the preference for federal court over state court here?"
1986.85-5915,0,28373,henry_l_woodward,,1510.862,1513.38,"It just wouldn't work in this particular context, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.707,1555.909,"Thank you, Mr. Woodward."
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1559.361,1563.98,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1813.977,1816.01,"Mr. Harris, let me just interrupt you with a question."
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1820.213,1821.046,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.046,1822.915,"So there is a substantive right involved, then?"
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1822.915,1823.615,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.615,1824.615,I see.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1824.615,1835.056,"There is a substantive right under the lease, if it please, Justice Stevens, to the extent that that relationship landlord-tenant, gives rise to a lease right."
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1878.55,1880.485,Let me put a little different question.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1893.31,1894.062,The statute does that--
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1894.062,1894.679,The statute does that.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1894.679,1895.412,--Your Honor.
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1895.412,1902.316,"And if the Housing Authority should charge more than the permitted statutory rent, would there be a remedy in federal court for that kind of thing?"
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1902.316,1903.166,"No, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1903.166,1906.434,"There would not, even if it's a very simple, flagrant case?"
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1907.97,1908.586,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1927.966,1928.583,0 xxx.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1928.583,1929.149,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.149,1935.303,xxx state court if you simply did not execute a proper lease.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1946.261,1955.117,"The lease, Your Honor, would I believe provide for a fixed amount of rent, which by statute can be no more nor no less than 30 percent of income."
1986.85-5915,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.117,1957.134,"I know, that's the way it's supposed to be."
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1957.134,1957.635,Yes.
1986.85-5915,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1957.635,1964.156,"But if you have a housing authority that executes different leases, there would be no remedy for that difference."
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1964.156,1979.082,"The remedy in that instance would be the remedy of HUD's enforcement of the annual contribution contract, through which the other side of this tripartite arrangement between the tenant and the PHA and HUD are regulated."
1986.85-5915,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.116,1994.174,"But the individual lessee would have no remedy, either in state court nor in federal court, so long as the defect is that the form of lease that the authority uses does not comply with what federal law requires, right?"
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,1994.174,1996.876,--Yes.
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1996.876,2004.112,"And if HUD were to sue, it would have to pay for whatever it recovered on behalf?"
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2004.112,2016.42,"I haven't figured out the answer to that one, Justice Stevens, and would that I could, because I at one time had decided, as I had argued and moved in this case originally, that it ought be dismissed since HUD was an indispensable party and had not been joined."
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.101,2073.471,"Let me ask one other question, following up on Justice Scalia's."
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2093.634,2097.852,"I don't know, Your Honor, that he would have a right even in federal court--"
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.852,2098.636,For equitable relief.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2098.636,2100.621,--to revise a lease.
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2101.504,2106.108,"Well, to compel the Authority to comply with the federal regulations, would be the way to phrase it."
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2106.108,2124.153,"--No, sir, I believe that transcends the intent of Congress in that instance, and I would think that that would be up to HUD, realizing that they had a derelict PHA on their hands, to exercise Section 1404 of the Act, which explicitly gives HUD the right to sue and, interestingly enough, also gives the right to sue HUD."
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.397,2172.9,Do you think the state was obligated to follow the regulation?
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2172.9,2176.335,That the Housing Authority was obligated to follow the regulation?
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2182.672,2187.643,"So your answer is yes, you were obligated to follow the regulation and you did?"
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2187.643,2188.576,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.545,2192.214,Yes.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2197.332,2198.284,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.284,2202.42,And the regulation is consistent with the statute?
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2202.42,2202.936,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.936,2204.455,And has the force of law?
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2204.455,2204.888,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2204.888,2206.974,Thank you.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2206.974,2218.079,The interesting analysis of the conflicting interests which was suggested by my answer to Justice Stevens' question brings to mind a point that I think is particularly interesting and is not treated in the briefs.
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2261.205,2279.0,"Part of your argument, as I understand your brief, is that the state has never understood its obligation under the contract or under the law or under the regulations to make it liable to cover utilities."
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2279.0,2286.106,"--provide utilities, free utilities in a reasonable amount, to the tenants of the PHA in this instance."
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.106,2291.308,But you've never understood your obligation to be any more than what you say it is?
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2291.308,2292.26,"No, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2292.26,2305.501,And so you in effect say there really isn't any clearly enough expressed right under the statute or regulations to found a 1983 suit?
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2305.501,2316.709,"That is correct, sir, although I am troubled somewhat by going back, as Mr. Woodward has pointed out, that I somehow have said that there might be some sort of right."
1986.85-5915,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2401.398,2421.359,"Well, do you draw the line essentially, Mr. Harris, as to what the tenants can sue for and what is left to these considerations you're just mentioning, what's in the lease the tenants can sue the PHA for if it's not furnished, but the section you just mentioned is left to some sort of other kind of adjustment between the PHA and HUD?"
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2421.359,2421.978,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.488,2473.827,Suppose there was either a provision of the statute or the regulation that was perfectly clear and the Housing Authority had just been ignoring it.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2489.021,2489.956,"No, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.956,2490.773,Why not?
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2490.773,2504.18,"Because I believe that the remedy at that point, given the tripartite scheme, would be for HUD to come in and say either, as a practical matter let's get together because next year we've got to renew your subsidy and we may not, or to--"
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.18,2506.332,"Well, what about Maine against Thiboutot?"
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2511.969,2512.586,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2541.471,2549.161,"Well, I would suppose you'd make the same argument in any of these spending power grant programs."
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2549.161,2560.469,"I have difficulty with that for one reason, Your Honor, and that is simply because some of the language in some of the opinions which has reference to the fact that if you can't forfeit the money there isn't a right."
1986.85-5915,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.094,2600.094,Straighten up.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2600.094,2605.164,"--Yes, or I can freeze your money, I can sue you."
1986.85-5915,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2710.065,2731.229,"Mr. Harris, if you're correct in saying that the tenants' real complaint is with HUD, I suppose they might have some sort of an action similar to that which we recognized last term in Brook versus United Auto Workers, to sue HUD over some interpretation of the regulation they claim was wrong but HUD was adhering to."
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2731.229,2732.364,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2846.806,2850.841,"Mr. Harris, do you have a lot of screen door litigation in state courts in these projects?"
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2850.841,2851.358,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2868.635,2871.921,"No, I'm not talking about just general landlord-tenant litigation."
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2879.527,2886.847,"Most of it... to answer your question, it is no more than ordinary litigation in any landlord-tenant, Your Honor, and not that many cases."
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2887.247,2888.133,How much of a burden is it?
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2891.585,2893.885,--I don't know how many.
1986.85-5915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2910.796,2917.45,"Are you suggesting that if a federal remedy were available, the tenants would no longer use this grievance procedure that the regulations provide for?"
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,2917.45,2918.302,"No, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3027.457,3031.341,Would you summarize the grievance procedure?
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,3031.341,3032.475,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3032.475,3037.645,Let's take an individual tenant and he or she has this complaint.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,3037.645,3041.097,"It is processed through ultimately to a panel, which is--"
1986.85-5915,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3041.097,3043.466,What's the first step?
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,3043.466,3046.601,--The first step is to lodge a complaint with the Housing Authority.
1986.85-5915,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3046.601,3047.703,That's in Roanoke?
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,3047.703,3048.52,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5915,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3048.52,3048.82,Right.
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,3050.489,3058.143,"That ultimately goes through two levels, I believe, and perhaps three, of management within the staff of the Housing Authority."
1986.85-5915,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3126.053,3128.822,Does a tenant ever get to HUD in Washington?
1986.85-5915,1,17693,bayard_e_harris,,3128.822,3130.274,Not to my knowledge.
1986.85-5915,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3166.63,3168.397,"Thank you, Mr. Harris."
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3170.616,3171.199,"I do, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3171.199,3172.701,You have about four minutes.
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3172.701,3187.544,"If I may accept the invitation of Justice Stevens to expand a little bit beyond the record with regard to the screen door cases, I would like to say that if those cases are brought with regard to the Housing Authority in Roanoke we would probably be bringing them, and in fact there are very few."
1986.85-5915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3265.544,3272.049,Do you have any doubt that a suit against the federal agency would lie?
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3272.049,3273.483,For non-enforcement or for--
1986.85-5915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3273.483,3274.483,For non-enforcement.
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3274.483,3275.835,--damages?
1986.85-5915,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3291.278,3296.165,Is the complaint the non-compliance by the PHA or the non-compliance by HUD?
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3296.165,3299.967,"In our case, our complaint is clearly non-compliance by the PHA."
1986.85-5915,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3314.56,3315.643,No way to invoke what?
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3315.643,3317.828,--To invoke a remedy from HUD.
1986.85-5915,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.962,3321.78,I thought you said you could sue them.
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3321.78,3325.018,"Well, it's always possible to sue, but winning is another question."
1986.85-5915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3325.018,3325.418,"Well, I know."
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3334.54,3339.159,"Well, I think the enforcement question does leave an avenue open."
1986.85-5915,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.428,3344.763,"Well, now you've answered the question three ways."
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3344.763,3353.086,"--Underlying the question, though, is the... I mean, underlying the pursuit is the question of whether these folks have done something wrong in the first place."
1986.85-5915,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3355.287,3356.537,"Well, don't they have your money, too?"
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3356.537,3356.97,Pardon?
1986.85-5915,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.97,3358.405,"Don't they have your money, too?"
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3358.405,3360.941,They have received the benefit of our money as well.
1986.85-5915,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3360.941,3362.574,"I mean, they actually have the money, don't they?"
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3362.574,3365.692,"Well, it's not clear, frankly, at this point whether they still have it or not, Your Honor."
1986.85-5915,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3365.692,3366.442,I see.
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3367.609,3368.978,"We paid it, we know that."
1986.85-5915,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.513,3372.696,And they haven't given it back.
1986.85-5915,2,28373,henry_l_woodward,,3372.696,3374.23,--They certainly haven't given it back.
1986.85-5915,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3397.811,3399.58,"Your time has expired, Mr. Woodward."
