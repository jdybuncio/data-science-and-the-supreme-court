2011.10-8974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.07,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 10-8974, Perry v. New Hampshire."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,9.689,13.074,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-8974,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,33.202,38.672,"Counselor, does your position depend on police involvement at all?"
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,38.672,40.208,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.10-8974,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,40.208,48.564,"I'm -- if a private investigator shows a picture or -- that has no connection to the police, a company's investigator?"
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,48.564,49.647,What I suggest--
2011.10-8974,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,49.647,53.516,Or the news media publishes a picture of someone that it thinks--
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,53.516,57.003,--I have a two-part answer to that.
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,98.247,117.708,"Mr. Guerriero, if it's not -- if it's not limited to suggestive circumstances created by the police, why is unreliable eyewitness identification any different from unreliable anything else?"
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,126.997,127.932,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,149.345,156.099,"So at least for all eyewitness testimony, there would have to be some pretesting for reliability?"
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,158.535,163.939,"No, Your Honor, and I don't think that's exactly what the Court said in Wade and the subsequent cases."
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,178.08,185.352,"And in this case, in which category do you place the eyewitness testimony?"
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,194.624,201.278,"In our case, we do not allege any manipulation or intentional orchestration by the police."
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.709,238.819,"Do you think that our cases which exclude or -- or require reversal when there is eyewitness testimony impaired by the police, you think that's really limited to eyewitness testimony?"
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,281.396,284.531,--I think that may be a separate due process claim.
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.049,286.532,Exactly.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,297.238,299.19,"--I -- I disagree, Your Honor."
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.761,304.894,I'm saying we don't mean it.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,306.077,306.963,Well--
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.963,322.223,"I'm saying that it's unbelievable that if the -- if the police created testimony, not eyewitness testimony but testimony that was unreliable because of police suggestiveness, I think we would throw that out as well."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,323.223,342.719,"--I -- well, I think that in any case, and I think the Court has said this in other circumstances, that in any case a defendant could raise a due process claim and say, either because of the way the prosecution handled the evidence or because of the -- the combination of rulings on evidence, that there was a due process violation that implicated fundamental fairness."
2011.10-8974,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,342.719,354.96,"In this case, suppose that the police talked to this -- to the lady that was in the -- in the apartment and saw the thing out the window and said, we -- we think we've solved this case but you can't look at this man."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,385.546,387.581,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.71,413.03,What about -- what about unreliable eyewitness testimony in favor of the defendant?
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,427.756,432.544,"It may be excluded under the rules of evidence, but the Due Process Clause doesn't--"
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.544,435.996,Do you think it should be excluded under the rules of evidence?
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,439.181,441.55,--The Due Process Clause--
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.55,453.107,"All of the evidence that -- that causes the defendant to be convicted is excluded, but -- but any -- any evidence -- any evidence on the other side is not?"
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,453.107,463.296,"--Well, the defendant is obviously not trying to deprive the State of its liberty in the same way that the State is trying to deprive the defendant of his liberty at trial, so the Due Process Clause would not apply in that sense."
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.117,479.258,"Well, you see, when -- when it's the State that causes the unreliability, I can see why it is a -- a ground that can be invoked only by the defendant."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,493.315,494.034,It -- it--
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,494.034,499.338,Once -- once you take the State out of the mix there is no reason to limit it to the -- to the defendant.
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.338,504.29,You -- you answered that due process works only in favor of the defendant.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,504.29,504.723,--That's right.
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,504.723,505.992,Not in favor of the State.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,505.992,506.625,That's right.
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.625,509.877,And that is your only -- your only distinction.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,512.646,514.514,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,514.514,515.131,--street.
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.131,515.464,Well--
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,515.464,520.585,I take it from your -- I take it from your answers that simple unreliability is not enough.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,521.835,522.552,That's right.
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,522.552,527.922,"--eyewitness testimony that seems of very dubious unreliability, that cannot be excluded."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,527.922,528.339,That's right.
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,528.672,529.172,Something more is needed.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,529.172,530.855,"--That's right, and I might even go further."
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,530.855,532.374,Something more is needed; suggestiveness is needed.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,532.374,532.807,That's right.
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,532.807,535.992,But suggestiveness doesn't require any police involvement?
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,536.826,537.359,That's right.
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,537.359,540.194,Can you just define what you mean by suggestiveness?
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,540.194,543.413,"Well, I think the court has given examples."
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,556.489,560.707,"Yes, but those are all situations where the police is involved, the police are involved."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,560.707,560.991,Right.
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,576.819,579.521,"Well, what if you have cross-racial identification?"
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,584.74,590.377,That may be a separate grounds to move for a jury instruction or for an expert.
2011.10-8974,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.78,597.399,--Why not?
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,621.848,624.134,"Two answers to that, Your Honor."
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,638.393,642.345,"I understand that, but I need to know what you mean by suggestiveness."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,645.63,650.701,--It is conduct or circumstances that point -- that tell the witness that's the man.
2011.10-8974,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,684.672,700.967,"But just to repeat Justice Scalia's question, once you're not talking about police suggestiveness, once you're talking about suggestiveness that arises from non-State conduct, why should we be focused on suggestiveness as opposed to any other cause of unreliability?"
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,700.967,708.121,"Well, because that's what -- my first reason is that that's what the Court focused on in Wade as the main danger."
2011.10-8974,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,708.121,709.787,"Well, the Court was focusing on police suggestiveness."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,723.296,726.682,"Well, I think our position is in between there."
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,749.448,750.081,What does that mean?
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,750.081,753.482,Do you distinguish -- do you distinguish the husband's situation?
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,772.361,776.431,--Trial counsel simply did not move to suppress that testimony.
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.919,783.869,So you'd put them both in the same category?
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,783.869,784.235,I would have.
2011.10-8974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,784.235,790.323,"Why isn't it -- this may be -- just again following up on Justice Alito's question, but there is always a degree of suggestiveness."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,806.131,807.833,That's right.
2011.10-8974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,821.691,828.247,"But whenever -- whenever the witness is asked, at least there is a suggestion that this might be the man."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,840.904,845.089,"--Actually, I disagree with that aspect of your question, Your Honor."
2011.10-8974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,873.376,878.446,"Well what about a situation like the one we had here, where you're not talking about a line-up."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,878.446,878.846,--That's right.
2011.10-8974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,878.846,885.583,"But you're talking about the scene of a crime, and the police says, do you know this person, did you see this person, or anything else?"
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,895.189,899.093,"It is, but the key is that it's not the suggestion that results in exclusion."
2011.10-8974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,907.597,910.216,"So this is -- again, this is just following up, I guess."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,938.801,940.337,I--
2011.10-8974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,940.337,943.972,"You know, how long were you there before this individual came into the shop?"
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,956.18,964.868,--I think it's important to look back at what the Court said in Wade and in fact how what the Court said in Wade has been borne out.
2011.10-8974,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,993.02,998.34,"But again, that was in the context of procedures that the police had instituted."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,998.34,1000.125,--It may be that--
2011.10-8974,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1000.125,1003.577,And your -- and your rationale goes much beyond it.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1034.013,1034.513,--Right.
2011.10-8974,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1034.513,1035.549,And there was good light.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1042.868,1044.737,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2011.10-8974,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1058.128,1058.497,What is--
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1058.497,1059.83,--on a case by -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-8974,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.83,1060.164,--Go ahead.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1064.318,1072.555,"And then the trial judge would look at it and in the rare case where he says it's very substantially likely, which we agree is a high standard--"
2011.10-8974,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1072.555,1073.005,All right.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1127.308,1133.962,"--Well, to answer the first part of your question, what's different about this evidence is that--"
2011.10-8974,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1133.962,1135.062,I didn't say what's different about it.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1154.309,1169.485,"--The analysis under 403, which New Hampshire of course has as well, will accord a certain weight and value to the opportunity of counsel to cross-examine the witness and to make arguments to the jury."
2011.10-8974,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1177.841,1182.626,"Well, the judges don't, I'm sure -- I'm not 100 percent sure, you'd have to ask a trial judge."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1209.793,1210.978,--The difference--
2011.10-8974,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1210.978,1211.978,"Unless -- well, go ahead."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1211.978,1212.295,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-8974,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1232.642,1233.026,"Whoa, wait."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1262.978,1274.236,"--It's -- it's the standard that this Court has established, if it's reasonably -- reasonably likely or substantially likely to lead to a risk of misidentification at trial, very substantially likely."
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1274.236,1277.971,"That would be really a great change from the way trials are now conducted, wouldn't it."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1335.976,1341.647,"Well, it's certainly not the change from what the law is in the Federal circuits that we cited."
2011.10-8974,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1345.432,1351.003,Do you know of cases like that in which the judge has said that eyewitness identification cannot come in?
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1351.003,1365.512,"--In Thigpen v. Cory, which is a Sixth Circuit case, the court said -- in fact they specifically used the phrase ""police machinations"" -- that this did not arise from police machinations."
2011.10-8974,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1373.601,1377.803,"But we've said in our case, Neil v. Biggers -- that was a rape case and we allowed it."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1379.838,1384.809,"Well -- and I think the Court said in all its cases, and in particular in Simmons, that each case--"
2011.10-8974,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1384.809,1390.546,"And, in fact we said that it was unnecessarily suggestive, but that it was still reliable."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1390.546,1391.763,--And it may be.
2011.10-8974,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1413.159,1420.999,Suppose that there was some other category of testimony which proved even more unreliable than the category that you're talking about.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1439.694,1445.03,I think it would be a very high burden for the defense to meet there.
2011.10-8974,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1465.194,1465.511,Okay.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1482.14,1483.84,"Well, I don't think so, Your Honor."
2011.10-8974,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1497.315,1504.653,"No, I understand you have very good empirical evidence which should lead us all to wonder about the reliability of eyewitness testimony."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1513.692,1528.684,"Well, maybe if somebody else came along and said, we've done a study and we find this kind of evidence, that in 75 percent of the wrongful convictions, this evidence contributed to the miscarriage of justice, then I would think the Court should take a look at that."
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1530.386,1532.405,What about all the other safeguards that you have?
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1546.246,1546.763,Yes.
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1546.763,1549.115,All those questions.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1572.38,1578.584,"If all of those safeguards were enough, even when the police made--"
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1578.584,1587.173,"Well, leaving aside the police, because there -- there is an interest in deterrence, in deterring the police from manipulating evidence."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1587.173,1599.967,"--I don't think deterrence is the primary basis of the court's cases, Your Honor, because the Court has said that if it proves to be reliable, no matter how manipulative the police were, this evidence comes in."
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1608.153,1613.324,There is a difference between suggestive and suggested by the police.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1613.324,1614.976,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I--"
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1614.976,1625.098,"If the suggestion comes from the police, then the evidence will be excluded."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1632.052,1633.218,--Well I think that that's a--
2011.10-8974,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1633.218,1635.254,--it would be admitted.
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1635.254,1644.293,"--I mean, I think that that's a -- that's a tricky issue to consider, because suggestion coming from the police is different from manipulation."
2011.10-8974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1658.952,1661.002,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-8974,0,39386,richard_guerriero,,1661.002,1661.452,Thank you.
2011.10-8974,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1661.452,1674.395,General Delaney.
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,1674.395,1680.133,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-8974,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1700.696,1706.933,Now we've changed the language of Wade when it talks about intentional or unintentional.
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,1713.854,1715.456,--I'm not--
2011.10-8974,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1715.456,1722.026,Even if the policeman tells you he wasn't really thinking or focusing on a distinguishing characteristic in the line-up?
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,1722.026,1732.298,"--That may play a role, Justice Sotomayor, but only in a limited sense, and not in the way the Petitioner is suggesting we look at unintentional conduct."
2011.10-8974,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1742.023,1744.891,Could you tell me what you think would have happened here?
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,1752.062,1753.997,That -- that's correct.
2011.10-8974,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1753.997,1759.918,In your judgment -- I think Justice Kennedy hit the nail on the head.
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,1789.587,1797.258,The difference in this case is the role that the police played in bringing about potential suggestion under your hypothetical.
2011.10-8974,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1810.751,1811.118,No.
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,1856.981,1859.933,"--Well, first, I don't think you need to go there in this case."
2011.10-8974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.687,1882.53,"But doesn't -- we face that problem anyway, even if we -- whether or not we decide in this case that it doesn't matter that the police manipulated it, we are always going to have the problem of when has there been police manipulation; right?"
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,1882.53,1883.216,--That's correct.
2011.10-8974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.216,1886.001,"I mean, that -- that's not a creation of this -- of this case."
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,1886.001,1886.884,That's correct.
2011.10-8974,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.884,1905.645,"And I -- I would guess that in the case you're talking about, just telling the person to stay where he is, is not -- now, it would be different if -- if the defendant was -- was caught two blocks away and the police bring him back to the scene of the crime and make him stand there so that the woman can see him from the window."
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,1906.581,1907.547,It is quite different.
2011.10-8974,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1918.722,1923.924,"When you say that's -- when you say that's different, you're not -- you're not suggesting that that would be suggestive, are you?"
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,1923.924,1924.507,"--No, I'm not."
2011.10-8974,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1924.507,1929.059,"Because presumably, that's the same argument -- that's for the jury and the counsel."
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,1944.152,1946.235,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-8974,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1977.104,1978.956,"Well, it's both; right, General Delaney?"
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,2005.123,2010.677,"That is true, Justice Kagan, that -- that the opinions have discussed both issues."
2011.10-8974,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2030.056,2030.506,It seems that that's not right.
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,2044.665,2056.889,"That is correct, and if we expand that out and we apply that rationale to the circumstances of a case not involving police activity, we lose that deterrence rationale."
2011.10-8974,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2065.162,2069.966,"And what you're -- what you're saying, I take it, in the answer to Justice Kagan, was that there is really a two-part step."
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,2080.038,2081.356,And that is the Biggers test.
2011.10-8974,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2130.437,2151.351,"What you're saying -- what you're saying seems to suggest that the rule we're talking about here is really not an aspect of due process per se, but, like the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, it's a special due process exclusionary rule that is meant to deter conduct that could result in a constitutional violation."
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,2151.87,2154.02,"I -- I think that's correct, Justice Alito."
2011.10-8974,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2188.96,2198.581,"If -- if the exclusionary aspect of this is not part of due process itself, then doesn't it follow that what due process requires is reliability?"
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,2207.337,2210.825,"It's -- the standard is not reliability, Justice Alito."
2011.10-8974,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2217.479,2232.155,"What -- what about cases with inflammatory evidence, too many lurid photos or testimony that ignites prejudice in the community?"
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,2235.773,2242.51,"That is, and we have both constitutional and non-constitutional tools and procedures right now to address that."
2011.10-8974,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2288.575,2289.341,You -- you have two cases.
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,2316.759,2318.692,"No, Justice Alito."
2011.10-8974,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2362.12,2367.941,"Well, I'm not sure you answered Justice Alito's questions about why there should be this difference between these two cases."
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,2384.653,2403.03,"Well, if we do look back to determine whether the circumstances involving the police are any more -- of more serious concern, if we look back to Wade, this Court did talk about the unique role of police suggestion in this context of confrontations."
2011.10-8974,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2432.55,2439.471,So tell me -- they gave the hypothetical of the police pointing out the defendant out the window.
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,2465.269,2468.121,You would look at the totality of the circumstances.
2011.10-8974,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2476.227,2478.429,We are now -- we are now at mens rea again.
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,2520.423,2525.141,"--And I -- and, Justice Sotomayor, I'm not trying to create that complication."
2011.10-8974,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2567.301,2575.323,"Well, what's happened is that your briefing and your counter's briefing is broader than I think needs to be on the facts of this case."
2011.10-8974,1,35696,michael_delaney,,2596.054,2596.637,Yes.
2011.10-8974,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2640.116,2640.85,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2656.425,2660.079,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-8974,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2688.146,2696.466,"So do you mean to say, Miss Saharsky, that there can never be a due process violation from the admission of unreliable evidence?"
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2710.457,2712.491,I'm saying that's where the Court's cases are now.
2011.10-8974,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2766.923,2768.542,I'll give you an extreme example.
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2776.296,2778.212,That is an extreme example.
2011.10-8974,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2831.864,2832.549,It is interesting.
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2847.106,2847.692,Yes.
2011.10-8974,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2848.775,2850.042,Lurid photos or something like that.
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2850.042,2856.764,"--I mean, there you have, first of all, a separate constitutional provision of an impartial jury, and have you a direct influence upon the jury."
2011.10-8974,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2880.946,2888.469,"I think there were some early cases when fingerprint testimony couldn't come in, when fingerprint technology was just new."
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2891.421,2892.687,--I can't say.
2011.10-8974,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2928.51,2932.545,I was intrigued by what your brief said about Federal Rule of Evidence 403.
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2946.222,2954.828,"Well, I mean you would need to meet the standard of Rule 403 which is that the -- the probative value of the witness would be substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice."
2011.10-8974,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2971.087,2972.705,But you think in theory that could be done?
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2991.417,2995.136,"--Well, I mean Rule 403 isn't talking about whether evidence is true or false."
2011.10-8974,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3049.853,3053.155,Was -- was the Daubert case our expert witness case where you have to have a threshold showing?
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3057.257,3060.392,"Yes, it was just interpreting rule of evidence 70 -- 702."
2011.10-8974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3072.3,3072.633,"Well, we--"
2011.10-8974,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3072.633,3076.585,--that already follow your adversary rules.
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3087.893,3092.195,"--It is not many, but the principle the Petitioner is arguing for is a significant one."
2011.10-8974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3109.156,3115.626,"--Well, suppose the -- lie detectors, for example, that's been taken away from the jury on a categorical basis, right?"
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3115.626,3129.636,"--Well, there are some State rules of evidence that do that, but I mean, we are talking about as a matter of due process that it is fundamentally unfair at trial to not allow -- this -- to -- this evidence if given to the trial would be fundamentally unfair."
2011.10-8974,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3146.847,3151.233,"There surely is some minimal due process requirement for the admission of evidence, isn't there?"
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3162.691,3168.945,"Well, I think that there would initially be a problem with respect to the Confrontation Clause and the court would probably go through the analysis that way."
2011.10-8974,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3170.463,3171.613,Let me give -- you're right.
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3179.568,3181.018,--Right.
2011.10-8974,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3193.876,3195.495,Is tea leaf reading okay?
2011.10-8974,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3195.495,3198.53,--What I'm saying is the Court doesn't need to address that question here.
2011.10-8974,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3248.88,3250.363,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-8974,3,39386,richard_guerriero,,3252.849,3255.867,I will try to make three points in those 2 minutes.
2011.10-8974,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3330.682,3331.832,Tell that to the jury.
2011.10-8974,3,39386,richard_guerriero,,3339.02,3358.518,"The problem is that the witnesses who have -- are under the suggestive influence actually believed what they are testifying to, and the -- that's why the Court said in Wade cross-examination for this one kind of evidence -- not floodgates, but this one kind of evidence, cross-examination may not always be enough."
2011.10-8974,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3404.83,3405.915,"Thank you, counsel."
