1996.95-1649,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.649,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1649, Kansas v. Leroy Hendricks, and 95-9075, Leroy Hendricks v. Kansas."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,13.811,16.234,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1649,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.075,105.195,"General Stovall, may I ask you whether... how you fit this kind of a law into any situation with which we have previously dealt?"
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,108.046,110.577,Only insofar as that we have--
1996.95-1649,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.577,111.248,--confinement.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,111.248,115.002,"--treated subsequent to punishment, Your Honor, instead of treatment in lieu of sentencing."
1996.95-1649,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,115.002,124.017,"How would this be cabined in the future, do you think, if we uphold it?"
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,139.908,147.394,"I think, Justice O'Connor, as long as the State could show that there's a medical justification for a diagnosis and that we can show dangerousness--"
1996.95-1649,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.394,154.801,"Not of mental illness, but of some kind of mental aberration or personality disorder."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,154.801,178.654,"--Well, the term mental illness is one that this Court has certainly used in its decisions but never defined and, in fact, in Addington, where the language of mental illness was used, the Court also used mental disorder, mental disease, emotional disorder, emotional disturbance, almost synonymously and interchangeably, and so I would submit the mental abnormality that Kansas has in our statute is not different from those things that you have previously approved."
1996.95-1649,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,178.654,192.125,"Well, General Stovall, don't you think in using those terms in our opinions we are certainly lay people from a medical point of view, and they probably are not used in any strict medical sense."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,192.125,217.14,"And I'm a lay person in that regard, too, Your Honor, but when you look, Mr. Chief Justice, at the DSM, where we... where the psychiatric profession describes particular kinds of condition, the things that the medical community tends to understand would fit within this definition would be two paraphilias, which are pedophilia and sexual sadism, which are terms that have been recognized by the community and still would fit within this definition."
1996.95-1649,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,217.14,228.937,"General Stovall, can I clarify that you are not trying to... you're not suggesting that this Court ought to establish some kind of national standard for what is mental illness or mental abnormality."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,231.601,242.91,"Justice Ginsburg, that's exactly right, and that's what the State of Kansas would ask us... ask you to do, so long as we still have a mental justification, a medical justification for commitment and we show dangerousness."
1996.95-1649,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,242.91,256.216,"Well, I take it that even the DSM says that these categories have no real operational consistency, and that you look to the diagnosis or the prognosis on a case-by-case basis after clinical evaluation."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,256.216,272.46,"That's true, Justice Kennedy, and in fact the DSM in the beginning of the introduction part says that this was not created for legal use or for forensic meaning, but it's to aid the psychiatric profession in making some diagnosis that they then can apply to this definition in the Kansas statute of mental abnormality."
1996.95-1649,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,272.46,281.286,"You begin by saying, and this was part of Justice O'Connor's line of questioning, too, that this is a hybrid between a criminal statute and a civil statute."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,285.196,285.806,It's a hybrid... I'm sorry.
1996.95-1649,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,291.79,300.997,"--Yes, and I was going to say it seems to me that your argument in your brief at least is one in which you can justify this statute strictly as a civil commitment."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,314.437,315.676,Yes.
1996.95-1649,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,334.719,339.101,And also that there's no difference in this man than there was the day he went into prison.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,354.011,380.009,"Justice Ginsburg, that would be true for Leroy Hendricks, who certainly is the respondent here, but Kansas in our prison system has the ability and, in fact, requires inmates that are convicted of sex offenses to go through treatment, so they do have the ability while receiving treatment in prison to shed themselves not of the diagnosis of pedophilia, for example, but of the later part of the definition, which is being likely to continue to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence, because they've gone through treatment."
1996.95-1649,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.983,394.223,"Well, I--"
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,417.549,421.699,"--There are many studies that were cited in our brief, Justice Kennedy."
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.176,447.188,Is 8 percent high enough?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,457.366,460.538,"--Justice Scalia, that would be a question for the judge and jury to decide."
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.7,464.621,"Well, what do you tell the jury, you know?"
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,474.358,481.755,The jury instructions in Kansas just simply ask them to find whether or not he is likely to continue to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence.
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.774,483.054,Likely.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,486.626,490.389,"--I would be willing to assert that it's 51 percent, Justice Scalia, and the testimony at the trial--"
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.389,491.22,That's pretty generous.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,495.895,510.724,"--There has been no determination as to what percent that is, and we don't give that guidance to the jury in Kansas, but Dr. Befort, who testified at the sex predator trial, testified in his view that... he was saying that Mr. Hendricks would reoffend within a 51-percent chance."
1996.95-1649,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,510.724,516.048,"Well, you don't define reasonable doubt in criminal cases in terms of 15 percent, or 12 percent."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,518.578,523.594,"That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, and we don't give any more of that decision within our statute as well, but--"
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.594,526.396,And what if it's clear that treatment will not be effective?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,535.712,541.876,"--What Kansas has done is to provide for treatment, and I think that's all that we have to do, and not show that Mr. Hendricks, for example--"
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.876,544.538,Even when treatment is ineffective.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,550.304,551.185,"--Let me clarify, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.427,553.348,For the particular person.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,560.652,566.185,"--I think in that case we still have the ability to commit an individual, because we're providing for the treatment."
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.857,568.248,"Well, the Court--"
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,570.619,572.319,--But we don't... I don't know that we--
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.319,580.335,"I mean, I can understand your position we can commit him, treatment or not, just because he's dangerous, you know, and we can commit him and not even provide any treatment."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,591.003,599.34,"--The Court has never required, in my understanding, for a State to be able to show that a cure is guaranteed for somebody or that they will necessarily benefit from it, and so--"
1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,599.34,605.973,"But that's not necessarily this case, I take it, because you're at least claiming that this man is treatable to some degree."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,611.549,612.318,"--Absolutely, Justice Souter."
1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,612.318,631.661,"Now... so that in the challenge that we've got before us we would not, in order to hold your way, have to go beyond saying, I suppose, that this was mental illness within the meaning of the term as we used it in Foucha, because of two things."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,652.986,657.517,As long as we show dangerousness as well.
1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,657.517,658.058,So far as the mental illness category... yes.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,658.459,659.277,"I mean, I think we have that obligation as well."
1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,659.277,678.612,"So we could... if we ruled your way we could leave for another day the question of what to do under, we'll say, the Foucha rule, in a case in which there was a recognized psychiatric category of abnormality but one that was totally untreatable, one that was permanent."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,679.764,681.476,I would agree with that.
1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,681.476,684.747,So you don't have to have as broad a rule as you were speaking--
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,695.975,704.372,"Justice O'Connor, what the Kansas supreme court did was look at one prior district court ruling in the... a motion for a new trial which found that there was treatment."
1996.95-1649,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,718.412,719.774,"Well, could you just answer the question?"
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,719.774,719.954,I'm sorry.
1996.95-1649,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,719.954,722.395,Is Kansas providing any treatment for these people?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,722.395,722.625,"Absolutely, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1649,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,722.826,725.867,"And what kind of treatment, other than locking them up in a special ward?"
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,725.867,728.03,--Cognitive behavioral-based treatment.
1996.95-1649,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,728.03,728.44,What is that?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,729.941,732.765,"It didn't to me in the beginning of this case either, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1649,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,745.702,746.894,What kind of treatment is that?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,754.821,772.623,"--Part of it does have to do with stopping those thinking patterns, helping them identify, for one thing, what their thinking patterns are that are maladaptive and not like the rest of us, and then how to stop the behavior, how to stop the thinking patterns from leading directly into that behavior, and there is certainly some level of behavior modification in the program."
1996.95-1649,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,788.823,789.254,General Stovall--
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,795.501,797.382,--But the--
1996.95-1649,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,797.382,800.734,"I mean... you know, correct me if that's wrong."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,800.734,807.319,"--The definition of mental abnormality in our Kansas statute is that it is a congenital or an acquired condition, and that--"
1996.95-1649,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,807.319,808.812,But that's not cognitive.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,808.812,810.521,"--You're correct, Justice O... Justice Kennedy."
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,831.774,835.908,May I ask you a question about this statute and what the State's position is?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,865.707,866.949,"I think so, Justice Stevens."
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.729,876.205,So really the prior convictions are merely the evidentiary support under the statute for the finding that it's more likely than not that this person will be violent.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,876.205,881.31,"--It's somewhat evidence of that, as well as it's a limiting of Kansas' decision who to commit."
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.003,883.413,But why not?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,884.335,888.979,"--Oh, constitutionally I think that we could, but the legislature chose to very narrowly define--"
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,888.979,891.381,"Only those who have previously been punished, or ones who would be--"
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,891.381,896.443,--Because the idea is that we're trying to identify those that pose the greatest risk to the community.
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.443,903.478,"--But I don't understand why a person who's indicted on very strong evidence, probable cause, shouldn't be subjected to exactly the same treatment."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,903.478,907.211,"There are certainly those that would argue, Justice Stevens, that we should have more expanded the law--"
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.211,907.452,Yes.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,907.452,910.644,"--to include more people in it, but that's not what the legislature chose to do, though."
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,910.644,913.887,You agree that it is a preponderance standard that's determinative here.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,918.351,921.954,"More likely than not about the dangerousness, but the State has a beyond a reasonable doubt--"
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.954,924.758,"Oh, beyond a reasonable doubt of proving that he's likely to do it."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,924.758,925.266,--Exactly.
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.266,927.509,"Which boils down to a preponderance standard, of course."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,938.667,947.732,I think this Court has... as I read decisions of the Court has never been extremely clear as to whether or not treatment is absolutely required.
1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,952.326,952.586,"Well, it's--"
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,952.586,953.067,I think it's--
1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,953.067,954.018,--I'm sorry.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,995.969,1007.108,"--And Mr. Hendricks' certainly would have the ability to file a habeas action in either State or Federal court challenging that if he were not getting any sort of treatment at all, or if he was unable to be released without... for that reason."
1996.95-1649,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1007.108,1007.338,Yes.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1033.279,1034.608,"Well, it is for us."
1996.95-1649,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1038.323,1042.165,I'm talking about the general rule.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1042.165,1060.639,"--I think that that's correct, that that's... the decisions have indicated by some justices that there need to be some level of treatment and others have sort of left the door open, but from Kansas' standpoint it's an easier call because we clearly do provide treatment."
1996.95-1649,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1060.639,1066.492,"General Stovall, will you be devoting some of your oral argument to a response to the cross-petitioner's claims?"
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1066.492,1068.993,"If I have the opportunity to do that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1649,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1068.993,1069.183,Yes.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1086.197,1094.663,"It is somewhat, although for the last 60 years States have been dealing with a way to be able to civilly detain sex offenders in particular."
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.74,1122.33,When you say--
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1131.056,1135.7,I think clear and convincing would be sufficient from a constitutional perspective.
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.7,1136.471,"But, see, you don't provide that."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1146.427,1150.681,"But only one of the elements, though, of the definition would be likely to--"
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1150.681,1154.865,"Well, the fact that likely do the... commit the harm to the... to children."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1154.865,1159.49,"--Right, and the other is the mental abnormality, and taken in totality we have beyond a reasonable doubt to show that."
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.49,1162.422,But a key element doesn't require beyond a reasonable doubt.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1167.929,1172.593,"Well, I still think overall the State has to be able to sustain that burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1172.593,1177.186,"It has to prove that it's likely beyond a reasonable doubt, but that's... you can't... you know--"
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1177.186,1178.958,I think even if you--
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.958,1179.619,--That's still 51 percent.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1190.804,1191.265,--Medically justified.
1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1191.265,1191.876,Medically justified.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1200.293,1210.129,"I don't think we are limited, Justice Souter, just to the DSM, but I think certainly the psychiatric community has to believe that this is a condition that they can identify and diagnose, but it would not--"
1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1210.129,1222.527,"You don't take the position that the... or maybe you do, that the legislature of any State could say, we recognize a category of mental abnormality or mental illness."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1235.606,1236.447,--That would not be the argument the State would make.
1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1240.621,1245.953,What is the function of this medical recognition as you understand it under Foucha?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1262.095,1270.002,I think so that the Court doesn't worry that we confine merely for dangerousness or merely for a class of people that we don't want to be around.
1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1275.448,1280.72,It's less likely to be abused if there's a categorical approach rather than a purely individual approach.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1280.72,1281.281,--That would be correct.
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1281.281,1289.236,Do you know of any medically recognized condition that has been medically determined to be nontreatable?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1297.301,1299.444,Not that I'm aware of.
1996.95-1649,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.06,1379.755,Hadn't a similar situation applied to Hendricks at one stage?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1388.764,1390.276,Justice O'Connor... I'm sorry.
1996.95-1649,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1398.143,1400.303,But that was a civil commitment?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1400.303,1401.044,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1649,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1401.044,1405.276,But not under this current statute that was under some--

1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1565.573,1575.719,"Because one of the requirements in our definition is that the individual go to a secure facility, a securely confined facility, so that would be similar to the hospitalization."
1996.95-1649,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1575.719,1577.451,"No, I'm not worried about the part."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1577.451,1579.272,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1996.95-1649,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1579.272,1591.229,"I'm worried about how, by clear and convincing evidence, to show that he is dangerous to others, because what I thought you said is in Kansas you don't have to show this by clear and convincing evidence."

1996.95-1649,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1602.556,1603.768,Suppose we disagree with you.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1611.945,1624.583,"--The Addington decision clearly talked about, for civil commitment you had to show it by clear and convincing."
1996.95-1649,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1631.911,1632.141,Both.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1632.862,1648.293,"Right, and we clearly do that in terms of the mental abnormality, and I understand that's where the issue is for the Court, but you still have to show the likelihood of committing that harm is beyond a reasonable doubt, and so it's showing a 51-percent burden by an 80-percent burden--"
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.293,1650.296,What did we mean by dangerousness in that case?
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1657.321,1657.962,--Yes.
1996.95-1649,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.962,1662.166,"--which would have converted that into a preponderance standard as well, if you follow that reasoning."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1662.166,1664.147,"That would be exactly right, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1649,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.147,1665.627,"That's not what the opinion says, if you read it carefully."

1996.95-1649,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1696.1,1696.31,Yes.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1696.31,1698.603,"--made that final determination, and that's not part of their decision."
1996.95-1649,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1698.603,1698.813,That's not in their opinion.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1698.813,1699.842,They relied just on--
1996.95-1649,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1699.842,1702.665,"Could I ask you another question, assuming this is not an obstacle."
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1740.061,1745.884,--One of the distinctions is the level of personality disorder that is there.
1996.95-1649,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1745.884,1747.656,Go ahead and answer the question.
1996.95-1649,0,20082,carla_j_stovall,,1747.656,1759.025,"The indication in the Foucha decision, for example, was that simply a personality disorder might not be enough for commitment, and that's clearly not what the State has in this condition."
1996.95-1649,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.521,1770.164,"Thank you, General Stovall."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,1773.216,1781.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1649,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1842.35,1856.911,"Well, didn't the Court in Baxstrom uphold essentially the notion that the State could commit people after they were released from prison in a civil commitment proceeding?"
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,1856.911,1861.225,I believe the Court upheld that they could commit after a... pardon me.
1996.95-1649,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1864.457,1875.035,"Yes, and we have left largely to the States to define what constitutes a mental illness within that framework."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,1875.035,1877.236,"That is correct, however--"
1996.95-1649,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1877.236,1886.683,"And so maybe this boils down to whether this particular condition of pedophilia, or however you pronounce it, qualifies."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,1886.683,1903.803,"--Your Honor, I don't believe that the constitutional standard for mental illness can be the equivalent of any diagnosis that might come out of the DSM, and that is essentially what the State, I believe, is trying to argue."
1996.95-1649,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1903.803,1918.655,"Well, let's talk about this specific condition of pedophilia and whether that is open to the State to include within the broad concept of some kind of mental illness."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,1918.655,1924.567,"Pedophilia, as I understand it, is diagnosed based upon prior commission of criminal acts."
1996.95-1649,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1945.222,1953.74,"This Court has suggested that may not be so, but is this a different kind of category of mental aberration?"
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,1953.74,1956.772,--Pedophilia as opposed to any other of the DSM--
1996.95-1649,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.772,1961.246,As opposed to a tendency to have an antisocial personality.
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,1961.246,1967.53,--I don't believe there's anything that I have read which would indicate that it is any different than an antisocial personality.
1996.95-1649,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1967.53,1976.556,"Well, suppose you had a paranoid schizophrenia acute type, and the diagnosis was that the person was dangerous to himself and to others, could you commit there?"
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,1976.556,1996.681,"That would be acceptable under the normal civil commitment statute, Your Honor, where the commitment is based upon the inability of the person to take care of themselves and make rational decisions about their treatment, and then because the commitment is for the person's own good, he can be civilly committed."
1996.95-1649,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1996.681,2003.307,"Well, rationality is not a part of the civil commitment preconditions."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2003.307,2006.799,"Generally, in--"
1996.95-1649,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2006.799,2011.623,Why is it that you can commit the paranoid schizophrenic and not this person?
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2011.623,2013.275,--Because the treat... pardon me.
1996.95-1649,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2018.55,2024.376,"But suppose the condition, the condition for his incarceration was he was dangerous to others?"
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2024.376,2035.383,--I don't believe that a paranoid schizophrenic could be committed unless there was first a finding that the commitment would be for his own good.
1996.95-1649,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.766,2058.409,"Well, the supreme court of Kansas, Mr. Weilert, in its opinion, which upheld your... the majority upheld your point of view, said the State could get around... could handle it by simply imposing a life sentence on these people and there would be no constitutional problem."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2069.438,2076.952,"Your Honor, it is a decision that the State can make under its criminal... or, criminal powers."
1996.95-1649,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2108.584,2109.583,Why is all that okay?
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2116.818,2122.421,The restrictions that I spoke of as far as parole or conditional release in this case--
1996.95-1649,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.421,2124.364,It's a restriction of his physical liberty.
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2124.364,2134.63,"--It's a restriction of his liberty, but it's not a confinement that is a massive curtailment of that liberty, and I believe that's the distinction, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1649,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2134.63,2158.726,"But life imprisonment certainly would be, and one of the arguments that the State makes is, we're doing something gentler and kinder here, that instead of locking him up in a maximum security prison for the rest of his life, we say there's a criminal sentence and maybe... there's not much chance of it, but maybe he'll be all right at the end of the term."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2174.917,2180.61,"The Constitution does not force that, the most harsh remedy."
1996.95-1649,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.294,2220.348,Maybe the State has to take the harsher course because the harsher course is the only one that is less manipulable.
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2220.348,2221.75,I believe that--
1996.95-1649,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.75,2228.456,"I mean, isn't there some fear about... you know, totalitarian regimes don't put people in jail for crimes."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2235.664,2239.727,"--I believe that is a very astute observation, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1649,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.727,2245.989,"And so mainly to... perhaps to protect against that, the State, if it wants to protect itself, has to take the harsher course."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2245.989,2251.953,"It is certainly the... or, pardon me, an avenue open to the State to do it that way."
1996.95-1649,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2265.463,2274.27,"But surely that would be manipulable, too, if that is to be part of the test, if the parole authorities are to have that sort of discretion."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2274.27,2292.701,"Well, certainly the parole authorities would have to have some discretion, but it would be... it would not be manipulative in the same way that the States could formulate a plan to commit persons based solely upon dangerousness, which we believe this act provides that opportunity."
1996.95-1649,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2292.701,2303.458,What's the... your best authority from this Court for the proposition that you can only have a civil commitment for the best interests of the person and not for the safety of society?
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2303.458,2318.649,"It is... in Addington v. Texas the Court basically said the commitment is for those who cannot take care of themselves, and that is where the being in the best interests of the person comes from."
1996.95-1649,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2319.72,2332.557,"What is the rationale... if that is the correct reading of Addington, what is the explanation for it, that everyone has a constitutional right to commit a crime once before he can be committed?"
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2332.557,2337.031,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe anyone has a constitutional right to commit a crime."
1996.95-1649,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2337.532,2339.124,Before he can be committed civilly.
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2339.124,2354.354,"--It would not require the commission of a crime to be committed civilly, but it would require the finding of a mental disease or mental illness and the finding of dangerousness both by--"
1996.95-1649,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2354.354,2360.278,"No, but you say he can only be committed if it's for his own good, if we're talking about civil commitment."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2360.278,2364.349,--I believe that that is the underlying basis for civil commitment.
1996.95-1649,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2364.349,2368.863,"No, I thought Addington said dangerous to others, didn't it, as well as dangerous to himself?"
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2368.863,2382.471,"It does say that it is dangerous to himself or others, and that is in conjunction with the need that... or, pardon me, in conjunction with the fact that he is unable to care for himself and needs commitment."
1996.95-1649,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2382.471,2388.166,But Addington was just talking about the burden of proof when you're going ahead with civil commitment.
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2395.292,2413.774,"While Addington was a procedural due process case, I believe the concept that a civil commitment has to be based upon dangerousness and mental illness was carried into fruition by this Court in Foucha v. Louisiana."
1996.95-1649,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2448.816,2482.057,"Mr. Weilert, are you complaining just about timing, and suppose Mr. Hendricks is charged, indicted, found guilty, and then instead of having the ordinary criminal incarceration, at that point we have this SVP proceeding, and so although he has a criminal conviction he's never... the time that he served has been pursuant to this special proceeding."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2484.22,2508.878,"--That's the situation in Colorado v. Specht, or Specht v. Colorado, where the Court approved that type of situation, where instead of a specific term of criminal incarceration it allowed for an indeterminate term and found that it was, in fact, a criminal incarceration even though it was for the purpose of incapacitation rather than retribution."
1996.95-1649,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2508.878,2512.47,But that raised... that... correct me if I'm wrong.
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2515.873,2539.709,"That was a procedural claim, Your Honor, where there was not a hearing for that second sentencing procedure, but that would be an appropriate type... Kansas could make the decision at the time of the original conviction to go to a sexual psychopath type law, much as it could have done back in 1984 when Kansas did have such a law in effect."
1996.95-1649,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2539.709,2545.786,"So you're saying that they could have done it on the spot, but they can't do it 5 years later."
1996.95-1649,1,43480,thomas_j_weilert,,2546.377,2561.638,"--It's now 12 years later, Your Honor, and the reason they can't do it now is because first of all it is a continue... a second incarceration for the same conviction, the same criminal act that he committed back in 1984."
