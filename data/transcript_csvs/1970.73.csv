1970.73,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.808,"We'll hear arguments in number 73, Phillips against Martin Marietta Corporation and Mr. Robinson you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1970.73,0,45962,william_l_robinson,,13.808,17.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1657.643,1661.997,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1970.73,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1705.792,1707.077,At what page is this?
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1707.077,1719.895,"Well, we stated it both on pages 2 and 3, and again on page 4, but we are informed by counsel for the parties that no such petition was filed."
1970.73,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1736.855,1739.782,"That's the common practice in all the Circuits, is it not?"
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1739.782,1757.888,"To my knowledge, but there is a specific rule about it in the Fifth Circuit, and the denial of the rehearing en banc, you will note in the record that denial begins with the statement on page 42 A of the record."
1970.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1832.925,1834.62,What is that --
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1834.62,1844.186,"That is to be trained to work on the assembly lines, as far as I know the record doesn’t specify what the job is, they keep referring to it as assembly trainee."
1970.73,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1844.186,1849.272,What do they assemble in Martin Marietta?
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1849.272,1853.3,"The record doesn’t -- I am sure counsel for Martin Marietta could tell you, I mean record doesn't --"
1970.73,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1853.3,1857.923,The record shows that 75-80% of assembly trainees are women.
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1857.923,1866.519,"That is correct, there is a affidavit, that is un-contradicted that 75 to 80% of them are women."
1970.73,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1866.519,1866.94,Right.
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1866.94,1888.159,"And that a higher percentage of women than of men who apply are hired for the job and that is essentially all the record there was, other than the complaint and the answer and the district judge's assumption that Martin Marietta did hire men with pre-school aged children for this job."
1970.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1922.636,1925.215,Did any company have any women employed in it?
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1925.215,1930.333,"It certainly does, in fact most of the people employed in this job are women."
1970.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1930.333,1933.738,And yet they refused to hire these because they are women?
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1933.738,1942.401,"Because they have -- because their women with pre-school aged children, because they have little children, they won’t hire any women with little children."
1970.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1942.401,1944.171,That’s the only issue then?
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1944.171,1953.221,"The only issue is whether they can hire men with little children, but refuse to hire women with little children."
1970.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1977.11,1989.238,"Is it contended and I heard somebody use the word rational, that a decision of that guy not to employ women, who have children in pre-school age, is irrational?"
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1989.238,1992.866,"We don’t contend that it is irrational, we contend that it’s illegal."
1970.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1994.257,2000.997,"Somebody used the word, I was trying to get it (Inaudible) that connection."
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2000.997,2008.346,Many things that are illegal may not be irrational.
1970.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2158.757,2160.451,Do they have male stewards or --
1970.73,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2160.451,2169.738,"They have both male stewards and female stewardesses, and when they get married, the women are fired but the men are allowed to continue in their jobs."
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3105.415,3109.635,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3399.279,3412.227,Would you want us to decide this case on assumption that perhaps Martin Marietta hires -- refuses to hire men with preschool age children?
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3412.227,3436.206,"We think, Your Honor, that the record in this case does not show that it did not and it does not show that it treated women with preschool age children any differently than it treated men with preschool age children and that there was nothing in the record before the District Court for to enable him to rule otherwise than as the way he did."
1970.73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3436.206,3441.79,Do you deny that what the receptionist said to (Inaudible)
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3441.79,3451.86,"We have admitted Mr. Justice Marshall, in our answer that the receptionist made the statement that was alleged."
1970.73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3529.216,3530.661,Has there any change in the policy?
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3530.661,3534.2,"No, sir the policy was exactly the same at that time."
1970.73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3534.2,3537.351,Why did the receptionist say what she did?
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3539.352,3542.48,There is no explanation in the record for that Your Honor.
1970.73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3542.48,3564.693,"Well, would it be clear that to assume that when the receptionist said we don't hire women with preschool age children, in preference to saying we don't hire people with preschool children that she meant women, is that a correct assumption?"
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3564.693,3578.591,"We think, Your Honor, that it was a perfectly natural thing for the receptionist in talking to a woman, not to say we don't hire men or women with preschool age children, but simply to say, we don't hire woman."
1970.73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3600.87,3606.524,Do you say now that you don't know whether that was the policy at that time?
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3606.524,3620.736,"I know that it was not the policy to decline, to refuse to hire women or men with pre-school-age children and the decision of the EEOC so reflects even though it has no evidence of value of course."
1970.73,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3620.736,3621.925,And that's true now?
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3621.925,3623.525,"And that is true now, yes sir."
1970.73,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3623.525,3642.582,"But quite apart from policy, if this applicant was in fact, not considered for employment, because she was a woman with pre-school children, then there was a violation of the act, wasn't there?"
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3642.938,3644.867,I would say -- I understand --
1970.73,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3644.867,3660.801,"-- somebody the company just didn't know, didn't get the word or misunderstood what the policy was, and if this woman, in fact, was denied consideration as an employee on that ground, then there was a violation of the equal rights, wasn't there?"
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3660.801,3674.841,"We pointed in our brief, Mr. Justice, that the record, the skimpiness of which we must accept a degree of responsibility for --"
1970.73,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3674.841,3676.263,Because your motion for summary judgment?
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3676.263,3679.912,As advocates we were -- we filed a motion and we won it.
1970.73,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3738.692,3779.419,"So then do I understand that you, what you agree that if regardless of all these good faith efforts and if -- and regardless of what the company's policy was, if regardless of both of all of those things, if this woman, in fact, was -- if her application was to refused consideration because she was a woman with pre-school-age children at a time when the company was hiring men with pre-school-age children, then her individual rights were violated under the act, you concede that or don't you?"
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3779.419,3783.46,"Well, not Your Honor, unless --"
1970.73,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3783.46,3789.57,Because understood you say that you virtually concede that the rationale of the Court of Appeals was in error?
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3789.57,3805.266,"Not unless if it were considered, if it were a -- shall we say per se violation and unfortunately the case became confused in that framework at a point."
1970.73,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3872.897,3894.105,"Only under the statute -- well, then I would infer perhaps for some tactical reason you want to -- probably agree with me and I don't except you to, but by the inference I gather from your argument is that you pretty well agree with your advisory that this judgment ought to be set aside and the case remanded for a trial on the merits?"
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3894.105,3899.691,We thank Your Honor that of course is one way to develop -- that is a way to develop a fuller record.
1970.73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3943.983,3960.52,Are you saying that we have got to view this record just as though it had evidence or allegations that men who had pre-school-age children with no mother at home to take care of them.
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,3972.028,3983.147,"First of all Mr. Chief Justice I wouldn't presume to tell this court what it must view this case, but I am certain that I am understand --"
1970.73,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3983.147,4000.487,"Well, you make an argument that there is no showing on this record, this admittedly limited record that men were not treated the same way if they had custodial care of children at home."
1970.73,2,21556,donald_t_senterfitt,,4009.199,4039.597,"We would say Your Honor that the fact that it does not as such, and there is no affirmative showing in the record that there was any difference in the treatment simply to say that we are not going to hire pre-school-age children or women with pre-school-age children without being coupled with a comparison of the treatment of men similarly situated."
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4582.739,4583.326,Thank you sir.
1970.73,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4678.425,4685.947,You concede of course that Martin Marietta is not discriminating against women on this record?
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4685.947,4686.656,Yes sir.
1970.73,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4721.772,4740.324,Do you agree that (Inaudible)?
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4740.324,4744.582,"Yes, under an appropriate pronouncement of the law by this Court."
1970.73,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4744.582,4748.412,(Inaudible)
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4748.412,4751.386,I don't either.[Laughter]
1970.73,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4751.386,4754.666,[Inaudible].
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4754.666,4756.197,"Well, Your Honor on this record --"
1970.73,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4756.197,4761.395,[Inaudible].
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4761.395,4762.167,"Well, Your Honor, no."
1970.73,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4762.167,4763.306,[Inaudible].
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4763.306,4777.478,"You know that in deciding this case the District Court specifically excepted the fact or assumed the fact, he assumed it, it was not a fact."
1970.73,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4784.97,4788.469,On what basis that was (Inaudible)?
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4788.469,4801.341,The basis of his assumption was his belief the law didn't prohibit an employer from the differencing between men with pre-school-age children and women with pre-school-age children and that's what squarely puts the issue Your Honor.
1970.73,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4808.239,4827.732,"Now you are suggesting Mr. Robinson that, it wouldn't be enough as a defense for the employer had to show statistical data indicating significantly higher absentee rate or accident rate for women with pre-school-age children as distinguished from other men and women?"
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4827.732,4829.9,With pre-school-age children unless --
1970.73,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4829.9,4833.607,"Or particularly as distinguished from men with pre-school-age children, I suppose?"
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4833.607,4845.169,"Yes, particularly, that is the comparison, unless the company can also show that the normal operation of their business prohibits them from absorbing that rate of absenteeism."
1970.73,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4850.513,4861.071,It has a significant impact on a business operation such as that an assembly line operation is significantly hurt by absenteeism or something else?
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4861.071,4870.71,"Not just significant hurt, it can no longer be normally operated, that's the narrow way that Congress intended this exemption to be applied."
1970.73,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4870.71,4873.436,"That's rather collateral to the basic issue in this case, isn't it?"
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4873.436,4873.916,It is.
1970.73,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4873.916,4883.087,As I understand it all you are asking is the case be referred (Inaudible) rendering summary judgment in this case?
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4883.087,4887.838,"Of granting the motion to strike and summary judgment, yes sir."
1970.73,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4887.838,4898.487,"Mr. Robinson I suppose as practical matter if this case goes back, would it be your guess it will developed on the proviso or exception on the statute?"
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4898.487,4901.063,I don't know Your Honor.
1970.73,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4920.496,4934.888,"Really I think there has been intimations to contrary though and my guess is that if it goes back, good lawyers will try to zero in on that and we will have an entirely different case when it comes back here.[Laughter]"
1970.73,3,45962,william_l_robinson,,4934.888,4936.38,"Yes sir, thank you."
1970.73,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4936.38,4937.371,Thank you Mr. Robinson.
