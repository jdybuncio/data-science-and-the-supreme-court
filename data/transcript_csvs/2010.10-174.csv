2010.10-174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.987,"We'll hear argument today in Case 10-174, American Electric Power Company v. Connecticut, et al.--"
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,9.272,11.589,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2010.10-174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,79.083,80.285,I think that's--
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,80.285,80.868,"Now, all of these issues--"
2010.10-174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,80.868,83.57,--That's exactly one thing that's concerned me.
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,100.449,100.782,--Well--
2010.10-174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,100.782,106.067,"In either case, your argument is that this is too generalized for the Court to -- to address."
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,106.067,109.554,"--Mr. Chief Justice, our principal argument has not been prudential standing."
2010.10-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.205,142.109,"Mr. Keisler, what -- what good does it do you to have this Court say that there is no Article III standing?"
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,144.644,145.81,Well--
2010.10-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,145.81,151.214,--under State common law and -- and the States' rules of standing are not ours.
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,151.214,156.25,"--Well, many States, Your Honor, have similar doctrines of standing, similar doctrines of political questions."
2010.10-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.25,157.118,They only need one.
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,157.118,165.022,"Well, in any event, Your Honor, we believe we would have a very strong motion to dismiss in State court on a variety of grounds, including--"
2010.10-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,165.022,166.058,"We're not sure about that, are we?"
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,168.843,170.026,"--Well, I don't--"
2010.10-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.026,178.282,"Indeed, you know, tapping the case to State judges instead of Federal judges, I would frankly rather have Federal judges do it, probably."
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,178.282,195.493,"--Well, as I said, Your Honor, I think we would be able to defeat a State common law claim on grounds of State law, for lack of proximate cause, on standing and political question grounds that many States have that parallel these; but in any case, whichever ground the Court resolves this case on, we think it's clear that the cause of action can proceed."
2010.10-174,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,195.493,211.187,"Well, if -- if you had a State court suit with a State plaintiff, wouldn't the State be able to adduce Federal common law as a ground for recovery?"
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,215.372,219.693,"It's -- it's possible, Your Honor, although we think they would be more likely to proceed under State common law."
2010.10-174,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,228.898,233.452,"Well, we all -- we all know that you sometimes have to peek at the merits to see if there's standing."
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,245.26,254.449,But the Court has said in Warth v. Seldin that the plaintiff has to demonstrate that it will benefit in some tangible way from the Court's intervention.
2010.10-174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.865,264.805,"If you have -- if you have the precedent of Massachusetts v. EPA and if any one plaintiff has standing, I guess that's enough."
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,275.528,284.134,"--Justice Ginsburg, we believe that Massachusetts was very carefully qualified to focus on the particular regulatory context of that opinion."
2010.10-174,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,305.048,309.833,"Mr. Keisler, the Court did say that, but it's cut off from the Court's actual analysis in the case."
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,317.272,322.426,"But it does, Justice Kagan, specifically refer to the regulatory context in which the case is taking place."
2010.10-174,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,381.548,395.189,"But the Court clearly understood that in Massachusetts v. EPA and said that it was enough, and I would think under traditional standing principles the standing there was actually harder to find because one had to go through the EPA first."
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,408.199,413.234,"But there, Your Honor, they were suing a defendant, the EPA, that had regulatory authority over the entire country."
2010.10-174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,475.707,476.926,So how many States does it take?
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,486.949,498.423,"--It's not a question of the quantity of plaintiffs, Mr. Chief Justice, it's the nature of the task that the Court would have to perform, and this task is different because of the global nature of the phenomenon."
2010.10-174,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,498.423,504.577,I'm more receptive to this kind of argument if I know we're going to the merits as opposed to standing--
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,504.577,504.977,It -- it--
2010.10-174,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,504.977,509.731,"--and I recognize that we slip in and out of the two categories, and don't want to make it difficult on you."
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,515.884,520.288,"--Exactly, Your Honor, and whether the Court should expand the Federal common law to recognize this."
2010.10-174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,563.213,575.438,I thought your -- your first argument when you addressed this issue was there is a decisionmaker and that decisionmaker is EPA.
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,595.451,597.636,"We are making both arguments, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.10-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.442,647.069,"Well, the EPA is given authority to regulate other pollutants, including those that do not go up into the atmosphere, but that does not prevent California, for example, from enacting stricter standards for its -- for automobiles in its State."
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,647.069,647.486,"--Oh, and--"
2010.10-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.486,653.223,So why should we say the EPA preempts the Federal common law?
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,653.223,660.561,"--Because this issue, and I would prefer to refer to it as displacement rather than preemption, is very different from the question of preemption of State law."
2010.10-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.163,692.763,What's your best case?
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,692.763,694.929,Milwaukee v Illinois II.
2010.10-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.888,733.171,"This is a merits argument, right?"
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,733.171,738.875,"Yes, it is a merits argument, because it says that any Federal common law action would be displaced by the Clean Air Act."
2010.10-174,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,739.875,746.362,"Is the consequence of that argument, Mr. Keisler, that there in fact is no Federal common law of interstate pollution claims?"
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,746.362,757.837,"--I don't think there is very much left of any Federal common law of interstate pollution claims, just because the field has been so heavily occupied by statutes."
2010.10-174,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.596,776.548,"Of course, you're going to have to struggle with the preemption question sooner or later."
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,784.404,790.491,"It will ultimately depend on the state of the law at the time that such a hypothetical case is filed, but we would welcome the opportunity, Your Honor."
2010.10-174,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,790.491,796.878,"Is part of the inquiry, part of the dynamic, how imminent the Federal regulation is?"
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,796.878,798.997,"I don't think so, Justice Kennedy."
2010.10-174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,856.914,861.201,EPA couldn't give -- could EPA give that relief?
2010.10-174,0,38044,peter_d_keisler,,870.974,883.281,"We believe that the EPA can consider, as it's undertaking to do, regulating existing nonmodified sources under section 111 of the Clean Air Act, and that's the process that's engaged in now."
2010.10-174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,901.409,902.445,"Thank you, Mr. Keisler."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,915.669,918.287,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-174,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,949.926,952.628,"Well, again, that just goes to the merits."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,960.733,963.149,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think it goes to both."
2010.10-174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,988.884,992.419,I'll add a third thing that it goes to and that's Article III standing.
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1007.845,1013.749,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think that this case is best like Newdow, in which the Court went to prudential standing first before Article III."
2010.10-174,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1028.794,1037.984,"Well, I'll think about it, but Newdow was a case where we thought that this particular litigant was not directly injured."
2010.10-174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1041.435,1055.695,"More than that, Newdow was a case of a father trying to assert a right on behalf of a child, and the child herself did not want that right nor did her mother."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1079.143,1087.666,"Justice Ginsburg, we're not here saying that this case follows inexorably, inexorably from the facts of Newdow or, frankly, from any case that this Court has decided."
2010.10-174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1101.557,1111.246,"But it seems, General Katyal, that there also is no case where we've ever used this language of generalized grievance as a prudential matter rather than as an Article III matter."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1112.532,1121.47,"--Well, I think that this Court has in Newdow and in Warth v. Seldin used the language of generalized grievances to reflect prudential considerations."
2010.10-174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1121.47,1128.874,"But Newdow -- Newdow quoted the language of generalized grievance that came from Warth, but it didn't specifically pin anything on that language."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1128.874,1130.659,"I quite agree with you, Justice Kagan."
2010.10-174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1171.653,1187.663,"Well, General Katyal, how about the Aiken case, because in the Aiken case I think the government came in and made the same argument, that even though the injury was concrete, it was too generalized and therefore there should be no standing, the Court specifically rejected that argument both as to Article III and as to prudential standing."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1187.663,1196.352,"Right, and I think Aiken says that the prudential standing cases thus far have been about has concrete injury been shown to a particular person."
2010.10-174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1204.457,1210.195,To that extent you disagree with Mr. Keisler because he says there is no Article III?
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1210.195,1213.147,"--That is absolutely correct, we do disagree to that extent."
2010.10-174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1235.929,1239.715,"Counsel, you don't usually -- your phrase is exactly what bothers me."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1260.044,1274.054,"But I think that the prudential standing doctrine generally and the zone of interest test in particular really do focus on this question, Mr. Chief Justice, about whether or not a case can be cut down to judicially manageable standards."
2010.10-174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1274.054,1280.708,"I'll give that you on the zone of interests, but there you're dealing with administrative law and a very narrow proposition."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1298.586,1301.705,"I'll move to that and take your invitation, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.513,1330.224,"I don't understand why you assert that the remedy here will not provide the relief -- you acknowledge that, don't you, that the remedy here cannot possibly stop global warming, right?"
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1330.224,1338.411,"We acknowledge that the relief that they are seeking looks like the relief in Massachusetts v. EPA, which is that it would, if the Court--"
2010.10-174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.411,1338.83,It does?
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1349.186,1350.554,"--Justice Scalia, that isn't what the Court said."
2010.10-174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.633,1379.287,"Do you think -- do you think that was the holding of Massachusetts v. EPA, that EPA can only regulate the transportation section?"
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1379.287,1383.108,--That is what the Court based its redressability analysis on.
2010.10-174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1383.108,1390.179,Is that the holding of the case and -- and do you think the -- the -- the forthcoming EPA rules can only govern transportation?
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1390.179,1390.595,Of course not.
2010.10-174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.279,1391.762,Of course not.
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1393.131,1393.814,--But I am talking--
2010.10-174,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1393.814,1394.747,--what the EPA could do.
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1394.747,1395.116,--Right.
2010.10-174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1435.291,1439.695,At what point in this -- in what point in this cascade did the displacement occur?
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1439.695,1443.48,We think that the Court doesn't really need to get into it.
2010.10-174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1465.809,1471.13,"We don't know what EPA may do down the road, we don't know what Congress may do down the road."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1477.034,1477.551,Certainly--
2010.10-174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1477.551,1480.753,--be applied to the future course of conduct?
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1480.753,1485.557,"--Certainly, Justice Alito, I think it's appropriate for the Court to look at what has -- what is happening right now."
2010.10-174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1494.245,1498.697,"But, General Katyal, suppose that the EPA had decided not to issue the endangerment finding."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1500.149,1506.97,"I think that that would present a difficult case, because it would be the one like the Petitioners make, which is the Clean Air Act alone."
2010.10-174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1538.122,1541.24,"But if I insisted you answer the hypothetical I gave you, what would the answer be?"
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1543.676,1551.465,"I think that it's a -- it's a difficult case to make for -- for displacement, but I think it could be made, for the reasons Mr. Keisler suggests."
2010.10-174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1551.915,1556.417,"Why is it -- I don't want to make -- try to make a case for you, but why is it that much more difficult?"
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1572.593,1573.077,--Absolutely.
2010.10-174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1584.484,1588.436,I guess that would be a preemption question rather than -- rather than a displacement question.
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1588.436,1589.971,I think that very well may be.
2010.10-174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1642.523,1657.616,"I understand that that's not the issue here, but does the government have a position on that if -- if New York law provides exactly the same public nuisance claim that is now asserted under Federal common law, would that be consistent?"
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1657.616,1660.484,I -- I don't think we have a position at this time on that.
2010.10-174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1681.231,1684.683,Do you have a position on whether there's anything to be displaced here?
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1688.468,1709.048,"Well, we think, again, the Court doesn't need to get into that question because it -- you know, the -- there are few Federal common law causes of action in the area of nuisance -- I mean, and there have been two that the Federal Government has filed since 1970 and three that we can find all together in the Federal courts of appeals, all of which have failed for various displacement reasons, and the others."
2010.10-174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1736.366,1750.042,"So, if there were -- if there were no Clean Air Act, you would still say that this suit, a suit like this, would -- would fail prudential standing, but you don't have a position as to whether there would be a claim under Federal common law?"
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1750.042,1750.392,--That is correct.
2010.10-174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1767.587,1778.728,"But I'm sorry, General, because I was understanding your answer differently, and maybe I misheard you, as saying that if there were no legislation here, you doubted that there was a Federal law cause of action."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1779.128,1782.18,I doubted that there was prudential standing.
2010.10-174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1782.18,1791.952,"No, but as to whether the cause of action exists under Federal common law in a case like this, where you said it was so different from the other Federal common law cases that the Court has seen."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1791.952,1793.737,I -- I -- I think I put it as we doubt it.
2010.10-174,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1819.305,1825.708,"Same -- same hypothetical, assume no Federal statute, and -- and assume no Federal common law."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1839.802,1846.289,"Well -- well, there may be arguments, Justice Kennedy -- I'm not sure if the premise of your question has a Clean Air Act in existence or not."
2010.10-174,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1851.241,1855.645,The hypothetical is that the Federal law -- Federal statutory law doesn't apply.
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1855.645,1874.606,"--Then I think that again for purposes of State common law, I think this Court would approach that question the same way it did in Milwaukee II, which is to say that's a really separate policy-based question that the Court doesn't use to answer the questions about whether a cause of action should be recognized or whether displacement has occurred."
2010.10-174,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1888.033,1894.103,"It would be very odd to say that there's no Federal common law, but also that there's no -- no displacement of State law."
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1895.57,1902.293,"That's precisely the situation that -- that this Court was grappling with in Milwaukee II, and it said that--"
2010.10-174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1902.293,1905.66,Can we get to -- to the situation that now exists?
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1928.943,1930.11,"--Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.10-174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2033.76,2039.045,"General, could I take you back on that last point to another threshold question, which is the political question doctrine?"
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2056.607,2061.492,"Well, Justice Kagan, I'm not going to tarry too long on which different way we should win this case."
2010.10-174,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2108.873,2113.943,It's not an area where the Court can't go.
2010.10-174,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2131.655,2142.546,"Justice Ginsburg, we quite agree, and that is why we say that if a statute were -- were announced to provide standards, that that would provide a way around the political question problem that exists in this case."
2010.10-174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2142.546,2143.813,"Thank you, General."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2151.151,2154.27,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2243.911,2259.004,"General Underwood, the -- the relief that you're seeking, asking a court to set standards for emissions, sounds like the kind of thing that EPA does."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2285.155,2289.273,It's not as a super EPA.
2010.10-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2300.662,2318.357,"But if we just concentrate on I think the relief you want, you say: District court, if we pass everything else, you set emissions standards, you put a cap immediately, you set a cap, and then annually you require further reductions."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2324.879,2327.795,"--Well, it's also like what the Court did in Tennessee Copper."
2010.10-174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2354.981,2357.95,How does a district judge decide what is reasonable and cost-effective?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2365.604,2366.054,--Correct.
2010.10-174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2366.054,2368.489,There are other -- there are countervailing interests.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2372.193,2373.96,"Well, I would say two things about that."
2010.10-174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2393.557,2399.01,But do you seriously argue this isn't -- this isn't orders of magnitude more complicated than that case?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2399.01,2402.295,--It's somewhat more -- it's larger.
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2441.92,2453.478,What -- what is the -- what factors go into the cost-benefit analysis that would have to be undertaken to decide what level of emissions are reasonable in light of the threat of global -- global warming?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2453.478,2459.299,"The available technology, the cost of that technology--"
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2459.299,2466.37,"Obviously the greatest benefit to reduce global warming would be, of course, to shut down the power plants, right?"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2466.37,2470.607,"--Well, we haven't asked for that and nobody suggests that that would be appropriate."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2474.642,2475.276,Because -- right.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2492.937,2495.972,"Well, it's also a burden that the plaintiffs would have to bear."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2522.372,2528.645,"We're dealing with an electric grid that connects I don't know how vast an area, but certainly a vast area here."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2541.036,2544.822,--It may or may not be based on this.
2010.10-174,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2549.476,2553.428,"But, General, they're usually facts that are determined by an administrative agency."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2560.831,2576.793,"But if there were no agency and if there were no Clean Air Act and somebody was shooting poison into the air in a way that injured people in another State, the States would have the--"
2010.10-174,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2576.793,2579.578,"But if there were no and if there were no, we would be living in a different world."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2582.53,2588.184,--But those -- those are questions about what has been called the merits or displacement.
2010.10-174,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2601.991,2605.562,"We can concede that, but we still have the displacement argument--"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2605.562,2605.795,Yes.
2010.10-174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2627.476,2628.326,Can the courts set a tax?
2010.10-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2628.326,2637.332,"The agency -- the agency is engaged in that, in it right now, and that's another facet of this case, the potential for conflict."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2691.668,2694.036,"No, we do not ignore that."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2767.549,2774.322,"I -- I suppose there were reasons that Congress adopted that approach, and your suit would override those determinations."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2774.322,2778.04,"No, our suit is consistent with those determinations."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2799.104,2803.341,How much -- how much regulation do you need before you would admit that there is displacement?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2809.245,2810.711,--It's a displacement analysis.
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2892.249,2894.601,What is -- what is your test for displacement?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2902.088,2906.04,--There's been displacement as to automobiles.
2010.10-174,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2925.037,2929.322,"What if the EPA made a judgment, but it just was not the judgment that you liked?"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2935.392,2949.502,"I think if it were a judgment that the amount of carbon dioxide emission from stationary sources that was currently happening was the -- was the correct amount, that would displace."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2949.835,2955.822,"--That sounds like -- that sounds like preemption to me and not displacement, or at least preemption with another label."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2955.822,2960.191,"--Well, of course, there are some similarities between the two."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2968.879,2974.95,"Well, maybe you can tell me in what -- to what extent displacement is different from preemption."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2998.399,3002.435,"Well, the difference isn't on that front."
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3040.959,3041.242,"Well, I don't think--"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3041.242,3042.976,"--there's a new one, they have the old one."
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.976,3047.113,"--I don't think that they have to have in mind State law for preemption, either."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3059.003,3060.603,"No, but -- perhaps not."
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3081.167,3081.953,--But you haven't told us how.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3096.545,3100.33,"Well, I think in this context they probably work pretty similarly."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3116.707,3125.03,I think you're right that under your theory they operate pretty similarly and I thought the whole point of Milwaukee v. Illinois was that they are two very distinct propositions.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3125.03,3129.684,"--Well, they have different reasons for existing, that's certainly what Milwaukee v. Illinois said."
2010.10-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3149.597,3171.261,"Your point is that EPA, unless and until EPA gets to the point of setting standards for existing sources, the court can be side by side with the agency; we know that the agency is beginning, it starts with light motor vehicles, and then it's moving forward."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3212.004,3215.039,"--Well, you say the court substituting for the EPA."
2010.10-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3224.061,3231.465,"But now there is an agency, and we know that it operates in a certain way, through notice and comment rulemaking."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3231.465,3231.999,I--
2010.10-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3231.999,3238.738,And here is the court and how does it operate to get to those standards?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3238.738,3246.725,"--Well, TVA suggests that there's an inexorable march, that there's a regulatory program underway."
2010.10-174,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3293.206,3299.526,"General, do you think that you have a Federal common law cause of action against anybody in the world?"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3315.738,3316.821,Yes.
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3367.938,3368.84,You're -- you're lumping them all together.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3379.311,3380.013,Courts sometimes--
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3380.013,3382.447,"Cow by cow, or at least farm by farm?"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3382.447,3390.119,"--Courts sometimes aggregate joint contributors to pollution, particularly where the remedy that's sought is injunctive relief."
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3397.892,3403.546,"So you can lump everybody together, so you can lump together all the people in the United States--"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3403.546,3403.946,Well--
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3403.946,3405.463,"--who breathe, I suppose."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3405.463,3406.079,--No.
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3418.638,3419.054,All right.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3419.271,3420.288,--could be found unreasonable.
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3420.288,3424.173,--all homes that -- that emit carbon dioxide in their -- in their heating systems.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3424.173,3424.625,"No, we're talking--"
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3424.625,3427.225,"The whole country, and you lump them all together, and--"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3427.225,3427.577,--No.
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3427.577,3430.144,"--you say that, you know, that equals 10 percent or whatever."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3431.196,3438.35,It is not necessary to aggregate to have these five defendants stand apart from everybody else.
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3438.35,3440.718,"Well, then don't give us a 10 percent figure."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3440.718,3441.134,I--
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3441.134,3444.436,"Give us the, you know, the maximum figure for a single one of them."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3444.436,3447.038,--3 1/2 percent of U.S. emissions.
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3447.038,3448.99,"Well, why do you stop at U.S. emissions?"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3458.346,3460.298,"Not infinitesimal, actually."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3468.219,3470.987,From power plants or total emissions?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3470.987,3471.587,Total emissions.
2010.10-174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3474.189,3477.843,And anybody who is a substantial contributor could be sued?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3477.843,3478.677,--Yes.
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3517.718,3532.311,"Do you agree -- General Katyal began his argument in fairly dramatic fashion by saying we've never in 222 years had a case where the relief, the damages and the relief sought, were as broad as they are here."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3538.981,3541.25,"Well, of course it depends on what you call broad."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3551.189,3558.129,What's your best -- what's your candidate to rebut his proposition?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3558.129,3559.212,Well--
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3559.212,3564.282,A broader case with respect to the infliction of damage and the need for relief.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3564.282,3590.016,"--Well, I guess what I would say is that cases allowing suits against large contributors, with or without others, and dismissing against small and remote contributors, I give you three State cases that are cited in our briefs: A California case about a large mine that was sued for polluting a river when lots of -- lots of others polluted it and were not before the court."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3590.016,3592.683,"Well, not as many as contribute to global warming?"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3592.683,3594.052,"No, that's correct."
2010.10-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3608.394,3625.606,"One aspect of the litigation process as opposed to the agency process, the agency makes its rule and that can be challenged in court, but suppose your plaintiffs lost this case on merits."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3642.749,3645.936,No.
2010.10-174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3655.958,3656.925,That means you have--
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3656.925,3661.112,"There would be others who have -- would have -- who would have the ability, other States, I suppose."
2010.10-174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3676.455,3688.929,Even if you won and the district court imposed some sort of limit would be there any other obstacle to other plaintiffs bringing suits and another district court issuing a different standard?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3688.929,3698.451,"--Well, the -- ultimately such things would be resolved by appeal and by -- by the circuit courts."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3704.439,3713.795,"Well, no, it's not, and it's not true of every litigation in this sense, that everyone is harmed by global warming."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3728.07,3749.218,"Well, a principal basis to limit -- the common -- the Federal common law of nuisance, as I said, exists principally for the States, for the reason it survived Erie was the Court spoke of the strong Federal interest in providing the States with a remedy for interstate pollution."
2010.10-174,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3782.807,3793.747,"But, General, much of your argument depends on this notion that this suit is really like any other pollution suit, but all those other pollution suits that you've been talking about are much more localized affairs."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3811.374,3820.682,"--I don't know if I would call it a chasm, but there's a large distance between them, and -- but I would like to separate two things."
2010.10-174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3860.224,3863.676,"In setting these standards, there would some difficult trade-offs, wouldn't there?"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3912.407,3914.442,"Well, reasonableness is the beginning."
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3926.499,3929.534,Implausible -- implausible is the word you're looking for.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3930.101,3936.022,"Thank you, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3966.743,3975.147,"Well, I suppose cost-effective -- suppose your complaint is the same but you alleged, what I get from reading these might be the best way to deal with the problem."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4007.119,4009.153,--I don't think so.
2010.10-174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4009.153,4022.58,"All right, now next question is going to be, if he does not have the power to enter that order, which could be proved to be extremely effective, and least possible harm to the consumer, why does he have the power to enter the order you want?"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4022.58,4029.317,Because the common law of nuisance is addressed to direct the polluter to abate the nuisance.
2010.10-174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4029.317,4029.934,"Oh, this will."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4043.008,4046.612,"Actually, the order we're asking for is less intrusive than that."
2010.10-174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4057.534,4058.336,"Well, why is it less intrusive--"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4058.336,4058.636,--Because--
2010.10-174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4058.636,4070.477,"--to try to get into the details of how an electricity company will in fact run its operation, than to say all you have to do is make a change in the dollar sign that you charge for your product?"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4070.477,4076.798,"--Well, because we're not suggesting that the court would get into the details on our theory, either."
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4086.154,4088.522,I wish Justice Breyer had made this argument in the EPA case.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4091.457,4154.881,"And of course it's true that if you conclude that the Federal statutes displace the Federal -- and the Federal regulations displace the Federal common law either now or in the future, then under Ouellette, the same Federal statute that displaces Federal common law will revive source State common law, because of the savings clause in that statute, because of a choice Congress made; and that result, while less -- less respectful of the Federal interest in providing Federal law to govern these disputes, would nevertheless leave common law courts in the business that they're -- of attempting to address unaddressed pollution problems."
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4254.795,4257.747,What if the EPA comes up with a different number?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4268.018,4271.422,You mean an emission reduction?
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4271.422,4271.939,"Yes, yes."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4272.489,4278.826,"If the EPA -- when the EPA speaks, the EPA's rule will displace the Federal common law."
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4279.859,4283.144,--And will displace the judgment that has been obtained under Federal law?
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4283.144,4295.119,"--If -- it would presumably provide a basis for the defendant to go back to the court and -- and vacate the judgment or alter the judgment to comply with regulations, should that happen."
2010.10-174,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4295.119,4295.652,Right.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4296.652,4300.404,"That's what appellate courts are here for, isn't it?"
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4301.272,4309.092,"Well, I guess, just to follow up, what is the appellate court reviewing?"
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4316.829,4322.65,The continuing validity of the injunction it entered previously because once the EPA--
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4322.65,4333.457,"But that seems to be a displacement of the normal process of administrative law, which we would review the agency's determination of how best and to what extent to regulate the emissions."
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4333.457,4357.989,"--On a different litigation track, it is -- would also be possible to challenge the EPA's regulatory judgment, but in the case in which a judgment had already been entered, it is the ordinary litigation track to, if -- if intervening events make equitable relief no longer equitable, to go back to the court and ask the court to modify its injunction."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4357.989,4358.456,Yes.
2010.10-174,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,4369.963,4384.39,"I don't think it's a different set -- yes, one set of standards for reviewing an agency's determination, but the ultimate standards that are reached are going to be a level of emission reduction through either process."
2010.10-174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4412.492,4416.694,"Thank you, General Underwood."
2010.10-174,3,38044,peter_d_keisler,,4419.313,4420.879,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-174,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4546.246,4548.698,"Thank you, Mr. Keisler, counsel."
