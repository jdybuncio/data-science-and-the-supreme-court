1996.96-552,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.122,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-552, Rachel Agostini v. Betty-Louise Felton, and a consolidated case."
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,10.322,12.474,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.96-552,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,81.868,82.534,General Dellinger--
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,82.534,82.7,--Yes.
1996.96-552,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,82.7,90.538,"--you're not suggesting that an act of Congress should be treated any differently than an act of a State legislature, are you, for purposes of Establishment Clause jurisprudence?"
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,90.538,91.806,"No, I am not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-552,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,131.93,143.572,"Do you take the position that Congress, or for that matter a State, could simply appropriate money generally for the teaching of secular subjects and that money could go into the parochial schools without a First Amendment problem?"
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,143.572,145.438,"We do not, Justice Souter."
1996.96-552,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,145.438,146.857,"Well, how do you draw the line?"
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,180.911,215.167,"Justice Souter, I think it is well-established that... though I do agree that there's no bright line between remedial mathematics and other math, but what is critical is that the Federal title I money was so clearly intended to be, and the statute and the regulations require it to be, a supplementation that goes to the benefit of these low-income needy children that I do not think this case raises the question that would be raised when taxpayer funding takes over a significant portion of the regular educational curriculum."
1996.96-552,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,229.225,245.854,"Well, what if Congress comes along and says every school district in the United States that spends less than X dollars per pupil will be subject to supplementation by Federal grant for the teaching of secular subjects, and this money can go to parochial as well as private schools."
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,251.257,258.577,"As you describe it, I believe that that would cause a more far-reaching revision of the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence than anything we--"
1996.96-552,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,258.577,259.243,How would we draw the line?
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,259.243,260.36,--seek here.
1996.96-552,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,260.36,262.295,Congress would say this is a supplement for poor school districts.
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,262.295,276.703,You draw the line here because this appropriation has none of the indicia of Congress providing the support that then enables the institution to engage in its religious function more fully.
1996.96-552,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,278.971,290.045,"Well, it allows parochial schools to teach reading better than they could teach it otherwise just as public schools can teach reading better than they could teach it or are teaching it otherwise, so I don't see how we draw the line."
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,290.045,303.786,"--Well, first of all, that is, of course, as true under the program as it has existed from 1965 to 1997 as it is under the issue that is before is here."
1996.96-552,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,304.286,304.569,Except--
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,304.569,305.836,--There's the same supplementation--
1996.96-552,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,305.836,322.181,"--Except that at least an attempt is made to draw a visual line, if you will, between what the school is ultimately accomplishing and the secular source by which it is accomplishing this extra objective."
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,331.203,346.212,"--Here, I believe the attempt is not only made but it is fully successful to differentiate this program from a program like Grand Rapids v. Ball, which we are not challenging, which we... in this submission at all."
1996.96-552,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,346.212,347.029,General Dellinger--
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,347.029,347.412,Yes.
1996.96-552,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.412,364.674,--I assume that it enables a parochial school to teach better if you allow a person who knows sign language to enable its deaf students to understand what is being taught in a class better.
1996.96-552,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,366.46,368.56,"Of course it does, Justice Scalia, as does--"
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1137.307,1144.697,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.876,1246.478,"It's these children's fault for going to parochial school, I assume."
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1248.43,1249.497,"Well, no."
1996.96-552,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1270.796,1278.616,"Well, let me ask... suppose that it is very expensive and impractical for the program involved to comply with the Establishment Clause."
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1283.968,1284.853,No--
1996.96-552,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1284.853,1286.753,--a question of practicality?
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1286.753,1288.472,"--Justice Kennedy, no, of course not."
1996.96-552,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.814,1305.933,Is it a change?
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1310.818,1315.955,"--Well, my answer, Justice Breyer, is that there has been a substantial change."
1996.96-552,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1315.955,1318.007,What on the merits?
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1335.453,1336.286,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1996.96-552,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1336.286,1336.536,All right.
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1341.238,1345.559,"Well, on the merits, Your Honor, I would say that that is no longer the applicable law."
1996.96-552,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1345.559,1355.598,"He has a number, four or five reasons why, in terms of the basic purposes of the Establishment Clause, it makes sense, though of course you'll get bizarre cases."
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1375.994,1377.446,"The answer, very--"
1996.96-552,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1377.446,1382.582,"Basically it was along the lines that Justice Souter was saying earlier, but I don't want to characterize it if you're familiar with it."
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1382.582,1406.815,"--The answer, Your Honor, I believe is that under the teaching not reflected in Judge Friendly's decision, because it occurred subsequently and in this Court, in Zobrest, where you had a child who was handicapped, what the Court said was, when you have a broad program of benefits that are available to everyone, regardless of their religion, it can't be denied to that particular child because he happens to be going to a parochial school."
1996.96-552,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1406.815,1428.546,"All right, so it's quite clear that a handicapped child, one who is a particularly strong case for breaching the line about sending the public school teachers into the schools, but then once that line is breached, is it then logical that you could have science taught for the lower third in the class, math, et cetera?"
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1432.331,1451.428,"Well, the line here, Your Honor, is, unlike in paroch... excuse me... in public schools under title I, where they have area-wide schools, where enough of the population is in poverty they make the entire school title I eligible and all kinds of things happen, that's not available in the parochial schools."
1996.96-552,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.061,1486.667,"Mr. Crotty, Justice Breyer suggests that there is a line between a physical handicap and a mental handicap, which is what these children are laboring under."
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1489.536,1493.571,"Well, I don't agree with that at all, Your Honor, and I don't think that's a constitutionally significant--"
1996.96-552,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1493.571,1509.098,"Well, the reason would be, I suppose that the basic line is as to whether or not large numbers of public school teachers are going to be physically in the parochial school, and we have a whole list in the opinion of problems that grow out of that."
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1509.098,1510.117,--Well--
1996.96-552,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1510.117,1518.555,"And now this Court's created an exception to that, and the exception, I take it, is in the situation where it's hardest for a child physically to leave the school."
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1518.555,1521.59,"--Well, it's hard for these children to physically leave the school."
1996.96-552,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1521.59,1521.774,All right.
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1521.774,1522.474,It's terribly--
1996.96-552,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.474,1524.709,"So what in your opinion, then, is the line?"
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1545.373,1550.742,"--Well, what I ask only, Your Honor, in reversing Aguilar is that the title I program go forward."
1996.96-552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.578,1609.363,What does the record tell us about the amount of monitoring that goes on in the buses to find out what the teachers do?
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1609.363,1614.017,"The same amount of monitoring, Your Honor, goes on in the buses that would go on in the public schools."
1996.96-552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1614.017,1615.6,What is that amount of monitoring?
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1615.6,1628.36,"The... I think the teachers are visited once a month by their supervisors, and once or twice a year, depending on the teacher's tenure status under the collective bargaining rules they get an evaluative study."
1996.96-552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1628.36,1632.062,"They're visited in the bus, so somebody comes into the bus once a month?"
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1632.062,1640.251,"They're visited once a month in the bus, and then there's an evaluation study either once or twice a year, depending upon the union, the teacher's status."
1996.96-552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.251,1646.321,"Have there been any fact-finding hearings on what's happened during the last 30 years, because I guess this case was dismissed right on the pleadings, wasn't it?"
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1646.321,1646.938,Well--
1996.96-552,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1646.938,1649.273,"I mean, on the Rule for a 60(b) motion."
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1649.273,1659.963,"--after a full record was made in a preceding case, called the Pearl I case, which was a three-judge court case, and then appeal was taken here to the Supreme Court, and it was out of time and so it was dismissed."
1996.96-552,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1684.98,1688.148,"Mr. Crotty, we're still looking for a limiting principle."
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1732.926,1735.961,"The limitations, Your Honor, are contained in the regulations."
1996.96-552,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1735.961,1738.913,"No, but that's not a constitutional limitation."
1996.96-552,1,37762,paul_a_crotty,,1746.001,1760.511,"I would say that a program that is limited and made available only to those who objectively need it, without regard to their religion, would be a program that is constitutionally permitted and consistent with the Court's teaching in Zobrest."
1996.96-552,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.761,1762.411,"Thank you, Mr. Crotty."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,1765.713,1771.367,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.239,1830.206,Or private school students.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,1838.428,1839.262,--Let me... yes.
1996.96-552,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1853.771,1855.889,Can't you answer Justice Scalia?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,1855.889,1856.406,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1996.96-552,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.406,1858.675,I didn't think you answered Justice Scalia's question.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,1858.675,1859.291,I'm sorry.
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.291,1866.412,You have no problem in principle with making public funds available to public schools and to private schools.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,1871.947,1872.566,"Oh, right, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.566,1873.182,Yes.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,1873.182,1873.649,Yes.
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.838,1885.89,You have no problem with the Free Exercise Clause.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,1885.89,1887.491,--I have no problem--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.491,1896.431,"Those parents must forego that, that subsidy, even for remedial purposes if they happen to select a private school that is a religious school."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,1896.431,1897.781,--I don't--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.781,1900.799,You see no Free Exercise problems with it.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,1900.799,1910.489,"--I... to the extent that I see a Free Exercise problem, I see it as being seriously overcome because of the Establishment Clause problems."
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.912,1948.464,"Mr. Geller, it's not a matter of their having a right."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,1980.501,1980.917,--I--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.917,1988.071,"And to adopt the absolutist view of the Establishment Clause that you're proposing simply ignores that aspect of the matter, it seems to me."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,1988.071,2007.318,"--Oh, I don't have to adopt that view, because I can see where, if you had the religious school students obtaining their remedial instruction in public schools like the public school students do, then they would be able to get that instruction."
1996.96-552,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2007.318,2008.334,They'd go to public school--
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2011.203,2013.969,That that alternative--
1996.96-552,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2013.969,2015.719,Suppose there were a showing that that alternative did not work?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2028.979,2036.548,"--That question, Your Honor, contains the assumption that it is so."
1996.96-552,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2038.464,2039.5,"Yes, of course it's an assumption."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2039.5,2040.283,--The respondents--
1996.96-552,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2040.283,2044.618,"The assumption is that it's impractical, and my question is, what if that assumption is true?"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2044.618,2051.308,"--If the assumption was true, it would bear some weight, but the fact, the actual fact is--"
1996.96-552,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2051.308,2057.21,So that practicality does enter into our determination of whether there's an establishment violation.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2057.21,2061.663,"--It would, if it were factually warranted."
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2267.548,2272.266,"I assume that the State can provide buses to these parochial school students, right?"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2272.266,2273.932,--They can provide--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.932,2277.817,"Public services such as fire, fire protection and so forth?"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2277.817,2278.367,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-552,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2278.367,2282.954,And is that true even if that advances the mission of the parochial school?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2282.954,2287.323,I don't see how it advances the mission.
1996.96-552,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2287.323,2291.442,You don't think busing students to go to the school advances the mission of the school?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2291.442,2292.394,It does not.
1996.96-552,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2292.394,2292.86,All right.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2292.86,2316.891,"I don't see how that does at all, and as a matter of fact, we point out in our brief that when in Everson v. Board of Education that was permitted, the Court noted that this was the very verge of the aid, if it could be called aid, that would go to a public school, religious schools or religious school students."
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2316.891,2318.525,How about books?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2322.879,2323.545,They... they--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.545,2324.979,"And that doesn't help the mission either, does it?"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2324.979,2326.997,"--They can do that under Allen, yes."
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.466,2331.485,"Can on Zobrest, right."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2331.485,2331.985,--What?

1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2333.718,2335.437,I don't go back on--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.437,2336.92,"I mean, it seems to me that there's not--"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2336.92,2337.889,--I don't go back on Zobrest.
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.889,2348.995,--It seems to me there's not this clear line you're trying to draw between any assistance that the Federal Government provides to the accomplishment of the mission of parochial schools.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2368.908,2377.264,"The line that respondents draw, Your Honor, is as far as I'm concerned as clear as clear can be."
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.216,2408.449,Why are teachers different from books?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2408.449,2413.353,"--Because teachers are uncontrollable, and I point this out--"
1996.96-552,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2425.494,2432.648,"That's an argument... Mr. Geller, you can't seriously expect this Court to accept that argument, that teachers are unprofessional and uncontrollable."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2457.965,2482.663,"--When I said teachers are uncontrollable, I may have used a strong word, but not much stronger than Chief Justice Burger did in Lemon, and when he pointed out that books are controllable because once they're printed and they contain nothing that offends the Establishment Clause, that's the end of it."
1996.96-552,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2482.663,2501.042,"Well, we had... New York had 19 years of title I education programs without a single identifiable incident of a public school teacher inculcating religion, and it worked fine, until this Court got the notion that that program somehow failed the Establishment Clause test."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2501.042,2524.174,"Those many years of nonreported violations are very easily explained, and Justice Breyer asked questions about... to Mr. Crotty about Judge Friendly's opinion on that point, and I believe that's the... that speaks much better than I could ever speak."
1996.96-552,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2553.844,2560.663,What is there in our civic tradition that says that surveillance is necessary to ensure that citizens obey the law?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2560.663,2562.115,--I didn't--
1996.96-552,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2562.115,2568.269,What is there in our civic tradition that says surveillance is necessary to ensure that citizens obey the law?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2568.269,2577.125,"--In this particular case, I would assume it's necessary."
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.45,2592.402,Is it any easier to bug the buses than it is to bug the classrooms?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2593.369,2595.621,--Is it any easier to bug the buses--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.621,2597.288,To bug the buses than it is to bug the classrooms?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2597.288,2597.704,--Well--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.704,2602.59,"I mean, if you have this problem about teachers inculcating religious values, why couldn't it happen on the bus?"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2602.59,2604.125,--That's--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.125,2617.833,"I mean, somehow the teacher magically, when she walks into the public... into the parochial school classroom is transformed from an impartial employee of the State, without any secular interest in mind, to somebody who's going to teach religion."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2620.317,2624.438,"--My answer to that has to be, Your Honor, one case at a time."
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.627,2635.244,The buses are not even any good.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2635.244,2651.923,"--If you want an honest answer from these respondents, yes, the buses are a violation, because we see little difference between the buses right outside the door of the religious school and a title I classroom inside the door."
1996.96-552,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2719.317,2725.221,"Before you finish, could you spend a couple of minutes addressing the 60(b) question?"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2774.736,2778.188,"My answer to that, Justice Breyer, is twofold."
1996.96-552,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2791.996,2792.715,Mr. Geller--
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2806.106,2833.442,"That is odd, but I was going to answer Justice Breyer by saying, Justice Kennedy, that that is the precise situation in which many, many parties before this Court have found themselves, and they have had to wait, some of them many, many years, to have a case come before this Court... very few cases... in which the determination in their case is overruled."
1996.96-552,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2834.075,2836.894,"Mr. Geller, on the question of cases... you mentioned there were cases."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2850.634,2868.096,"--Yes, the case that respondents have now... it's suspended pending this case... in the Second Circuit Court, in which we are challenging the present, what we call the alternative plan in New York City which relies largely on busing."
1996.96-552,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2882.606,2886.66,Have your opponents in that case urged that Aguilar be overruled?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2886.66,2897.098,"--Oh, the opponents take precisely the same position that they're... that the petitioners are taking in this case, yes, that Aguilar is no longer the law, and we--"
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2897.098,2901.733,Would the district court be able to grant them that wish that Aguilar no longer be the law?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2901.733,2903.168,--The district court already--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.168,2908.537,"No, I mean in that case could the district court pronounce Aguilar to be dead?"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2908.537,2914.041,--The district court distinguished the buses from the--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.041,2914.976,"Yes, but assume it couldn't distinguish."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2931.085,2935.354,--Depending on the facts of the case that are developed.
1996.96-552,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2935.354,2937.839,I don't understand that answer.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,2943.841,2979.632,"Well, it's not the job of lower courts, but what has happened in the case... the Walker case in California is, that went past the court of appeals out there, was that the court of appeals... that was a Chapter II case, a title II case on books and equipment rather than a title I case, but there the court of appeals did hold on the basis of the change in the law that the petitioners here argue--"
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.632,2981.299,"Well, it shouldn't, Mr. Geller."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3002.13,3003.164,--Yes.
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.164,3008.616,"That is, it was wrong in obeying our instructions that it should follow Aguilar."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3011.234,3011.884,I never--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.884,3013.436,"--the court that did the right thing was wrong, aren't we?"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3013.436,3023.642,"--All right, Justice Scalia... I never got to the second point of my answer to Justice Breyer, and that is, it was suggested by Justice Ginsburg."
1996.96-552,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3053.763,3066.237,"Mr. Geller, even assuming that were not done, I have assumed that there would be no difficulty for any school district, for example, to protest the Secretary's position and litigate that."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3080.947,3085.532,"Oh, well, that was the third part of my answer to Justice Breyer's question."
1996.96-552,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.539,3126.709,"Well, Mr. Geller, you're not suggesting that this Court has never granted a rehearing out of time, are you?"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3126.709,3129.161,--I thought it never had.
1996.96-552,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3129.161,3131.28,Have you... are you familiar with the Gondack case?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3131.28,3138.267,"I must not be, because I thought that... I thought that this case was unprecedented."
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.267,3139.786,How could you not be familiar with the Gondack case?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3140.453,3145.773,"I am not... I said that... yes, I must admit."
1996.96-552,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3146.989,3148.391,"Mr. Geller, I believe that was a question--"
1996.96-552,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3148.391,3151.176,"--I think he's answering my question, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3151.176,3152.109,"--Yes, I did answer that."
1996.96-552,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3152.109,3159.246,"Gondack may have been an error on our part, but there was a case 20, 25 years ago where we did grant a rehearing out of time."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3159.246,3174.522,"Out of time, and before a bench that was so different from the bench that sat on Aguilar, with not even... not even a single Justice here that indicates that he would change his vote?"
1996.96-552,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3174.522,3181.259,"Well, this was perhaps 2 years out of time, not as far out as... now it's very much out of time by our rule."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3212.195,3217.015,"Well, having had to admit that I'm not familiar with Gondack--"
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.865,3229.74,"Mr. Geller, can you give me... I mean, it's fine that you say some other district may be able to raise this issue."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3250.82,3253.938,I do not see it at this late date.
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.211,3276.269,We're not imaginative enough to find some way to provide relief to somebody who is laboring under an injunction that is assumedly unconstitutional?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3276.269,3277.054,--That I obtained?
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3277.054,3281.606,"That you obtained, but assume, just posit--"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3296.365,3297.232,Yes... yes--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3297.232,3303.169,"Is there no way that we can give relief to New York, or to just tell them, well, wait for somebody else to bring a lawsuit, maybe you'll get lucky?"
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3303.169,3308.59,"--I was about to answer Justice O'Connor's suggestion, and it will answer yours."
1996.96-552,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3389.144,3408.856,"If we took the position that Zobrest had in fact undermined Aguilar to the point that there was nothing left of it, that it had in fact overruled it, even though we did not say that in express terms, then I suppose it would be proper for us to employ or to sanction the employment of Rule 60(b) to grant the relief that they want."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3409.439,3410.058,Yes.
1996.96-552,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3433.321,3442.862,"And yet the type of aid that's given actually enables the sign language interpreter to inculcate religion, if that's what's being taught."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3448.064,3450.599,"--In a way it does, yes, Your Honor, but with a single student."
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3462.156,3464.406,Zobrest applies to only one individual?
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3469.643,3475.261,--But it would still be much more attenuated than the aid... that's the word that this Court--
1996.96-552,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3475.261,3475.63,Don't say one individual.
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3478.999,3499.412,"--Well, the question, Your Honor, is, did you apply... did you adopt a principle that overrules the cases in which the Court has held that... it's sometimes called massive aid, or funding of religious schools, is unconstitutional as in Grand Rapids, as in Meek v. Pittenger?"
1996.96-552,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3513.82,3515.236,"Thank you, Mr. Geller."
1996.96-552,2,41388,stanley_geller,,3516.42,3516.938,Thank you.
1996.96-552,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3516.938,3520.474,"General Dellinger, you have less than a minute left."
1996.96-552,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3520.474,3536.316,The line that this Court has itself drawn in Ball and in Zobrest is that a State may not in effect subsidize the religious functions of the parochial schools by taking over a substantial portion of their responsibility for teaching secular subjects.
1996.96-552,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3552.209,3553.143,"Thank you, General Dellinger."
