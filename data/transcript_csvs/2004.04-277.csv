2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,64.81,68.063,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.96,143.551,Why?
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,168.314,174.398,"Well, I don't think we would say, in that example, that you are offering windshields, per se."
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.931,198.973,"Well, suppose I just tie it in with windshield wipers."
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,198.973,202.818,"Well, again, I--"
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.818,205.713,You can only buy my windshield if you buy the windshield wipers with it.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,210.375,212.722,"--Well, I think it would depend on the nature of the regulatory--"
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.722,213.329,Fifty-fifty.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,213.329,213.985,--regime.
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.985,222.151,But don't you think that the telecommunications aspect of what's going on here is at least as important as the information aspect of it?
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,224.508,235.004,"Well, the... and, by the same token, the transmission component is useless unless it offers all of the... all of the information-services type functionality that Internet service offers."
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.004,235.808,Not necessarily.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,244.23,257.541,"But, Your Honor, it's the... it's the capabilities that you purchase in the integrated package... not the pure transmission, but the other capabilities, the computer data-processing, data-access capabilities that are an essential part of that."
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.152,283.999,I understand that.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,283.999,284.143,It's not just transmission.
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.883,298.516,"I agree, but the question isn't whether it doesn't do anything; the question is whether you are still offering telecommunications services to the public."
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,335.127,335.261,Well--
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,335.261,336.263,--use of language.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,336.263,338.2,"--well, two points."
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.282,369.389,I was giving you a hypothetical.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,369.681,379.344,"Well, in the... in the hypothetical, it's conceivable that a different result might be reached by the regulatory agency with authority for construing the statute and applying it to particular fact situations."
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.856,414.143,"--But if you do the same combination over telephone lines, you say they are... they are selling--"
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,414.143,416.244,Your Honor--
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.244,417.684,--offering to the public communications service.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,417.684,427.747,--That's because the telephone companies have always offered a standalone transmission component which other... which other ISPs can utilize.
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.299,449.944,"What bearing does history have upon the definitional question of whether, when you sell a bundled offering of information technology and communications, you are selling communications?"
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,449.944,450.419,Your Honor--
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.419,456.883,"With respect to the telephone long-lines, you say, yes, you are; and with respect to cable, you say, no, you aren't."
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,456.883,477.991,"--Your Honor, it's certainly not unusual for this Court, in construing a statute, to look to the regulatory history that led up to the enactment of the statute, particularly where it's clear in the legislative history that Congress was in... was essentially borrowing from the pre-1996 regulatory definitions, the definitional scheme that the Commission adopted in 1980 in its Computer II report."
2004.04-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,483.979,492.618,"Mr. Hungar, what is the tentative decision the FCC has taken on the DSL regulation?"
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,492.618,508.841,"Your Honor, the FCC has tentatively concluded that when a telephone company makes an integrated offering of the DSL transmission capacity with the Internet service, as a combined offering to consumers, that, tentatively that is an information service, precisely the classification that you--"
2004.04-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.841,509.294,Even though--
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,509.294,509.426,--read here.
2004.04-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,509.426,513.249,--telephone lines have always been subject to common-carrier regulation.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,513.249,513.836,That's correct.
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.11,556.616,I understand what--
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,556.616,556.733,--Computer II order.
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.733,560.451,"--they're saying, but they're doing it all on policy grounds."
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,572.472,573.49,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.49,574.166,It just doesn't seem to--
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,574.166,575.441,It depends on the nature of the offering.
2004.04-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,641.279,650.334,"But it seems to be saying, because the cable companies do not offer separate telecommunications service, they don't have to offer it."
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,650.334,650.787,--Correct.
2004.04-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,650.787,653.629,"I mean, it just... it's almost question-begging."
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,654.807,655.814,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2004.04-277,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,722.709,726.682,Did you say... you say that the FCC is changing its view.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,732.772,734.403,"--Well, actually, that's an important point, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-277,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,793.63,796.851,What would be left in the common-carrier category?
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,796.851,806.53,"--Well, any standalone, pure-transmission offering, including, under the Computer II rationale, to the extent the Commission adheres to it--"
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.392,835.773,"--Well, that's wonderful policy--"
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,835.773,835.937,--communications pipelines.
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.937,847.722,"--that's wonderful policy, but I don't... what I'm still waiting to hear is how you get that out of the definitions, which is the lever that the Commission is using to implement this good policy."
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,870.891,872.438,"Your Honor, I'm sorry, but--"
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,872.438,873.243,That's not my understanding--
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,873.243,873.477,--that's--
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.477,874.373,--of how definitions work.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,874.373,876.65,--Let me try to clarify what the Commission's position is.
2004.04-277,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,905.331,905.587,So it's--
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,905.587,906.174,--as information.
2004.04-277,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,906.174,912.446,"--in effect, it's the unbundling requirement which is your answer to Justice Scalia's... Why should that make a difference?"
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,916.675,917.599,You could.
2004.04-277,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,931.822,944.782,"And the reason for a distinction, at least at the present time... the reason for the reasonableness of the distinction at the present time, as a source of applying this definition, is history, basically."
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,944.782,955.348,"History and, not unrelated to that, the fact that the cable companies have not traditionally been regulated as common carriers under the--"
2004.04-277,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,955.348,955.752,Yeah.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,955.752,956.435,--Title II of the Act.
2004.04-277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.996,1018.688,They claim that that's by toleration of the FCC.
2004.04-277,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1020.767,1022.5,--If I may reserve the balance of my time.
2004.04-277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1022.5,1024.308,"Very well, Mr. Hungar."
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1026.964,1037.635,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1089.55,1092.541,What is the... what is the data-processing part?
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1092.541,1096.62,"In the case of cable modem service, Your Honor, it's a number of things."
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1104.587,1114.922,"So I guess, on that one, if, in fact, you had a telephone system, and, at the other end of the wire, Joe Smith, your friend, had recorded a message,--"
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1123.833,1134.632,"--Well, I think in your situation... in the hypothetical you give, Your Honor, that would be somebody using just a regular transmission-only path to hear what the other person--"
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1134.632,1136.099,And how is this different?
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1136.099,1144.67,"--Well, because here, in the example that I used, for example... it's certainly not the only one... it is the capacity to retrieve information that is stored otherwise."
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1145.646,1149.144,Information that other people have stored otherwise?
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1149.144,1149.624,--Yes.
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.709,1155.907,"Well, why isn't that even more telecommunications than my answering service?"
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1155.907,1156.771,--Well--
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1156.771,1158.067,"You know, I pick up my messages."
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1158.067,1163.368,"--I would say, Your Honor, for one thing, it fits squarely within the definition of information service, which says--"
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1163.368,1166.227,"Well, yes, of course it does, and so does my answering service."
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1166.227,1168.387,--Well--
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1168.387,1170.072,I got... what about the next one?
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1172.163,1172.648,--Okay.
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1172.648,1175.581,--of those things that are not telecommunications.
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1175.581,1183.475,"It's the ability to engage in... to use your e-mail, it's the ability--"
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1183.475,1193.635,"Well, the ability to engage or use my e-mail is an ability to access messages that other people, who don't work for you, have left for me."
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1197.208,1197.854,--Right.
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1197.854,1199.555,--and it doesn't seem very different.
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1199.555,1200.643,Right.
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1200.643,1201.661,"But, anyway, what's the third one?"
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1201.661,1212.071,"Well, it's anything that allows you to browse the World Wide Web and to... and to retrieve information from the World Wide Web."
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1212.071,1213.047,"Yes, indeed."
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1213.047,1213.409,Right.
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1213.409,1225.674,"What it is, is a system where I pick up the phone, and what my phone does is... let's say it had the ability to survey a number of possible people who wanted to talk to me."
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1232.944,1233.28,The--
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1233.28,1236.708,Because the other people are leaving the information; it's not the phone that's doing it.
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1236.708,1245.582,"--Your Honor, the ability to retrieve information that is stored somewhere out on a server is not the raw transmission functionality."
2004.04-277,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1271.31,1282.243,"Rather like when I phone Europe, and they take the message and turn it into electronic packets, and they send it all over the world and on computers and so forth, and it comes back to me eventually, sounds a lot like my brother-in-law."
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1282.456,1291.09,"Yeah, I guess... look, Your Honor, I am not disputing that an information service has a component of it that's communications."
2004.04-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.393,1330.086,The FCC--
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1330.086,1332.326,"--Yeah, I'm sorry, I keep saying Congress; I meant the FCC."
2004.04-277,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1388.192,1395.093,"But the... I mean, I think the difficulty that we're having is that it says it in the cable context, and then it doesn't say it in the wire context."
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1397.94,1398.308,--Yeah.
2004.04-277,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1398.308,1400.345,It's just that you haven't been saying it.
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1400.345,1402.312,"Let me try to clarify that, Justice Souter."
2004.04-277,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1437.427,1439.854,So is that really the nub of the difference?
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1446.877,1448.776,I would... I read the statute this way.
2004.04-277,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1465.08,1466.094,"Yeah, but that begs the question."
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1466.094,1466.627,"--Your Honor, I--"
2004.04-277,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1466.627,1469.245,It begs the question.
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1469.245,1554.353,"--It just says that it's for someone else to decide the second prong of the NARUC test, which is, Should you be compelled?"
2004.04-277,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1568.842,1577.338,"Basically, you're saying interstitial lawmaking, like other kinds of lawmaking, can be reasonable without being absolutely consistent at a given moment."
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1577.338,1578.016,"Correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1578.016,1585.851,"--That still doesn't explain... it still doesn't explain, to my satisfaction, why it becomes a different product--"
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1585.851,1587.659,"Okay, let me try--"
2004.04-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1587.659,1593.386,"--a different product when you're selling it separately, and it is not a different product when you're not selling it separately."
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1593.536,1597.6,"--Because, Your Honor, it's whether the words ""offering telecommunications"" are ambiguous."
2004.04-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.577,1623.679,--Unless you also sell butter.
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1623.679,1625.391,Separately.
2004.04-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.391,1626.036,If you sell butter--
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1626.036,1626.451,Separately.
2004.04-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1626.451,1627.89,"--separately, then when you sell a cake--"
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1627.89,1628.018,"But, Your Honor--"
2004.04-277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1628.018,1628.855,--you're selling butter.
2004.04-277,1,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,1628.855,1629.9,"--The ILECs do, we don't."
2004.04-277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.9,1632.342,"Thank you, Mr. Cappuccio."
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1634.998,1643.798,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-277,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.199,1962.263,"Well, it does have this, that what... if you look at the definition of ""telecommunications"", it means"
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2022.882,2023.234,No.
2004.04-277,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2023.234,2023.756,No.
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2023.756,2025.638,"All right, let me take you through both parts."
2004.04-277,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2042.662,2043.366,xxx--
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2043.366,2047.179,1a.
2004.04-277,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2061.472,2072.308,"No, no, but they're saying if telecommunications and something else is involved, and that's what you offer, you are not offering a telecommunications service."
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2096.239,2098.036,--Let me explain why I answered them separately.
2004.04-277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.611,2356.82,"Well, can't the Commission change its mind, Mr. Goldstein?"
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2356.82,2365.587,"--Mr. Chief Justice, on this question, the answer is, no, because Mr. Hungar has conceded, and the Commission conceded below, that Congress was adopting a definitional framework."
2004.04-277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2377.022,2378.457,"Well, I'm glad I did."
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2380.568,2382.168,--and that is to reinforce this.
2004.04-277,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2470.828,2491.435,"--No, but they say we have the authority, if they... if there is a bundled service, by looking at the competitive necessity, market power, the need to protect consumers, to insist that an offeror of bundled service split the bundle and then be regulated."
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2491.435,2492.32,I agree.
2004.04-277,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.168,2495.46,Yeah.
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2495.46,2500.717,"First, they have a Chenery problem; and that is, this doesn't appear anywhere in the Commission's ruling."
2004.04-277,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2509.144,2516.039,"No, but they're replying to your argument, and they're saying it's really not right that this means no regulation."
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2526.226,2528.765,"--I still this is covered by Chenery, but let's go to that."
2004.04-277,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.242,2551.297,"Well, if you take them as having a broad... if you take the statute as throwing this whole problem in the lap of the Commission--"
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2551.297,2551.734,Yes.
2004.04-277,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2551.734,2574.614,"--and then you say they have authority, broadly, to interpret this term ""offer"", they could give functional reasons, as in some circumstances, to interpret the word ""offer"" to mean ""offer telecommunications separately"", and, in other circumstances, because they're functional differences, to take a different position."
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2584.96,2592.821,"Let me deal with the premise that Congress threw this into the lap of the FCC, and also how it is they propose to deal with it, on that assumption."
2004.04-277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.623,2780.526,But the Congress apparently wanted to go in the direction of deregulation here.
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2780.526,2788.078,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it's a fair point, and it is basically... aside for the, sort of, nod at history, it... Mr. Hungar started with that."
2004.04-277,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2791.598,2796.861,"Well, what about Congress thinking, quite honestly, if they... people do think about it."
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2818.378,2820.544,"--It did that, but with a critical concession."
2004.04-277,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2821.077,2822.879,"It sort of it did that in broadcasting, didn't it?"
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2838.703,2840.894,--I think it's a very fair comparison.
2004.04-277,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3120.715,3122.303,"There's butter on the cake, not in the cake."
2004.04-277,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3122.581,3123.045,--Right.
2004.04-277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3169.807,3171.961,"Thank you, Mr. Goldstein."
2004.04-277,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3174.41,3179.731,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.04-277,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3408.629,3409.78,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
