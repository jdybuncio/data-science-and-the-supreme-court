1984.84-335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.785,We will hear arguments next in Mitchell against Forsyth.
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,58.1,74.15,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case the Solicitor General represents former Attorney General John N. Mitchell in a lawsuit that was filed 13 years ago, in 1972."
1984.84-335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,103.597,109.291,Were those conversations the target at their inception?
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,109.291,111.194,Not specifically.
1984.84-335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,223.088,226.259,Does it not go back even more than that?
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,226.259,234.014,"My research, Your Honor, shows simply that it was... there are things in this record that indicate in 25 years--"
1984.84-335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,234.014,244.241,"One case, I thought, in either this Court or the Court of Appeals referred to a memorandum from Franklin Roosevelt to the Attorney General Jackson."
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,244.241,247.493,"--That may very well be, Your Honor."
1984.84-335,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.774,328.084,"Well, Mr. Bator, even if you are 100 percent correct on the qualified immunity question, what about the review of that at this stage, the appealability question, which seems to me to be a tougher question than the one on the merits?"
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,328.084,341.244,"Well, Your Honor, we agree, and I am happy to turn to it if you would like me to, although I do want to come back and say perhaps a word or two about the merits of the qualified immunity issue."
1984.84-335,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,450.736,462.534,"Well, was there some factual dispute here about whether the wiretap was motivated by national security concerns, so is it enmeshed in the merits, and so forth?"
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,462.534,466.277,"Your Honor, we do not think that there was really any relevant factual dispute at all."
1984.84-335,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,593.018,601.143,"May I ask, Mr. Bator, are you going to argue the question whether 2520 limits the defense so that--"
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,601.143,606.066,"I hadn't planned to, Your Honor, and I am not really prepared, 2520 being--"
1984.84-335,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,606.066,607.128,--That's the one that--
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,607.128,608.129,--the Title 3.
1984.84-335,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,608.129,612.701,"--Yes, the only defense to the officials is those set forth in 2520?"
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,612.701,621.167,"Your Honor, our position on that is that 2520 doesn't limit because Title 3 is basically inapplicable to this entire situation."
1984.84-335,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,628.961,634.586,"Well, if he did have a good cause of action under Title 3, would 2520 limit the--"
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,634.586,645.092,"Then it may be that 2520 might limit, although we haven't briefed that issue, Your Honor, and it might be that the clearly established rule might still operate."
1984.84-335,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,645.092,647.073,--You haven't briefed it very fully.
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,654.549,656.82,Our position is that Title 3 is totally inapplicable--
1984.84-335,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,656.82,657.772,Because of Keith?
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,657.772,665.967,"--and this Court made that absolutely clear in Keith, so the Court doesn't really need to reach the question of what would be the situation with respect to immunity."
1984.84-335,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,665.967,666.628,Over dissent.
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,666.628,669.029,I beg your pardon?
1984.84-335,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,669.029,670.299,Over dissent.
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,670.299,677.613,"Your Honor, our submission on the appealability question is--"
1984.84-335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,677.613,680.575,"Let me ask you one other question, because I have been puzzled by the extent to which Title 3 is relevant."
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,686.88,688.219,"--I believe so, Your Honor."
1984.84-335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,688.219,689.812,And everybody agrees with that?
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,689.812,690.893,I believe so.
1984.84-335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.893,694.674,There are some traces in your opponent's brief that I didn't read that way.
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,694.674,699.359,We don't understand that the case really--
1984.84-335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,699.359,701.57,That there is any Title 3 issue at all.
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,701.57,722.724,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor, and of course it is on the Bivens issue where the issue of qualified immunity and its appealability arises, so we believe that really is the only issue on which we are here, as far as our petition for certiorari goes."
1984.84-335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,756.675,758.077,Doesn't that argument prove too much?
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,761.897,764.549,"--Well, we think there is a critical distinction."
1984.84-335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,864.456,867.867,It could be made for a lot of statute of limitations defenses.
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,871.78,886.94,"I think, Your Honor, that the sort of the central, central theme of distinction is that it is not enough for a defendant to say I want to come up now, because otherwise I will have to go through a trial, and yet I have a good defense."
1984.84-335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.322,889.842,It is more like double jeopardy.
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,889.842,891.742,It is more like double jeopardy.
1984.84-335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,893.795,901.209,"Is it not equally true of the absolute immunity, for example, that the judiciary has--"
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,901.209,902.141,It is like--
1984.84-335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,902.141,910.887,--that they are to be relieved of the expense and the annoyance and distress of defending a lawsuit so that they can carry on their judicial duties?
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,910.887,920.182,"--That is to say the central theme here is, what is the effect of the system of appeal on the underlying policy of the rule."
1984.84-335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,928.007,930.888,Do you just make this argument when there are no disputes on the facts?
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,935.522,945.06,"Your Honor, if I am going to be precise, I would make the argument not only where there are no disputes, but only insofar as there are no disputes."
1984.84-335,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1262.198,1267.852,"Mr. Bator, does the speech and debate clause procedure have anything to do with this?"
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1267.852,1284.994,"--Well, Your Honor, this Court in one of its precedents... it does not explicitly have anything to do with this case, but one of this Court's precedents, the Helstoski case, holds that there should be an immediate appeal if a speech and debate clause defense is rejected."
1984.84-335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.949,1469.383,"Would that absolute immunity submission on the government's part encompass a violation of Title 3, do you suppose?"
1984.84-335,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1483.752,1491.008,"Your Honor, our absolute immunity claim is generally with respect to preventive action in the national security field."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1603.222,1608.754,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to address the appealability issue first."
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1669.086,1669.576,"Well, that may be so."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1673.559,1674.35,--That's correct.
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.142,1679.033,It just goes to whether we would decide it here or remand.
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1680.955,1686.539,"That's correct, and it also leads to the question of where there is a Title 3 claim, which I will get to later on in the argument."
1984.84-335,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.64,1694.723,"Before you leave the Title 3, you say this is a Title 3 case?"
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1694.723,1700.958,"--Yes, there is, Your Honor, if in fact we are correct in asserting that there was no legitimate national security predicate for this tap."
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.556,1715.628,And Keith is irrelevant.
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1715.628,1722.801,"--Keith is irrelevant, there is a damage remedy, and there is no qualified immunity or absolute immunity available under 2520."
1984.84-335,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.143,1730.868,"But I am still puzzled, because I was under the impression that the District Court had entered a judgment finding a dollar of nominal damages."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1730.868,1731.469,"No, sir."
1984.84-335,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1731.469,1732.29,Was I wrong?
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1732.29,1737.976,This matter was appealed before the District Court could enter damages in this case.
1984.84-335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2000.527,2008.782,"In what kinds of cases are you addressing that, all lawsuits or lawsuits where there is an immunity question lurking?"
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2008.782,2032.368,"The government is suggesting that where there is an insubstantial claim against a government defendant, then in order to protect them from the insubstantial claim at trial, they ought to be allowed to appeal the qualified immunity claim pretrial, but that, I am suggesting to the Court, is exactly the same for virtually every other pretrial motion, including a motion to dismiss which this Court has clearly held for over 50 years."
1984.84-335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2032.368,2040.853,Does the government... at least I took it that the government's argument on that point was limited to cases where there is an immunity question.
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2040.853,2041.824,But I am suggesting--
1984.84-335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2041.824,2042.563,Not just to any lawsuit.
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2042.563,2053.592,"--I am suggesting to the Court that there was no distinction between a qualified immunity decision by a District Court in that regard, if the theory is to get rid of insubstantial suits, and all the other issues I have mentioned."
1984.84-335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2096.789,2109.538,"Translate that for me if you will, counsel, in a speech or debate clause in a hypothetical case where a Senator has made a speech on the floor of the House, so there is no question about it, and then suit is brought."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2113.071,2113.622,Right.
1984.84-335,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2261.388,2262.269,Mr. Rudovsky--
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2262.269,2262.72,--Yes.
1984.84-335,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2262.72,2269.413,--Does the record have anything in it that would really establish a dispute about the purpose?
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2272.485,2275.447,There is an enormous amount of information in the record with respect to the purpose.
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.596,2507.13,"Well, I suppose sooner or later the Court of Appeals is going to get the case anyway on the qualified immunity issue."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2512.232,2513.874,--And in this case the plaintiff has already won.
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.153,2528.824,That may be so.
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2535.447,2540.021,"--No, because a lot of cases beyond the qualified immunity decision may get settled."
1984.84-335,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2552.828,2553.86,I am still puzzled.
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2562.936,2571.05,We do only if we eventually lose our claim under the Constitution or Bivens.
1984.84-335,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.936,2580.217,Where did I get... maybe I just read something.
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2585.272,2594.046,"No, what there is in the record is a stipulation submitted by the plaintiff that he did not suffer any pecuniary loss in this case."
1984.84-335,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.195,2628.218,The thing that troubles me... Justice Brennan adverted to it earlier.
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2644.328,2646.612,To take it further... that is correct.
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.621,2657.297,"Well, if that's correct, why should a District Court... why shouldn't a District Court be obligated to decide the case under a statute before it even reaches the constitutional issue?"
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2657.297,2659.899,"--I have no disagreement with that, Justice White."
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.899,2666.854,"Well, in order to invoke the statute, you have to have a phony national security claim."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2666.854,2671.557,"Well, the standard that you would apply is certainly questionable whether it is primary purpose or whether it has to be phony."
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.557,2672.458,"Well, all right."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2672.458,2673.369,But putting that aside--
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.369,2676.95,You have to decide the national security issue.
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2676.95,2682.646,"--Your Honor, we urged the District Court throughout this case to at least decide at the same time the Title 3 claim."
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.618,2693.09,"Why should appellate courts... this goes to appealability, too, I suppose."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2709.781,2710.973,I am not suggesting that you should.
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.356,2730.394,Well--
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2730.394,2731.285,--I'm sorry.
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.285,2739.14,"--You say the case was over and you were about to have a trial on damages for a Bivens... on a Bivens basis, right?"
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2739.14,2740.111,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.111,2749.628,"Well, I am not sure the case should even have gotten to that point until you decided whether there was a statutory issue."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2749.628,2754.793,"It certainly, as this Court has cautioned District Courts to decide the statutory issue first--"
1984.84-335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.793,2756.303,"Well, it cautioned lawyers, too."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2756.303,2759.085,"--Your Honor, we did urge both points before the District Court."
1984.84-335,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2824.147,2832.382,"Well, I suppose a court in considering it would just assume that the allegations of the complaint are true and then look at the law."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2833.824,2836.476,"There is certainly nothing wrong with that, Justice O'Connor."
1984.84-335,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2836.476,2839.067,"Well, that is what the government says ought to be done here."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2839.067,2855.529,"But when you do that and you determine what the status of the law was at the time of the violation, that is the same kind of analysis, we suggest, on the merits, and I will get to the merits in a minute, in determining whether there was a violation at all, so that regardless of whether that is an easy task or not an easy task... that is not my point."
1984.84-335,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2856.18,2862.053,"In this case, it looks like a pretty easy task on the law, because it wasn't clearly established."
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2862.053,2865.258,"--We have a much different approach, obviously, than the government does on that question."
1984.84-335,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2911.319,2917.931,Didn't Keith itself subsequently say that was an undecided question and had been?
1984.84-335,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2917.931,2919.793,"Keith said that, yes."
1984.84-335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3409.125,3412.358,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Bator?"
1984.84-335,2,37751,paul_m_bator,,3412.358,3416.221,"Your Honor, I have a few matters."
1984.84-335,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3438.977,3443.291,"But on that, Mr. Bator, then do you agree with your opponent that the District Court did not find--"
1984.84-335,2,37751,paul_m_bator,,3443.291,3445.061,"No, Your Honor, we think the District Court did find."
