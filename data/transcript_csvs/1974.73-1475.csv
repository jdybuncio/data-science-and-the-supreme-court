1974.73-1475,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.168,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1475, Harris County Commissioners against Richard E. Moore."
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,32.153,36.047,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,169.109,171.482,How large was that committee?
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,171.482,174.62,"A committee of nine, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,214.02,217.655,"Incidentally, these are staggered terms, are they not?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,217.655,218.59,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,218.59,220.193,"They're staggered terms, are they not?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,220.193,221.53,"Yes, Your Honor, they are."
1974.73-1475,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,221.53,226.085,Do some of them expire in any event on December 31 of this year?
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,226.085,229.296,"And some on December 31 of 1976, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,229.296,233.628,Will the case as to them possibly become moot then?
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,233.628,244.147,It would not become moot as to the recovery of the emoluments of the office from the time that they were ousted from office pursuant to the redistricting to the end of the term of the office.
1974.73-1475,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,244.147,248.471,"The new appointees have qualified and served, have they, and been paid?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,248.471,249.203,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,251.142,252.955,We'll resume there after lunch.
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,252.955,261.55,Thank you.
1974.73-1475,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,261.55,263.647,"You may continue, Mr. Landry."
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,263.647,266.783,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1475,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,569.774,579.507,"Mr. Edward J. Landry, do you think the real problem here is that these people were not allowed to fill out their terms, serve out their terms?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,579.507,582.478,"I think that is solely their complaint, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,582.478,586.215,"If that hadn't been done, do you think you would have had no lawsuit?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,586.215,589.915,"I think not whatever but of course, I cannot."
1974.73-1475,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,589.915,603.999,I should ask the other side but how do you explain the difference between this statute and the one that concerns the commissioners as such which specifically as I recall it permits them to serve out the term?
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,603.999,612.27,"I think that contention was answered, Your Honor in the case of Whitmarsh against Buckley which of course you set out in our brief."
1974.73-1475,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,676.464,682.655,"Well, is that definitively determined as a matter of state law?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,682.655,749.044,"Not with respect to the difference between justices of the peace and constables as opposed to county commissioners, Your Honor and of course that is one of the supporting basis upon which we feel that the District Court should have abstained in this particular case to give the state courts, the opportunity to decide that very question because one of the major contentions of the appellees in this case is that they are truly county officers under the state constitutional provision Article 16, Section 14 and that as a result of being classed as county officers whose residence need only be within the county as opposed to residence within a precinct then under 2351 1/2 they should not be confined to residency within the precinct and 2351 1/2 would be invalid or unconstitutional under state constitutional Article 16, Section 14."
1974.73-1475,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,749.044,754.319,"And the result if that were so, Mr. Landry would be what for these petitioners?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,754.319,757.698,"They would be able to stay in office, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,789.089,794.079,"But that would not satisfy the voter's claim in this case, would it?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,806.313,813.044,"That is one of the basis on which the District Court found that the statute was unconstitutional, Your Honor but we would submit --"
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,813.044,822.001,"Just keeping this people on office and giving them their pay and even allowing them to sit in the new precincts 5, 6 and 7 would not satisfy the voter's claim, would it?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,822.001,844.532,"No, it would not but the fact of the matter is if the District Court's view is correct with regard to that line of reasoning you could never have a redistricting which changed the line to put a resident or citizen outside of the precinct of that in which he elected an officer. (Voice overlap)"
1974.73-1475,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,846.921,857.056,Are you suggesting that the three-judge court as to the voter's claim in effect said their vote was frustrated by the application of the statute?
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,857.056,860.378,"I believe that that is what the three-judge court said, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,860.378,861.882,And what is that.
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,875.288,888.472,"Well, in that case, I suppose the voters would be frustrated but we submit that the state definitely has that power within its own internal political structure."
1974.73-1475,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,888.472,889.973,But this is no different in terms of the voters.
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,889.973,890.718,That's correct.
1974.73-1475,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,900.894,906.965,The three-judge court must have held that there was a federal right of these voters above.
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,913.255,916.018,"Well, I think what the Court did."
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,933.444,935.296,While I have you interrupted Mr. Landry.
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,946.529,948.588,"Well, under the statute Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,957.692,966.252,"Now, and where you have as you do as I understand in the redistrict at four and you have places only for two JP's and one constable?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,966.252,967.277,That is correct.
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,970.071,973.232,"And then for, you have actually resident there."
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,974.49,977.004,Three justices of the peace and two constables.
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.004,977.754,And two constables.
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,984.388,992.572,"No, the three justices of the peace, Your Honor for the two positions authorized obviously they all three cannot fill two positions."
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,992.572,993.739,Right.
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,993.739,1000.133,"So, the statute says that those three -- two positions are to be considered vacated."
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1000.133,1000.906,That's what I mean.
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1009.769,1010.455,That's correct.
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.013,1031.358,"Then I correctly read that the three-judge court, do I, by saying that the reason there's an invidious discrimination here is between no situations."
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1031.358,1031.536,That's correct.
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1031.536,1040.784,"Where you have all the three places to fill and we have only three people there, they get the jobs whereas if you have three places to fill and five people in the district, nobody gets the jobs."
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1040.784,1042.117,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1064.943,1071.579,"Now, incidentally, are justices of the peace, judicial officers under Texas law?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1071.579,1075.152,"They perform judicial duties, yes Your Honor, they handled trials."
1974.73-1475,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1079.865,1084.497,Do you think that they are judicial officers under our cases?
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1084.497,1088.579,"Your Honor, I've no point here, frankly saying I do not know the answer to that question."
1974.73-1475,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1088.579,1097.975,Of course you know that we have not applied the Reynolds v. Sims principles to election of judicial officers.
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1097.975,1101.522,"I must have missed that case entirely, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.204,1105.965,You may have just thought of -– you haven't run in to any case of applying it?
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1105.965,1107.032,"No, I have not."
1974.73-1475,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1119.787,1122.846,Or are you suggesting that perhaps as to the justices of the peace.
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1127.322,1132.211,"Well, of course, constables have jurisdiction outside of their precinct."
1974.73-1475,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1179.119,1191.029,"But Justice Blackmun asked you before lunch whether one or two of the terms or one of these may expire December 31, are they eligible for re-election?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1191.029,1195.146,"They were eligible for the general election this year, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1207.991,1209.113,And did he win?
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1209.113,1212.439,"No, sir he did not."
1974.73-1475,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.338,1229.11,What does the three-judge court mean by a convenient redistricting?
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1229.11,1246.439,"Well, that is the term set out in the constitutional Article 5, -- state constitutional Article 5, Section 18 which is the authority, Your Honor, for the redistricting by a Commissioners Court of its county's justice precincts."
1974.73-1475,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.439,1250.705,But why are they called -- does it have some special meaning of the convenience?
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1250.705,1265.828,"Well, the phrase of course for the convenience of the people and, I think probably, this Court went into great study and great deliberation of that phrase in Avery against Midland County and of course in Avery against Midland County --"
1974.73-1475,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1265.828,1270.009,"So, it is convenient?"
1974.73-1475,0,22684,edward_j_landry,,1270.009,1284.235,"Well, convenience of course, in terms of justice of the peace precincts, now that this Court has decided that one vote, -- one man, one vote applies to Commissioners Court."
1974.73-1475,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1404.3,1409.415,"Thank you, Mr. Landry."
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1410.818,1414.215,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1475,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1550.002,1551.526,"Well, it isn't as bad at it was, is it?"
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1551.526,1556.949,"It wasn't as bad but it's still substantially out of the line but I think our concept as it are evolving today, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1556.949,1562.901,But you -- you didn't complain that that one was more poorly apportioned than it is not?
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1562.901,1564.076,I don't understand the question.
1974.73-1475,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.373,1569.763,"Well, you say one of the grounds of your actions for the three-judge District Court was malapportionment."
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1569.763,1570.325,Yes.
1974.73-1475,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1570.325,1579.786,And yet you never complained of the even more poorly apportioned justice districts that existed before the commissioners took this action.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1579.786,1592.34,"Your Honor, when I was employed in this case I immediately complained about as it now exists because it still I think significantly out of line with the intent of the Courts' decisions in all of the cases requisite to apportionment."
1974.73-1475,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1592.34,1598.194,Do you mean you asked that the redistricting be set aside?
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1598.194,1599.691,"I sure did, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1606.872,1610.108,"Under what, well excuse me, I'm just trying to get this clear."
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1616.765,1618.719,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1631.117,1632.758,I understand that but it's all damages.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1638.394,1640.91,We've raised it that this is unconstitutional because --
1974.73-1475,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1640.91,1642.778,Did you ask for that remedy?
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1642.778,1647.138,"No, I didn't ask for the remedy that with the Court issue, an order ordering redistricting."
1974.73-1475,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.232,1662.052,What federal constitutional significance do you think this disparity is?
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1662.052,1666.926,"It's a dilution of the vote for one thing, Your Honor of voters in the same class."
1974.73-1475,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1666.926,1676.04,What cases here would indicate that this so-called malapportionment of the JP districts would raise a federal question.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1676.04,1677.791,Perhaps I can answer it this way.
1974.73-1475,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1715.828,1722.702,But if your clients have only been new clients for only two in number JP's.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1722.702,1723.091,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1723.091,1732.659,"And they both lived in the redistricted four and you had another client, a single client who was a constable and he lived in the redistricting four, you wouldn't be here, would you?"
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1732.659,1734.282,Unless some other one who was thrown out in employee -- (Voice Overlap)
1974.73-1475,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1734.282,1735.428,"No, no, no."
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1735.915,1737.586,Those people would not be here.
1974.73-1475,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1737.586,1737.919,That's right.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1737.919,1739.485,Because they would not have been abused.
1974.73-1475,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1739.485,1746.431,"Well, if that were the case, you would not have been seeking a redistricting, a redoing of the redistricting plan, would you?"
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1746.431,1756.23,That's right because those particular people would have not complained if they had not been harmed but those who came under the alternate provisions would have been harmed and they would have been here seeking this relief.
1974.73-1475,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.583,1777.065,"Justice White asked you a moment ago what cases from this Court you rely on to raise the federal question as to the districting requirements, what federal -- what case of this Court do you rely on?"
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1777.065,1779.151,"You mean so far as asking them to redistrict, Your Honor?"
1974.73-1475,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.151,1780.337,Yes.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1780.337,1781.817,We did not ask for redistricting.
1974.73-1475,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.817,1790.521,"Well, but you say there is the federal or constitutional malapportionment claim which I understand you are asserting, what cases of this Court you rely on to support it?"
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1790.521,1799.409,I think the same Avery and I think Reynolds both Your Honor and I think the same ruling that applied to commissioners would apply here once the Fourteenth Amendment attaches.
1974.73-1475,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1913.415,1914.746,May I ask this one question.

1974.73-1475,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1915.512,1918.98,Justice of the peace judicial officers in Texas?
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1918.98,1920.668,They performed judicial function.
1974.73-1475,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1936.512,1941.841,And they are covered to the same extent as other elected officers and so far as this Court is concerned.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1941.841,1944.151,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1944.151,1946.852,And the case being what?
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1946.852,1953.511,"Insofar as judicial office is being covered, in regard to Fourteenth Amendment rights Your Honor."

1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,1996.086,1997.982,"Well, it's called the Commissioners Court."
1974.73-1475,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.174,2009.877,Does it actually decide litigated cases?
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2009.877,2015.887,"No, sir but the county judge himself does hear cases but the Court as an entity makes decisions."
1974.73-1475,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2026.836,2029.508,"In other states it's generally called the county commissioners, isn't it?"
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2029.508,2033.341,"Yes, Your Honor, I think this is an old historical term that has been used in its --"
1974.73-1475,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2033.341,2037.133,In Texas and in Missouri and maybe some other states call them the county court.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2037.133,2037.545,Right.
1974.73-1475,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2037.545,2042.142,This is why in Massachusetts it's referred to as the Supreme Judicial Court?
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2042.142,2047.37,"Yes, Your Honor, I have a very limited time because of split argument."
1974.73-1475,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2333.875,2339.347,"If the Attorney General takes that position, why isn't he here?"
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2339.347,2341.427,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2346.53,2355.72,"Well, if the Attorney General say, if that opinion of the Attorney Generals had turned out to be the law of Texas then you wouldn't have the same lawsuit you have now at all, would you?"
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2355.72,2356.538,"Not in the future, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2356.538,2361.863,And that suggests that the District Court should have at least abstained to find out what the law of Texas is.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2361.863,2364.788,"No, because they have historically ignored generally the opinion."
1974.73-1475,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2424.337,2435.953,"Now, but the District Court issued a decree on the hypothesis of Texas law provided for one thing and you have now just told us that that's far from clear."
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2435.953,2436.146,"What is that, Your Honor?"
1974.73-1475,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2436.146,2439.874,Whether any federal court can decide a case if the state law is unclear?
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2439.874,2440.806,I don't think the statute.
1974.73-1475,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.333,2448.43,But you told us that the Attorney General at the State of Texas told us that it meant something quite different.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2448.43,2450.455,"Well, this is an opinion, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.976,2457.0,Right.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2457.0,2458.79,"Of the statute, I realized that."
1974.73-1475,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2458.79,2460.961,But at least he introduced the conclusion.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2460.961,2470.244,"Simply I wished he hadn't because we have the matter in litigation but he was not aware, I'm sure of the fact that he was before a three-judge federal court."
1974.73-1475,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.112,2479.68,The Attorney General's opinion wouldn't reach -- wouldn't solve the voter's call?
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2479.68,2481.24,"None whatsoever, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2484.696,2486.465,The tenure of the officeholders not the law.
1974.73-1475,1,18934,c_anthony_friloux_jr,,2486.465,2490.043,"That's so, it would not addressed itself to substantial questions in the voting."
1974.73-1475,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2499.231,2500.362,Mr. Gilleland?
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2500.362,2503.429,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1475,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2647.979,2655.215,"Now, in the 1965 Act, was just designed to ameliorate part of the consequences of those Texas constitutional decision."
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2655.215,2656.779,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.342,2666.559,"Do you have the same result, why wouldn't that be the case if the three-judge court holds exactly that?"
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2666.559,2669.366,That we would have to challenge the --
1974.73-1475,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.366,2674.058,Why wouldn't they – if it is that 1965 legislation is unconstitutional?
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2677.061,2704.749,"Your Honor, it would be my position that declaratory judgment that we sought within the three-judge panel hearing and that was subsequently issued by the Court was that any -- that 2351 1/2 (c) was facially unconstitutional and of course it's effect was to remove an elected official from office and in the opinion of the Court it states specifically that any Act or this particular Act that would removed an elected official from office."
1974.73-1475,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2704.749,2708.798,Then all the offices were vacated?
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2708.798,2709.465,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.465,2711.496,And there wasn't any discrimination.
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2711.496,2712.636,That is correct.
1974.73-1475,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2712.636,2720.244,"So, wouldn't the three-judge district court had to hold the Texas constitutional provisions invalid, too?"
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2720.244,2722.035,"Now, would you repeat your question, sir."
1974.73-1475,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2722.035,2731.868,"Well, since the ‘65 Act was just to ameliorate some of the conceived hardships visited by the earlier Texas decisions interpreting the Texas Constitution."
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2742.978,2749.273,"Your Honor, I would probably agree with the Court that it would and surely have gone further in this decision."
1974.73-1475,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2805.177,2816.084,"Well then, then the Due Process theme of the three-judge district court would hold the Texas constitutional provisions invalid just as surely as it would the ‘65 legislative Act?"
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2816.084,2825.085,"I see what the Court, yes sir, just carrying it one step further in reasoning, it would even though it wasn't specifically set out in the Court's order."
1974.73-1475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2825.085,2837.981,"Now, the order of the Court did was not to keep these people in office simply but to absolutely enjoin the redistricting, didn't it?"
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2837.981,2840.237,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2853.087,2854.073,"No, I didn't say --"
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2854.073,2854.774,Maybe I'm not.
1974.73-1475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2854.774,2856.186,"No, it didn't that was much broader."

1974.73-1475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2886.956,2889.998,"Yes, well it just didn't allow any redistricting?"
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2889.998,2892.162,That is correct.
1974.73-1475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.162,2903.843,Any redistricting that would result presumably in the change of a residence of a magistrate or a commissioner or a JP.

1974.73-1475,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2908.753,2911.487,"Well certainly, it's what the appendix says, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1475,2,30446,john_g_gilleland,,2911.487,2912.136,No sir.
1974.73-1475,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2912.136,2914.529,The order says so.

1974.73-1475,3,22684,edward_j_landry,,3414.881,3425.793,That's correct but as I've said in answer to the question we've only been before the Courts since the order in an attempt to seek a stay.
1974.73-1475,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3425.793,3428.916,And didn't argue that proposal is broader than what you said in the appeal you were going --
1974.73-1475,3,22684,edward_j_landry,,3428.916,3438.381,"No, we did not Your Honor but of course, we argued that if the order was far overrating when we sought the stay from Mr. Justice Powell."
1974.73-1475,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.381,3440.598,"Which came out first, the opinion of the order?"
1974.73-1475,3,22684,edward_j_landry,,3440.598,3442.179,The order came down on the very day of the hearing.
1974.73-1475,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3442.179,3443.694,"(Voice Overlap), Mr. Justice Powell."
1974.73-1475,3,22684,edward_j_landry,,3443.694,3444.34,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3464.679,3470.245,The opinion is followed there and do you think that an effect to modifying the order or --
1974.73-1475,3,22684,edward_j_landry,,3470.245,3471.664,"Well, that's just our hope, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3471.664,3477.984,"But in any event you didn't go to the Court and said, “Look, your opinion now was much narrower than the order.”"
1974.73-1475,3,22684,edward_j_landry,,3477.984,3488.402,"We haven't had to, Your Honor in the light of Mr. Justice Powell's stay and in of course the hope that this Court will provide us with the relief that we're seeking."
1974.73-1475,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3555.589,3569.517,"The trouble with that Mr. Landry according to your brothers is that there is no prompt way for getting a resolution or construction in the Texas Courts, as your Harris County Courts are terribly behind and impeded."
1974.73-1475,3,22684,edward_j_landry,,3576.591,3578.322,"I differed very greatly, Your Honor."
1974.73-1475,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3590.451,3595.318,He represented us professionally that this would be a very long procedure.
1974.73-1475,3,22684,edward_j_landry,,3595.318,3601.381,There is no question that there may be some delay but it is not unreasonable delay.
1974.73-1475,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3601.381,3613.184,"Mr. Landry, a number of states now have had statutes which permit certification from the federal court to the highest court of state for the disposition of a question of state law."
1974.73-1475,3,22684,edward_j_landry,,3614.792,3615.027,"Your Honor, --"
1974.73-1475,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3615.027,3616.699,Uniform statute on the subject matter.
1974.73-1475,3,22684,edward_j_landry,,3616.699,3618.721,I simply do not know the answer to the question.
1974.73-1475,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3618.721,3626.764,Do you think this Court has inherent powers to certify to a state whether it has a statute of that kind or not or haven't you given it any thought?
1974.73-1475,3,22684,edward_j_landry,,3626.764,3636.019,I have not given it any thought Your Honor but I would certainly think that the Supreme Court of the United States would have that kind of power.
1974.73-1475,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3636.019,3636.394,Very well.
