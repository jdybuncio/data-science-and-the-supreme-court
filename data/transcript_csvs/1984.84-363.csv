1984.84-363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.866,We'll hear arguments next in Northeast Bancorp against the Federal Reserve.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,103.608,106.563,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,392.188,400.202,"But doesn't the very paucity of language, Mr. Shapiro, suggest that the states were given very wide latitude; that all Congress was interested in was state approval?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,400.202,401.794,"To the contrary, Your Honor."
1984.84-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,423.818,444.802,"Well, Mr Shapiro, I suppose the McCarran-Ferguson Act doesn't really make it unmistakably clear that states can adopt reciprocal discriminatory taxes, and yet, the Court upheld that power in cases like Western and Southern."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,444.802,449.735,"That's a very important question, and the distinction is between night and day; and let me explain that."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.495,548.841,"Well, Mr. Shapiro, suppose it were perfectly clear, that the Douglas Amemdment was perfectly clear to the effect that the state may pick and choose?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,551.963,562.217,"Well, if the Douglas Amendment such as S. 2851, the bill that was considered by Congress, said that a state may pick and choose among sister states, there would be no Commerce Clause issue."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.252,571.174,But that would be only... that would be the only remaining issue would be--
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,571.174,572.315,That is correct.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.315,575.448,--So doesn't this case just turn on what Congress intended?
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,575.448,579.609,It turns on the specific language of the Douglas Amendment.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.609,583.793,How do you ever get to any constitutional issue other than the compact issue?
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,583.793,589.046,"The Commerce Clause issue does turn on the meaning of the Douglas Amendment, that's quite correct."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.046,596.312,"And if they intended it to give the states the right to pick and choose, there isn't any Commerce--"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,596.312,597.42,That's correct.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,598.692,602.686,"--But if they didn't... if they didn't intend to reach that, then what?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,602.686,611.252,"If they didn't intend to permit the states to pick and choose and to gang up against their sister states, then there is a black letter violation of the Commerce Clause."
1984.84-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,614.644,620.776,"Well, I suppose, Mr. Shapiro, you had an equal protection claim below which you dropped."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,620.776,624.149,--We have reinserted that issue--
1984.84-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,624.149,626.63,After reading Metropolitan Life.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,626.63,627.201,--That is correct.
1984.84-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,629.715,639.679,I wonder if you think that having read that case that you think the Massachusetts and Connecticut statutes could survive an equal protection challenge under that doctrine?
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,639.679,646.895,"We think for the reasons that we explained in our supplemental brief that they clearly do not, and we have suggested that the Court may wish to consider this issue."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.565,725.516,Let me go back there.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,742.278,742.989,That's correct.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.989,744.077,Unless the state agrees.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,744.077,744.828,That is correct.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,744.828,761.91,"Well, if these agreements by the state are not the kind of agreements the Douglas Amendment purported to permit, then why shouldn't the ban... why shouldn't the ban against out-of-state acquisitions take over?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,768.495,771.907,The ban would certainly be back in place unless and until--
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.907,773.407,How would you ever reach a Commerce Clause issue?
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,773.407,781.521,"--Unless and until the state enacted a constitutional statute lifting the ban, there would be no acquisition."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.521,790.908,"So why wouldn't... if we agreed with you that Congress didn't intend to let the states pick and choose, then these states have not given the right kind of consent."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,790.908,793.229,"Well, these states--"
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.229,794.711,They haven't given any consent.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,794.711,801.336,"--These states have enacted laws that purport to give consent, but they're unconstitutional laws that have no blessing from the Douglas Amendment."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.336,803.266,"Well, they're not the kind that Congress anticipated."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,803.266,804.218,That's correct.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,804.218,811.052,"They didn't intend to permit states to act in this way, in which event there's no way to avoid the general ban."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,811.052,811.983,That's correct.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.734,814.354,"Well, then how do you ever reach a constitutional issue?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,814.354,827.793,"--Well, the Commerce Clause contains a rule of constitutional law that is of assistance to the Court in construing what the Douglas Amendment means, what it admits to allow."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.793,849.356,"If the Douglas Amendment had said bank holding companies may not acquire banks from out of state except that states may consent to do that, but we do not intend to give the states the power to pick and choose, and if they try to pick and choose, it shall not be deemed consent for purposes of this amendment."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,849.356,851.559,"Well, that's--"
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.559,854.401,Why isn't that really what you're arguing?
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,854.401,859.884,"--It's very close to what we're arguing, but our position I suppose is slightly different in this sense."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.027,880.538,"Well, all right."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,888.603,889.464,--That is correct.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,889.464,894.397,So neither the New York banks or anybody else could... may acquire an out-of-state bank.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,894.397,895.408,That is quite correct.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.414,909.376,"Well, I'm suggesting that if we agreed with you, we'd never need to talk about the Commerce Clause."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,909.376,911.379,"We're not far apart, Your Honor."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.936,1068.209,"Well, Mr. Shapiro, do you think the statement of the Board that Congress has just been silent with respect to this pick and choose business, that doesn't necessarily destroy the deference that's due the Board, because the Board nevertheless though it was consistent with the statute to do what it did."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1068.209,1069.291,"Well, the Board--"
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1069.291,1070.042,Isn't that right?
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1070.042,1072.312,"--We don't think so, Your Honor, because--"
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.312,1074.474,You mean they said we were acting contrary to the statute?
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1074.474,1077.586,--They said they were waiting for judicial clarification.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.807,1083.059,"But nevertheless, they felt there was room under the statute to do what they did."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1083.059,1083.44,--Yes.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.44,1084.241,Or they wouldn't have done it.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1084.241,1089.213,"And the rationale was this renunciation theory which, with great respect, is totally in error."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1091.025,1095.808,"Well, I know, but they nevertheless thought that the statute permitted what they were doing."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1095.808,1098.119,--On this theory of renunciation.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.119,1100.951,"Well, I don't... on the theory of silence."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1107.546,1108.627,But silence--
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.627,1111.518,And why shouldn't... and they left that up to us.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1111.518,1115.199,"--Silence, under this Court's opinions, is certainly not sufficient."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.369,1139.296,I would think you'd have to concede that you have the problem of convincing us that there's only one construction permissible under this statute with respect to picking and choosing.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1139.296,1140.818,--Yes.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.218,1144.251,"I mean the Board could have decided it the other way, too."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1144.251,1155.618,"--The silence of the statute on the issue of picking and choosing means that there is no unmistakable intent that Congress meant to permit something like this, completely destructive of principles that the Founding Fathers were concerned about."
1984.84-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.78,1176.662,"Mr. Shapiro, may I question right there?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1176.662,1177.54,"--and for the other Congressmen who voted on it, and for the President who signed this law."
1984.84-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1177.54,1185.227,"There are really two conditions in the state statutes here: one, that the other, the acquiring bank be in New England, and secondly that they have a reciprocal provision."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1189.067,1198.985,"The reciprocity provision is one of dubious constitutionality, of course, under this Court's decision, its decisions."
1984.84-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.263,1233.277,"But your argument would be that if that... if we thought that violated the Constitution apart from the statute, the statute would not save that either."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1233.277,1234.578,That's quite correct.
1984.84-363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1349.373,1354.355,"Is this an argument, Mr. Shapiro, that we should do nothing until Congress has acted?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1354.355,1355.947,"It's the reverse, Your Honor."
1984.84-363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1393.882,1395.783,"Well, suppose we don't agree with you?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1395.783,1398.334,On the Commerce Clause issue?
1984.84-363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1398.334,1398.965,Yes.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1398.965,1411.144,"The second issue in that event would be the Compact Clause issue, and the question, of course, is whether this amounts to a compact or an agreement among the states which requires Congress' approval."
1984.84-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1417.328,1423.302,"Well, just what is it that you say Connecticut and Massachusetts have agreed to?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1423.302,1433.59,This Court's opinions establish that reciprocal statutes can constitute compacts or agreements if they have the effects that the Founding Fathers were concerned about.
1984.84-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1445.885,1453.341,"But there are various kinds of reciprocal statutes on many different subjects on the books, are there not?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1453.341,1456.063,"--That's quite true, Your Honor, and what is unique--"
1984.84-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1456.063,1457.465,And you think all of those are suspect.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1457.465,1458.264,--We do not.
1984.84-363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1486.143,1487.022,Maybe it isn't a compact.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1491.596,1500.463,"--We say not only is it a compact because of the reciprocal nature of the statutes, but also because of the joint action in adopting these statutes."
1984.84-363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1531.815,1549.777,"Well, what if Connecticut, Mr. Shapiro, had simply adopted a statute that said we will allow out-of-state banks to come in so long as the state in which the bank is incorporated allows our bank to come in... just simple reciprocity without the New England regional aspect?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1549.777,1568.557,"We say a simple reciprocity statute does not have to go to Congress because it's not... although it could be characterized as a multistate agreement under the Multistate Tax case, it wouldn't have those deleterious effects on the Union and the equality of the states in the Union that requires Congress' approval."
1984.84-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1633.8,1635.453,"Mr. Shapiro, can I interrupt you?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1646.128,1647.07,That is correct.
1984.84-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.299,1650.002,Where does that appear in the papers?
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1650.002,1655.495,"--On the face of the paper you'll see the Department of Justice's names, but you'll see no representative from the Board listed."
1984.84-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1655.495,1657.558,But there's no comment on that in any of the papers.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1657.558,1658.128,No comment on that.
1984.84-363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.361,1664.831,"Well, doesn't the... the Solicitor General does have authority to represent the Board."
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1664.831,1665.733,"Yes, he does."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.888,1679.801,"Well, you don't suggest that in every case where the Government is up here and there's an agency involved that an agency's name is on the brief?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1679.801,1683.023,"--Not in every case, but with the Board that is indeed the practice."
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1683.023,1684.496,"Well, how do we know that?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1684.496,1686.956,Mr. Lee can confirm this.
1984.84-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.921,1693.522,"Well, what if he doesn't?"
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1695.042,1698.054,The Court can see for itself in the disagreement.
1984.84-363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1698.054,1701.417,You'll deal with that on rebuttal if we allow you any rebuttal time.
1984.84-363,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1701.417,1703.027,Thank you very much.
1984.84-363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1703.027,1706.409,Mr. Solicitor General.
1984.84-363,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1706.409,1708.881,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.316,2284.23,"Mr. Lee, I suppose you would agree, though, that a state couldn't attach an unconstitutional condition to the consent."
1984.84-363,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2289.443,2291.173,"Of course, of course."
1984.84-363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.173,2292.445,So there is some limit on the state's--
1984.84-363,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2292.445,2293.917,Of course there is.
1984.84-363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2336.153,2342.898,--What if it said something like provided that the acquiring bank doesn't charge interest rates that are different from those that prevail in our state or something like that?
1984.84-363,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2346.909,2365.392,"--Well, I think it would once again come back to whether that was or was not a commerce-related concern, and that's also, Justice Stevens, why Mr. Shapiro's attempted distinction between this restriction, this geographic restriction and the reciprocity restriction or the grandfathering provisions or any others just won't wash."
1984.84-363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.718,2469.55,"Well, if they do, they're certainly can't be any Commerce--"
1984.84-363,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2469.55,2472.062,"That is absolutely correct, Justice White."
1984.84-363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2473.892,2480.517,"--How can the Board... how can the Board have some constitutional doubts; that if it really thinks Congress intended to do this, what's left of the--"
1984.84-363,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2480.517,2489.303,--Because they didn't understand this Court's decisions in Western and Southern and in Prudential Insurance v. Benjamin.
1984.84-363,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2492.786,2499.811,Mr. Tribe.
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2499.811,2503.584,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-363,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2784.115,2794.492,"But, Mr. Tribe, would the case be any different in your view if they thought that there was particularly dangerous competition from, say, California and New York, and so we'll let every state except those two in?"
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2794.492,2796.523,"Justice Stevens, I think it would be no different."
1984.84-363,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2797.745,2798.984,"Just New York, every state except New York."
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2798.984,2807.62,"--I think the question in that case would be is there a rational basis for singling out New York by name or New York and California by name, just as in--"
1984.84-363,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.62,2809.453,"Well, the reason is we don't like New York."
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2809.453,2812.625,"--Well, if the reason is we don't like New Yorkers, pure and simple--"
1984.84-363,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2812.625,2813.386,--in particular.
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2813.386,2814.756,--Then it looks pretty bad.
1984.84-363,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2844.916,2851.091,"But you seem to be arguing there that the reasons were sufficient; in other words, that there was a justification for discrimination."
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2859.186,2863.757,"I guess, Justice Stevens, that would surely be a harder case, but I would say that it would require new law--"
1984.84-363,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2863.757,2865.379,Why would it be harder?
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2865.379,2881.408,"--Well, I suppose it would be harder because I can imagine this Court saying that like persons, states are subject to a norm of equality, and that if states by name are treated differently by other states, there must at least be a rational basis for the difference."
1984.84-363,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2881.408,2883.02,Even when Congress says it's okay?
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2883.02,2889.305,"I think when Congress says it's okay, Central Roeig suggests that that's decisive, and I think though harder, we would still win the case."
1984.84-363,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2889.305,2890.544,"See, that's what puzzles me."
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2898.862,2904.104,"Well, if Congress has said it's okay, there still is a Fifth Amendment problem, I suppose, with the validity of what Congress did."
1984.84-363,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2915.241,2926.018,Would there be a potentially bigger problem in the instance posed by virtue of the Equal Protection Clause analysis of Metropolitan Life?
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2926.018,2933.624,"--Well, I would think if Metropolitan Life were extended into a truly destructive engine for all laws of this kind, there might be a problem."
1984.84-363,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.968,2959.881,In order to preserve a regional home team.
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2960.602,2962.352,"--Well, I suppose."
1984.84-363,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2962.352,2965.524,"AAA competition, not the major leagues."
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2965.524,2970.148,"They were holding a regional meet, and they weren't ready yet to invite the big leagues in."
1984.84-363,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2970.148,2975.702,"Well, Mr. Tribe, could Connecticut say we'll let in New York banks, but only some New York banks?"
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2975.702,2980.735,"And if they picked and choosed in... picked and chose in a wholly arbitrary, irrational way?"
1984.84-363,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2980.735,2982.397,Whatever way they pick--
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2982.397,2984.727,I guess there would be potential equal protection problems.
1984.84-363,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2984.727,2986.087,--Has Congress allowed them to do that?
1984.84-363,2,35184,laurence_henry_tribe,,2987.499,2993.764,I think that under the Equal Protection Clause in Shapiro Congress couldn't delegate to them the power invidiously to pick and choose.
1984.84-363,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3199.928,3202.33,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Shapiro?"

1984.84-363,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.188,3279.12,"However we decide the case, we're leaving it to Congress."
1984.84-363,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3279.12,3284.974,"Yes, but in the interim serious harm could be done to commercial interests in boycotted states like the state of New York."
1984.84-363,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.571,3300.925,You are renewing your Equal Protection Clause argument here.
1984.84-363,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3300.925,3301.246,"We are, sir."
