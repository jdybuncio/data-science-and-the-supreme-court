1965.2,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,66.437,No. 2 United States Petitioner versus Frank Ramona.
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,69.919,73.678,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.2,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.9,280.876,"Which means that under the rule of Classen against the United States, both of these statutory inferences are necessarily before us in this case, does it not, because the sentences were concurrent identical sentences, were they?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,280.876,282.18,I must have mislead Your Honor.
1965.2,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,290.534,290.88,Yes.
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,290.88,292.371,– because there was an additional fine --
1965.2,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,292.371,293.217,"Yeah, it's just –-"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,293.217,297.341,"– but as to the second count, production --"
1965.2,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,297.341,297.469,That concerns –-
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,297.469,299.501,-- that concurrent with the conspiracy --
1965.2,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,299.501,300.408,I see.
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,300.408,314.125,"Now as I will explain, the conspiracy convictions were affirmed by the Second Circuit, a petition from those affirmances was taken here and denied."
1965.2,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.555,335.049,"So only possession is necessarily before us, is that it?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,335.049,354.509,"Yes, on the other the Court of Appeals, perhaps unnecessarily, did reach the conviction on the second count and did hold unconstitutional the presumption involved in the second count applicable to the crime of production."
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,386.861,390.505,"Well, what would that leave for us to decide?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,390.505,391.708,Only the possession --
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,391.708,392.683,Only the possession.
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,392.683,394.992,"The possession, presumption."
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,394.992,397.591,Presumption.
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,397.591,432.443,"Now I may say even as to that, that the court below it had no occasion to reach it under its holding, might have avoided even a decision there had it thought the cumulative sentences were improper in the circumstances, thus eliminating the fine of the third count and leaving only sentences concurrent with the one count, which is finally affirmed and not open here."
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,831.817,843.039,[Inaudible] in the way of what's required of the government to prove in addition to presence at the Crime of Possession?
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,843.039,853.263,"So far as this case is concerned and the situation involved in this case, Mr. Justice Brennan, the proof is the same in this respect."
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,873.703,886.507,[Inaudible] and became carrying on production and possession?
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,886.507,888.2,Yes.
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,888.2,895.833,"And if there is, what I'm asking is, the presumptions permit inferences based on their presence, do they not?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,895.833,900.396,"But that presence, Mr. Justice Brennan, is not identical in all three cases."
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,987.481,1012.484,"Well, in any of those circumstances, he might be where the still is actually operating, his mere presence might support where it's operating, and the government's proof is that it was operating, convictions on counts for all three when all the reason in the way of proof is he was there, nearby, and that the still was operating?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1012.484,1013.372,That is true that is --
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1013.372,1016.84,"As there for three counts, there could be convictions of all three?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1016.84,1017.442,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1017.545,1019.14,And that's that much proof and no more?
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1019.14,1048.555,"In some cases as in this case when the still is actually in full blown operation, the elements of all the presumptions are satisfied, except as I mentioned the additional ingredient which must be proved even over and above the presence which is failure to register or failure to obtain a bond or in the cases of production failure to obtain an operating permit."
1965.2,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1065.772,1083.582,"If a truck driver were delivering supplies to the still and was found there, would the presumption and the possession apply to him?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1083.582,1094.038,"Your Honor, if he was found on the inside, next to the still, the presumption would apply to him."
1965.2,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1094.038,1094.704,The still would --
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1094.704,1104.69,"I think it would have to, so as to justify the inference that anyone found there is likely to be guilty of the substantive presence."
1965.2,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1104.69,1109.627,The statute makes that distinction between inside and outside of the still?
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1109.627,1112.248,It says at the site of the still.
1965.2,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1127.913,1147.181,"Suppose somebody came to the still to pick up some of the beverage I think it's that's produced there, would the presumption apply to him and would he therefore be presumed that he was engaged in the Crime or Possession on the still?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1147.181,1149.028,We would say so Your Honor.
1965.2,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1178.424,1185.842,Perhaps that is rather unusual use of the word possession?
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1185.842,1200.506,We concede that that is so Your Honor though preserving the element of physical proximity it seems to us does limit the amount of strain we impose on the word.
1965.2,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1282.62,1295.243,"I don't want to protrude this, but as I understood you a moment ago, you said that there is a difference between the various crimes clustering around this offense."
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1314.464,1330.774,"Your Honor, I say there is a difference in terms of the time span covered by the two offenses, in terms of the proximity to the skill, to this still involved and in terms of the purpose of the two statutes."
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1410.663,1430.604,"[Inaudible] it might depend exactly where on the site or how near the site the accused was, whether he could be prosecuted for possession as against carrying on or as against production, did you make a distinction on that?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1430.604,1453.356,"Well, I was only suggesting an answer to a question, Mr. Justice Brennan that a person found on the outside of the building in our case might not be viewed as sufficiently close to the still to be in possession of it or for that matter for any of these presumptions to come into play, all of which depend upon presence at the site of the still."
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1458.91,1460.883,This would apply to all three presumptions?
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1460.883,1462.506,That applies to all three presumptions.
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1462.506,1473.752,"Well, then I didn't understand you to make a distinction between his location as determining whether he could be prosecuted for possession as against production as against carrying out?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1473.752,1486.44,"With reference to a person there, no sir, but with reference to a person not there, he couldn't be prosecuted for possession I say, whereas he could be prosecuted without benefit of the presumption for the other two crimes."
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1486.44,1503.214,"May I ask and that is certainly -- where there is evidence, which might support an inference, if the trial judge obliges to submit the question of guilt from presence in the government's view, perhaps not in Gainey, is that it?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1503.214,1510.741,We fully accept the decision in Gainey and in no way are attempting here to expand it with reference to the other crimes.
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1510.741,1513.257,"No, but to apply that same rule --"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1513.257,1513.547,We would apply that --
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1513.547,1516.967,As the judge's discretion to all of these offenses?
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1516.967,1533.232,"And likewise, we would emphasize the rule very clearly articulated in Gainey that the judge is not to suggest to the jury that they are required to infer a guilt from presence, but are merely authorized or permitted to do so."
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1533.232,1538.674,And on Gainey not even required to submit to the jury at all?
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1538.674,1540.282,That is correct.
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1552.548,1552.921,Before –-
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1552.921,1558.657,– before that opinion was written.
1965.2,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1632.436,1640.791,"If this is a narrower offense insofar as the -- in this offense, the still has to actually be producing whiskey, doesn't it?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1640.791,1656.714,"In terms of the time that which it comes into play, it is narrower and that reason alone suggests why there are more cases of involving carrying on the business."
1965.2,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1732.463,1736.805,[Inaudible]
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1736.805,1741.905,"I am sorry Your Honor, I don't know, I am informed that it is a place of about 3,000."
1965.2,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1741.905,1764.95,"[Inaudible] said that whenever any presence is found at the scene of a murder, the man has been killed recently, the jury is charged to assume he didn't?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1764.95,1769.347,I should hope I would not have to defend that presumption Mr. Justice Black.
1965.2,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1769.347,1773.401,"Well, at present he is there?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1773.401,1778.817,But so may other innocent bystanders very likely to be there.
1965.2,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1800.098,1830.368,"[Inaudible] that it probably has a right, but it does not have a right to search that the jury should find the man guilty, by certain evidence, [Inaudible] legislature does have the right to do so that the Court must permit the jury to find the man guilty, if they find the his presence, presence by the still's operation?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1830.368,1832.29,"We don't say must, Mr. Justice Black."
1965.2,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1832.396,1837.842,"I know you don't say they must do it, but they must, that must be enough to permit them to do it?"
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1837.842,1839.092,But the trial Judge –-
1965.2,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1839.092,1842.955,Whether the Jury and Court make it should be enough?
1965.2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1842.955,1859.942,"Well, that is true sir, but we do recognize the caveat in Gainey that the Trial Judge need not even submit to the Jury a case in which presence is shown and remains unexplained."
1965.2,1,44625,w_paul_flynn,,1892.327,1897.091,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
