1971.71-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.763,"We will hear arguments next in 71-492, Lloyd Corp. against Tanner."
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,60.142,64.784,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.71-492,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,226.421,230.499,"And how many public streets run through these, five or six, as I remember?"
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,230.499,237.756,"Yes, there are, they run through the various parts of the center, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1971.71-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,243.584,256.13,"Are the public streets identifiable in any way, marked in any way that we see them on here?"
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,256.13,268.314,"There are pictures of the malls and of the public areas, but I don't think that there is a picture of the street as such."
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.314,270.063,"Well, Mr. Black --"
1971.71-492,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.063,276.74,"Exhibit on Page 115 show the Broadway, Weidler, Halsey, they are all public streets --"
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,276.74,283.491,"Yes, the map that I understood you mean in addition to that map at Page 115."
1971.71-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,509.842,513.101,We will pick up there after lunch.
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,513.101,519.173,Thank you sir.
1971.71-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,519.173,525.889,"Given us the setting, now you can move into the full argument."
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,525.889,533.98,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.71-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,586.326,588.482,Who owns the ice rink?
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,588.482,592.357,The Lloyd Corporation owns the ice rink.
1971.71-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,601.844,607.438,Did this activity take place entirely within a building?
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,607.438,612.562,"Within this structure which we call a building, which is a building, it's the main building."
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,645.106,651.56,"Well, Mr. Black, it's actually though an extension of the streets, I mean the walkways and terminals or --"
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,651.56,654.911,"No, they are not an extension of the streets as we said."
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,654.911,658.872,Well -- people getting back and forth from one --
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,658.872,661.818,"People can come from a public street into the mall, yes."
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,661.818,665.502,"And they cross it to the opposite, to the street in the opposite side there."
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,665.502,666.522,They cross the street.
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,666.522,666.741,Yeah.
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,666.741,668.627,"Correct, they cross the street."
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,677.895,680.629,Is there any vehicular traffic in the mall?
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,680.629,681.127,"Pardon, sir."
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,681.127,682.705,Is there any vehicular traffic?
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,682.705,687.009,"No, there is no vehicular traffic in the mall."
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,687.009,689.478,But there is a great deal of pedestrian traffic.
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,689.478,693.641,"Well, we hope there is a great deal for business purposes."
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,693.641,697.938,"Everyone who patronizes, one of these shops of the skating rink and so forth --"
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,697.938,706.563,"Well, one of the various buildings either across the public streets or in this main building, in the mall there."
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,827.543,837.789,"Are you sure to say, where the picketing, where the leaf-letting occurred on pages 134 and 135 in front of the Meier and Frank company."
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,845.103,846.373,That the map --
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,846.373,850.021,"Where in this on page 115, where in this area we are looking --?"
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,850.021,853.505,It's --
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,853.505,857.668,I've got Lloyd --
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,857.668,859.293,"Approximately, in the center."
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,859.293,859.969,In the center.
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,859.969,864.461,"Can you see 138 there, right block, which was formally block 138."
1971.71-492,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,864.461,866.875,Yes.
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,866.875,873.358,"About there, within 20-30 feet of that, I can't tell you exactly."
1971.71-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,903.023,907.835,"Mr. Black, I take it that there is no problem of littering in this case?"
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,907.835,913.335,There was no problem of littering in connection with the incident involved that is of any consequence.
1971.71-492,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1127.143,1131.02,"This property, to start with belonged to the city?"
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,1131.02,1134.808,Yes.
1971.71-492,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1166.735,1171.75,Were there any companies running to the city on that ground?
1971.71-492,0,24978,george_black_jr,,1171.75,1173.463,"No, you mean was it a clean deal?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,1984.654,1986.859,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2009.132,2011.579,"But they couldn't refuse them service, could they --"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2011.579,2011.959,"No, of course not."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2011.959,2013.63,-- under the holdings of this court?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2013.63,2015.91,"No, of course, not Your Honor, and I don't suggest that it's --"
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2015.91,2017.952,And that doesn't help us one way or the other.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2017.952,2019.343,"No, it does not."
1971.71-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.143,2043.383,Was there a postal substation at Lloyd Center one time?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2043.383,2045.993,"If there is within the shopping center, I'm not aware of it."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2084.658,2090.956,It's the block right under the word C of Lloyd Center on the map?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2090.956,2092.393,It's right under the word --
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2092.393,2094.128,The letter C?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2094.128,2096.925,The letter N.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2100.863,2102.25,"Yes, 115 is it."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2102.25,2110.619,"Yeah, it's bounded by Halsey Street on the North, Multnomah on the South, 9th and 15th Streets on the East and West."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2110.619,2117.933,"Now are Halsey and -- well the streets bounding at Halsey and Multnomah and the others, are they public streets?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2117.933,2122.418,"Yes they are, Your Honor, and as I say--"
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2122.418,2126.027,This is an area completely surrounded by public streets.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2126.027,2127.031,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2127.031,2131.724,Just as this building is surrounded by public streets here.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2131.724,2134.208,Yes.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2237.744,2247.417,"In your view, does it make any difference to the case whether this was all acquired from a private party or some of it was acquired from the public domain?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2247.417,2261.439,"Well, it might make some difference Your Honor, because here we have government assisting in the creation of a private shopping center in a way that probably wouldn't have been possible to create the shopping center, but for the vacation of the street."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2261.439,2274.142,Is that legally and fundamentally different from number of the farms in the United States that derive from government patents?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2274.142,2278.299,"Well, in sense of all title derives from the government, no it is not different."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2278.299,2288.47,"Was this property, simply by deed from the city or was it -- some of that taking by eminent domain."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2288.47,2296.454,"The street and sidewalk property, that the city conveyed was all city public property, simply I don't know if they had it be, they at least vacated it."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2305.538,2309.271,Then the Lloyd acquired it from the property owners?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2309.271,2311.326,"No, they acquired the streets inside Your Honor."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2311.326,2312.967,"I'm speaking of the blocks, the blocks."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2312.967,2321.95,"Oh yes, the property, former private property was indeed acquired from those people."
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.28,2398.16,"Mr. Neil, where on the Exhibit number 3, at page 115, with relation to that main building, is the parking?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2399.879,2405.302,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, they park throughout this main part."
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.397,2445.041,"Is there any vehicular traffic to and from the parking area within the building itself, the part used for retail merchandising?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2445.041,2448.2,"I didn't quite understand your question, Your Honor."
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2448.2,2450.622,"Well, the question probably wasn't too clear."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2459.96,2461.4,I see.
1971.71-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.201,2516.119,"Looking at page 136, I see a camper there."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2518.132,2532.564,"No, the record doesn't explain that, but since I've been here a few times when that kind of thing was there, I think it's a display Your Honor, it can't be automobiles."
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.498,2679.432,"Mr. Neil, if a single store owner found someone inside his store, leafleting, whom he felt was trespassing and called the Portland Police to eject him, would you feel that brought him within the Logan Valley rule?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2679.432,2682.796,"No, you are talking about the single store inside the business premises where the business is--"
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2682.796,2683.238,Right.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2683.238,2684.3,Is that right?
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2686.971,2693.041,How does the presence of police officers hereby itself help your case?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2693.041,2713.9,"I'm not sure it adds anything to my case except the court’s questions indicated I guess what is the basis for color of law under Section 1983 under which this case arose, and one basis you could answer is the presence of deputy police officers threatening people with arrest unless they abandoned what they considered to be their constitutional rights."
1971.71-492,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2779.656,2785.437,You share Mr. Black's response to my inquiry about littering?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2785.437,2788.009,The evidence shows there was no littering Your Honor.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2850.567,2856.943,How much do you rely on the fact that these men -- these security officers held commissions from the city police?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2856.943,2861.271,It has one basis for showing color of law under Section 1983.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2861.271,2865.446,Suppose they gave them the same uniforms and just turned in there--
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2865.446,2867.364,I would argue the result should not be different.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2867.364,2870.667,"So then it isn’t very important, is it?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2870.667,2872.589,I don't believe it is in this case Your Honor.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2872.589,2882.681,"They could be plain clothes or guards or they could be uniform guards, marked private security Lloyd Center or whatever?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2882.681,2889.278,"Well, I take Mr. Black’s example that he personally kicks them out if he is the President of the Corporation."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2906.996,2923.922,"Well, would you say the state action, suppose someone came in there, assume that there is a bank there and some bank robbers came in to rob the bank and the bank charters took some clubs or guns and resisted the robbery."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2925.309,2927.359,No I'd say that's self-defense.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2927.359,2928.438,"Self-help, isn't it?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2928.438,2928.705,Self-help.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2928.705,2937.536,Suppose this Lloyd Center has a staff of men highly trained in “self-help”.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2937.536,2940.142,"Well, I can conceive that happening, but it seems--"
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2940.142,2941.345,"It’d be very easy, wouldn’t it?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2944.892,2952.126,"Yes, but it seems to me that wherever that occurs, that party is likely to invoke the trespass laws too."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2952.703,2962.562,"Well, look, he doesn’t invoke any law, he just grabs him by the scruff of the neck and throws him off, he doesn’t identify the statute or the common law that he’s acting under."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2967.944,2974.024,"Well, I suppose he can do that, if you’re asking me, if that is permissible, does that change?"
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2974.024,2984.148,"Oh no, I'm just -- I'm trying to find out how important it is that these men have commissions that they have uniforms or whatever."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2984.148,2987.586,"It is something you can hang your hat on, but I don't think it’s that important."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2990.024,2994.757,"Well, I'm not sure what I thought about it, I'm just trying to find out where we’re going?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,2994.757,2996.602,I have an even broader ground for --
1971.71-492,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2996.602,3007.398,"We have in the Griffin case, the Glen Echo case, we're talking about the municipal, that if that deputized private guard, makes the arrest in state action."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3007.398,3009.258,I agree with that Your Honor.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3009.258,3019.754,"Yes but if the same private guard have turned in his badge and made -- ejected somebody or made a citizen's arrest, the following week then would it--"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3019.754,3021.301,That might not be the state action.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3026.083,3028.918,"So then the state action is not an important factor in here, Your Honor."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3028.918,3036.524,"Yes, it is, it is an important factor but that isn't the only thing that may create state actions in this case."
1971.71-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3037.352,3047.285,Suppose that the fact that officers were deputized agents of the state would have something to do perhaps for the purposes of 1983 jurisdiction.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3057.737,3058.557,Exactly.
1971.71-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3058.557,3062.884,That this complex was--
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3062.884,3063.36,"Yeah, that's quite--"
1971.71-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3063.36,3064.935,-- government itself.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3064.935,3066.082,--about--
1971.71-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3066.082,3070.093,There is no such thing as trespassing on public sidewalks.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3070.093,3071.038,Right.
1971.71-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.388,3118.663,"Isn't there this difference though that in Wilmington Parking Authority, there was state involvement whereas in Logan Valley."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3123.784,3135.471,"Well, the difference, Your Honor, is that the property initially was owned by a public body in Wilmington and it was not initially owned, all of it at least by a public body in either Logan Valley or this case as I mentioned."
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3135.471,3144.097,"Well, but do you think if the property had been conveyed and fee simple, in Wilmington the same result would have obtained?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3144.097,3146.816,"Well, yes I think it might have."
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3174.311,3181.03,Does your Portland Zoning Code requires site plan approval for most major retail constructions?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3181.03,3186.83,"The record doesn't show that, Your Honor, but I think it probably does."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3235.937,3245.986,"Well, your suggestion introduces a new factor when you said free speech, which they don't like."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3270.814,3272.024,"No, I don't think it does Your Honor."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3272.821,3277.824,"Well, then it doesn't make any difference that they are excluding things they don't like either?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3277.824,3306.562,"Well, I think it doesn't result, Your Honor, because one of the things I am arguing is that if the rule the Lloyd Corporation seeks is adopted here, the result is not just total prohibition, result as the American Retail Federation amicus brief clearly says, is the right to choose which speech, which activity, which non-commercial enterprise will take place on these malls and walkways and not merely the right to say that none shall."
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3316.619,3323.209,Do you think Logan Valley just automatically decide this case that --?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3323.209,3324.388,Yes.
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3324.388,3329.456,Well what about -- Logan Valley at least said -- noted that the activity was connected with the races.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3329.456,3341.515,"Yes, I agree, Mr. Justice Marshall has expressed statement that he is not commenting, the court is commenting on “unrelated speech.”"
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3341.515,3343.078,Is this unrelated speech?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3343.078,3347.485,"Well I suppose, we get an argument about what is related and un-related."
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3347.485,3350.778,"Well, it isn't related in the sense the activity was in Logan Valley."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3350.778,3358.106,"That's true, it's not related in a sense that it has anything particularly to do with any tenant of the shopping center."
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3383.854,3391.701,Let's assume that it isn't related -- your argument simply covers that aspect.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3391.701,3392.292,Yes sir.
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3392.292,3395.281,"Let's assume that it isn't related, then what?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3395.281,3406.938,"Well, I think that once you get over the functional equivalence point that we are then just talking about reasonable regulation and rather than prohibition."
1971.71-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3406.938,3412.018,"In Marsh v. Alabama, they were to hold this witnesses and I don't know how related that was to?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3412.018,3412.565,Unrelated.
1971.71-492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3412.565,3414.693,Business of that company town.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3417.223,3433.143,"Yes, but notice how much we've jumped on it when we have said functionally equivalent, we ruled out all kinds of premises, we ruled out hotel apartment lobbies, private residences, interiors of businesses, and industrial plants for the most part."
1971.71-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3435.453,3436.412,Hardware stores?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3436.412,3439.662,"Hardware stores, interiors of hardware stores at least."
1971.71-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3449.16,3451.838,What is the definition of a functional equivalent?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3451.838,3462.731,"It seems to me, first of all we don't stop at functional equivalent, functional equivalent of a public sidewalk in a public business district, so let's go back, of the business district."
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3499.667,3505.932,There's one functional equivalence to the Logan Valley is -- you admit you had sidewalks all around this discipline.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3505.932,3507.034,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3507.034,3508.277,And you didn't in Logan Valley.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3508.277,3509.565,That's true.
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3513.292,3517.067,"Well, couldn't you have reached everybody in that mall?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3517.067,3518.631,"No, in this case?"
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3518.631,3519.333,Yeah.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3519.333,3521.067,"No Your Honor, we could not."
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3528.564,3531.043,Those automobiles turn down to public street?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3531.043,3531.914,"Yes, they do Your Honor."
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3531.914,3533.461,But could you pick it there?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3533.461,3534.852,Pardon me.
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3534.852,3536.104,Could you leaflet there?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3536.104,3538.255,Well I think that would be very difficult.
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3539.575,3545.278,"Oh, I agree -- that it would be less difficult if you had gone in large store it would be less difficult."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3545.278,3545.775,Right.
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3545.775,3547.118,I don't think that's the point.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3547.118,3559.432,"Well maybe it is, because I think it's so difficult that there actually are hazards to the safety of person if you are trying to do it, and is ineffective secondly, because you can't really handle leaflet to a driver removing automobile."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3564.153,3566.246,Where does the right to --
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3566.246,3566.878,Go ahead.
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3567.432,3571.245,I just want to know is there anything directly to show how many people walked on that sidewalk?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3571.245,3576.55,The numbers are not shown as to how many come by bus --
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3576.55,3579.201,"No, no, how many are walking on the sidewalk?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3579.201,3588.123,"Well, the only people that are going to walk on that sidewalk are people who do not enter and leave from the shopping center by automobile."
1971.71-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3591.091,3592.296,You don't know how many?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3592.296,3594.175,The record doesn't show.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3594.175,3600.793,Is the swimming pool here the functional equivalent of a public swimming pool of the same size and depth.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3600.793,3603.513,"Are you speaking of skating rink, are you?"
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3603.513,3604.045,Isn't there is a swimming pool here too?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3604.045,3604.764,Skating rink.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3604.764,3607.1,"Skating rink, that's right."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3614.205,3615.942,I don't think so.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3615.942,3616.723,What's the difference?
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3616.723,3618.757,They charged admission from one thing to this thing.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3618.757,3621.194,Will they do in some public --.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3621.194,3638.868,"Yes, and I suppose you put it to me, what if I were to exclude people on the basis of race, or religion or something of that sort and I might be able to argue that it was, but I don't think it's crucial to whether the malls and walkways are functional equivalents of sidewalks."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3638.868,3642.913,"Well, I am trying to test what Justice Rehnquist was driving at."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3652.611,3692.221,"Well first of all, I limit it to the business districts, secondly I limit it to the functional equivalence of sidewalks, in the sense that sidewalks, they are using -- they are being used to carry pedestrian traffic between businesses within the business district and I think that you have then got to the functional equivalent provided that couple of other conditions don't exist, like in Taggart v. Weinacker, is apparently a sidewalk there was so narrow that any exercise of First Amendment speech or whatever would have unreasonably interfered with the owner's use of the property normally."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3728.143,3745.21,"But is it conceivable that some people, customers I am speaking of now, would refrain from going to a place in order to avoid having people harass them with pamphlets and leaflets?"
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3745.21,3748.835,"Well, yes it is conceivable."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3763.688,3774.618,"In the recent decisions of this court, you will find the enforcement of such statutes is not as easy as writing out to them."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3774.618,3776.102,"In what sense, I don't follow it."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3776.102,3783.87,I was thinking of some of the cases in which we struck down city ordinances because of the difficulty of describing the limitation.
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3783.87,3784.643,That's true.
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3784.643,3793.897,"I am speaking now of holdings in which I have joined, addressing myself to the difficulty, in which you move over rather rapidly."
1971.71-492,1,19717,carl_r_neil,,3793.897,3799.444,"Well, I agree that in First Amendment cases, even on public sidewalks that there are difficulties of regulation."
1971.71-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3829.096,3830.394,"Very well, your time is up."
