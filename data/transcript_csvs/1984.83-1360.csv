1984.83-1360,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.466,We'll here arguments next in Webb against County Board.
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,58.591,59.141,Thank you.
1984.83-1360,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,137.683,142.536,Could you have brought the proceeding in court without going into the administrative process?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,142.536,147.709,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, we could have gone straight to the federal court, and that is true."
1984.83-1360,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,162.999,172.836,"Do you read the opinions of the courts as encouraging, even if they do not require, the exhaustion of administrative remedies?"
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,172.836,186.855,"Your Honor, in the Patsy case, which held that exhaustion is not required, this Court pointed out that one of the concerns of Congress when it passed 1983 was to provide concurrent remedies in both state and federal courts."
1984.83-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,218.678,230.534,"Mr. Ralston, the district court's memorandum as I read it refers to the state administrative proceeding as one before the County Board of Education of Dyer County, Tennessee."
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,230.534,231.415,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,231.415,236.917,"You say you were pursuing the federal claim before that, the County Board."
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,240.34,251.817,"Your Honor, we have reprinted in our brief, our main brief, in the appendix, pages 1a to 4a, the statute under Tennessee law which sets out the proceeding."
1984.83-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,289.595,294.006,What are the standards for showing that you're entitled to reinstatement?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,296.557,301.209,Certainly under the tenure act there is that.
1984.83-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.628,334.921,Is there any indication in this statutory language that a federal claim is contemplated?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,334.921,339.346,There is certainly no language that indicates that it could not be presented.
1984.83-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,355.906,361.68,Do you ordinarily expect a County Board of Supervisors to pass on constitutional claims?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,361.68,367.334,"Well, Your Honor, it certainly is not the normal kind of case they'll handle."
1984.83-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.181,412.193,"But they probably would have dealt with it under some principle of state law, rather than saying something was unconstitutional."
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,412.193,423.179,"Your Honor, the members of the County Board I would assume, as are all other state officials, are bound by oath to support the Constitution of the United States and to conform their activities to that Constitution."
1984.83-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.179,426.692,I don't really claim to know anything about Tennessee proceedings.
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,433.838,435.117,"Your Honor, I am not."
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,450.679,461.418,I would find it rather strange to have the constitutional issues presented to and passed on by an administrative agency or a County Board.
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,479.129,495.141,"Your Honor, if given the hypothetical I've given, if it had emerged that in fact there was a policy to discharge black teachers in violation of their rights to be free of racial discrimination, I would hope that they would entertain such a claim and that they would not allow such a discharge."
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.141,497.311,"But it certainly could hardly comport with Tennessee law, then, could it?"
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,497.311,499.121,It might not have.
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.592,603.36,Is there any provision for judicial review of the County Board's decision at the end of this sort of an administrative process?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,603.36,604.399,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,607.411,614.407,"And I take it, then, that your constitutional claim was rejected by the County Board?"
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,614.407,618.25,They simply issued a short decision saying--
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.25,619.85,"Well, they certainly didn't grant it."
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,619.85,620.932,--They certainly didn't grant it.
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.932,623.363,So ordinarily you would say they rejected it.
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,623.363,623.884,Yes.
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.884,626.015,So why didn't you take it to the Tennessee courts?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,626.015,635.431,"Well, at that point, Your Honor, we had the option of going either to federal court or to state court, and the counsel decided that they would prefer going to federal court at that point, now that they were going to have to go to court."
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.431,648.468,"You don't think that... you don't think that if you don't appeal a county commissions's judgment, that doesn't foreclose you from another judicial action?"
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,648.468,653.934,"No, Your Honor, we would not say... no, we take the position that it doesn't."
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.113,657.386,There's no administrative res judicata?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,657.386,662.209,"--Not under a claim under 1981, I would urge not."
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.209,662.82,Why not?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,662.82,667.603,In the same way that this Court has held that in a Title VII case the fact that one goes to--
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.603,675.198,Title VII requires you to go to the court and specifically leaves the court open after you've resorted to that.
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,675.198,681.9,"--Yes, but 1981 and 1983 also allow an independent federal claim to be brought."
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.833,687.303,"It may not, it may not."
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,700.914,702.294,"Well, as I--"
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.294,703.155,Could you?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,703.155,712.081,"--Well, if the federal constitutional claims had been raised and had a final decision from the state courts, yes."
1984.83-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.455,718.455,"Well, if they weren't raised you weren't entitled to attorneys' fees."
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,718.455,722.369,"If they weren't raised in state court, yes."
1984.83-1360,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,736.267,743.633,"Mr. Ralston, did any of the proceedings in the administrative agency get into the federal court suit in any way?"
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,743.633,744.634,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1360,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,759.907,764.649,Did those proceedings have any relevance to the settlement at all?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,764.649,775.064,"Well, the record is not clear, although in the hearing on counsel fees the district court stated that he had in fact read those proceeding."
1984.83-1360,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,778.217,786.171,"Were they stipulated into evidence, so that the facts were brought before the court by way of stipulating that record in?"
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,786.171,792.296,--It was introduced as an attachment to an affidavit by counsel for Mr. Webb attesting to their accuracy.
1984.83-1360,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,798.34,799.081,"Oh, I see."
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,799.081,805.906,They were put in at a point where motions for summary judgment were pending before the district court relating to a number of issues.
1984.83-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,810.768,848.011,"Mr. Ralston, may I ask whether by relying on Carey you're asking us to hold that Section 1988 creates an independent action for attorneys' fees for time spent in administrative proceedings, or whether you are asking us to say that you can recover something for attorneys' fees just to the extent you would be able to do so anyway, like for discovery conducted before a federal action?"
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,851.023,863.252,"In the present case, the Court only need reach the second point, because in this case we had an action filed in federal court to raise the merits of the claim, there was no final disposition in the state administrative processes."
1984.83-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,873.009,875.673,And what do you think about the other question?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,875.673,888.249,"The other question... Carey did hold, at least in the context of a Title VII case, that an action could be brought solely for the purpose of obtaining counsel fees."
1984.83-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,910.144,918.6,"A moment ago, in answer to Justice O'Connor's question, you said there had been... at least I understood you to say that there had been no final disposition of the state administrative proceeding."
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,918.6,922.273,"I'm sorry, Not in favor of the plaintiff."
1984.83-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,924.384,925.315,Against the plaintiff.
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,925.315,925.956,--Against the plaintiff.
1984.83-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.956,926.715,Right.
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,926.715,929.399,"I'm sorry, I did not mean to indicate otherwise."
1984.83-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.399,931.329,"May I ask you a factual question, Mr. Ralston?"
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,942.375,943.637,"'79, I'm sorry."
1984.83-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.793,960.278,"--And is it your contention that everything that precedes that, it was reasonably necessary in order to prepare and prosecute the federal case?"
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,960.278,961.32,That is our contention.
1984.83-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.402,1000.055,"Of course, the district court did something else that smacks of a compromise in a way."
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1014.244,1018.598,--It's my understanding that the rate at the beginning of the period may have been less.
1984.83-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1028.304,1028.503,Right.
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1028.503,1031.227,And the Respondents did not cross-petition on that issue.
1984.83-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.597,1050.048,Right.
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1071.582,1079.486,"Well, our contention would be, if we were in the situation in district court to justify all those hours, that they could be justified."
1984.83-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.598,1082.378,As necessary to the federal litigation?
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1082.378,1083.46,--As necessary.
1984.83-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.191,1101.893,"Well, he at least gave you the time it took you to write the complaint."
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1101.893,1102.842,Pardon?
1984.83-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.842,1105.202,"He didn't begin with the filing of the complaint, at least."
1984.83-1360,0,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1105.202,1107.546,"Yes, he allowed us to prepare and write it."
1984.83-1360,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1206.86,1210.132,Mr. Headrick.
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1210.132,1214.586,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.83-1360,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1329.501,1338.398,What would have been the situation under Tennessee law if he'd gone into the state courts and prevailed there?
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1341.81,1342.739,"No, sir."
1984.83-1360,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1376.992,1380.495,"Well, but is that true if he filed a 1983 action in the state court?"
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1389.051,1393.364,"No, sir, not in the courts of the State of Tennessee."
1984.83-1360,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1393.364,1394.854,--They don't accept 1983 litigation?
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1394.854,1396.925,"No, sir, not in the courts of the State of Tennessee."
1984.83-1360,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.034,1411.814,Is that cited in the briefs?
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1412.696,1413.507,"No, it is not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1360,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1418.43,1420.621,Do you have any question about whether that's good law today or not?
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1420.621,1433.89,"Well, I understand that there is some question under a footnote, I believe in the Martinez case, as to whether or not state courts are obligated to entertain Section 1983 actions."
1984.83-1360,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1435.28,1437.14,They're not... I see.
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1437.14,1437.982,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1561.464,1604.882,"Mr. Headrick, in a case in which a claimant files a state administrative proceeding and does urge the same grounds as he later urges in a federal civil rights action, and spends time preparing for that administrative hearing and doing what amounts to discovery for purposes of dealing with the hearing, and later in the federal civil rights action relies on some of that time and effort as part of his preparation for the federal claim in the federal court, is any of that time recoverable in your view?"
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1604.882,1612.807,"No, we do not think so, because the prevailing plaintiff, the applicant, has not made it over the statutory threshold."
1984.83-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1626.775,1641.354,"Though certainly time spent for ordinary civil discovery would be recoverable, would it not, under Section 1988 for preparation time for the 1983 or 1981 claim?"
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1641.354,1643.096,We have no problem with that.
1984.83-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1643.096,1654.554,"And if the work done is essentially the equivalent of discovery in the administrative proceeding, why should it not be recoverable?"
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1654.554,1658.958,"Well, as a general proposition it may should be discoverable."
1984.83-1360,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1689.489,1694.461,But certainly Congress indicated that they wanted 1988 to be broadly read.
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1694.461,1699.764,"I don't have any problem with that, with that as a general proposition, Justice."
1984.83-1360,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1699.764,1701.537,As just a general proposition?
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1701.537,1706.81,"Well, yes, and I think there's other references in the legislative history--"
1984.83-1360,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1706.81,1715.465,Your view certainly provides a disincentive to pursue administrative remedies and to force everything right into federal court.
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1715.465,1734.836,"--Well, of course, one of the problems that is incurred in this type of situation is that I don't think you can equate the relief sought in the federal court with what the County Board of Education of Dyer County, Tennessee, was empowered to do with this plaintiff's civil rights claim."
1984.83-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.956,1790.125,"Well, is there any Tennessee law on whether or not administrative agencies or County Boards will entertain federal constitutional claims?"
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1790.125,1794.036,"Justice White, I certainly know of none."
1984.83-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.16,1800.711,Entertain 1983--
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1800.711,1806.885,"--entertain 1983 actions, then the fair inference would be that, no, that administrative bodies would not."
1984.83-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.885,1807.816,--Let me ask you this.
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1827.368,1835.453,"I can't address that as a general proposition, whether there is enabling legislation that says statewide all boards can."
1984.83-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.453,1838.063,Are there any kinds of decisions in your courts?
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1838.063,1840.387,"No, sir, I'm not aware of those."
1984.83-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.387,1843.717,Or any custom of your administrative agencies?
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1843.717,1854.055,"Well, I certainly know that in this particular case, from a review of the record even, although those points were made, I don't think they were seriously considered."
1984.83-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.055,1855.407,Did you represent the Board?
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1855.407,1856.056,"No, I did not."
1984.83-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.3,1865.783,"Well, was there any objection by counsel to entertaining these claims or to the introduction of evidence to support them?"
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,1865.783,1881.634,"I don't think there was specific objection to the argument of counsel concerning constitutional claim, and I'm not sure that there is a way to divide the evidence that Petitioner submitted."
1984.83-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2198.72,2216.411,"On the other hand, as Justice Blackmun points out, the costs of not at least permitting the courts to consider the preparation time is to provide a disincentive to follow alternative remedies and stay out of court altogether."
1984.83-1360,1,41493,s_russell_headrick,,2216.411,2221.875,"Now, of course, there's no... and there may be some of that disincentive."
1984.83-1360,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2307.291,2309.114,Mr. Headrick.
1984.83-1360,2,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2310.383,2312.647,May it please the Court:
1984.83-1360,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2428.811,2430.123,"Mr. Ralston, let me ask you a question on that point."
1984.83-1360,2,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2449.695,2458.891,"Your Honor, in that particular instance the district court could very well look at that and say, that was not time reasonably spent in vindication of federal civil rights, that's not compensable here."
1984.83-1360,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2458.891,2466.207,"So you're not claiming that you're entitled to be compensated for all the time spent in the administrative proceeding, all time necessary to that proceeding?"
1984.83-1360,2,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2466.207,2467.647,Not necessarily.
1984.83-1360,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.416,2495.225,"It's hard to get the flavor of it, but as I read the district court opinion I thought he was treating the claim as though the lawyer who was then representing the plaintiff thought he was entitled as a matter of law to be compensated for the time in that proceeding more or less as he is in the federal proceeding."
1984.83-1360,2,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2495.225,2501.349,"Well, the counsel for plaintiff was arguing that all the time was reasonably spent and therefore he should be compensated for it fully."
1984.83-1360,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.066,2519.12,"But see, I got the impression the parties didn't fight about the allocation, that there was kind of an agreement that 58 hours was on the federal case and 82 hours was on the state proceeding, and you either got the 82 hours or you didn't."
1984.83-1360,2,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2521.684,2527.468,"Well, the defendants objected to any of the time as a matter of law, and that's the issue that we're focusing on."
1984.83-1360,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2527.468,2528.757,And you in effect argue you're entitled to all of it.
1984.83-1360,2,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2528.757,2533.94,"We said, yes, we're entitled to all of it unless you can convince the court that some of it--"
1984.83-1360,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.94,2535.763,"That's what I don't find, is the ""unless you can convince"" part."
1984.83-1360,2,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2535.763,2543.868,"--Well, I guess that issue was never reached, Your Honor, because it all got focused in on whether any of it could be compensated at all and that's the way it was decided."
1984.83-1360,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.383,2590.798,"Mr. Ralston, suppose there's a case where everything you do to enforce your state rights, state statutory or state constitutional rights, are absolutely the same as what you would be doing to enforce the federal right, and in the state proceeding you just... you have a federal constitutional claim, but you also have these state claims, and you just go forward."
1984.83-1360,2,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2590.798,2595.671,"Your Honor, in that case it would be the same issue that was grappled with, I think, in Hensley."
1984.83-1360,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.87,2614.033,"Even though if he hadn't joined his claim, his federal claim, he would have done exactly the same thing?"
1984.83-1360,2,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2614.033,2614.724,Yes.
1984.83-1360,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2637.628,2638.439,"Thank you, gentlemen."
