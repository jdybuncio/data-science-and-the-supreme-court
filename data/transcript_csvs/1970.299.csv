1970.299,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.291,"We will hear arguments next in Number 299, Cohen against California."
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,41.411,42.533,Thank you Your Honor.
1970.299,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,109.215,110.854,What was the business?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,110.854,122.297,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, he was -- although it’s not on the record the fact is he was called there as a witness in a case which he was not involved in himself."
1970.299,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,144.716,151.602,"Now, inside the courtroom, you say he took the jacket off, and did he put it in a place where it was prominently on view?"
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,151.602,155.99,"No Mr. Justice Stewart, he held it folded over his arm and it was not on view there."
1970.299,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,180.397,186.46,So the conviction rests basically upon his wearing it in the courtroom -- in the corridor of the building.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,186.46,188.054,"Precisely Mr. Justice Stewart, yes."
1970.299,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,188.054,195.428,"In this respect it’s no different is it from what it would be if he’d been picked up out on the street, in front of the building or in any other public place?"
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,195.428,197.576,"Exactly Mr. Chief Justice, I think that’s the (Voice Overlap) --"
1970.299,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,197.576,200.382,The courthouse atmosphere has nothing to do with it.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,200.382,205.665,"I think it is not an issue in this case, yes Your Honor."
1970.299,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,205.665,211.848,But wouldn’t you think that there are some things people couldn’t do in the courtroom that they could do in other places?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,211.848,222.175,"Mr. Justice Black, I would think there are some things that in the courtroom itself, while court is in session would be improper consistent with the First Amendment."
1970.299,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,222.175,222.397,But you said he --
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,222.397,223.989,I don’t think that arises in this case.
1970.299,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,223.989,226.772,You said he did not wear this jacket in the courtroom.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,226.772,229.482,That is correct Your Honor.
1970.299,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,237.864,242.879,(Voice Overlap) -- did it write at in the front door of the courtroom while the Court was in session?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,242.879,244.086,Your Honor as far as the record indicate --
1970.299,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,244.086,248.658,"Did he do it, I’m not talking now about what you're -- merits of your case."
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,248.658,250.353,Yes.
1970.299,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,250.353,259.93,But do you not think at a court it has something to say more than a word if it was -- the man was walking down the street?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,259.93,288.187,"Mr. Justice Black, I think that when you get into the question of contempt, which that really raises this Court’s standard that has been adopted in numerous cases namely that there must be a showing of the speech creates a clear and present danger of interference with a judicial process would apply and conceivably and given facts where those words do appear during session of the court not merely in the physical courtroom but while court is in session."
1970.299,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,303.189,304.63,Which courthouse in Los Angeles?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,304.63,307.438,It is in the Los Angeles County Courthouse Mr. Justice Brennan.
1970.299,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,307.438,309.109,That's not the very large one is it?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,309.109,310.595,"It is, yes it is a very large one."
1970.299,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,310.595,312.638,"Isn’t that one the 100 courtrooms, is that --?"
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,312.638,314.578,"Something like that Your Honor, yes."
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.038,510.701,"Would it be your position that your client could have -- would’ve had a First Amendment right to say this words orally, face-to-face to any person in the hall outside the courtroom?"
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,510.701,514.89,Mr. Justice White I don’t think the distinction lies on whether it’s oral or written.
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.304,519.847,I’m not suggesting anything I just asked the question.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,519.847,520.136,What?
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.136,522.164,Would your position be the same?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,522.164,522.339,Yes.
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.421,525.785,Yes.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,531.136,532.076,Yes I do your Honor.
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.076,539.393,And if he didn’t there might be some trouble -- you'd -- might have some trouble in this case.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,539.393,541.83,"I don’t offhand see a viable distinction between the written and the oral, yes."
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.83,545.436,Yes.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,545.436,558.689,"But Your Honor, I think it’s terribly important to suggest, perhaps you were not suggesting, but it could suggest to me this line of fighting -- the fighting words concept taken from the Chaplinsky case decided by this Court some years ago."
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.532,578.05,More a -- is your view of fighting words different than -- do you think fighting words are different than insulting words?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,578.05,579.938,No Your Honor.
1970.299,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,620.57,624.786,Let’s go back to what Justice White was addressing himself to.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,661.017,668.287,"Mr. Chief Justice, first of all in terms of the fighting words I don’t see any likelihood to the facts constituting those fighting words."
1970.299,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,809.796,813.601,"You seem to be, at least if I follow you."
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,829.659,836.729,"Mr. Chief Justice it is not our position that because it happens to be profanity, automatically there is an absolute right, no Your Honor."
1970.299,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,972.772,981.001,Now what does this have to do with the communicating dialog or discussion of public issues?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,981.001,985.571,"Your Honor ,I understand the argument can be made and perhaps you by implication are making it."
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1085.483,1090.385,(Voice Overlap) Why did he take his jacket off when he went in the courtroom?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1090.385,1097.859,"Mr. Justice Marshall, he took the jacket off because he was wearing the jacket as one would ordinarily wear the jacket, he was somewhat chilly."
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1110.086,1113.326,I think you missed the import of my question.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1113.326,1114.377,I’m sorry Your Honor.
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1114.377,1119.792,He was willing to do all this demonstrating but he wouldn’t want to do it in the courtroom.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1119.792,1121.361,"But Your Honor, he was not --"
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1121.361,1127.231,Does that lead me to believe he knew exactly what he was doing?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1127.231,1129.688,"Your Honor, he was--"
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1129.688,1133.176,That he knew better than to wear it in the courtroom.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1133.176,1134.08,That he knew -- I didn’t hear the last.
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1134.08,1138.546,That he knew better than to wear it in the courtroom.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1138.546,1141.226,Perhaps he knew it would be improper to wear it in the courtroom.
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1144.621,1147.243,But you put emphasis that he folded it up.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1147.243,1148.656,Yes indeed.
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1148.656,1165.364,"But he still has the right to parade around the courthouse halls with him knowing that that building has nothing to do with the draft, in any form or fashion, am I right?"
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1165.364,1166.782,You’re quite right Your Honor.
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1166.782,1168.423,You emphasized that.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1168.423,1169.35,Yes Your Honor.
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1169.35,1172.16,And my question is why?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1172.16,1172.702,Your question is what --
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1172.702,1175.033,Why did you emphasize that?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1175.033,1180.283,Because I want to make the point that this does not get into the area of possible contempt of court.
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1187.161,1192.116,But could he have stepped on the court hallways and yelled those words?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1192.116,1192.734,Certainly not.
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1196.646,1203.813,But the fact that he has it placed on his jacket we can’t tell whether that’s allowed or why can't you?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1203.813,1217.369,"Well Your Honor, it was on his jacket, which meant that a person if he wishes to could see it on his jacket, but the person was not forced to continue to observe that as in terms of a loud noise one can’t help but hear it."
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1217.369,1222.656,(Voice Overlap) somebody was walking up the hall directly behind him couldn’t help from seeing it.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1222.656,1223.886,For the moment but there -- but for --
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1223.886,1226.959,"Well, I mean obviously that’s why he did it."
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1226.959,1227.083,Yes Your Honor.
1970.299,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1227.083,1230.529,You mean he’d -- he didn’t want people to see it?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1230.529,1230.794,No.
1970.299,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1591.923,1602.353,"Mr. Nimmer, before you sit down may I ask for a comment because you haven’t made one on the Bushman case in California since this one was decided."
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1602.353,1607.743,"Yes Your Honor, several points if I may Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1970.299,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1674.738,1681.749,Do you feel that the California Court in Bushman disapproved of the holding of the Court of Appeals in the present case?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1681.749,1704.098,"Your Honor I have to conclude that the California Supreme Court approved the holding because they cited apparently with approval the Cohen case as standing for the correct proposition namely that there must be a likelihood of violence in order to justify convicting a speaker for the use of words under the Offensive Conduct, Section 415."
1970.299,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1704.098,1713.27,"And my next question is, do you feel that the Bushman construction of the statute meets federal constitutional standards?"
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1713.27,1717.954,"Your Honor, I think it comes a lot closer to meeting it than does the Court of Appeals opinion in this case."
1970.299,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1769.79,1775.153,Then you would see no point in our remanding this case for reconsideration in the light of Bushman?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1775.153,1776.592,I certainly do not Your Honor.
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.023,1812.818,"Mr. Nimmer, I take it from your earlier remarks that you think the situation might be different if he wore his jacket in the courtroom?"
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1812.818,1815.885,"Your Honor, if he wore the jacket in the courtroom during courtroom proceedings --"
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1815.885,1824.848,"Yes, well why would that -- why would wearing this sign on his back in the courtroom be any more vulnerable to attack?"
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1824.848,1827.468,"Your Honor, I should further qualify that."
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.632,1831.654,Why?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1831.654,1833.987,I would still say it would be a proper to charge him under this statute.
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1833.987,1835.772,"Why, why?"
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1835.772,1837.956,"Well, I’m only looking at the possibility."
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.119,1851.286,Of what?
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1851.286,1852.123,Interfering with justice.
1970.299,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.837,1866.979,"You think it would be different if in the courtroom the sign on his jacket was, “I hate the draft”?"
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1866.979,1868.056,Perhaps not Your Honor.
1970.299,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1878.396,1879.136,It is.
1970.299,0,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,1880.894,1887.72,Thank you your Honor.
1970.299,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1887.72,1888.859,Mr. Sauer.
1970.299,1,36613,michael_t_sauer,,1888.859,1894.006,Mr. Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.299,2,36409,melville_b_nimmer,,2891.826,2893.92,Thank you very much Your Honor.
1970.299,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3028.012,3029.271,Thank you Mr. Nimmer.
