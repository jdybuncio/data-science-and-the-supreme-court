1987.87-5565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.789,"We'll hear oral argument now in No. 87-5565, Cherlyn Clark v. Gene Jeter."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,12.574,15.676,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-5565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.195,155.714,Isn't that the way that one would normally enforce the statute then?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,160.134,192.672,"This Court specifically, in Rosato v. Wyman in another AFDC case, indicated that it is not necessary for a claimant, who has no normal route through an administrative appeal or no impact on the Secretary of HHS's decision to review for compliance and penalize the state, that in a situation like that the federal courts have the power to oversee the compliance of the state with the federal statute."
1987.87-5565,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,194.791,203.111,"Was that a case involving the distribution of funds, where the claimant was asking for funds?"
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,203.111,212.668,--It was a case that involved an exclusion from benefits of some AFDC recipients on the basis of a state law.
1987.87-5565,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,212.668,215.454,"But what was involved were funds, part of which were federal."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,215.454,216.62,That is correct.
1987.87-5565,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,216.62,240.735,"And that seems to me different from the question that the Chief Justice was asking, because this is a case in which you are saying simply that a state statute on a procedural matter determining when an action can be brought under state substantive law is void because of a spending prohibition."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,246.287,252.893,"Perhaps a better response to that would be the case of Bennett v. Arkansas, which was very recently decided by this case."
1987.87-5565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.901,323.639,There was no grant to the state of funds involved in Bennett.
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,341.1,362.93,"The cases under the AFDC statute, starting with King v. Smith, have dealt specifically with the kind of problem that we have here where a person who is remote from the procedure which is brought to bring a compliance action depends upon the federal guarantees."
1987.87-5565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,404.507,409.911,"You still have a problem about retroactivity, don't you?"
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,425.187,426.706,In the situation--
1987.87-5565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.706,427.256,Is that right?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,427.922,438.078,--The retroactivity question is related to the fact that Pennsylvania only allows support to be granted from the date that a support complaint is filed.
1987.87-5565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.261,470.699,"Well, Pennsylvania here said that it wouldn't apply, the 18-year statute which has been adopted at a certain time, to this case."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,470.699,479.072,In this particular instance it is clear that the language of the statute comprehended this and included it.
1987.87-5565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,484.393,485.109,Who said that?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,485.109,486.495,That's in the statute.
1987.87-5565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,486.495,487.661,In the Pennsylvania statute?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,487.661,488.697,"No, in the federal statute."
1987.87-5565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,488.697,494.582,"Well, that's what I... yes, so you do have to interpret the federal law to win on this particular statutory point."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,494.582,495.234,That's absolutely correct.
1987.87-5565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.234,504.722,You have to convince us that the federal law forbad Pennsylvania from refusing to apply the 18-year statute retroactive.
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,504.722,506.408,"That is the heart of this argument, Your Honor."
1987.87-5565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,687.191,694.928,Did the court below us speak on the issue concerning the federal statute?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,694.928,698.214,"In Clark v. Jeter, they did not."
1987.87-5565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,735.089,737.039,You are going to go on to your other points in due course.
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,741.409,742.843,"--Yes, we presented--"
1987.87-5565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.843,745.861,And how did they rule against you without ruling on that point?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,745.861,756.002,"--What happened was that the child support enforcement amendments were passed in '84, but they weren't implemented in Pennsylvania until '86."
1987.87-5565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,770.678,775.714,So you think they were entitled not to rule on your point?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,775.714,776.999,"Oh, no, no, not at all."
1987.87-5565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,776.999,778.599,"Well, they rejected it, didn't they?"
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,778.599,797.561,"At the time of the oral argument, we asked for a remand, because this was an intervening factor while the litigation was going on, while the appeal was going on, we asked for a remand to the trial court, which is the normal procedure in Pennsylvania, for a decision on the applicability of the 18-year statute of limitations."
1987.87-5565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,807.018,824.23,"Because this statutory argument, and if this had happened while the Petition to a cert was pending, we very well have remanded for reconsideration in light of a statutory argument."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,824.23,833.752,"We, of course, raised this specific argument in the motion for reargument in front of the intermediate court, and again in our request for review by the State of Pennsylvania."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,833.752,834.269,I'm sorry to waste your time.
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,872.108,874.227,"Your Honor, I think so, yes."
1987.87-5565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,874.227,876.262,Is it purely statutory?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,878.548,879.564,Precisely.
1987.87-5565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,879.564,881.231,--and other constitutional aspects to it?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,881.231,883.0,That is precisely correct.
1987.87-5565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,904.246,905.513,Why do you say only if?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,905.513,920.923,"--Well, if... because of the nature of Cherlyn Clark's case, she has a support complaint that's pending since 1983, and she has damages which are dating from 1983."
1987.87-5565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,944.788,945.188,Why is that?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,945.721,952.875,Because she will be barred by the six-year statute of limitations.
1987.87-5565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,952.875,957.779,"Yes, but if the statute is invalid on equal protection grounds--"
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,957.779,959.029,Correct.
1987.87-5565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,959.029,960.079,--why is that a barrier?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,962.914,964.099,Maybe I should just restate it.
1987.87-5565,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.054,976.573,"Before you get to the equal protection, let me ask you one more question about the statute."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1004.458,1005.776,"--Yes, I understand your question."
1987.87-5565,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.202,1046.337,"But that would be a matter of Pennsylvania law is what I'm... it would comply with the federal statute for them to say, well, I guess we do have to, in order to comply literally because the language is very strong as you say, they'll say, well, I guess we cannot apply our six-year statute to prevent you from establishing your paternity, but we may apply the six-year statute to prevent you from recovering any support money for the period before you establish paternity."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1054.09,1054.606,--That's correct.
1987.87-5565,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.606,1055.108,Yes.
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1055.108,1071.784,And the equal protection argument is based on the fact that there has been this differentiation between the rights accorded marital children as opposed to the rights accorded non-marital children in order to establish support against their parents.
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.583,1174.951,Can that be opposed by the child?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1174.951,1176.137,--By the child?
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1176.137,1176.737,Yes.
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1189.878,1195.682,"That's correct, but it can be opposed by the mother, and that frequently happens actually."
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.682,1196.382,It can... I see.
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1196.382,1210.023,"Actions for custody in which the mother has never acknowledged that this particular man is the father of the child, in those case, again, paternity actions are permitted in Pennsylvania without any statute of limitations."
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.123,1212.456,Excuse me.
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1214.075,1219.295,--Where a father wants to sue for custody but his paternity has not been established.
1987.87-5565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1247.028,1250.314,--Had he been supporting the child up until that time?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1250.314,1253.849,--He had been married and supporting the child.
1987.87-5565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.205,1265.657,So that would have been the first time the question of support was an issue.
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1265.657,1267.792,"Yes, I believe that's right."
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.792,1290.724,"Are there any cases to come down of what interests me in particular, is there any situation in which a living individual can be held by a court to have fathered an illegitimate child without encountering this statute of limitation?"
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1290.724,1291.841,Living individual--
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.841,1292.341,Right.
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1292.341,1294.109,--can be held to have fathered a child.
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.109,1294.493,Right.
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1294.493,1298.311,In an action where the father is denying paternity--
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1298.311,1300.163,"Right, right."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1300.163,1302.532,"--and in that situation, yes."
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.567,1306.201,It can?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1308.451,1308.767,--Right.
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.767,1311.236,And you say you can get around this?
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1313.705,1314.121,Right.
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.899,1330.499,"Well, excuse me."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1340.588,1342.938,"--No, he's saying this is not my child at all."
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.39,1357.098,"Well, I am looking for... see, what I think may underlie the Pennsylvania statute is the severe personal, legal, social consequences of a person being judged by the court to be the father of illegitimate children."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1401.21,1401.843,That's precisely right.
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.411,1410.065,"--Yes, but also he can't be personally hurt as much, or personally vilified as much."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1410.065,1416.552,"Of course, his heirs are always concerned, and these are always in that context."
1987.87-5565,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1419.254,1421.973,"Your answer to my question is no then, you don't know of any."
1987.87-5565,0,23342,evalynn_welling,,1421.973,1432.681,--I believe that the statute of limitations not being applied to denial of paternity is really the same thing; just a mirror image of it.
1987.87-5565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1680.522,1683.741,"Thank you, Ms. Welling."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1685.174,1689.443,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-5565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.065,1749.381,"May I ask, what do you mean a final judgement?"
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1751.583,1764.057,"--Well, it is, but the court had, in July of 1985, rendered its decision in Pennsylvania."
1987.87-5565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.829,1783.185,"Yes, but if the Pennsylvania statute clearly applied and said it will be retroactive to all cases still pending in our Court, something like that, the fact there was a final judgment wouldn't make any different, would it?"
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1783.185,1787.303,"Well, I think that that is true, but the Court did not say that."
1987.87-5565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1788.422,1790.541,But what if the federal statute says that?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1790.541,1792.907,"--Well, I don't think the federal statute says that."
1987.87-5565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1792.907,1801.229,It says procedures which permit the establishment of the paternity of any child at any time prior to such child's eighteenth birth.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1805.031,1805.8,"Well, that's correct."
1987.87-5565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.8,1809.918,"So, literally this federal statute clearly applies, does it not?"
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1809.918,1817.958,"Well, I don't think that the Pennsylvania statute does not follow the federal 1984 amendments."
1987.87-5565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.408,1823.012,Do you acknowledge that the Pennsylvania statute is in conflict with the federal statute?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1823.012,1823.528,"No, I don't."
1987.87-5565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1868.207,1873.009,You rely on the fact... you just don't rely on the retroactive point.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1875.878,1876.312,That's correct.
1987.87-5565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1885.168,1893.422,--Isn't the general rule that an appellate court looks at the law as of the time of its judgment rather than as of the time of the trial court's judgment?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1893.422,1897.724,"Well, we have to go back to what statute was in effect at that time."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1898.724,1900.64,At the time of the appellate court.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1900.64,1913.984,"I think that I should note that if Congress had wished that these amendments raise cases which had been put to rest, it should have said so."
1987.87-5565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1925.291,1934.164,What you would say it means paternity of any child at any time prior to such child's eighteenth birth really means paternity of any child except those who have tried to establish their paternity up to now and failed to do so.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1936.932,1939.134,I think that's a reasonable interpretation.
1987.87-5565,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1939.134,1951.525,"--What happens on the final judgment on appeal, if the final judgment is reversed on appeal?"
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1951.525,1953.977,What happens?
1987.87-5565,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1958.346,1961.898,"I didn't say it's a final judgment, but it could be reversed on appeal."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1961.898,1962.75,--That's correct.
1987.87-5565,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1962.75,1967.118,"So, in Pennsylvania is that a final judgment or not?"
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1967.118,1973.022,It is a final judgment with respect to what law applies to it--
1987.87-5565,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1973.022,1973.906,Not with respect to it.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1973.906,1976.474,"--was, the final judgment was entered."
1987.87-5565,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1976.474,1981.044,"With respect to this case, is it a final judgment before appeal?"
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1981.044,1987.048,"Yes, it was a final judgment in July of 1985."
1987.87-5565,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1987.048,1989.131,And that's because of Pennsylvania law.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1989.131,1989.817,That's correct.
1987.87-5565,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1994.035,1998.606,That was not an adjudication on the merits though.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,1998.606,2013.349,"--No, it was a... the hearing was held with respect to whether Gene Jeter was estopped from asserting the statute of limitations because of the particular circumstances of this case."
1987.87-5565,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.224,2130.608,The supremacy clause always applies.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2136.128,2137.33,--That's true.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.006,2154.489,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2154.489,2155.391,--Okay.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.391,2157.577,You sort of abbreviated that argument.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2183.025,2183.575,That's correct.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2183.575,2190.798,Because Pennsylvania is entitled not to comply with the federal statute if it doesn't want to so long as it understands that it doesn't get the money.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2190.798,2191.298,That's correct.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.298,2192.048,Okay.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2211.628,2215.347,Jeter is my client.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.347,2218.449,"I'm sorry, the putative child here."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2218.449,2220.234,I think the--
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2220.234,2226.387,"The beneficiary of a program that was supposed to be run in a certain way by the state, but it hasn't been."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2232.625,2237.695,"--Well, I think it's incumbent upon the courts to direct that."
1987.87-5565,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2243.599,2247.568,But that's what they are... how do they get the courts to direct it?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2247.568,2265.596,"Well, if the Pennsylvania statute is deemed to be not in compliance, Pennsylvania has to be given an opportunity, with respect to the King case and the Townsend case, to come into compliance."
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.628,2293.616,What would you have suggested Ms. Clark do to get what she considered justice in the case?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2293.616,2298.484,She did apply for certiorari to this Court.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.484,2301.084,"Yes, but you are telling us we can't do anything."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2310.625,2316.279,"I have said that that is the situation, that is true."
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.496,2319.147,So what should she have done then?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2319.147,2338.275,"--I believe I did say that she applied certiorari to this Court, and that the Court's response, if it sees that there is no compliance, is to give Pennsylvania the opportunity to amend its statute with respect to the 18-year statute of limitations."
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.275,2339.977,"Oh, you acknowledge... I see."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2347.648,2349.998,"Well, the judgment would be if--"
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.998,2359.254,"Tell Pennsylvania to amend its statute subject to being what, judged in default and losing its federal funds?"
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2359.254,2359.872,--Correct.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.872,2365.443,We can issue that judgment in this case.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2365.443,2380.202,I think that you can remand to Pennsylvania to examine its statute to see that if it is retroactive to include Ms. Welling's client.
1987.87-5565,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2380.202,2386.356,"Well, I guess we could also hold that the Pennsylvania statute violates the Equal Protection Clause."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2386.356,2387.839,"That's correct, you could do that."
1987.87-5565,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2480.383,2481.501,"Well, what about the new 18-year statute?"
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2481.501,2482.401,"Pardon me, sir?"
1987.87-5565,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2482.401,2484.603,What about the new 18-year statute?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2484.603,2488.805,"Well, I think that those problems are prevalent there also."
1987.87-5565,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2488.805,2493.208,"But the legislature has adopted it, and hence isn't very concerned with it."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2493.208,2500.946,"Well, I think that we have to look at the motivating factors behind why that 18-year statute was adopted."
1987.87-5565,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2505.898,2507.1,For money.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2507.1,2508.466,--Pennsylvania could receive money.
1987.87-5565,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2508.466,2508.983,Money.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2508.983,2510.218,That's correct.
1987.87-5565,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2510.218,2514.27,But the state interests certainly didn't counterbalance the money interest.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2514.27,2521.775,"Well, I don't think we can compare the six-year statute against the 18-year statute."
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2817.246,2821.15,How come the blood test results changed here?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2833.458,2835.243,I think you are thinking of the Connell case.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.243,2835.943,--That was Connell?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2835.943,2838.779,Connell was cited in Petitioner's brief.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2838.779,2840.379,How long ago was that case?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2840.379,2843.314,Connell was 1984.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2941.679,2951.385,"You don't, but the effect... surely, the effect on the woman in that case is just as horrendous as the effect, if not worse, than the effect upon the man in a paternity case."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2963.926,2965.128,"--That's correct, but I'm going--"
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2965.128,2967.913,And you say that can be done at anytime up until the--
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2967.913,2968.246,--I didn't say that.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2968.913,2971.365,--Is there a six-year statute on that?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,2971.365,2993.862,"--What was specifically stated in the Petitioner's brief was that provided that the putative father is not barred by laches or estoppel, and in each one of these cases the father was barred by laches or estoppel prior to the period of time that would have been represented by the six-year statute."
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3018.529,3019.379,"But now, wait."
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,3033.22,3038.174,"No, this is not illegitimate... this is between wedded parents."
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3041.292,3043.16,--He is disclaiming paternity of the children.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,3043.16,3043.744,--Fine.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3043.744,3044.927,Okay?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,3044.927,3046.196,Correct.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3046.196,3049.731,"So that child would not be a child of the marriage, right?"
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,3049.731,3050.064,Correct.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3050.064,3051.933,The child would be an illegitimate child.
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,3051.933,3052.566,Correct.
1987.87-5565,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3052.566,3053.05,Correct?
1987.87-5565,1,19541,craig_a_mcclean,,3099.081,3099.514,That's not true.
1987.87-5565,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3428.242,3431.427,"Thank you, Mr. McClean."
1987.87-5565,2,23342,evalynn_welling,,3433.463,3436.915,I have no rebuttal.
1987.87-5565,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3437.665,3439.481,"Thank you, Ms. Welling."
