1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,15.276,17.359,Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors.
1961.323,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,17.359,19.442,Mr. Morewitz.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,19.442,36.776,This is a case here on certiorari -from the Fourth Circuit involving a seaman in the characterization of Mr. Justice Story awarded the admiralty.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.011,262.108,The voyage had ended at the time he was discharged?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,262.108,285.611,"The voyage -- the particular trip now -- Your Honors in a case some years ago divided on the question of whether or not the provision, the usual provision in a foreign voyage of a six -- termination, no less than six months or no more than six months rather."
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,470.826,474.276,All you have to show is that the injury or illness or incapacity --
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,474.276,474.635,Yes.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,474.635,476.488,-- occurred while you were in the service of the ship?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,476.488,477.614,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,523.727,528.464,"Now, Mr. Morewitz, let me get a couple of things straight in my own mind, cure is not involved in this case?"
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,528.464,534.716,"Cure is not involved because he was under treatment, had outpatient treatment for as -- over two years, I think."
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,534.716,536.194,Right from the beginning that --
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,536.194,540.115,And he was discharged finally as fit for duty --
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,540.115,540.415,Right.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,540.415,541.199,-- as a seaman.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,541.199,542.139,So cure is not in any way involved in this case?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,542.139,543.566,Cure is not involved.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,543.566,544.73,All that is involved is maintenance?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,544.73,545.666,Is the maintenance.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,545.666,553.5,"And now, what is it -- your position that -- the -- that it was the extent of the respondent's obligations so far as maintenance goes because --"
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,553.5,553.791,Well --
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.791,555.57,-- you told us the voyage had ended.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,555.57,555.94,Yes.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.94,560.842,And I shall think of it at least be arguable that there was absolutely no obligation with respect to maintenance.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,560.842,562.001,"No, Your Honor."
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,591.551,591.741,Right.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,595.963,596.469,Until he --
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,596.469,597.544,-- in your (Voice Overlap) --
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,597.544,604.301,Until he is either cured or there's no possibility of cure as I announced originally.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,604.301,604.583,Until he --
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,604.583,604.601,I don't --
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,604.601,608.43,-- would be -- he's either cured or it was shown that he was incurable?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,608.43,609.06,That's the principle.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,609.06,612.327,And the obligation to pay maintenance would go on until that point was reached?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,612.327,614.172,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,748.726,751.551,Go back to work as a seaman or go back to work generally (Inaudible)?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,751.551,763.011,"I think under the present day, the charge that he gets for them -- the hospital in which took over two years here to get, was that he was fit for duty as a seaman."
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,864.355,869.216,"Well, now the contract didn't -- the contract specified the amount of -- for the --"
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,869.216,870.027,And it also --
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,870.027,870.222,-- in dollars to that.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,870.222,875.523,"Your Honor, made it unconditional with no conditions in the contract, it even --"
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,875.523,878.352,But it didn't go to the question of how long it should be paid --
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,878.352,879.354,"Well, that -- the -- as I --"
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,879.354,880.562,"-- as matter of law, isn't it?"
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,880.562,881.624,That's a matter of law.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,885.897,886.072,And --
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,886.072,886.57,-- to begin with.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,886.57,889.464,And that that's not purported to be dealt with in the point --
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,889.464,889.47,"No, sir."
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,889.47,890.344,-- of bargaining period.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,890.53,890.759,"Now, the --"
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,890.759,892.819,"-- the amount that's specified, is that it?"
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,892.819,893.338,"No, Your Honor."
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,893.338,895.178,The unconditional amount that specified it.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,895.178,899.086,The unconditional amount and the unconditional way in which it was to be paid.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,899.086,899.101,The amount per day?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,899.101,900.786,To be paid weekly.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,925.084,925.101,But --
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,925.101,939.388,That when he is entitled to wages under the law as laid down for nearly a 100 years by Congress that they -- you can't arrest his wages and you certainly couldn't arrest his maintenance.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,971.924,977.483,"Now I would -- I should think, it just appears to me that the respondent could take an even more extreme position."
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,986.252,987.204,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,998.564,1005.071,"Well, let's say he got a job but not as a seaman but as Vice President of General Motors of -- by 50 times what a seaman earns."
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1005.071,1005.272,Well --
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1005.272,1007.231,Do you say he was still entitled to maintenance?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1007.231,1007.765,"No, sir."
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1017.728,1018.368,Well --
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1018.368,1018.901,-- and was able --
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1018.901,1018.949,But your argument --
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1018.949,1019.633,-- to earn more money.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1019.633,1022.223,"Your argument, I should think, would lead you to answer yes."
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1023.756,1024.192,"Well, if --"
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1024.192,1025.476,-- if not able to work as a seaman.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1025.476,1027.46,If I want to be extreme about it I --
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1027.46,1027.8,I'm (Voice Overlap) about it.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1027.8,1031.8,I might and he could but I don't want to be that extreme.
1961.323,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1113.216,1114.464,Can he lose?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1114.464,1115.078,Sir?
1961.323,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1115.078,1115.78,Can he lose?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1115.78,1116.559,Yes.
1961.323,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1161.103,1174.439,"So we can't put -- there aren't any scales by which we can weigh their respective appeal, their professional judgment or wisdom and (Inaudible) Judge Soper and Judge Sobeloff, can we?"
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1174.439,1194.502,"No sir, except this that if the reasoning of a one as against the other appeals to the court has been the fair and just way of handling a thing of this sort which affects one of the lowest class of our citizen."
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1230.194,1232.993,"Of course while he's in the hospital, he gets both maintenance and cure, does he?"
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1232.993,1234.099,Yes.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1234.099,1235.382,From the hospital?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1235.382,1237.489,He gets at the expense of the United States.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1237.489,1238.539,That's right.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1239.219,1239.616,Yes.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1239.616,1239.669,-- and cure.
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1239.669,1241.463,And he also gets medical treatment.
1961.323,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1241.463,1242.836,Yes.
1961.323,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1242.836,1246.285,What's the source of the doctrine of maintenance?
1961.323,0,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,1247.393,1252.447,In law -- the -- it was a non -- it was developed as I have stated -- suggested for --
1961.323,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1252.447,1253.607,"A judge may think, isn't it?"
1961.323,1,45530,walter_b_martin_jr,,1978.853,1983.651,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2030.392,2035.113,"His employment, his articles when he signed on, what were the terms of his employment?"

1961.323,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2037.105,2037.403,So far as --

1961.323,1,45530,walter_b_martin_jr,,2047.361,2048.193,"That's correct, sir."
1961.323,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2055.498,2061.474,"The -- so far as this case is concerned, does it make any difference how long he was a seaman?"
1961.323,1,45530,walter_b_martin_jr,,2061.474,2068.101,I think it does if we are going to rely upon the dissenting opinion of Judge Sobeloff.
1961.323,2,32132,jacob_l_morewitz,,2073.389,2081.955,If I may be permitted to suggest Your Honor that the articles are not here and they're quoting from it and the ordinary one has a six months termination.
1961.323,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2087.116,2096.054,"Oh, I'd suggest if you want to quote further from the articles that you submit the articles to us so we can -- so the Court can see them."
1961.323,3,45530,walter_b_martin_jr,,2096.054,2098.448,I was merely reciting from my memory.
1961.323,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2099.87,2100.192,Yes.

1961.323,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2627.978,2633.261,"So that when you're an inpatient in the hospital, you get both maintenance and cure."

1961.323,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2875.43,2882.342,Well you think -- you think that should be bound by the rigid principle to contract law?
1961.323,3,45530,walter_b_martin_jr,,2883.763,2887.56,"That is my argument here, that he has the duty to mitigate."

1961.323,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3115.016,3115.234,-- (Voice Overlap) a complaint.
