2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-45, Elgin v. Department of the Treasury."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,7.47,10.939,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-45,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,66.608,67.308,Mr. Schwartz--
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,67.308,67.692,Yes?
2011.11-45,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,67.692,76.916,"--suppose an employee is fired and he has a variety of different kinds of claims, constitutional and statutory."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,87.189,88.189,"No, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,95.628,98.164,"Well, that seems just as bad."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,108.952,109.637,That is correct.
2011.11-45,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,109.637,111.421,Why -- why would we do that?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,111.421,124.731,Because of the importance of making the constitutional claims available in -- in a -- for judicial review.
2011.11-45,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,130.718,132.668,Why would you make that concession?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,157.618,161.987,"That -- that certainly is a possibility, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.151,216.241,In -- in those cases did the -- did the plaintiffs also have nonconstitutional claims which they were pursuing in the Federal Circuit?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,216.241,220.526,We -- we were unable to -- to find any example of -- of that happening.
2011.11-45,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.526,221.478,"Well, that's -- that's the problem here."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,235.468,239.772,I -- and I -- I agree that that is a more difficult situation.
2011.11-45,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,243.891,249.128,You suggested that it's a situation that doesn't often arise and I guess that puzzles me.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,250.612,252.997,I don't know why it doesn't often arise.
2011.11-45,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,259.234,261.25,"Counsel, do you--"
2011.11-45,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,261.25,268.59,What -- what would happen if -- if the employee is fired because of his or her religion and he goes to MSPB.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,268.59,269.34,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,269.34,271.458,And this is a First Amendment claim.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,282.647,299.275,"Your Honor, if -- if an employee is -- is fired because of his religion, there's -- there is a -- a separate procedure for discrimination claims such as could be brought under Title VII; and in fact, in -- those claims do go directly to the Supreme Court."
2011.11-45,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,299.275,301.477,"No, because -- well, let's -- then I have to do a new hypothetical."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,306.279,307.048,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,307.048,311.433,--saying there is no global warming or something.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,311.433,311.967,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.259,327.461,But the MSPB -- we can't look at the First Amendment?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,327.461,327.994,--No.
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,328.761,331.68,Mr. Schwartz--
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,331.68,334.865,"I'm sorry, just to clarify: No, they wouldn't say that?"
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,338.567,339.019,Okay.
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,341.436,346.423,"--Mr. Schwartz, I thought you're talking about the constitutionality of a statute--"
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,346.423,347.875,"That's it exactly, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,347.875,354.446,--not any constitutional claim that there has been unconstitutional action by an official.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,361.765,363.801,"That is my point exactly, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,363.801,368.003,Could I -- I please verify your answer to Justice Kennedy before you move on?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,368.003,368.386,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,378.644,381.513,--Are you talking about a facial challenge to the statute?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,392.904,393.621,--Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,411.346,416.333,"But I -- I was leading up to say, why should there be a difference?"
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,428.474,434.878,"--Well, I would -- with due respect, I -- I -- I disagree with you, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.874,457.91,"Well, and whether that reason was justifiable."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,466.23,467.016,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.016,470.568,So why do you need a facial challenge in addition?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,498.701,513.061,"Justice Scalia, I -- I agree that in the as-applied challenge, where somebody says my rights were violated, that case now goes and should go to the Merit Systems Protection Board."
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,526.987,534.493,"So that's the rule -- that's the rule that you would apply across the board, so only in the case of a facial challenge do you get to go to the district court?"
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,540.814,542.88,--Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,544.349,560.542,Could you tell me how -- how -- how this is any different than the administrative system and review system that was reviewed in Thunder Basin and Illinois Long-Term Care?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,577.92,579.57,--Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,614.526,617.445,But please deal with the language of both cases.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,633.073,633.573,--Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,633.573,635.19,So why isn't that okay here?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,651.451,686.808,The first thing that's wrong -- that's wrong with that procedure as it would be applied to this case is that it's -- it's a vast departure from the Civil Service Reform Act scheme as it was created by Congress; and -- and because that scheme involves the Merit Systems Protection Board acting as a trial court; and -- and given the first level of review and in effect substituting for the -- for a district court.
2011.11-45,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,687.391,693.961,Isn't one of the challenges here by one of the Petitioners that he was constructively discharged?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,704.317,714.189,"--Well, in fact, it's -- it's just the reverse of that, where that one Petitioner would be taking the position that he was not constructively discharged."
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,733.086,745.577,"I thought your -- your position was that the Merit Systems Protection Board has said we have no authority to adjudicate constitutional questions, period."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,745.577,746.127,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,746.127,755.683,So I thought the court was saying that this claim is dismissed because we don't have jurisdiction to deal with that kind of question.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,769.425,770.075,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,770.075,772.311,I thought that that's what your position was.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,772.311,782.917,"That is what our position is, and, and it leaves open the question of just what the Federal Circuit is going to do after the Merit Systems Protection Board has dismissed for lack of jurisdiction."
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,782.917,787.587,"But that's not your position, as I understood it, in your response to my earlier question."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,798.777,819.173,"My position is that if the MSPB has jurisdiction to find a statute -- that since the MSPB does not have jurisdiction to find a statute unconstitutional, any claim in which the employee is asking for them to find a statute unconstitutional is one that is outside of the CSRA scheme."
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,819.173,829.779,"Okay, but -- but within the statutory scheme, are you saying that a claim that this statute is, while not facially unconstitutional, unconstitutional as applied to me?"
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,830.981,835.349,"Mr. Chief Justice, I apologize for my confusion about--"
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,835.349,836.885,I think it's probably mine.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,836.885,839.919,"--I would defer to you, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,839.919,844.371,Where does -- where does that claim go?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,844.371,847.24,"My confusion is about the use of the term ""as-applied""."
2011.11-45,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,866.202,876.426,"Well, why wouldn't the dividing line be -- and I think that this is consistent with your argument -- the dividing line should be where the MSPB itself could decide the claim."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,876.426,876.86,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,876.86,880.978,"If the MSPB can decide the claim, then it goes to the MSPB."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,886.698,887.15,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,887.15,912.366,"And you're saying that the MSPB has said that, although it can decide, can decide, cases where he says, you know, my supervisor fired me for a discriminatory reason, that that's within the scope of the MSPB's authority, a claim like this, which is that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional full stop, is not within the scope of the MSPB's authority."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,912.849,914.301,"Yes, that's absolutely correct."
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,940.868,944.42,"What type, summer interns and FBI employees?"
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,944.42,944.87,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,944.87,954.962,"I assume that's for very different reasons, one because they are summer interns and you know, if they are impermissibly treated it's kind of, they are summer interns."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,989.23,1011.179,"Actually, Your Honor, it's the government that is taking the position that the summer interns, the FBI agents, all the government attorneys, Federal Government chaplains, who have no right to appeal to the MSPB, all of those persons the government says can bring their constitutional claims to the district court."
2011.11-45,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.179,1013.162,And why is that wrong?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1048.702,1067.58,"Because the summer intern, the FBI agent, the nonpreference employee, the accepted service employees, unless they have a claim that they can take to the Merit Systems Protection Board, they are precluded from going to any other court."
2011.11-45,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.516,1099.051,"Yes, but that's -- that's entirely logical."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1110.526,1111.009,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1111.009,1112.159,They are not entitled to--
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1125.619,1133.356,"Well I -- I agree with you completely that, that constitutional claims are different from statutory claims."
2011.11-45,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.356,1133.856,Exactly.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1133.856,1134.725,Or damages case.
2011.11-45,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1134.725,1149.317,"It's those that I say that people not covered by appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board, they can bring those constitutional claims, even though they can't bring statutory claims."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1149.317,1149.65,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.185,1154.769,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1164.41,1164.843,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.843,1172.314,"And you're saying even the people who can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, right, can go directly to the district court."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1173.616,1183.888,"But I -- I'm limiting that to those people who can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, but the Merit Systems Protection Board has no authority to grant them relief."
2011.11-45,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1183.888,1193.31,There are at least -- at least three different kind of constitutional claims and I'm not sure where you're drawing the line with respect to your argument.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1200.183,1200.516,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1200.516,1202.702,--but there is unconstitutional executive action.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1231.769,1232.637,Just the first category.
2011.11-45,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1232.637,1235.839,So it's not a distinction between as-applied and facial.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1235.839,1237.539,"No, no, no."
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1244.945,1251.515,"I thought your position was that whatever the MSPB cannot hear, then you go to the district court."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1251.515,1252.699,That is absolutely correct.
2011.11-45,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1252.699,1260.47,"And in your original briefs, Mr. Schwartz, you suggested that if the MSPB can't hear a claim, neither can the Federal Circuit."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1286.105,1293.842,I agree that a system can be proposed to get these claims to the Federal circuit.
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1312.422,1330.3,"Do you take the position that, the MSPB having no jurisdiction and saying it has no jurisdiction it, can adjudicate this matter, well then, a reviewing court has no jurisdiction to, to -- to review?"
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1334.251,1336.87,--That's how it would work in the real world.
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1364.188,1369.175,Is it really a question of jurisdiction of the MSPB?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1369.175,1369.709,Well--
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1369.709,1372.377,"""Jurisdiction"" is a word with many meanings."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1372.377,1373.027,--Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1389.172,1390.838,So what's the problem?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1419.874,1423.742,"That's a system that, that could come up."
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1427.494,1428.144,I don't know.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1430.813,1433.432,"--Oh, it presents immense practical problem."
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1433.432,1433.832,Which is?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1433.832,1445.422,Which is that the Merit Systems Protection Board is not going to say we affirm your dismissal or that -- it's not going to reach the merits.
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1449.809,1450.109,"Fine, fine."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1455.38,1455.83,--Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1455.83,1460.015,"We do not have jurisdiction over that, therefore we say you were rightly dismissed."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1460.015,1460.465,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1460.465,1467.271,"Now, they appeal that, and they say: They are right that they didn't, but you do, so will you please decide that this statute is unconstitutional?"
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1468.088,1471.807,"Well, that's -- that's an unusual form of--"
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.807,1472.657,It may be unusual.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1479.079,1485.649,"--Okay, the problem, if that is the system that's going to be in place, is that it's not quite that straightforward."
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1502.492,1505.813,"No, it doesn't affirm the dismissal."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1510.032,1526.309,"And then in a case such as this one, where -- the reason that this challenge to Rostker is that the facts have changed."
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1530.145,1538.784,"I thought your point was and hasn't the Federal Circuit said that the MSPB has no jurisdiction to decide, we have no jurisdiction to review."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1538.784,1540.684,--That's what the Federal Circuit had said.
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1540.684,1545.021,And that an appellate court is reviewing a court of first instance.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1552.425,1566.951,"And that is why what's proposed by the government is such a departure from the CSRA scheme as written by Congress, in which MSPB has first instance jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit has appellate jurisdiction."
2011.11-45,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1566.951,1578.326,"Well, isn't your basic answer to Justice Breyer, I mean correct me if I'm wrong, you think that the problem is that there is no record that the Federal Circuit can use to evaluate this constitutional claim."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1578.326,1579.009,That is correct.
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1579.009,1584.646,"Well, every day of the week we get constitutional claims and people submit all their arguments in the briefs."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1605.493,1612.349,The problem is that that's not the scheme written by Congress--
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1612.349,1621.771,That's your conclusion and I want to know what -- what is the practical reason that that wouldn't work or why is that such a big problem to have it work that way?
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1626.307,1626.859,--Okay.
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1632.579,1633.846,Give me one where it wouldn't.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1633.846,1635.365,Excuse me?
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1635.365,1637.281,Give me one where it wouldn't.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1638.816,1639.033,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1639.033,1640.95,So you have to be thinking about it and if you want to respond.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1640.95,1642.45,Okay.
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1642.45,1644.568,I thought you said this one.
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1644.568,1645.202,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1645.202,1652.856,"This one, because you want to make a record of all the changes that have occurred in the service and you need much more than briefs."
2011.11-45,0,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1666.115,1667.731,Yes.
2011.11-45,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1673.352,1673.702,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1676.554,1679.923,Thank you.
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1714.679,1717.214,"You could just ask the MSPB, Mr. Feigin."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1731.224,1738.645,"Well, I don't think that's consistent with the CSRA, Your Honor, because the way the CSRA works is that you go to the MSPB first and then you go to the Federal Circuit."
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1740.58,1744.699,"Well, but the CSRA is presuming that the MSPB actually can decide something."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1744.699,1754.237,--I don't think it's presuming that any more than 42 U.S.C. 405(g) was presuming that in Illinois Council or the Mine Act was presuming that in Thunder Basin Coal.
2011.11-45,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1778.789,1792.798,"Those statutes to which you refer said that no action on the claim for Social Security benefits, no action shall be brought under 1331."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1795.298,1799.618,--That was true in Illinois Council and some of the other cases we cite.
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1828.387,1836.475,"Well, could you help me with something, because I agree with you, Thunder Basin is a very strong case for you, but McNary is a very strong case for Mr. Schwartz."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1843.981,1846.266,"We prefer Thunder Basin, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1847.099,1847.699,"Yes, I imagine."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1847.699,1856.555,"Your Honor, I think, as we suggest in our brief, McNary actually presented a very specialized circumstance in several respects."
2011.11-45,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1922.597,1928.234,Is that your -- is that your answer for that's why it's an out for their failure to have gone to the Federal Circuit?
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1928.234,1931.436,--Our answer -- our answer--
2011.11-45,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1931.436,1938.273,"Will they be able -- if the commission says, no, we won't reopen, do they have any avenue now to go to the Federal Circuit?"
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1938.273,1943.677,"--Well, they can appeal that decision to the Federal Circuit, and the government will again support the fact that the case ought to be reopened."
2011.11-45,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1943.677,1944.494,Please finish with your answer.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1944.494,1948.315,Let me now address what should have happened when the case went to the MSPB.
2011.11-45,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1993.509,1995.961,If I can ask you to pause briefly on that question.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1995.961,1996.395,--Yes.
2011.11-45,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1996.395,2012.971,"So the government -- if Mr. Schwartz comes in before the MSPB and says, we have three witnesses who are only going to testify on the constitutional issue; I have this volume of evidence about what's happening in the military; it's only relevant in the constitutional issue; and, you know, it's going to take us two days to present this."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2015.423,2016.292,"Well, Your Honor--"
2011.11-45,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2016.292,2019.327,They are not going to object that that's beyond the jurisdiction of the agency to decide.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2019.327,2022.613,--We will not object that it's not beyond the jurisdiction of the agency to decide--
2011.11-45,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2022.613,2023.196,"TWell, I will object."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2032.484,2047.827,"--Well, Your Honor, I think this is fairly analogous, although not perfectly analogous, to the fairly common circumstance where, for example, a district court reserves to itself a decision on the merits of an action and then delegates to a magistrate judge decisions on discovery."
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2049.644,2056.333,"Well, its very different because the magistrate can come back to the district court judge and say, we have a tough one, Your Honor, why don't you decide it?"
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2075.727,2087.268,"--Well, first of all, Your Honor, the only thing that we think the MSPB lacks authority to do, the only thing is to issue an order on the merits declaring a Federal statute unconstitutional."
2011.11-45,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2089.554,2097.141,How can it -- how can it deal with discovery without knowing -- without going into the merits of the constitutional claim?
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2100.778,2101.262,--Well--
2011.11-45,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2101.262,2105.147,"Any evidence they think might be possibly be relevant to the case, they can put that in."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2106.38,2109.332,"--Well, there may be disputes as to the scope of discovery."
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2122.805,2126.091,Do you think the MSPB should find facts with regard to this claim?
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2126.091,2141.284,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, I think this case isn't going to require any fact finding because I think it's worth noting that both judges that have addressed Petitioner's arguments on the merits, the district court judge and the concurring judge in the Court of Appeals were able to resolve the claim without fact finding."
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2141.284,2144.153,"I would think, Mr. Feigin, it would depend on how it's litigated."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2151.492,2153.442,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2156.044,2159.829,Can you go back and tell me when the government changed its position.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2182.492,2185.477,"--Well, Your Honor, I need to separate out two things."
2011.11-45,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.07,2254.624,"I don't want to delay the -- don't pause too long, but I'm curious."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2263.946,2266.348,"So there is not a statute, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2362.06,2370.464,"Well, Mr. Feigin, they might well be the same claim, but if the MSPB can decide the one and cannot decide the other, that's a relevant distinction."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2385.758,2408.022,"--Well, Your Honor, even if the MSPB lacks the authority to strike down a Federal statute, I still think it might be able to adjudicate the claim of the employee, the second employee, who brings it as an as-applied challenge because the Court would -- I'm sorry not the Court -- the MSPB could decide that case on the same constitutional avoidance grounds that are resolved -- that are urged by the first employee."
2011.11-45,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2420.23,2421.431,They are not the same claim.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2432.837,2441.762,"--Well, Your Honor, I think they are the same in the respect that as I was just saying to Justice Kagan, if the MSPB--"
2011.11-45,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2441.762,2452.618,"When we just wanted to rephrase that -- If this Court adopts a certain interpretation based on principle of constitutional avoidance, do you think the Court is rewriting the statute?"
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2452.618,2459.372,"--No, Your Honor, but there may be ambiguity in a statute that the Court interprets to avoid a significant constitutional question."
2011.11-45,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2544.007,2546.126,Is there any such possibility in this case?
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2562.636,2564.286,"--I agree with that, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.11-45,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2584.047,2604.36,"To go back to your interesting suggestion that the board should decide the constitutional issue, I've just been spending a little bit of time going through the act, and you're certainly -- it doesn't appear that there's anything in the act that precludes them from granting any appropriate relief with respect to an unlawful discharge."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2605.027,2606.646,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2616.002,2618.454,"Well, that's weird in another way, isn't it, Mr. Feigin?"
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2626.124,2636.498,"--Well, as everyone agrees, and as Mr. Schwartz was discussing with the Court, the MSPB does have expertise on -- in constitutional claims."
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2643.235,2649.305,"Well, but this is a question, and -- and you can -- I take the point that I'm just talking about this case."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2667.351,2675.271,"Well, I think that's right, Justice Kagan, but the CSRA doesn't draw distinctions between the types of arguments that are being made."
2011.11-45,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2682.007,2686.376,Congress -- Congress is unhappy when this Court holds a statute unconstitutional.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2697.184,2698.634,"--I don't, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2703.954,2704.387,Why?
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2751.685,2756.987,"--It's coming from statements by this Court, and also statements by Kenneth Davis in 1958."
2011.11-45,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2757.839,2762.707,"So somebody quoted Kenneth Davis in 1958, and wrote it into an opinion in a holding?"
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2762.707,2764.259,--No.
2011.11-45,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2767.828,2769.397,So Kenneth Davis said this in 1958.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2769.397,2773.931,--The Court made very clear in Thunder Basin this is just a general presumption about the authority of administrative agencies.
2011.11-45,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2774.931,2776.383,Johnson v. Robison is one such case.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2783.37,2790.91,"--Well, that treatise is cited -- for example, by -- the Court cites the Mine Commission cases that themselves cite the treatise."
2011.11-45,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2804.068,2805.903,If I could just focus there.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2817.96,2823.631,"--Yes, we agree with the MSPB's position that it lacks the authority to strike down a statute as unconstitutional."
2011.11-45,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2853.467,2876.166,"If somebody who drafted or voted for the Civil Service Reform Act had thought about a case like this, where it's a pure question of law, a facial challenge to constitutionality of a statute, do you think they would have said well, the way we think that this should be handled is this scheme that you have proposed?"
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2876.166,2884.003,"I think they would have preferred it to a scheme where first of all, the claims go to district court, which is precisely what the CSRA was trying to eliminate."
2011.11-45,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2894.477,2907.467,Do you know of any other -- any other case where an appellant court has authority to decide a question that the court of first instance lacked authority to decide?
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2928.781,2937.57,"--Well, Your Honor, first of all, we cite several examples of courts of appeals deciding constitutional questions in the first instance, at pages 37 to 38 in our brief."
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2952.513,2958.5,"Mr. Feigin, could I go back to the Chief Justice's question about what actually would happen in the MSPB."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2994.387,3004.092,"He would develop it in the MSPB, either in the first instance on the initial appeal, or the MSPB could let it go to the Federal circuit without having developed an administrative record."
2011.11-45,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3016.467,3017.252,I don't like that at all.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3041.083,3047.337,"--Your Honor, if the Court believes that that is a better way to reconcile the scheme, we wouldn't oppose that either, but--"
2011.11-45,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3047.337,3048.105,"Well, I don't like that."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3084.629,3087.147,"--That was our position, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3087.147,3091.598,"But, but, but -- but this is not an area that's within their expertise to decide."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3102.52,3113.895,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, I think it's actually going to be a fairly rare case in which a challenge to a legislative act, passing a statute, is really going to turn on some sort of factual finding--"
2011.11-45,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3113.895,3114.745,"Well, this is--"
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3114.745,3123.0,--like a credibility determination -- like a credibility determination or something that's uniquely within the competence of a trial court or an agency with trial court-like powers.
2011.11-45,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3154.834,3172.831,"I suspect that if this were litigated in district court, the government would move to dismiss and would take the position that it doesn't matter; even if women can now do 99 percent of the -- the things that are done in the military, the -- the Registration Act is still constitutional."
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3175.247,3176.866,"Your Honor, I don't--"
2011.11-45,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3176.866,3185.055,"Would you say that if -- if it can be proven that they have -- that women are now, that the percentage is now high enough, the statute may be unconstitutional?"
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3193.928,3195.178,--Well--
2011.11-45,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3195.178,3197.863,All of this -- all of this development of the factual record?
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3205.802,3215.991,"--Well, Your Honor, the way to deal with that would be to just have a very quick stop in the MSPB which assures itself yes, this is a constitutional challenge to a statute."
2011.11-45,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3225.564,3232.786,Is there any rule of the board that stops a litigant from making a proffer -- an offer of proof?
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3232.786,3234.988,"--There is not, Your Honor, and in fact--"
2011.11-45,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3234.988,3239.774,"Wouldn't that be the proper way of doing it, if you're going to go up on a constitutional claim?"
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3245.242,3247.01,"--That's where I was going with this, Your Honor."
2011.11-45,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3262.937,3269.293,"What if -- I guess the party doesn't -- doesn't even have to raise its constitutional claim before the MSPB, does it?"
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3269.293,3270.576,"Well, the Federal--"
2011.11-45,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3270.576,3273.678,It's pretty odd to say that you've somehow waived a claim you couldn't pursue.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3273.678,3281.684,"--Well, the Federal Circuit has in analogous cases decided constitutional claims that weren't raised in front of an agency when the agency couldn't decide them."
2011.11-45,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.145,3299.478,--Wait.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3309.418,3312.72,"Yes, Your Honor, I think the Court has recognized--"
2011.11-45,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3312.72,3314.072,Curiouser and curiouser.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3325.094,3333.783,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think what should happen in a case like this is that the employee appeals to the MSPB and says nothing at all."
2011.11-45,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3398.626,3400.011,Where did -- where did Salfi go?
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3408.431,3410.55,"--In Salfi, Your Honor?"
2011.11-45,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3410.55,3410.983,Um-hum.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3410.983,3412.152,That would have been in district court.
2011.11-45,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3436.284,3437.8,Not on the constitutional question.
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3437.8,3444.188,I think it would still be the preferred course that the agency would do any further fact-finding that would be necessary in the first instance.
2011.11-45,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3444.188,3444.473,Why?
2011.11-45,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3449.525,3462.751,"Well, under 405(g), rather than 1331, the preferred form of fact-finding is in the agency, and remands to the agency for further fact-finding whether than development of the facts in the district court in the first instance."
