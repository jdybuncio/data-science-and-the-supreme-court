1971.70-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,17.778,The Federal Trade Commission against Sperry Hutchinson.
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,19.582,23.056,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,444.681,447.354,For what period?
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,447.354,450.982,That went back to the beginning of S&H.
1971.70-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,450.982,453.602,"I assume rather long, a long period of time?"
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,453.602,456.016,"A long period of time, yes."
1971.70-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1089.893,1091.127,Mr. Mclaren?
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1118.931,1122.866,I am sorry; I did not make that clear Mr. Justice Stewart.
1971.70-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1131.97,1132.619,"I see, that was the only count."
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1132.619,1139.978,It was only count three that came to the Court of Appeals and it is only count three that is here.
1971.70-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1139.978,1152.07,I think the concurring opinion of Commissioner Elman and the dissenting opinion do not really direct themselves to Count Three in any explicit kind of way at all?
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1152.07,1156.001,Mr. Elman’s opinion as I recall.
1971.70-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1164.396,1165.509,Industry wide study.
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1165.509,1166.75,"Industry wide study, yes."
1971.70-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1166.75,1167.176,Right.
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1167.176,1180.824,And I think he simply concurred and reiterated that then Commissioner Jones I believe dissented only on the theory that the remedy did not go far enough with respect to the one for ten holdings.
1971.70-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1194.667,1200.885,So there was no appeal by S&H on finding suggested on counts one and two?
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1200.885,1204.117,That is correct.
1971.70-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1204.117,1206.03,Thank you.
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1206.03,1209.838,"Well, as the matter of law."
1971.70-70,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1397.791,1416.997,Mr. Mclaren would you mind telling me precisely what are your (Inaudible).
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1416.997,1428.874,"It is at paragraph 5, Mr. Justice Brennan and in paragraph 6 and paragraph 7."
1971.70-70,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1428.874,1429.961,Those were the only first.
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1429.961,1430.636,"Yes,"
1971.70-70,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1430.636,1434.961,"I gather S&H has five and the rest is the others, is that it?"
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1434.961,1437.977,I assume that they are in process.
1971.70-70,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1437.977,1439.25,At least it is not on appeal.
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1439.25,1440.253,Not on appeal.
1971.70-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.253,1454.291,Could you tell me where is the Federal Trade Commission finding conclusions or opinion it relies on the entree to consumers?
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1454.291,1468.447,"Mr. Justice White, the opinion itself speaks very little in the section under count three of the impact on consumers."
1971.70-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1493.794,1494.587,Anticompetitive
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1494.587,1497.403,Anticompetitive effect and-
1971.70-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1497.403,1515.171,"Do you think, do you think really that a Court could affirm the Commission by putting aside the question of the anticompetitive effect in just resting it solely on the injuries of consumers even if there was no injury to competition?"
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1515.171,1520.301,"As the matter of law, I think in your question of course Mr. Justice White in this particular case."
1971.70-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.301,1526.304,Would not be resting an affirmance on the ground that the Commission really reached?
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1526.304,1542.129,"No, I think that in this particular case, the Commission saw this as a matter of impact upon the consumer from the elimination of these outlets and this runs throughout the opinion and the both Commission."
1971.70-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.129,1557.51,"I hope that the Commission and- do you think a fair reading of the Commission's opinion is that even if there is no injury to competition, we nevertheless find this as an unfair practice because consumers are injured?"
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1557.51,1557.727,Yes.
1971.70-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.083,1564.86,I certainly read your brief that way but I did wonder where you can find the appropriate commission.
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1564.86,1566.498,I look at order.
1971.70-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.378,1582.52,"I know but the Commission expressly said in its opinion, they did not want to rest its opinion on any such narrow technical ground."
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1583.849,1587.189,And it is not the opinion but the order goes to that and that have (Inaudible) to me.
1971.70-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.189,1593.258,I know but the opinion said that it did not want to rest it on that technical ground.
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1602.224,1610.048,I think that it is true that the impact on competition caused the injuries to the consumer and --
1971.70-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.048,1618.843,"Well, so again I say, if the impact on competition then was essential to the FTC’s conclusion."
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1618.843,1620.05,That undoubtedly is true.
1971.70-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.05,1621.103,Well then.
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1631.034,1631.248,No.
1971.70-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.831,1696.223,"Well, maybe that is true but what I am truly getting at is whether or not an appellate Court would be free to affirm the Commission or Uphold the Commission on the so ground that injury to consumers rather than to competition."
1971.70-70,0,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,1704.424,1706.322,"As a matter of law, yes they could."
1971.70-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1742.019,1744.937,"Thank you, Mr. Mclaren."
1971.70-70,1,27911,harold_l_russell,,1747.065,1751.849,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-70,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2433.274,2436.822,"Where are these findings in the appendix, what page?"
1971.70-70,1,27911,harold_l_russell,,2436.822,2458.789,"Yes sir, page 126 and that those are the ones that I have just mentioned and actually petitioner has two fragile straws upon which it relies 126 and 176."
1971.70-70,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2458.789,2460.947,Now that page 126 --
1971.70-70,1,27911,harold_l_russell,,2460.947,2462.299,Of the joint appendix one yes.
1971.70-70,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2462.299,2464.494,Page 126 finding 89?
1971.70-70,1,27911,harold_l_russell,,2464.494,2473.295,89 and then the second of the three conclusions immediately below that.
1971.70-70,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2473.295,2474.49,"All right, thank you."
1971.70-70,1,27911,harold_l_russell,,2474.49,2490.304,"And then 176, you find the second straw where it is alleged and petitioner alleges that the Commission adopted the examiner's finding on injury to consumers."
1971.70-70,2,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,3699.049,3703.61,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-70,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3777.367,3781.147,Where do we find the specific finding on that by the Commission?
1971.70-70,2,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,3781.147,3788.653,No specific Mr. Chief Justice I was quoting from the testimony of one of the witnesses.
1971.70-70,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3788.653,3798.338,"It was not, certainly, would the defender I hope that the commission made a finding on that force?"
1971.70-70,2,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,3798.338,3800.28,I think it would.
1971.70-70,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3852.156,3854.581,"That is the case now, is it not?"
1971.70-70,2,39860,richard_w_mclaren,,3854.581,3855.303,I beg your pardon?
