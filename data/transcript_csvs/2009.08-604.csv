2009.08-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.774,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-604, Union Pacific Railroad v. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen."
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,10.369,12.526,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,49.322,55.912,"Counsel, the circuit court did things in an unusual order."
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,76.859,90.508,"--Well, Your Honor, it certainly would be this Court's prerogative and appropriate for this Court to choose to reach the statutory ground first, but we think that the Respondents have no viable claim under the statute, and so then--"
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,90.508,90.945,Why not?
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,90.945,101.224,--Their only claim under the statute is under the second statutory ground of review for an award that fails to confine or conform itself to the board's jurisdiction.
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,103.127,104.157,No.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,107.452,107.877,"--But, Your Honor--"
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,107.877,108.579,That's the--
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,108.579,112.108,"--They -- they have never made that argument, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,112.108,114.495,"--Well, I saw it in their brief to the Ninth Circuit."
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,125.96,132.864,"Your Honor, on -- on page 5 of their brief to the Seventh Circuit, they waived any argument based on that first statutory ground of review."
2009.08-604,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,142.157,147.952,"It's the same argument -- it's the same argument, as if you had an APA case, and the words in the APA are"
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,156.04,156.792,"--Well, if--"
2009.08-604,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,156.792,165.664,"And I don't really see that it's any different, except we normally go to those words before we would decide a due process question."
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,168.913,171.285,"--Your Honor, I think that there is an important difference."
2009.08-604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,270.773,276.833,"May I ask, just to be -- do you -- do you contest the question of whether there was conferencing?"
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,276.833,280.113,"--It's a complex question, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,295.044,297.322,You conceded that there was conferencing?
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,297.322,299.602,We didn't contest that point in the arbitration.
2009.08-604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,312.063,313.423,I'm not sure that answers my question.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,313.423,327.48,"--Well, we took the position in the arbitration that we don't know for sure whether conferencing occurred and that it's Respondent's burden to prove it, and that the proof that they proffered in the arbitration was not convincing and sufficient to satisfy their burden."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,332.897,334.788,But you didn't contest it in two.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,338.992,342.475,"In two cases, that appears to be correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,352.376,354.064,"Yes, but the board can make rules of procedure."
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,403.556,410.789,"--But Your Honor, the board was -- I think the board is entitled to mean different things by the word 3 court would mean."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,440.837,451.677,"So you say this is just a mistaken use of words, rather than -- than the board saying, under our rules, we don't have power to handle this?"
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,451.677,457.799,"The substance -- I think it can -- you can get tied up in the word ""jurisdiction"" in a way that makes it more confusing than it needs to be."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.195,504.387,"Do you -- do you dispute what your opponent tells us, that some panels of the board, even when there has been no conference, let alone no proof of a conference, but some panels have stayed proceedings to allow the conference to occur, and then the board will pick up?"
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,504.387,507.963,"--That -- we don't contest that, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,530.311,594.816,"That's true generally, but if the board believes that as a matter of law it can't hear this dispute and consider normal grounds for excusing a failure to include something in the record because, in its own language, we can't do it, the law doesn't permit us to do it, we have no jurisdiction to consider matters outside the record, we don't apply normal rules of waiver or forfeiture or any of the other rules that attend themselves to a failure of a party to immediately raise a defense like you could have done and waited two and a half years to do, doesn't that suggest that the board is not reaching -- merely resting its decision on a merely procedural rule, it's resting its decision on its erroneous view that the law deprives it of jurisdiction to hear the case?"
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,594.816,595.752,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,604.312,606.528,"No, but that -- this is not merely a question of law."
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,610.98,616.463,"--There is no question, no one has ever disputed in this case, that the board was entitled to hear this matter."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,638.417,642.009,I am looking at the decision and they are all identical in this respect.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,666.829,674.231,"Again, Your Honor, I think the important point is that the board is not required to use the word ""jurisdiction"" in precisely this sense."
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,680.51,693.519,"Don't you think there is a big difference between the adjudicator saying: I could, but I choose not to because there is no reason for your failure, from: I won't because I can't."
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,693.519,694.564,--Yes.
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,694.564,698.017,Those are -- those are two very different concepts.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,698.017,701.059,"They're -- they certainly are in an Article 3 court, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,706.167,707.872,Can you -- could you go back for a minute?
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,785.432,796.85,"I think that there are several things wrong with it, Your Honor, starting from the premise that the statute guarantees in all instances procedures that are, quote unquote, ""fair"" in an untethered sense."
2009.08-604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.716,847.822,Are there any -- is there any rule describing how one has to get this into the record?
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,853.742,868.438,"--As the board has explained in prior cases, the ordinary method of proving that conferencing occurred is that the last exchange of correspondence on the property between the carrier and the union, references the conference that had occurred and what happened."
2009.08-604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,889.894,891.661,"But that doesn't refer to conferencing, does it?"
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,891.661,896.673,"A full statement of -- of all of the facts and supporting data, which includes conferencing."
2009.08-604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.203,900.904,Implicitly includes con -- not expressly includes conferencing.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,900.904,906.274,"Well, that's how the board has understood it, and, of course, the board is entitled as an arbitral body to interpret its own rules."
2009.08-604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.274,906.789,I see.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,906.789,920.301,"Within the enormous discretion that this Court has established in the Steelworkers trilogy standard of review, which is that as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the appropriate principles, his decision has to stand."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,935.169,945.277,"And it's going against another panel that says, not only you don't have to have the proof, even if you didn't have the conference we are not going to throw you out."
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,972.683,975.854,"--Your Honor, exactly the same thing happens to litigants in courts all of the time."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,990.064,992.86,I'm not -- I'm not talking about due process.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1000.561,1013.071,"--Your Honor, it is a feature of the Railway Labor Act scheme that different -- each panel of the board is its own discreet interpretive universe and is to be judged by the Federal courts according to the standards set up in the statute."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1018.82,1042.981,"--So does the board as a whole apparently, because I am looking at the instruction about joint exhibits and it tells the parties, when you are going to make a submission don't include unnecessary documents, and among things don't include things that aren't in dispute--"
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1042.981,1044.057,--Three things about--
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1044.057,1046.058,--like letters requesting conferences.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1046.058,1049.104,"--Three things about that, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1076.825,1085.525,It must be what they think of as an interpretation of the rule and the statute that they already had promulgated.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1129.18,1131.941,"Again, Your Honor, there is nothing unique or new about what the board did here."
2009.08-604,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1135.52,1137.221,I'm right in stating what they did?
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1146.764,1154.461,"--No, I'm -- I'm disagreeing with the -- the characterization that this is the board saying, we're going to make up a new rule that we've never applied before."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1176.732,1180.433,"Then the board is telling people, I will go back a sentence:"
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1200.066,1204.816,"--Your Honor, no one in this case could have legitimately relied on that instruction sheet, whatever it means."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1210.84,1232.661,"Then if -- then a person following this is obliged not to pay heed to this advice because if you don't put in every document, if you don't put in enough evidence of conferencing, you are going to be out and never have your grievance heard."
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1232.661,1246.61,"Your Honor, in an appropriate case, if a board panel interpreted that language in -- in a manner that would be inconsistent with something that that panel then did, then there might be an inherent conflict that--"
2009.08-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1246.61,1250.717,Do I understand you to say that that provision was not applicable here anyway?
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1250.717,1252.23,"--It's not applicable at all, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.23,1253.822,Does the other side contest that?
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1253.822,1255.041,Not that I am aware of.
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1265.021,1267.657,They are not relying on it as applicable in this case.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1278.326,1282.764,"--Well, the board obviously does not consider evidence of conferencing unnecessary, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1293.647,1295.145,Some panels of the board.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1298.69,1299.942,"That's right, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.736,1307.031,That's a decision on the merits.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1317.024,1326.164,"Your Honor, this Court has made clear that issues of procedural arbitrability, threshold conditions to arbitration, are governed by the same standard as merits issues in arbitration."
2009.08-604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.469,1376.438,May I ask this question.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1398.567,1400.658,"Not ordinarily, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.658,1405.251,So the only -- the only importance is to just to establish the fact that there was a conference?
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1405.251,1412.606,It was very important to the congressional plan and so it's written into the statute that the parties make one last effort to settle these grievances before it comes to the board.
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1417.009,1421.992,"And in two cases you concede that that condition was met, that there was a conference?"
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1421.992,1422.741,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1422.741,1426.847,So we are not even talking about a conference requirement.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1435.235,1435.718,Your Honor--
2009.08-604,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1435.718,1437.278,It's how you plead that.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1437.278,1438.37,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1443.027,1444.73,Can -- can we -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1484.853,1485.886,"--Your Honor, in that--"
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1485.886,1491.744,"In your theory, there is no due process violation in that case?"
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1503.987,1506.923,"--That case would be reviewable, Your Honor, and properly so under the--"
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1506.923,1507.641,Under what theory?
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1507.641,1509.591,--statutory ground of review for exceeding jurisdiction.
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1509.591,1509.841,Why?
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1509.841,1520.261,"Because in that case the arbitrator is not even arguably construing or applying the rules; he is dispensing his own brand of industrial justice, as this Court said in the Enterprise Wheel and Car case."
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1520.261,1526.975,"Well, point me to any rule, that -- you know, anybody could point to a rule and says it commands a result."
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1541.968,1549.635,But every -- every adjudicative body has to have the ability to set and enforce procedural rules governing its procedures.
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1549.635,1550.509,But they can do that.
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1552.54,1553.195,In the--
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1553.195,1559.832,"They could have passed a rule that told people, warned them, and said this is a procedural rule we are going to apply."
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1559.832,1561.08,"--Well, they did, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1566.843,1577.559,"At what point does the interpretation of rules that don't command a result become improper, outside the board's jurisdiction?"
2009.08-604,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,1578.87,1588.832,"--Under the -- under the Steelworkers standard of review for arbitral decisions, there will be a point at which the board's interpretation isn't even arguably grounded in -- in the rules, and it will be reviewable."
2009.08-604,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1609.185,1612.558,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,1617.979,1619.117,"""GAE-gunn"", actually."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1619.117,1620.833,"""GAE-gunn""."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,1620.833,1640.591,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The first and most important thing that the Respondent would like to stress is that we are not here reviewing an arbitrator's interpretation of the contract or here under the review standards set by Steelworkers trilogy."
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1696.188,1700.079,But it didn't -- it didn't promise them that categorically.
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,1737.574,1740.089,"Your Honor, I respectfully disagree."
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.862,1764.719,Do -- do you say that all five were -- were conferenced?
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,1764.984,1765.686,"Oh, absolutely."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1767.855,1770.089,But we have rules like that -- we have rules like that all the time.
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,1794.032,1802.073,"--Your Honor, that would be true if there was a rule that required these documents to be attached to the original submission."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1805.181,1805.574,You think there is now?
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,1810.071,1812.882,"--Rulemaking by adjudication is not unheard of, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1853.161,1856.722,So is it -- is -- where is the rule that there has to be conferencing?
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,1856.722,1860.238,--The rule -- there is no rule that there has to be conferencing.
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1861.299,1865.031,"So you think -- you think that was where the board erred, in requiring conferencing?"
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.031,1866.045,"It's in the statute, isn't it?"
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,1866.045,1874.57,"--It is in Section 152, which is not a statute, by the way, that the NRAB administers."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1878.882,1884.818,"Well, it's -- can the board adopt procedures about how you go about proving conferencing?"
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,1900.607,1912.071,"We believe that, given there are no rules on this point -- and the Seventh Circuit made that point clear -- that what has been to be done is to facilitate the purpose of the act, which is to get a contract interpretation."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1913.463,1925.427,"So they can -- the board can never have a rule that says, you have to establish conferencing, you know, before the date of the first arbitral proceeding, or within 30 days?"
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,1933.436,1934.31,"--No, you're not."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2080.711,2084.864,Where -- where does it say the unions have to send in letters requesting a conference?
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2084.864,2089.676,"Oh, it's in Section 2 of Part 6 of the Railway Labor Act."
2009.08-604,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2166.014,2182.259,"I -- I still don't understand your answer to the Chief Justice's question about how the panels -- how these panels -- how the board, in your view, is supposed to go about making some sort of sensible procedural rules about establishing the that conferencing took place."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2199.0,2201.297,"Your Honor, that's a good question."
2009.08-604,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2236.455,2251.293,"You said, on that point in your brief, that, normally, the carrier will raise the absence of conferencing as an impediment at the time the union files its notice of intent to file a submission."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2282.465,2285.62,"--Your Honor, the answer is past practice."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2294.442,2299.332,So could the board -- could the board adopt a rule requiring that?
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2299.332,2304.144,--The adjustment board could adopt a rule.
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.167,2320.837,Do they do anything else?
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2323.119,2327.413,"Your Honor, I'm not sure."
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.413,2330.006,"I don't want to get you in trouble, but I'm not sure they do anything."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2330.006,2332.146,I--
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2332.146,2335.048,Just to be clear -- I will take you off the hook.
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2355.291,2356.149,"--No, no, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2357.896,2358.099,No.
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2360.002,2364.002,--We don't think that the board can or should do that.
2009.08-604,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2395.269,2409.997,"Could they -- could they adopt a rule that says that, if the -- if the parties go through -- do everything that is necessary prior to the time of the adjudication, they can't pop up at the very last minute and send in a letter saying: Oh."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2417.262,2431.066,"Your Honor, in our view, the panel couldn't, but the adjustment board could, and the adjustment board comes out with these little procedures, like the one read here that -- which they say is not relevant, that says -- you know, let's have these joint submissions, let's keep evidence of conferencing out."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2445.435,2452.775,"I thought, under the Steelworkers trilogy, the arbitrators has broad deference to adopt these sorts of modes of procedure."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2452.775,2454.085,"But, Your Honor--"
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2454.085,2456.678,That we would review only for whatever it is.
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2456.678,2458.457,--This is not the Steelworkers trilogy.
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2529.911,2542.39,"So the review -- the review of government arbitrators arbitrating provisions pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the standard of review of that is different than private arbitrators under the Steelworkers trilogy?"
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2542.39,2549.651,"--It should be, and, in the hornbook sense, it is, the reality of it is, and that's true here."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2577.824,2579.306,But you don't think that this is that.
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2585.912,2587.881,"But there is no such rule, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2589.881,2605.919,"I'm saying that, if the board adopts a procedure exactly like that, you may challenge it as -- as violating due process because you didn't have notice, any number of things, but you can't say that the board is imposing its own brand of industrial justice."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2617.572,2626.615,"--Your Honor, all I can say, in answer to that, is that there are governmental rules that have very specific procedures that are in place."
2009.08-604,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2626.615,2638.61,"I thought your position was -- at least I thought I heard you say earlier, that these individual panels do not have rulemaking authority for the board."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2650.683,2652.602,The adjustment board down the street.
2009.08-604,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2653.745,2670.484,"--And I thought that your -- because there's nothing in this statute, nothing in any regulation, that gives an individual panel the right to proscribe rules of procedure that all parties to these disputes are obliged to follow."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2670.484,2671.764,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2671.764,2675.978,"That -- that authority is vested only in the board, not in the panels."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2675.978,2677.979,"Arguably, in the board."
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2677.979,2680.1,I don't know how that could possibly be true.
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2697.095,2698.187,Well--
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2698.187,2703.326,I would not know how to run an arbitration without -- without establishing some rules of procedure.
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2703.326,2705.389,"--Your Honor, that didn't happen here."
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2707.619,2708.184,Well--
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2708.184,2710.964,--The whole question that this was -- that these documents were--
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.964,2715.025,"--Well, at least back off from your statement that an arbitrator cannot set rules of procedure."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2715.025,2722.944,"--I -- well, Your Honor, an arbitrator can set rules of procedure within the parameters of what is allowed by the act."
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.944,2723.24,"Oh, all right."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2723.849,2734.125,"But the act itself, and the CFRs, are very clear that there is no requirement that this evidence has to be submitted in the original submission."
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.889,2735.813,"Well, you're making sense."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2750.004,2759.706,--There is no CFR that says that the conferencing materials have to be in the original submission or the case is dismissed.
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2760.237,2762.891,"Presumably, there is none that says they don't have to be."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2768.464,2772.543,"--Well, in any specific way."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2802.839,2806.949,"Well, you are just disputing the validity or applicability of the rule."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2833.735,2838.372,I think that an arbitrator could penalize a party for not showing up.
2009.08-604,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2848.963,2850.741,I take it your point is that there is a rule?
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2949.694,2972.936,"We did not, Your Honor, and the Wells case in particular, where there was no question that the rule was valid, was a case where the Fourth Circuit found a violation of due process because the parties did not have reasonable notice, or the carrier in that case did not have reasonable notice that it was the postage date that was the date for the brief, instead of the postmark."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2972.936,2986.01,"Do you recall the situation -- do you recall the situation Justice Breyer described, and we can debate about it, whether it's rulemaking by adjudication, which does take place, you would say that in the situation you described, it violated due process, right?"
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2986.01,2993.989,I would say that it is also in excess of the arbitrator's power under the act because this arbitrator does not have rulemaking power.
2009.08-604,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2993.989,2995.74,"And because -- I mean, in the normal--"
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2995.74,2999.769,"I thought you said he did have rulemaking power, so long as it did not contradict--"
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,2999.769,3005.392,"Your Honor, you were asking me whether he could require the parties to show up at a certain time."
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3009.638,3012.509,--Let's not get -- can I ask about argumentative facts?
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3021.617,3022.724,Yes.
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3022.724,3035.032,"Well, that would be a pretty incomprehensible statement of the -- of the event, if you write in your brief statement of facts and you only write down the facts that are disputed and none of the facts that are agreed to."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3054.697,3062.912,"Well, Your Honor, you may be correct in your view of it, but the parties have interpreted this as being the facts that are in dispute."
2009.08-604,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.912,3063.396,Well--
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3063.396,3071.843,"And remember, this is a procedure that is not about conferencing or proving conferencing, it is a procedure that -- about what happened at the trial."
2009.08-604,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3092.55,3093.942,What does the government party define--
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3093.942,3096.613,"In that context, it is not about conferencing at all."
2009.08-604,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3096.613,3101.908,--How does the party filing the grievance know exactly which facts are in dispute at the time when they made the submission?
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3106.482,3107.906,Yes.
2009.08-604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3156.476,3164.426,"Let me ask you this question, if I may: Your opponent says there is sort of a common-law adjudication method of developing new rules."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3177.092,3180.449,"--Your Honor, this isn't a system of precedent."
2009.08-604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3183.623,3188.338,"Well, I understand that, but were there presidents that might well have put you on notice that you better get this in the record?"
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3188.338,3190.506,"No, Your Honor, not in or our view."
2009.08-604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3232.036,3241.345,"Well, that's really not my -- but you do concede, do you, that there are half a dozen cases out there which were dismissed because there was the failure of the record to show that there was conferencing below?"
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3241.345,3250.496,"--We do admit that, but we say that in our particular case, the record would certainly include or we would be allowed to supplement with the evidence from the--"
2009.08-604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3250.496,3252.029,So your -- your objection is -- is two-fold.
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3265.365,3267.362,--That's correct and we don't know of any case that--
2009.08-604,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3267.362,3269.347,You did -- you did make an offer of proof as to--
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3269.347,3270.159,--Yes.
2009.08-604,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3270.159,3279.108,"--In fact, the panel invited it and you have made it; and then the panel said sorry, it's too late, you have to do it at the time you make your initial filing."
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3279.108,3281.67,"Your Honor, I don't -- I wish I had made that point earlier."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3313.448,3321.664,So you think you could submit that offer of proof at any time during the proceeding and the board would have to accept it?
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3321.664,3331.237,"--We think of it as relevant, probative evidence as to conferencing when the objection had not been raised at the time that these cases were conferenced, at the time that this--"
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3331.237,3334.563,Why wouldn't the other side say we don't have to raise the objection at a particular time.
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3336.969,3341.484,"--Your Honor, I'm afraid there is such a rule, and that is 301.5."
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3353.023,3359.614,"So your answer to my earlier question is that you can submit that offer of proof at any time, and it has to be considered?"
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3359.614,3363.657,"Well, any time that the objection is raised."
2009.08-604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3397.829,3400.372,Let me ask you some questions about the common law that we are talking about here.
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3400.372,3400.856,Yes.
2009.08-604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.856,3407.758,"Are there also cases out there in which the record doesn't tell us whether there was conferencing, but nevertheless, the merits were decided?"
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3407.758,3408.413,"Oh, sure."
2009.08-604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3409.879,3413.596,There are least six -- six or are there more than that?
2009.08-604,1,42746,thomas_h__geoghegan,,3413.596,3421.063,--I don't think that there are -- there are the cases that we cited where it turned out there wasn't conferencing and the arbitrator said go back and conference.
2009.08-604,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3434.396,3436.268,"Thank you, Mr. Geoghegan."
2009.08-604,2,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3439.907,3442.109,Four quick points.
2009.08-604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3454.526,3459.727,Were any of those decisions that were boardwise or did they apply to one panel?
2009.08-604,2,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3459.727,3462.258,All these decisions are rendered by one panel.
2009.08-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3497.053,3505.547,But there is a difference between governmentally ordered arbitrations and private contracts.
2009.08-604,2,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3513.061,3521.247,"The difference, Your Honor, I believe, is that in the ordinary arbitral context when you have a procedural question, the question is what the parties would have wanted."
2009.08-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3536.021,3562.542,"--Is it your position that if you go through the first phase and as everybody is walking out the two adversaries in the first investigative space say this is never going to be settled, this is the most important case in the history of this -- the railroad system."
2009.08-604,2,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3565.619,3566.493,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3566.493,3573.395,"That they can't waive the grievance procedure, that they just can't go straight to you?"
2009.08-604,2,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3573.395,3574.49,"That -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-604,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3633.572,3636.321,But we disagree with you.
2009.08-604,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3652.547,3654.47,"You may answer the question, counsel."
2009.08-604,2,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3654.47,3655.468,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-604,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3666.085,3667.509,Thank you counsel.
