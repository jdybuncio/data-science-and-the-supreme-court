1963.89,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,32.712,"No.89, United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO, et al., Petitioners, versus National Labor Relations Board."
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,33.988,37.714,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,271.551,275.972,Right and within the -- within the area enclosed by the gate?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,275.972,278.514,"No, not within the fence, Your Honor, further down."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.378,287.556,Just run through another gate?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,287.556,288.624,That's correct.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,288.624,302.984,"Now in the -- the gate itself which is visible on the foreground of a -- exhibit number two at page 305, does that gate belong to the New York Central?"
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,302.984,307.269,"I suppose the gate does, that's right because they own the piece of real estate on which gate is."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,307.269,309.971,And they own the real estate over which that gate is?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,309.971,311.222,"Yes, that's right."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,311.222,315.577,"And the -- and they have the keys, don't they?"
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,315.577,319.714,I think that's right although I -- I -- I'm not sure this makes any difference.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,324.665,325.814,By the fact it is --
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,325.814,332.931,I'll concede for the purpose of this case that the keys are in control of the railroad.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,499.327,501.452,There is attempted physical obstruction of the move.
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,501.452,503.201,"Oh, that's right."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,503.201,505.278,By how many people?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,505.278,507.068,"I don't know, quite a -- quite a number of people."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,507.068,508.143,A number of -- several?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,508.304,511.415,"Several -- yeah, many people."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,511.415,513.999,"And not all -- a -- an automobile was involved, wasn't it?"
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,513.999,521.763,"Yes, at one point there was a -- an automobile which was found to be owned by union representative parked on those track."
1963.89,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,558.977,559.723,If you --
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,559.723,560.918,8(b)(1)(A) --
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,560.918,562.473,And what was the ground for that?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,562.473,564.743,Restraint and coercion of the employees.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,564.743,565.575,Which employees?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,566.973,574.488,The theory -- well -- there was a general pattern of conduct since this was a plant which was trying to operate during a strike.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,600.968,601.831,Of the 8th?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,601.831,603.343,8(b)(1) which is not a part of this case now.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,603.343,604.731,Which is not a part of this case now?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,604.731,606.505,Dropped out of this case now.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,701.069,707.568,"This is not a -- this is not a common-situs case, is it really?"
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,707.568,709.232,"No, I would say not Your Honor."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,712.361,712.996,"Well, I'm not reading that."
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,712.996,715.703,I would say it's not a common-situs case.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,715.703,718.189,There's a -- how many gates were there in all?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,718.189,719.416,There were many gates.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,739.89,751.727,"And those were all well picketed and this gate, as you've -- as I understand it, there's a -- was -- was for the sole use of the New York Central Railroad, is that right?"
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,751.727,752.955,That's correct.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,832.679,835.413,Do you think General Electric clarified the whole area?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,835.413,835.977,That's right.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1053.148,1064.515,"Of course every secondary employer who would ever be involved in this kind of a situation, I should think, would be related in someway to the primary employer unless there wouldn't be any -- there wouldn't be any point."
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1064.515,1065.952,The work would be related?
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1065.952,1068.917,"Yes, he being his supplier or his customer."
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1068.917,1082.522,"Well, let me tell you what I think is meant by work which is related in normal operations and the Court didn't have to define it in GE because it was remanded to the Board for that purpose."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1145.117,1148.663,"But of course, there would have been no point -- nowhere all of the union doing so either."
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1148.663,1150.387,"Well, sure there would have been."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1150.387,1151.254,And then what?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1151.254,1160.413,"The point would be exactly the point which the statute was intended to prevent, to force the railroad to stop making deliveries to Carrier."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1160.413,1161.202,"Well, but you --"
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1161.202,1174.562,"Now, it happened then we tried -- the union tried not to force the railroad to stop making deliveries in the sense of the President of New York Central but simply to stop the very people on the spot from performing that work."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1204.53,1205.205,Unless you're not only --
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1205.205,1210.836,"-- a general disruption of the railroads' operations, but that's not what was involved here."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1232.237,1236.998,"Well, the object would have been the same if you picketed the New York Central's Office too."
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1236.998,1238.463,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1238.463,1241.282,"Well, the object would have been to stop this train from making deliveries to Carrier Company."
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1241.282,1262.964,"Well, we don't have to resolve that because of the primary picketing proviso which Congress put in to make clear that primary picketing is exempt -- I would say the object is different because the objects here is not to put pressure on the railroad but to put pressure on Carrier by provide -- by depriving it of service."
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1386.759,1387.31,Is it that?
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1392.936,1393.174,I think I have --
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1393.174,1397.331,They had -- had a gate which was for the exclusive use of the New York Central and not for the use of (Voice Overlap).
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1397.331,1401.199,I think the fact that it was for the exclusive use of the New York Central makes no more difference in this case.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1401.199,1405.05,And along with the New York Central as you told us in the beginning.
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1405.05,1409.113,"Well, the fact that it's a very exclusive use of the New York Central makes no difference --"
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1409.113,1410.111,"But it belongs to it, it was in front of the --"
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1410.111,1414.365,-- the fact that it belongs to it makes no difference either.
1963.89,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1419.326,1421.54,Well --
1963.89,0,28884,jerry_d_anker,,1421.54,1423.666,Where you picket has nothing to do with the statute.
1963.89,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1470.169,1471.26,Mr. Manoli.
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1471.26,1474.68,May it please the Court.
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1554.724,1563.912,"There was a little bit more than -- but they're not of any importance of -- a little bit more than merely publicizing if you look at the pictures on -- pages 308, 309 and 310."
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1563.912,1570.005,"Oh, they were seen by -- there was some question and some coercive -- coercive activity that went on that it -- it's that such easily --"
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1570.005,1571.027,That's really so --
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1571.027,1571.735,Yes.
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1574.013,1574.778,Probably is irrelevant.
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1574.778,1575.987,-- it makes no difference.
1963.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.101,1629.442,(Inaudible)
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1629.442,1634.393,It was used on -- it was not used by Carrier employees and I will indicate that that is a --
1963.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.393,1636.295,(Inaudible)
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1636.295,1641.905,"-- except the railroad, I will indicate that that's irrelevant under the -- this Court's decision in GE."
1963.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.011,1696.245,(Inaudible)
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1696.245,1718.101,"Well, the Court said that that this is a -- this has been a traditional form of picketing that employees will -- will not only hope when they're picketing a particular plant -- not only hope, that the second neutral employees will not perform services behind the picket line, but that also that they may go ahead and ask them not to perform those services behind the picket line."
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.156,1726.322,"Does the gate there in GE in question, what was it -- who was it used by?"
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1726.322,1732.724,"Well, the problem in there arose in connection with a separate gate that had been setup by those independent contractors."
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1741.482,1741.828,All right.
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1741.828,1750.985,"-- but the gate, however, was reserved exclusively, was reserved exclusively for an independent contractor who's performing some kind of construction work on there."
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1756.705,1756.927,Was that --
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1756.927,1756.955,If --
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1756.955,1759.949,--gate used at all or I just -- I just forgotten the facts.
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1762.818,1763.817,"No sir, no sir."
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1763.817,1764.379,"Not at all, was it?"
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1764.379,1764.886,No sir.
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1781.711,1782.971,That is delivery people (Voice Overlap).
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1782.971,1786.029,"-- don't yet -- and particularly for example, in connection with delivery people --"
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1786.029,1786.519,Alright.
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1786.519,1788.641,-- a union could appeal to track employees --
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1788.641,1792.794,"But not -- but not to people say who were doing new construction in there, is that right?"
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1792.794,1793.027,That's correct.
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1793.027,1794.568,Is the distinction in that case true?
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1794.568,1796.063,If that -- that's -- the distinction of the case is true.
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1796.063,1802.993,"And it's a very realistic distinction and is the gate was used interchangeably by both kinds of employee, how about the employee?"
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1802.993,1805.849,"Not, in that -- in that case, it was not used interchangeably."
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1810.08,1811.038,"No, no."
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1814.024,1814.1,Yes.
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1814.1,1818.534,-- and also by building trades people who were building their construction in there.
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1819.398,1821.111,The delivery people for the primary?
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1821.111,1821.472,Yes.
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1821.472,1827.122,"In that case I think the implication is that the union could picket that at that place, but the union could picket at that place."
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1933.034,1934.376,And to the gate?
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1934.376,1934.783,Sir?
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1934.783,1935.882,And to the gate apparently?
1963.89,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1935.882,1941.703,And to the gate -- and to the gate and the railroad had the gate too -- had the key to the gate too.
1963.89,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1974.42,1978.903,It -- it seems to me that you can't -- that -- that just by calling up --
1963.89,2,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,2374.68,2381.453,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court."
1963.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.467,2432.938,Your (Inaudible) certainly lead to no picketing at special gates of the primary employer.
1963.89,2,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,2432.938,2434.426,Not necessarily.
1963.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.426,2435.989,But they pretty follow the --
1963.89,2,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,2435.989,2438.009,Not necessarily Mr. Justice White.
1963.89,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.009,2440.881,That's what you (Inaudible)
1963.89,2,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,2440.881,2451.772,Carrier Corporation in Syracuse has an operation with some eight gates for use of employees and suppliers surrounding the premises.
1963.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2581.019,2592.015,(Inaudible) there putting on the -- this automobile on the track that happened to be taken off irrelevant to the legal issue?
1963.89,2,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,2592.015,2600.822,"I think they are only, Mr. Justice Black if we get to the question of balancing of interest here which argument is made in the board brief."
1963.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2623.011,2628.874,(Inaudible) of proving conduct like that?
1963.89,2,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,2628.874,2630.828,No.
1963.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2651.57,2655.22,Was it done for the -- anything on that account?
1963.89,2,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,2655.22,2656.47,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1963.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2656.47,2661.855,Has any charge been made against the union on account of this conduct which you've just outlined to us?
1963.89,2,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,2661.855,2664.657,"Yes Your Honor, the union was charged with this conduct."
1963.89,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2682.144,2682.911,Well that's not before us at all.
1963.89,2,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,2682.911,2684.027,-- fell out of the case.
1963.89,3,28884,jerry_d_anker,,3469.633,3475.103,I would just like to comment on two points which you have been made by Mr. Kammholz.
1963.89,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3646.579,3647.655,Then you --
1963.89,3,28884,jerry_d_anker,,3647.655,3648.056,I would make out --
1963.89,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3648.056,3656.379,"Undoubtedly -- undoubtedly, these people would have a right to go into the brotherhood to make a speech if their brotherhood wanted them there."
1963.89,3,28884,jerry_d_anker,,3660.894,3663.921,"Well, I -- that's true but not under this statute."
