2003.02-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.596,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1377, Buck Doe v. Elaine Chao."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,61.922,64.644,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,88.876,92.098,"Before we go further, could you help me out on one thing?"
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,118.681,123.594,"The answer to that is no, Justice Souter, and let me answer that in at least two ways."
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,143.784,143.923,Okay.
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,143.923,152.262,"--and I think correctly, that that would be considered one disclosure under the act and, thus, the individual would be entitled to only a single $1,000 recovery."
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,152.262,155.772,What if... what if there had been an initial disclosure and he had protested it?
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,160.496,170.155,That's a closer question... it... because then you... you've got the... the temporal separation that did not exist in the Tomasello case.
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,170.155,177.093,"Yeah, but you'd have temporal separation if there were 10 pleadings over a period of 10 months."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,177.093,178.291,But--
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,178.291,187.29,"And I take it in that case you're saying, no, there would still just be a... a... a one violation and... and the maximum recovery, at least under this provision, would be 1,000."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,187.29,201.369,"--I... I... I think that's right, Justice Souter, and I want to make clear too that for each of those disclosures you're describing, there would have to be an adverse effect described and... and a causation element met in each of those in any case before you even got to the question."
2003.02-1377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,201.369,202.462,But suppose the IRS--
2003.02-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.462,205.539,"--But that's so easy to establish, as shown here."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,217.527,226.072,"I... if I understand your question, Justice O'Connor, the answer is, yes, there is a real harm suffered here, and adverse effect is not a meaningless standard."
2003.02-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.494,243.744,"Well, but wouldn't--"
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,243.744,244.366,--and was cross-examined.
2003.02-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.366,250.431,--wouldn't every person who wanted to make such a claim make similar allegations?
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,255.261,257.452,Let me answer both parts of your question.
2003.02-1377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,359.287,372.744,"Let's assume that somebody wrongfully and intentionally releases Social Security numbers, you know, just... just a whole bunch of Social Security numbers of their... their entire list."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,399.039,405.538,"Well, I... I think that the example you give, the problem remains, particularly one of causation."
2003.02-1377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.645,418.148,Those numbers are... are linked to names.
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,418.148,421.103,I'd still go back to the... there's a causation problem.
2003.02-1377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,424.037,426.637,"May I ask, with respect to that, you brought this case."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,448.145,452.975,--I don't... I don't... I don't contend that there aren't arguments to be made.
2003.02-1377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,455.37,458.137,"But you say you lost fair and square, and now you've seen the error of your ways?"
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,458.137,476.797,"--Well, we lost fair and square and I... and I want to point out too, I want to give another example of a case, and it's one of the cases that the Government cites in its brief as the example of... of this... this problem, and that's the Schmidt case that is pending in the Western District of Wisconsin, which involves a putative class action against the Veterans Administration."
2003.02-1377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,506.64,512.227,"But even if they're not class actions, I have, I think, the same problem people have expressed."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,571.239,575.259,"--In the hypothetical that you're proposing, Justice Breyer, I think there are several answers."
2003.02-1377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,575.259,577.86,"And just make up, you know, it's easy for both of us to make up a lot."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,577.86,578.06,Sure.
2003.02-1377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,578.06,589.543,I want to know what are the protections if you win against generating millions and millions of lawsuits with billions of dollars.
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,589.543,594.289,"In... in the hypotheticals that you've described, if I could take those on their terms first."
2003.02-1377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,621.865,625.497,"Well, yeah, I can't imagine any government agency that takes place that isn't intentional."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,629.295,630.204,"--Certainly, well--"
2003.02-1377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,630.204,634.458,"Nobody released these... nobody... nobody puts anything on a piece of paper, releases it, isn't intentional."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,634.458,642.714,"--Certainly the... the intent to release the... the information would be correct, but that's not the same as to say there was an intent to violate the Privacy Act."
2003.02-1377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,642.714,661.457,"Ah, in other words, in order to recover... now, that's an important point to me... in order to recover, the plaintiff has to show that the government individuals or the agency not only intended to do what did violate the act, but they intended that what they did would violate the Act."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,667.03,667.856,"That's correct, Justice--"
2003.02-1377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,667.856,668.888,"Well, then, how did you ever win this one?"
2003.02-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.888,669.881,That's... that's... that's a very strong--
2003.02-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.881,670.957,"--Yeah, very strong."
2003.02-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.957,672.193,--instruction.
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,685.196,692.794,"--Well, in... in this case... I... the consistent constructions of... of the Privacy Act is it's... it's greater than gross negligence."
2003.02-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,701.012,702.664,"Well, how about this case?"
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,705.143,717.486,--In pages... if I could point the Court to pages... bear with me for one moment... pages 90... 96--
2003.02-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,717.486,721.118,This was a... this was a distribution by administrative law judges--
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,721.118,722.066,--That's correct.
2003.02-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,722.066,724.462,--of hearing notices and decisions?
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,724.462,726.707,That... among other things.
2003.02-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,746.503,753.895,But to say there's no intent to comply isn't the same thing as saying that you knew you were violating the act when you acted.
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,753.895,756.867,"--Well, let me amend my answer in this way, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.381,768.179,"Well, how can you... how can you willfully ignore an act's requirements?"
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,768.179,781.47,"--Well, the Department of Labor was well aware of what the Privacy Act's requirements were and made no attempt to get the administrative law judges to comply, and... and I want to go back here this... to one of the answers I gave with respect to your adverse effect questions."
2003.02-1377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.265,791.295,"Well, but our concern--"
2003.02-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.295,798.81,"--We're concerned here, Justice Breyer and I guess... what is going to happen if we rule in your favor?"
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,808.385,828.16,"The answer is no, and... and certainly I acknowledge, Mr. Chief Justice, and Justice Souter and Justice Breyer, that in future cases there might well be a lot more time spent litigating the issues of whether there was an adverse... truly an adverse effect and whether... and... and whether the... the violation was truly intentional and willful."
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,828.903,830.927,"Okay, but can... can we just go back to that for a second?"
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,830.927,831.382,--Sure.
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,831.382,836.211,"Because we've been concentrating on willful, and you say, well, willful requires a very high standard."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,845.461,846.082,Or willful.
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,846.082,857.515,And it would be even more remarkable to construe the... the term intentional as requiring conscious disregard of... of a known statutory obligation.
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,857.515,863.544,"Let... let me answer this way in response, and maybe it will... will help ease the concerns."
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,873.036,883.522,Do you have a case that says intentional standing alone must be construed to include this conscious disregard of a... of a known legal provision?
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,883.522,915.389,"--I can't cite a specific case for that proposition, Justice Souter, but I again go back to we were talking about intentional or willful, it's a high burden under any concept of what intentional or willful will be, and for years, for 22 years, from 1975 to, at the earliest 1997, when the Sixth Circuit decided the Reno case, the interpretation that I am offering this Court is the one that the courts of appeals had unanimously adopted, and never in those 22 years had the kind of parade of horribles that the Government posits in this case materialize."
2003.02-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,924.76,928.847,But have any of those cases involved disclosure of Social Security numbers?
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,928.847,930.045,None that I recall.
2003.02-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,932.274,936.982,"See, this seems to me a particular kind of disclosure that might happen over and over again in a very casual way."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,936.982,943.919,"--I... I submit, Justice Stevens, if it happens in a casual way, that's not going to provide anyone with a cause of action."
2003.02-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,943.919,956.634,"Well, pursuant to a policy such as they had here of that's the way they use to identify... driver's license they use it on, the Holiday Inn uses it for their social... all sorts of people use Social Security number for another purpose."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,956.634,957.787,That's true.
2003.02-1377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,972.981,973.807,That... that may be true.
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1042.083,1066.686,"I... I... I under... I well understand your dilemma, Justice Breyer, and I again go back to, I don't doubt if this... if the statute is given its natural reading, that the $1,000 statutory damages is available to those to whom the United States shall be liable, there will be an awful lot more traction, a lot more fighting over the adverse effect and the particular circumstances that would rise to the level of an intentional or willful violation in the future."
2003.02-1377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1066.686,1067.801,Mr. Campbell--
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1067.801,1068.794,That's simply not an issue here.
2003.02-1377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1068.794,1078.742,"--Really what... what Justice Breyer is saying is... is that this issue of willfulness or not is not in the case and we wish it were, because the answer to that is important."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1080.887,1082.995,"Yes, yes, Justice Scalia, thank you."
2003.02-1377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.995,1093.359,Can... can you tell me what... I... I really have trouble understanding how there can be an adverse effect without actual damage.
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1120.397,1126.879,I think there frequently can be an... an emotional harm that is not quantifiable in dollar terms--
2003.02-1377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.879,1127.129,Well--
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1127.129,1128.244,--and that's very common in the law.
2003.02-1377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1128.244,1129.608,--That doesn't mean that it's not actual.
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1136.789,1149.42,"I... I want... I... I agree with you that that is an actual harm, and I think that's one of the things that the Government is... is trying to cloud the issue a bit in this case, and that is to equate actual damages and actual harm."
2003.02-1377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1161.103,1174.478,"Well, do you agree that, or do you contend that adverse effect include... includes emotional distress and that you have to show something like emotional distress before there is an adverse effect?"
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1174.478,1181.498,"Yes, yes indeed, Justice Kennedy, and that is indeed the unanimous position of the Federal courts on that question."
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1181.498,1196.769,"What... what do you say about the position of the... which I understood the circuit to be taking that, on the assumption that there... there was some emotional damage, at least in the sense that the... the man said, I was very upset when I heard that the number was out."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1250.351,1254.317,"If that is indeed what the Fourth Circuit's position is, it's squarely wrong."
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1267.775,1269.344,What about... even if there is no physical manifestation?
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1269.344,1270.914,--Even if there is no physical manifestation.
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1305.769,1305.769,"Sure, because privacy--"
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1305.769,1306.391,Here you have to put--
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1306.391,1322.077,"--I mean, in your... I understand your privacy argument, but that's because the invasion of privacy or the infringement of privacy is regarded simply as... as injury per se, and... and I thought the circuit was saying, that's not what we're dealing with here."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1324.816,1326.574,"--Well, I... I want to--"
2003.02-1377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1326.574,1329.341,"--But it's... but if that is so, then let me just get to my question."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1360.548,1367.813,"--Well, I... I, of course, disagree with your characterization of what subsection (A) in fact says, but let me go back to first part of the answer."
2003.02-1377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1389.694,1396.447,"And what... can... can you... and this goes back to Justice Scalia's initial question, what is the difference in adverse effect and actual damage?"
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1396.447,1404.349,The difference is the ability to quantify the harm in some dollar amount.
2003.02-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.349,1422.365,"Yes, but if that's... if that's the case, I don't see why the risk of being subjected to identity theft would be increased by the disclosure of your Social Security number, and if that's true, and I think some people could prove the risk is increased, that would be true of every release of every Social Security number."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1422.365,1433.139,"I... I... I would certainly agree that there is a real risk of identity theft any time there's a disclosure of a Social Security number, particularly as here when it's linked directly with the name."
2003.02-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1433.139,1437.969,So does it not necessarily follow that every one of those releases causes an adverse effect?
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1437.969,1438.978,I don't think it is.
2003.02-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1444.179,1452.231,"Whether they're bothered about it or not, they're... they have an increased risk, just if you increase your risk of death, maybe they're not aware of it, but it's still an adverse effect."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1452.231,1459.744,"Well, I do not contend that the Privacy Act is a statute that... that compensates in some way for merely increased risk."
2003.02-1377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.23,1472.625,"Well, I mean, that doesn't answer it."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1484.059,1491.49,"I can't support that interpretation of the act, although candidly, it... it probably would be a better one for plaintiffs in the... in the run-of-the-mine case."
2003.02-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.979,1512.766,"Well, it's superfluous with respect to Social Security numbers, but the statute covers a whole range of activities other than this particular case."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1512.766,1520.634,"--Absolutely, Justice Stevens, and I... I... but I'm not sure... I... I don't think the answer is that it would be just superfluous with respect to Social Security numbers."
2003.02-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1534.547,1539.211,"Well, the release of medical information doesn't necessarily increase the risk of any particular harm."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1545.321,1548.748,It does increase that... it does increase the risk--
2003.02-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1548.748,1552.258,"It is not true if you say, well, you're taking aspirin three times a day or something like that."
2003.02-1377,0,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,1555.063,1557.831,"--No, it's a... I agree, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1569.485,1570.75,"Very well, Mr. Campbell."
2003.02-1377,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1572.419,1578.802,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.088,1670.417,"Well, but that... but that's not the question."
2003.02-1377,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1682.167,1683.199,He wins--
2003.02-1377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1683.199,1687.944,It... it is enough to give... to make his claim a valid... a valid claim.
2003.02-1377,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1687.944,1689.02,--He... he wins but--
2003.02-1377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.02,1693.228,"And the reason he can't get money damages has nothing to do with the magic words, adversely affected."
2003.02-1377,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1697.498,1697.686,--But--
2003.02-1377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.686,1699.134,But he wins under the APA.
2003.02-1377,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1699.134,1726.831,"--But the fact that a plaintiff can win under the APA and, in our view, can't win under the damages provision of the Privacy Act simply reflects what is implicit in the APA's exclusion of money damages as an available item of relief, namely the view that agency action should ordinarily be reviewable in court, and plaintiffs who can show that they would be injured by unlawful government conduct in the future should ordinarily be able to get a judicial order decreeing that that not take place."
2003.02-1377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1733.89,1741.032,And I take it you're... you're saying here... and they're not here because there's a further requirement of actual damage before they get money.
2003.02-1377,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1741.032,1741.282,That... that's right.
2003.02-1377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1741.282,1741.637,Yeah.
2003.02-1377,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1741.637,1758.493,"That the damages provisions restricts the availability of monetary relief to a person entitled to recovery, and the phrase, person entitled to recovery, is most naturally construed to mean someone who has not only established a violation of law, but who has established the prerequisites to an award of compensatory relief."
2003.02-1377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1758.493,1763.778,"Why... why did they put that phrase, entitled to recovery, in there in addition to actual damages?"
2003.02-1377,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1780.746,1783.884,One... one hypothesis as to why the phrase may appear as it does.
2003.02-1377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1810.596,1813.484,"Well, he is entitled to recover actual damages if he has any."
2003.02-1377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1813.484,1813.856,Yeah.
2003.02-1377,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1813.856,1814.106,But that--
2003.02-1377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1814.106,1816.335,And he's entitled to recover it if he doesn't have any.
2003.02-1377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1835.859,1837.511,"Well, I guess that's the issue."
2003.02-1377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.511,1838.254,"Yeah, that is the issue."
2003.02-1377,2,29549,jack_william_campbell_iv,,3311.15,3313.007,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1377,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3530.117,3532.84,As to your point about the... the costs.
2003.02-1377,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3556.634,3557.832,"I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1377,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3562.085,3562.54,"Yes, I am."
2003.02-1377,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3562.54,3566.088,(g)(2) and (g)(3) are entirely different causes of actions.
2003.02-1377,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3580.001,3580.373,I see.
2003.02-1377,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3580.995,3583.846,--that the contrast in the language between (g)(2) and (g)(3)--
2003.02-1377,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3583.846,3584.384,I see what you're saying.
2003.02-1377,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3584.384,3586.203,--and (g)(4) proves my point.
2003.02-1377,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3591.859,3593.511,"Well, what assumption would you like us to make--"
2003.02-1377,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3593.511,3593.717,"--Right, right."
2003.02-1377,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3593.717,3596.029,--in respect to the meaning of intentional or willful?
2003.02-1377,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3596.029,3606.681,--I... I submit that a perfectly proper interpretation of intentional or willful can include conscious disregard of... of the... of the legal obligations.
2003.02-1377,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3608.744,3609.404,"Thank you, Mr. Campbell."
