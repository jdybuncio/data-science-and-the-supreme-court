1975.36_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.787,"We will hear arguments first this morning, in number 36, under our original jurisdiction the State of Texas against the State of Louisiana."
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,16.787,22.813,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1975.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,124.878,136.902,"Mr. Attorney General, before you get to that, as I understand there is no dispute of the area of the River now between 30 and 32."
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,136.902,137.339,No neither.
1975.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,137.339,152.968,"Latitude and you referred to 12 maps that had been agreed upon, and apparently are to be deposited with the land departments of each state. Do you expect us to incorporate those maps in our decree here?"
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,152.968,155.951,We do not speak of it as an agreement.
1975.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,165.753,167.259,You expect us to incorporate --
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,167.259,174.084,"Yes we do, with the only controversy left down to the natural mouth of the river, involves --"
1975.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,174.084,175.856,I know what the only controversy is.
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,175.856,176.354,I am sorry.
1975.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,176.354,179.567,But how are we to incorporate them in the decree if they are not here?
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,181.149,183.798,"Yes, they are in the exhibits if it pleases the Court."
1975.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,183.798,188.894,"Are you going to submit incorporation language, or do we have to work it out ourselves?"
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,188.894,190.971,"No Sir, we would be happy to do so."
1975.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,220.685,228.679,"I know what the issues are, what I am concerned about is that two degree area up there, and I am trying to pin you down as to whether you have language that will --"
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,228.679,229.294,"We do, Your Honor."
1975.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,229.294,230.532,Enable us to --
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,230.532,231.258,We do.
1975.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,246.813,248.827,This does not bring you down to the gulf does it not?
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,248.827,252.237,"No Sir, but we are alright in that we could?"
1975.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,252.237,254.775,He has to cover -- (Inaudible)
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,254.775,255.161,Clearly.
1975.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,255.161,257.014,Degree area and I just wanted to confirm?
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,257.014,262.707,"Yes Sir, well we certainly have the help in the record and I do not think that presents any difficulty at all."
1975.36_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,276.012,281.917,"Attorney General, is there a counterpart of that map in our papers?"
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,282.806,287.82,"Yes, it is different in this respect and I should like to explain it if I may?"
1975.36_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,287.82,290.102,"But may I ask, is there a counterpart of it here?"
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,290.68,292.08,There is to this extent.
1975.36_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,293.679,294.678,Mr. Attorney General.
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,294.678,295.02,I am sorry.
1975.36_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,295.02,307.235,Would you draw your map closer so that you will not be out of range of the microphone?
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,307.235,318.536,"So the difference between what is before the court on the exhibit and what is in the Masters? exhibit here besides from the obvious enlargement, is the Louisiana Arc."
1975.36_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,341.05,347.075,(Inaudible) -- in our papers that I can look at rather than try to get from here and I cannot?
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,347.075,353.652,"If you could Justice Brennan, if you will refer to the masters exhibit but ignore all of the lines that are on it."
1975.36_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,477.496,487.782,"I think one of the (Inaudible) argument that will pass that point, is there a map in the briefs or in the report that shows the upper end of the lake?"
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,487.782,493.847,"Not in the briefs, if it please the Court, but there is an exhibit if you will go back to our --"
1975.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.847,501.991,"As far as the contention between You and Louisiana is where the line begins at the upper end of the lake, there is no map that --"
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,501.991,508.168,"Not in the briefs, in only the exceptions to the masters report, Justice White."
1975.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,510.957,513.847,"What is the exhibit number, do you know?"
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,513.847,519.933,I believe that it is 5A.
1975.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.392,546.811,--that is the only map there is?
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,546.811,548.485,"The only one in the briefs, may it please the Court."
1975.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,548.485,550.782,There is no masters map to this --
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,550.782,556.703,Not attached to as an exhibit to his report.
1975.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.364,563.676,Instead of this one --
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,563.676,574.5,"Well, Justice Blackmun has a larger exhibit that he is referring to Justice Stewart."
1975.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.97,610.676,"(Inaudible) according to the contention the two States are not in contention to south of that,"
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,610.676,611.096,No Sir.
1975.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.096,612.702,Until you get to that though?
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,612.702,614.686,That is correct.
1975.36_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.978,1045.726,"The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was after Texas was annexed, wasn?t it?"
1975.36_orig,0,30676,john_l_hill,,1045.726,1048.087,Yes.
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,1932.977,1936.884,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.36_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.919,2409.689,"Does the median line principle, equidistant median line principle apply only when there is not only a dispute between two States or Countries but only when the line, you can not say the line is ever been definitely established before?"
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2409.689,2413.233,There are two ways under the Geneva Convention?s to delimit?
1975.36_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.233,2415.923,"Let us assume, just to get my question straight."
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2438.865,2439.503,Yes.
1975.36_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.503,2450.671,Now would building the jetties then change that boundary?
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2450.671,2454.284,I wish I could answer that question yes or no?
1975.36_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2454.284,2456.889,"You must answer it no, I suppose?"
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2456.889,2460.344,Well I think the answer is no and the reason that it is no is that this Court has held?
1975.36_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.344,2470.204,"Because if you would have answered it yes, that Texas? argument about what its historic boundary was irrelevant?"
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2470.204,2471.932,I do not think that follows.
1975.36_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.083,2517.185,I will put it again.
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2525.16,2526.114,Yes.
1975.36_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.114,2529.045,Does the boundary change or not?
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2529.045,2533.173,"Our position is that it would not, once it is fixed in the decree of this Court it would not."
1975.36_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.061,2552.548,"I take it you agree, if there had been a judicial finding of what the boundary was or where it started in 1900 it would not have been changed by the building of the jetties?"
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2552.548,2556.609,"The problem is, I cannot answer yes or no?"
1975.36_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.609,2557.657,Alright.
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2557.657,2565.023,The problem is that we are talking about a controversy which has relevance only under the Submerged Lands Act.
1975.36_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.259,2615.962,Fluctuate depending upon what?
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2615.962,2621.74,It depends upon both natural changes in the coastline as well as evulsive changes.
1975.36_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2622.556,2623.663,How about man-made changes?
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2624.901,2627.816,"Yes, I included man-made changes."
1975.36_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2627.816,2628.881,As evulsive?
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2628.881,2645.565,"Yes, man-made changes and normally evulsive and the Geneva Conventions specifically include harbor works that form an integrated part of the harbor network as part of the coastline."
1975.36_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2654.152,2655.05,Yes.
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2655.05,2672.243,"For you to hold now for purposes of the lateral boundary dispute with which we are now presented that Texas? jurisdiction cuts the eastern jetty and extends eastward into the Gulf of Mexico from the natural mouth of the Sabine, we regard as wholly inconsistent without prior holding."
1975.36_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2720.627,2723.794,"All these two States, it simply involves the Louisiana coastline?"
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2723.794,2725.206,"Yes, that is right I am sorry."
1975.36_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2726.369,2729.335,"It has nothing to do with the boarder between this two States as such, did it?"
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2729.335,2732.992,"No that is not, that is right, it did not."
1975.36_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2750.015,2755.553,That is not really relevant to the dispute here or the issue here is it?
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2755.553,2756.281,It is relevant?
1975.36_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2756.281,2758.406,Or not relevant but certainly it is not?
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2758.406,2760.751,"It is not conclusive, no, no, it is not conclusive."
1975.36_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2781.191,2793.415,"(Inaudible) the baseline that you lay out in the coast, to start with do you think it has to be the same coastline that was recognized as part of Louisiana?s coastline in the past cases?"
1975.36_orig,1,32657,john_p_rupp,,2793.415,2816.93,"Exactly, that is correct, that the breadth of the territorial seas and the coastline to be used for the present purposes should be the same."
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,2816.93,2820.486,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.36_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.432,3107.182,(Inaudible)
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,3107.182,3112.695,"Over three miles, about three and a half miles I think."
1975.36_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3112.695,3117.012,And Louisiana?s position was that you then go see what three miles from?
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,3117.012,3118.188,Yes Sir.
1975.36_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3180.212,3181.948,"It would not affect the title, would it?"
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,3181.948,3187.734,"Well, I think the only reason that Louisiana could get the swamp lands was it had to be in Louisiana."
1975.36_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3200.172,3202.979,But you can not go back and invalidate those patents?
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,3202.979,3205.614,"Well, I think that might be a legal question."
1975.36_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3263.046,3275.396,The Missouri River is full of instances where property on the other side belongs to the state on the other side of the river.
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,3287.958,3302.854,"Yes Mr. Blackmun, of course what we are saying is that the Louisiana had title to these beds or these streams by virtue of the fact that the United States recognized that the boundary is extended to this west part."
1975.36_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.744,3331.272,(Inaudible) prior case in this Court that Louisiana?s boundaries went three miles out from the jetty?
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,3331.272,3332.258,"Yes, that is right."
1975.36_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3332.258,3341.971,"And you went three miles seaward from the end of that jetty, or from the middle, from the line between two jetties or from the end of the jetty?"
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,3341.971,3344.554,"From the end of the jetty, because that determines?"
1975.36_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3344.554,3345.883,Then you started on the north?
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,3345.883,3346.717,That is correct Sir.
1975.36_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3346.717,3354.984,"And as between the United States and Louisiana, that arc divided the rights to the seabed."
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,3354.984,3357.046,"That is correct, under Submerged Lands Act."
1975.36_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3357.046,3359.331,"Yes, under Submerged Lands Act."
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,3370.101,3371.265,That is correct Sir.
1975.36_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3387.364,3408.568,"So that if there is oil development, if they were drilling on the seabed within the arc that the United States though belonged to Louisiana under a prior case, it might now be determined it belonged to Texas?"
1975.36_orig,2,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,3408.568,3409.898,"Well it might be, yes."
