1985.84-1485,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1146.461,1151.698,"--Yes, and none of those things are enough to trigger the Sixth Amendment."
1985.84-1485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.836,1263.871,It's important he understand he has a right even if he doesn't have a right; that's your point?

1985.84-1485,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1306.032,1307.082,When they arraign him.
1985.84-1485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.082,1310.686,--It's really started when they start the prosecution.

1985.84-1485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1856.847,1877.243,"Well now, Mr. Mann, would this case be different in your view if the police, instead of being deceptive, if they were here... I'm not sure, but if they were... if they had just said, we're talking to Mr. Burbine right now and you can't see him?"
1985.84-1485,2,39961,robert_b_mann,,1877.243,1882.98,"--Well, I think the attorney... yes, it would be different."
1985.84-1485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1887.634,1892.253,"What could she have done and what right, if any, would be violated, and why?"
