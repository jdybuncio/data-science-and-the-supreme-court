2015.14-844,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.87,"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-844, Bruce v. Samuels. Mr. Shelley."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,7.87,50.525,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are at least three reasons why the Court should adopt what the courts of appeals have called the per-prisoner approach under PLRA Section 1915(b)(2). One, the per-prisoner approach best comports with the statutory text. Two, the per-prisoner approach is the only one consistent with the careful balance Congress struck between deterring frivolous prisoner lawsuits and preserving their right to bring meritorious ones. And three, the per-prisoner approach avoids anomalies and disincentives that Congress could never have intended, disincentives such as discouraging prisoner work by taking one hundred percent of their income month after month. I would like to, of course, start with the text."
2015.14-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,89.46,89.82,There -- there --
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,89.82,90.8,-- in the statute exactly twice.
2015.14-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,90.8,94.205,Can't there be more than one filing fee for a single court?
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,94.205,99.04,"No, there cannot, not in the way Congress understood the term in the PLRA."
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,120.54,134.54,"So what happens if you have -- the district court makes an order, there has to be a filing fee?"
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,134.54,135.545,In the district court?
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,135.545,140.865,"Yes, and then that fee is not totally paid."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,151.465,151.89,Right.
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,151.89,162.53,"Does -- does -- on your reading, does the court of appeals filing fee also have to wait until the district court filing fee is fully paid?"
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,162.53,163.21,Yes.
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,175.63,180.69,And that would be across the board that you always have to pay.
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,180.69,186.3,"Always have to pay that. But the second filing fee, the one from the court of appeals, would line up."
2015.14-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.09,214.64,"If he files enough cases, he's never going to have to pay for it, right? I mean, you know, he files 20 cases, that 20 percent will never -- will never come home to roost. What -- what's the disincentive for him -- for his continuing to file cases?"
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,214.64,224.795,"Well, first of all, it would come to roost back in 1995 when Congress enacted the statute because the filing fee for a district court case was only $120, and a court of appeals was 105."
2015.14-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.0,266.63,All right.
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,272.94,273.79,It was and it is.
2015.14-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.79,279.52,I'm pointing out that it's a very ineffective disincentive if the person keeps filing a lot of cases.
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,279.52,287.53,"Well, it's not an ineffective disincentive because it creates months and months more of additional income being garnished."
2015.14-844,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,309.97,315.665,"Mr. Shelley, can we go back to the sentence that you're relying on, because I have to admit I don't understand your reading."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,366.29,374.32,"I think that's incorrect because I think what -- what you should insert, if -- if necessary, in front of the clerk of the court is the relevant clerk of the court."
2015.14-844,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,378.17,386.14,"But then -- so that -- that seems right, to make the sentence work the way you want it to work -- and this is the sentence you are relying on."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,389.43,399.515,"You -- you do not, because there's still -- there's one clerk of the court, and there's always going to be a clerk, because every case the filing fee is paid to a clerk; so there's always going to be the clerk of the court."
2015.14-844,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,403.785,408.955,"Yes, I'm going to say, you know what, even as I look at that, even if you add that language, it still doesn't make sense."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,418.95,428.155,"Well, the filing fee's plural. It -- it can't allow for the -- for the per-case approach, the opposite approach, because filing fees we know means more than one."
2015.14-844,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,446.64,447.98,"Well, but Congress doesn't know that."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,463.66,468.25,It's give the fee to that clerk that that clerk is owed until all the fees are paid.
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,473.04,483.12,"Isn't -- isn't the statute drafted, though, that with a single-case focus, that is, 1915 throughout, talks about an action?"
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,483.12,485.13,Not -- not true.
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,545.72,556.39,"But why is the initial fee -- the initial partial fee, you say each time you file it, you've got to pay that? Why shouldn't that go the same way?"
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,556.39,559.84,"Well, the -- the two sections are written differently."
2015.14-844,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,580.86,588.885,"If you don't know -- I mean, I can't get anything out of the second sentence, to tell you the truth, because I think that a prison is usually within a single district."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,637.225,665.03,"Well, first of all, I don't think Congress necessarily had in mind a prisoner who is filing numerous cases in the same court, because if you look up to (a)(2), for instance, it talks about the prisoner having to file a statement of his indigency. And Congress talked about it needed to be obtained from the appropriate official of each prison at which the prisoner is or was confined. And the government concedes that prisoners are moved around all the time, and therefore, there are numerous districts --"
2015.14-844,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,665.03,666.46,I don't mean it's exclusive.
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,666.46,666.805,Sure.
2015.14-844,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,666.805,677.57,"I'm just giving you an explanation as to why they might have used the words ""fees,"" even though they previously defined a filing fee of $350."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,677.57,683.055,So then let's go to that first sentence in -- in the statutory text in Subsection (b)(2)
2015.14-844,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,707.56,726.08,"In terms of one of your purposes, why isn't the government's concession that in no circumstance can a fee 20 percent be taken until -- unless it's above $10? Why doesn't that take care of your problem?"
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,726.08,730.255,Because I don't think the government's position is -- is statutory allowed.
2015.14-844,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,756.85,771.105,"No, what the government -- I understand -- and they'll correct me -- is I think they are saying that if you pay a -- the initial filing fee, and you're down to $8, they can't take another 10 -- another 20 percent."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,771.105,771.35,Sure.
2015.14-844,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,771.66,773.58,That's how I understood their concession.
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,773.58,775.31,So that was their alternative position.
2015.14-844,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,810.875,814.33,"If you're clarifying it, $11, I guess you'd take a dollar."
2015.14-844,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,817.21,818.92,"If you're at 55, you take 10."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,818.92,822.825,The statute says 20 percent if it exceeds $10.
2015.14-844,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,830.2,831.665,They can't administer it that way.
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,834.305,841.71,"Every circuit who has looked at it has described the per-prisoner approach as one that as long as there's $10 in the account, it's the trigger."
2015.14-844,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,842.95,843.86,And they are really doing that?
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,843.86,845.2,"As far as I know, yes."
2015.14-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.55,883.625,"That's inconceivable to me. I mean, what? Is -- is there a constitutional requirement that prisoners be given income while they are in prison?"
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,883.625,885.94,"There isn't, I -- I don't think."
2015.14-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.24,895.875,"Especially if the fact that they don't have any is their own fault, if they keep filing baseless suits."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,895.875,900.69,"Well, but the -- you'd be out of -- you wouldn't be filing baseless suits because you got the three strikes, eventually."
2015.14-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.95,933.32,"Well, it -- it's not a Hobson's choice if he forfeits all except $10."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,937.01,938.015,Yes.
2015.14-844,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,954.85,971.48,"Is there a way of interpreting the statute, which I think would make -- I -- I would guess, not in every case, where this multiple thing is likely to arise is where: Files a frivolous case, it's dismissed by the district court, and then he takes an appeal."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1019.37,1021.85,"I think it is, given the statutory language."
2015.14-844,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1046.93,1051.92,"Actually, I -- I didn't realize the back end of this."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1079.1,1079.51,No.
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1113.73,1121.62,"That wouldn't be true for a Federal prisoner, because the Bureau of Prisons says no matter what, the prisoner has to be left with $10."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1121.62,1122.74,It's a matter of grace.
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1126.92,1130.82,Do they know to the extent to which the States are following that?
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1130.82,1131.19,Yes.
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1164.1,1164.22,If -- if --
2015.14-844,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1164.22,1179.55,"Now, I don't see how the Bureau of Prisons can do this as a matter of grace. I mean, the statute says what it says, ""shall."" I don't -- I don't know why think they can do -- they may have their own views on what's good policy, but Congress, it seems to me, has written the statute exactly the way you say."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1179.55,1180.31,I agree.
2015.14-844,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1203.65,1206.245,"You can interpret it the other way, linguistically."
2015.14-844,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1231.64,1234.42,"Well, it exceeds $10 until they cash the check."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1234.42,1236.205,I would agree with that.
2015.14-844,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1236.205,1240.34,"Well, now we're getting into the technicalities of banking -- (Laughter.)"
2015.14-844,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1240.34,1247.39,"-- which -- so -- so I -- I -- I think you can read it the way I suggested, if you're not too technical about it."
2015.14-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1249.44,1254.5,Does the Fed have a position on this that -- that -- that Chevron requires us to defer to?
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1254.5,1255.88,No.
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1299.4,1304.815,"What happens -- I think this -- this -- Mr. Bruce had multiple filings, right?"
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1304.815,1305.975,"At this point, yes."
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.975,1306.35,Yes.
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1308.565,1309.895,19.
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1311.69,1312.04,19.
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1324.355,1331.35,"First of all, Mr. Bruce didn't incur -- the last seven or so have not been filed, essentially because he had had three strikes by the 12th."
2015.14-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1420.295,1425.605,"I thought the government's position was you can't get blood out of a stone, so when it's 100 percent, that's it."
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1427.96,1428.75,They stood in line.
2015.14-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1444.71,1451.58,"Why do you pick the earliest? I mean, all of them -- all of them are owed. Why don't you pick the nearest court?"
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1451.58,1452.46,"Well, you could."
2015.14-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.395,1455.65,Right.
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1455.65,1471.75,"-- the most current. But the way the courts of appeals have looked at it, they've looked at, in time, the first. And I don't think the government disagrees because, at least when you get to the sixth one, it's -- they -- they treat that one as being deferred under their approach, with the first five being paid."
2015.14-844,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1471.75,1474.81,Is he on the hook for the filing fees here?
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1474.81,1475.965,He is not.
2015.14-844,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1476.87,1478.345,Why not?
2015.14-844,0,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,1478.345,1493.59,"I don't understand the Court to apply the PLRA for its cert petitions, for instance. And in any event, I believe his filing fee was paid on -- oh, he is -- he is subject to a filing fee in this case, and he did pay it."
2015.14-844,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1560.32,1571.985,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1571.985,1577.83,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This statute is written from the perspective of a single case."
2015.14-844,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1640.31,1644.51,"You say the word ""fees."" What about the word ""fees""? Does that show?"
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1644.51,1645.355,Right.
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1710.99,1715.86,"Ms. Saharsky, I don't -- I can't -- I'm not terribly persuaded by your deterrence argument."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1732.51,1735.64,"Well, this is the only provision that provides a financial deterrent."
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1746.44,1758.22,"Yes, but Congress is talking about, okay, they have to pay the filing fee. Certainly Congress didn't focus, I wouldn't think, on whether it's -- well, I assume they didn't focus on whether it's per case or per prisoner, because it's really quite unclear."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1758.22,1763.67,"Well, we think that Congress did make that decision when it wrote the -- the statute from a perspective of a single case."
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1764.55,1765.845,I wanted to talk about that.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1790.895,1791.2,Right.
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.35,1795.46,To me that seems to be more a prisoner focus than a case-by-case.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1795.46,1798.05,But it's -- it's linked to Subsection (b)(1)
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1830.37,1832.55,I'm not sure that's responsive to my point.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1845.125,1862.635,"Well, we think -- the reason that we think it does, just to be clear as possible, is because of the language that starts Subsection (b)(2), which is, ""After payment of the initial partial filing fee"" -- which is for one case -- ""then the prisoner is required to make monthly payments,"" which is to pay the remaining amount because we know he has to pay the full amount for one case."
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1862.635,1865.915,Of 20 percent of the preceding month's income.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1890.15,1895.8,"But this -- this part of the statute, and all the parts of this statute, really, are talking about the perspective of a single case."
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1918.43,1920.69,"Well, yes, but he doesn't get off the hook for the other ones."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1928.99,1929.23,"Well, I think --"
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1929.23,1931.92,"I mean, it's not like he's getting off Scott-free."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1931.92,1932.57,Right.
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1955.9,1958.32,"Well, he pays the 20 percent in every case right away."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1958.32,1958.59,Right.
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2000.31,2002.085,You agree with that interpretation?
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2002.085,2004.69,It's not something that we've taken a position on in this case.
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2004.69,2006.65,Then I don't think it's fair to rely on it.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2006.65,2035.875,"Well, then I -- I do think it's fair to rely on it in light of the fact that no one is collecting -- no one is -- there's not any centralized mechanism to collect now. And that's really the second point that I wanted to make, which is regardless of how you would resolve that legal question, and actually the reason that the administrative office has not, so far as we know, taken a position on that, is because there are serious practical problems to collecting. One of those problems -- when you -- when you look at the statute, Subsection (b) allows you to take money from the trust accounts, so it's fairly easy to collect while the individual is in prison."
2015.14-844,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2084.315,2094.89,"Ms. Saharsky, can I get back to the $10 rule and the BOP policy with respect to this? I think it was the Chief Justice who said that he didn't really understand."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2123.005,2124.59,"Well, a -- a couple of answers."
2015.14-844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.87,2170.46,"Yes, that's probably right. But how can it be read that way? Tell me how it can be read that way."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2170.46,2170.905,Right.
2015.14-844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.905,2173.195,You're saying you can't touch $10.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2177.635,2184.84,"Well, because when it says ""exceeds $10,"" I think you could -- you could read it as that it can't -- kind of the flip side, that you can't go below the $10."
2015.14-844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.76,2188.15,Just read the language. Read the language.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2191.08,2191.725,Right.
2015.14-844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.89,2199.96,That doesn't follow.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2207.89,2209.06,"Well, Justice Scalia --"
2015.14-844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.06,2210.165,That's what it says.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2210.165,2210.575,Right.
2015.14-844,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2218.11,2227.85,"Anyway, why can't you read it that way? You forward the payment each time the amount exceeds $10."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2251.69,2254.5,"Well, that's what we think. We think it can be read multiple ways."
2015.14-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2297.31,2305.45,"But does all of this by all of the States, all of the prisons? Because your adversary says that some are going below the $10."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2305.45,2306.86,I'm not sure that that's true.
2015.14-844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.34,2360.155,"And that issue could come up in the very first payment, couldn't it? If the guy has $10 and 1 cent in his account, the very first payment could raise that issue."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2360.155,2361.47,"Yes, that's true."
2015.14-844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.47,2367.3,So it's not an issue presented by the -- by the question of whether you use the per-case or per-prisoner approach.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2367.3,2368.28,I completely agree.
2015.14-844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.28,2369.64,It's a problem either way.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2369.64,2377.15,"However you resolve the question presented, that would still be a separate question, one that the courts of appeals have not considered in any level of detail. The extent --"
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2377.15,2380.25,"Ms. Saharsky, I find -- I -- I think others may too."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2457.26,2469.94,"Well, a couple of answers. First of all, we think that this is not -- this -- this question of a person having so little in their money -- money in their the account only arises in the case that you're talking about someone who has filed five or more lawsuits, which is not the ordinary case."
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2519.39,2524.975,"Just a thought. Well, if you're there for 20 years, maybe you should let them buy a book."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2524.975,2526.885,Right.
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2534.14,2536.355,"I'm sure they are -- I'm sure they are very good libraries, too."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2536.355,2543.43,"Well, just -- just to be clear, you know, this is a situation that only arises in the fairly atypical situation."
2015.14-844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.76,2567.725,"Do a lot of prisoners buy books? I mean, does Amazon really make a lot of money off these people?"
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2567.725,2568.79,"I can't say, you know --"
2015.14-844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.79,2569.12,I don't think --
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2569.12,2580.41,"-- the experience that we have in this case, for example, might be good to highlight, which is Pinson, the individual who has filed more than a hundred cases -- gets regular deposits into his account, had been using them to buy books and other materials."
2015.14-844,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2633.43,2648.78,"But that does raise -- I mean, as Mr. Shelley says, using that exact $50 number. If you have $50 and you have five lawsuits, the $50 is gone, assuming that the BOP's policy is not uniform and maybe is not statutorily authorized."
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2648.78,2666.02,"Yes, I think that -- I think that that is the implication of it, and we think that that is what Congress intended. I am not sure if the Court is interested in such information, but we actually did go ahead and just look in our database to see how many inmates have one PLRA order that they're paying as opposed to five orders that we're paying."
2015.14-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2699.27,2701.875,Be clear about your policy.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2717.095,2717.86,Correct.
2015.14-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2717.86,2722.09,So those five cases would always wipe out the $10.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2722.09,2725.65,The $10 is not an impediment to the initial partial filing fee.
2015.14-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2727.7,2734.365,So -- and so the $10 floor starts once the account goes up -- you have to -- a bottom.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2742.654,2744.465,Right.
2015.14-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2756.99,2758.36,But you would take 20 percent.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2769.015,2769.71,To --
2015.14-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2769.71,2771.86,Let's assume there's five cases there.
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2771.86,2777.5,"We would -- if we can't pay all of the five cases, as we believe Congress intended, we would pay the oldest lawsuit."
2015.14-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2781.24,2783.085,Would take that entire $1?
2015.14-844,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2783.085,2783.85,Yes.
2015.14-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2865.715,2869.18,"Thank you, counsel. Oh, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.14-844,2,16959,anthony_f_shelley,,2869.18,2887.405,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, with respect to the -- the hypothetical that Justice Sotomayor asked, in fact, I think if the account had $11 in it, the government's position would lead to none of the clerks of the courts being paid because the first payment would take the -- the balance under $10."
2015.14-844,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3003.04,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
