1991.90-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.398,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-1150, Donald J. Willy v. Coastal Corporation."
1991.90-1150,0,36360,michael_a_maness,,56.227,58.56,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,136.41,142.594,"Did you just refer, Mr. Maness, to one of our cases in saying that it was controlled by that case?"
1991.90-1150,0,36360,michael_a_maness,,142.594,143.215,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.215,144.724,What case was that?
1991.90-1150,0,36360,michael_a_maness,,144.724,148.598,"United States Catholic Conference against Abortion Rights Mobilization, Incorporated."
1991.90-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,148.598,152.791,And when was... do you have a citation for that or what?
1991.90-1150,0,36360,michael_a_maness,,152.791,153.5,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1991.90-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.652,155.262,Okay.
1991.90-1150,0,36360,michael_a_maness,,156.582,160.486,Catholic Conference was a 1988 decision of this Court.
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1585.674,1586.185,Beatty.
1991.90-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1651.207,1654.359,"Except for, except for the Catholic Conference of Bishops case."
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1662.156,1669.23,What we had in Catholic Conference was a situation in which the bishops did exactly what Mr. Willy could have done.
1991.90-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.45,1750.864,So you would draw the line between standing on your rights and refusing to proceed further and that cannot be the subject of a sanction.
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1756.729,1757.627,--Certainly.
1991.90-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1762.572,1765.183,"Instead of a hypothetical, what about this very case?"
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1779.462,1781.673,"Well, the short answer, Your Honor, is that he can behave."
1991.90-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1782.445,1783.015,"Well, of course."
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1796.252,1798.894,"--I'm sorry, perhaps I didn't understand your fact situation."
1991.90-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.929,1804.42,Right.
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1804.42,1813.095,"--and he simply refused to respond, then what would happen is a judgment would be entered against him and he would then have the opportunity to appeal the lack of subject matter jurisdiction to the Fifth Circuit."
1991.90-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1813.095,1816.445,"Oh, I see."
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1819.718,1826.162,Certainly he litigates the jurisdictional issue because it's even conceded by petitioner that the Federal court has the jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction.
1991.90-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1833.979,1836.931,"Well, but did he do any more than contest the jurisdictional issue in this case?"
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1836.931,1837.692,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1991.90-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1868.233,1869.484,Let me just be sure I get the procedure.
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1875.128,1875.806,No.
1991.90-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.556,1887.036,"--Oh, right."
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1887.525,1893.329,"I hope and I would submit that that's not a hard, that shouldn't be that difficult a choice for a litigant to take."
1991.90-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.329,1897.302,"Well, it's a little different choice, though, than the choice of the subpoenaed party in the Catholic Bishops case."
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1898.514,1899.233,Yes.
1991.90-1150,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1937.029,1951.76,"Well, our, our cases in Chambers against NASCO and Hutto against Finney suggests that fee shifting sanctions are analogous to civil contempt."
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,1955.332,1963.637,"If I might, Your Honor, address both that issue of Hutto v. Finney as well as the issue of attorney fee shifting."
1991.90-1150,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2043.318,2054.105,I don't think they help you because there there was article III jurisdiction at one point in those cases.
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,2055.648,2057.496,I don't raise it for that position.
1991.90-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.744,2182.848,"But your argument on punishment, I'm not sure he disagrees with, with the distinction he emphasized from United Mine Workers between civil and criminal."
1991.90-1150,1,35414,michael_l_beatty,,2182.848,2185.57,But... I understand that.
1991.90-1150,2,36360,michael_a_maness,,2781.478,2794.996,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Court stated in Catholic Conference that a court, Federal district court's subpoena power under Federal Civil Rule 45 cannot be greater than its article III subject matter jurisdiction."
1991.90-1150,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2914.205,2915.964,"Thank you, Mr. Maness."
