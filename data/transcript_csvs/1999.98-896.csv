1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.039,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-896, Mark Rotella v. Angela Wood."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,72.196,75.231,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,149.529,150.798,"Well, there could be a third."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,154.083,154.833,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,154.833,157.718,Why couldn't we use the accrual rule that is used for the Clayton Act?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,157.718,158.402,Your Honor--
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,158.402,162.254,"Namely the time the injury occurs, whether you know about it or not."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,162.254,190.689,"--The template that the Court would take from the Clayton Act, Your Honor, would not fit for civil RICO and, as this Court recognized in Klehr, the pure injury accrual rule, it suggested, might not work without some modification in the situation of civil RICO, unlike the antitrust laws, because the antitrust laws require only separate and discrete single acts and not a pattern of racketeering activity, and so it's okay for the antitrust laws to use an injury accrual rule."
1999.98-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.064,226.446,"Well, perhaps the rule could be the injury plus the existence of a cause of action, which means there has to have been a pattern, and I suppose that principles of equitable estoppel might be available in circumstances where the pattern was undiscoverable due to conduct of the defendants."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,226.446,231.266,"But equitable estoppel principles, Your Honor, also will not work, we suggest, for civil RICO."
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.061,258.849,"Well, but in some cases you're going to have affirmative concealment, and the equitable tolling would address that and let the other things be governed by the normal rule."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,258.849,260.785,"But that would be unworkable, because--"
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,260.785,261.201,Why?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,261.201,280.763,"--the equitable tolling principles that would involve fraudulent concealment require affirmative acts or affirmative conduct on the part of the defendant to conceal the cause of action, so that if the defendant does nothing, as in this case, simply does not speak and remains mute, the plaintiff would be unable to take advantage of any equitable tolling."
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.763,282.63,"Well, you say it won't work."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,285.416,295.255,"It... Your Honor, it does not work, and there is not a single case cited in any of the briefs in which equitable tolling has been recognized to apply for civil RICO."
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,295.255,307.83,"I thought Posner has a long decision in which he explains all this, and he goes into it, and I thought, well, if your complaint is fraudulent concealment versus equitable tolling, we could work that out in some other case."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,325.857,328.975,Those... the problem is that it's an indefinite period.
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,332.344,334.796,"But that's viewed as an advantage, not a problem."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,343.902,344.419,--But--
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,344.419,348.953,So they certainly argue that that... what you just called is a problem is the best thing about it.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,348.953,354.007,"--Well, but it would not... it would defeat the purposes of predictability and certainty that should be an aspect--"
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,354.007,354.424,"Oh, no, no."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,364.063,393.149,"--It seems that that problem ought to be dealt with on the front end, and instead of closing the courthouse door to plaintiffs and forcing them to take on the additional burden of opening that door after it has been closed with no determination and no information for the circuit courts to apply as to how long that period ought to last, that it would be better to deal with the harsh results and the equities within the knew or should-have-known standard, and tell everyone that within that standard there is a 4-year limitations period."
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,393.149,396.267,"Well, there are equities on both sides of a statute of limitations case."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,409.427,429.84,"That's correct, and we suggest that Congress in this case has opted to tip that balance in the favor of the plaintiffs, that the open-endedness that might exist because of the knew or should-have-known standard ought to be resolved because Congress looked at a 10-year window in which predicate acts could happen, and the balance of the equities ought to rest in the favor of the plaintiffs."
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.84,432.892,I don't understand why we don't just apply the Clayton Act.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,440.83,444.534,The Clayton Act is geared to each separate act which produces an injury.
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.534,445.1,Right.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,445.1,448.152,"RICO requires a pattern, and in the Clayton Act context--"
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,448.152,450.004,So what is... and therefore?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,450.004,458.342,--And therefore the injuries that are remedied by the Clayton Act don't relate to anything that has the nature of a pattern of racketeering activity.
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,458.342,458.86,So what?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,458.86,460.194,So Congress--
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.194,461.194,What follows from that?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,464.079,464.598,--What follows--
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.598,468.9,"When the injury occurs from a pattern, boom, there's a cause of action."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,468.9,474.203,--The injury must tell the plaintiff that there was a pattern.
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.203,474.836,Why?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,474.836,475.919,Because otherwise--
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.919,480.523,The injury under the Clayton Act doesn't have to tell the plaintiff that there was an antitrust conspiracy.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,480.523,488.729,"--Because Congress has used the language that the injury is by reason of a violation of section 1962, which is a pattern of racketeering--"
1999.98-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,488.729,495.133,"No, but it may simply be that the RICO injury, that there is no RICO injury for your client."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,536.46,538.026,--But that interpretation--
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.026,541.512,It's only the person harmed by the second predicate act who's injured by a pattern.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,541.512,545.565,"--Your Honor, that would render the statutory language meaningless."
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,560.841,563.377,No cause of action until there's a pattern.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,563.377,564.26,--That's correct.
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.26,566.829,No cause of action until the second predicate act.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,566.829,572.816,"But for statute of limitations purposes there must be some discovery principle attached to that, because until--"
1999.98-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,572.816,574.335,"Well, in that connection, let me just ask you this question."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,581.322,582.089,--Yes.
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,604.854,607.489,It does work against the plaintiff in the antitrust area.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,618.864,623.149,But for two reasons that antitrust analogy doesn't work.
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,632.687,634.039,"No, they don't know there was a price fix."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,637.258,637.875,--That's right.
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,637.875,639.777,They didn't know there was a price fix for years.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,639.777,662.541,"But at least... and the second reason is, but at least, if there is a separate, overt act later on, which also damages them, under the separate accrual rule in antitrust they would get a new cause of action starting from that date forward, whereas in RICO, if the second predicate act falls outside the 4-year period suggested by Justice Scalia's question, then there would be no remedy for the RICO plaintiff."
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,662.541,662.893,Are you sure?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,666.694,677.483,"It is a new pattern which this Court rejected in the accrual... there is a new pattern, but the statute would not run anew from the last predicate act, as this Court said in Klehr."
1999.98-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,692.243,707.854,"Mr. Hogan, do you know of another instance where, Congress being silent on the limit, the Court picks as the closest analogy, as it did here, the Clayton Act, and then takes the starting trigger from some place else?"
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,707.854,709.687,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,709.687,713.991,"Those two ordinarily would go together, the statute of limitations and its accoutrements."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,722.545,723.145,Yes.
1999.98-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,730.418,732.92,But then why borrow from the Clayton Act at all?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,732.92,740.239,"We borrow from the Clayton Act to inform us what the statutory period is, and tell us how big the hourglass is."
1999.98-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,740.239,742.875,But it isn't the statutory period if you have a different accrual--
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,749.779,768.759,"Because in Malley-Duff this Court said that when it looked to those State limitations periods for fraud, they were divergent and not uniform, and this Court therefore said that the closest analogy for the limitations period is the Clayton Act, and so the 4-year limitations period, but the fraud analogy is what works best for the accrual rule."
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,776.763,779.214,"Well, those are two different things."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,793.391,795.076,--That's correct.
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.076,800.545,"Well, that's going a good deal further than saying you're just fighting concealment."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,800.545,805.032,But no further than it takes to recognize the existence of the cause of action.
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.749,831.183,Well--
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,831.183,832.199,It is not a RICO case.
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,832.199,836.587,--When do you say the pattern came into existence here?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,836.587,846.876,"Your Honor, the record is not clear about that, but we can assume for purposes of argument that it existed while Mr. Rotella was in the hospital, before 1986."
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.149,863.068,So we're not talking about a pattern that just came together after the actual injury?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,863.068,866.289,"For purposes of the argument, that... we can assume that."
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.322,894.607,"You'd have a perfectly good State cause of action for this, wouldn't you?"
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,894.607,896.042,"Your Honor, we... no."
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,899.243,899.66,Yes.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,899.66,900.41,--maybe under fraud.
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,900.41,904.395,"Yes, not treble damages or attorney's fees, but a traditional tort action."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,904.395,905.081,Exactly.
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.972,929.363,"Suppose I'm injured by some... by someone else, and do I have to... it could have been by negligence, and it could have been intentionally."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,942.939,943.856,"No, of course not."
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.856,948.324,"On both of them, you don't have to know what the precise nature of the injury is ordinarily."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,949.86,950.793,But if we say--
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.793,956.847,"And here you say, I have to know not only if these doctors injured me, but that they injured me by reason of a pattern."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,962.001,970.588,"--Because in an intentional tort case, Justice Scalia, there is a recognized common law accrual doctrine that would have applied to that."
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,978.261,988.568,"I understand that, but when we supply that doctrine, when we invent that doctrine, why should it be so radically different from the normal common law, which is that you have to know that you're injured?"
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,998.274,999.09,The tradition--
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.09,1002.226,We usually don't do that for statutes of limitation.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1002.226,1018.338,"--It is not picky, as this Court recognized in the Holmberg decision in 1946, to say that until the plaintiff actually discovers the fraud he has not discovered the cause of action and cannot sue on it, and the Court ought not to reward the wrong-doer simply because the wrong-doer--"
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1018.338,1019.554,Suppose you did this.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1059.665,1071.638,"--It would work an injustice in this case because the plaintiff would not be able to take advantage of any sort of equitable tolling doctrine, because there is no affirmative conduct on the--"
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1071.638,1078.376,"I read you what the definition of equitable tolling is right out of that opinion, which had a fairly thorough survey."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1092.569,1093.686,--Yes.
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.85,1175.306,"You know, I don't... I'm not really smitten by the equitable tolling possibility, even."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1216.783,1219.585,"Your Honor, our client would have no cause of action."
1999.98-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1239.748,1256.008,"Well, under State law, is there any doctrine that if your injury is not immediately discernible because it's consistent with adequate treatment, that the injury discovery arises only when you find out that there has been maltreatment?"
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1256.008,1265.031,"Well, certainly the latent injury cases, or the foreign object cases would encompass that, but in this case what you essentially have is--"
1999.98-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1265.031,1266.382,Would this case come within that?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1266.382,1267.5,"--No, it wouldn't."
1999.98-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1283.409,1284.527,I understand that.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1284.527,1284.927,--Yes.
1999.98-896,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1284.927,1289.396,"But under common State discovery rules, that there would be no exception to the discovery of injury."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1294.967,1299.021,Not for the nature of the cause of action that the plaintiff would want to undertake.
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1301.337,1304.173,"Well, which he could bring as soon as he discovers the fraud."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1304.173,1305.441,As soon as he discovers the fraud.
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.441,1306.375,So he would have a State cause of action.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1306.375,1310.494,"He would have a State cause of action, yes, for fraud, when he discovers--"
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.494,1311.061,That's right.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1311.061,1312.544,--And then he would have also--
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.544,1315.463,So in that respect he's much better off than the Clayton Act plaintiff.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1315.463,1315.963,"--Well, then--"
1999.98-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.963,1321.284,Who typically has no cause of action at all when he finally discovers--
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1321.284,1326.854,"--Well, first, at that point, when he discovers the fraud he'd have a certain 4-year period in which to bring the cause of action."
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1342.03,1349.033,"--Anyway, I think the Clayton Act plaintiff does have... he does have a... he can sue if it's fraudulently concealed."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1349.033,1350.083,That's correct.
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1350.083,1350.552,All right.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1369.797,1370.264,"Well, I--"
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1370.264,1373.149,I imagine the same is true of fraud defendants.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1384.457,1385.107,--Well--
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1385.107,1388.844,Or do you call it equitable tolling and say it's the plaintiff who has to have been diligent?
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1388.844,1404.687,"--It matters to the extent that this Court has always said those sorts of doctrines are very limited, very narrow exceptions to the limitations accrual rules, and they are available, as this Court said in the Irwin case, only very sparingly; only in very limited circumstances do they apply."
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.058,1417.678,"Well, in Holmberg, which you cited, there there was an allegation that there had been affirmative concealment, was there not?"
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1417.678,1420.297,"--There was some affirmative concealment, yes, Your Honor, there was."
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.297,1421.832,"Well, that's what the court is talking about, isn't it?"
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1421.832,1430.337,"Well, to the extent that the affirmative concealment kept the plaintiff from discovering it, that could be read as either a fraud case or a fraudulent concealment case."
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.337,1441.71,"Would you accept that as a basis for a statute of limitations where there has been concealment, or, you know, that the statute didn't run until it was discovered?"
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1441.71,1444.745,That sort of a doctrine wouldn't work well for RICO.
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1444.745,1446.614,"Well, it wouldn't help you, I think, yes."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1446.614,1457.905,"That's correct, it wouldn't help us, because certainly in Mr. Rotella's case there was no affirmative conduct by the defendants in this case to conceal the fact that they were taking money from him."
1999.98-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.54,1464.309,But it isn't concealing just that they were taking money from him.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1466.509,1474.098,"--Concealing the wrongdoing, which we say cannot be uncoupled in the case of RICO from the pattern of racketeering activity."
1999.98-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.703,1495.011,I don't understand why you say that an allegation that the pattern was concealed until 2 years ago wouldn't be... satisfy the fraudulent concealment tolling doctrine.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1495.011,1497.713,--We say because--
1999.98-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1497.713,1498.246,I think it would.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1498.246,1510.354,"--As Judge Posner has analyzed those cases, and as this Court cited in his opinion in the Cada case, which was quoted in Klehr, there has to be, in the case of fraudulent concealment, some sort of affirmative conduct on the part of the defendant."
1999.98-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1510.354,1510.854,Correct.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1510.854,1514.758,"Now, let's take this case and look at the practicalities of how that might work."
1999.98-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1550.181,1561.12,"Well, the answer is then he's using due diligence and the statute was tolled, so he's no worse off either way, and I can't imagine, if what you allege is true, that the doctors at some point didn't say, don't tell anybody."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1561.12,1567.709,"--But he ought not to be penalized if he did not really know, nor could have known of the existence of the particular acts--"
1999.98-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1567.709,1572.261,"Well, but you're omitting the fact, supposing the guilty plea had been entered the day before he walked into the office--"
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1572.261,1572.761,--If the--
1999.98-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.761,1576.729,--and the record of that proceeding gave rise to suspicion about all these facts.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1576.729,1586.002,"--If that happened, then he'd be into a 4-year accrual period which would start with the release of that criminal guilty plea 1 day before he walked into the lawyer's office."
1999.98-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1586.002,1595.876,"No, I'm supposing... I'm suggesting that maybe the record or the publicity attending the guilty plea put him on notice that there had been fraudulent concealment for the preceding 10 years."
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1599.328,1606.998,"But only if, under fraudulent concealment, he could also show, or somehow find out that the defendants had been affirmatively doing things."
1999.98-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.934,1608.317,--Right.
1999.98-896,0,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,1608.317,1615.021,"--defendant's office and said, doctor, I think you're stealing money from me, and the doctor said, no I am not, you're really sick, you deserve to be in the hospital."
1999.98-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.11,1624.06,"Very well, Mr. Hogan."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1625.479,1632.733,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1674.459,1675.875,Is that the Clayton Act rule?
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1675.875,1677.661,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.661,1679.611,You don't argue in favor of the Clayton Act rule?
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1679.611,1683.213,"We would accept the Clayton Act rule, Your Honor, because we would prevail with that rule."
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1683.213,1683.998,"Yes, I understand."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1684.665,1685.315,And--
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.315,1690.819,"--And we've said that this statute is modeled after the Clayton Act, but you don't argue that we should use the same statute as the Clayton Act."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1690.819,1692.254,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1696.806,1701.543,"Like RICO, we should give it more breadth than the Clayton Act."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1701.543,1705.995,"--Because of the variety of predicate acts, as well as the balancing test."
1999.98-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1771.873,1777.008,"What was the injury here that should have been discovered, and when should it have been discovered?"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1777.008,1795.738,"--Your Honor, the injury pursuant to the complaint, since we're dealing with the complaint allegation, the injury that was alleged on page 20 of the joint appendix, at paragraph 28, is that Mr. Rotella's personal items were converted, they were withheld at the time of his discharge."
1999.98-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1815.8,1817.835,When should that have been discovered?
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1817.835,1823.322,"--That was discovered, as the Fifth Circuit found in the first Rotella appeal, during the hospitalization."
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.575,1853.491,But Mr. Frazier--
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1866.851,1882.677,"--Your Honor, the discovery of a pattern is just discovery of another element, and it would not be fair because it would extend... it would allow plaintiffs to know their injury, or when they should have known their injury, but not bring a suit until they discover--"
1999.98-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1882.677,1896.085,"But Mr. Frazier, I think that's not quite right, because built into the discovery of the pattern is, discovered in fact, or should have discovered, so there's a diligence requirement built in there, too."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1915.998,1919.95,"--Well, there is a diligence requirement in the knew or should have known with diligence."
1999.98-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1938.245,1940.614,But the plaintiff doesn't know.
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1943.316,1944.066,Yes.
1999.98-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1944.066,1947.702,But he doesn't know why and how.
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,1974.353,1981.357,"Your Honor, it deals with what a plaintiff can discover in the 4 years."
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.956,2033.225,What diligence are you talking about?
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2046.466,2049.835,"Justice Scalia, if he knows of his injury--"
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.835,2050.937,Yes.
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2050.937,2086.36,"--and he exercises the diligence that the Federal courts have required to find the cause, and to find other elements of his claim, if he doesn't discover the pattern by virtue of a tolling doctrine of fraudulent concealment, or he simply just cannot, by fault of no one, he must bring suit, as the courts have held, within the limitations of the claims that are available to him, and if it's undetectable by no fault of the defendant, then equitable tolling will allow him to bring a cause of action under RICO within a reasonable time after discovery of the essential information that he may have."
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2086.36,2090.728,"Of the existence of the RICO claim, of the pattern of conspiracy?"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2090.728,2094.28,"That may be included in the essential information that he would need, yes."
1999.98-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2094.28,2101.803,"Well, I thought a majority of the circuits... and I'd like you to discuss what the circuits have done."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2136.29,2139.159,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, that is the majority rule."
1999.98-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2139.159,2146.748,"Have other circuits applied the pure Clayton Act rule, injury whether you know of it or should have known of it?"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2146.748,2149.467,"No, Your Honor, no circuit has applied--"
1999.98-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2149.467,2151.15,"Isn't that a red herring, or is it?"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2201.067,2204.019,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief--"
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.019,2217.345,"As I understand your position, you desire neither the Clayton Act rule nor the rule that Justice O'Connor just described, but rather some third rule."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2217.345,2220.046,"--No, Justice O'Connor stated the majority rule that--"
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2220.046,2221.68,Which is what you assert.
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2221.68,2224.515,"--Yes, that discovery of the injury--"
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.515,2239.608,"But I thought in your answer to me you said that if he didn't know of the pattern, and could not with due diligence have discovered the pattern, the statute would not be running."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2239.608,2242.893,"--No, Justice Scalia, I... if I said that, I misspoke."
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.893,2245.512,"You did indeed say it, and it perplexed me."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2246.045,2254.618,"Well, what I was saying is, is that if all elements exist, and a plaintiff discovers or should discover his injury, that is the majority rule."
1999.98-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2282.951,2283.518,"--All right, let's--"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2283.518,2284.653,The statute has begun to run.
1999.98-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2284.653,2289.955,--Let's assume that the second predicate act does not occur until after 4 years from the date of the injury.
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2292.073,2299.061,"That is a substantive question, Your Honor, that frankly the courts have not grappled with, and--"
1999.98-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2299.061,2299.413,"Oh, come on."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2299.413,2299.896,--Yes--
1999.98-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2299.896,2304.298,"I mean, the statute isn't violated unless there are at least two predicate acts, isn't that right?"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2304.298,2317.79,"--A pattern is at a minimum two predicate acts, but the Court in McCool indicated that you might have an injury, just because you happen to be the first person injured, that you might not... that you might still have redress if the pattern arose later, but--"
1999.98-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2317.79,2321.592,"Yes, and another way of construing the statute is that you don't, that there--"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2321.592,2322.026,--Right.
1999.98-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.026,2329.196,"--is no RICO violation until the second predicate act, and if you were injured beforehand, whatever your injury is, it's not a RICO injury."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2329.196,2332.982,"That is an interpretation of the statute, because it does require a violation of 1962--"
1999.98-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2332.982,2333.465,"Okay, and--"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2333.465,2334.167,--which is a pattern.
1999.98-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2335.384,2338.067,--You don't have to take a position on that in this case?
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2338.067,2379.244,"That is correct, Your Honor, because the pattern existed at the time of his discharge in 1986 pursuant to his complaint, so all of the elements of Mr. Rotella's RICO claim existed in June of 1986 and, critically, he was aware of his open and obvious injury, the retention of his personal items, and the Federal courts have determined that notice of injury is sufficient to place a reasonably diligent plaintiff on notice to investigate to find out the other elements to plead the claim, and we have a 4-year limitations period, and that has been held to be--"
1999.98-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2379.244,2384.965,Is it correct that the issue we have to decide is just when the cause of action accrues for limitations purposes?
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2391.987,2402.426,"--Yes, Your Honor, but the injury discovery rule that we posit does have the equitable tolling, but in this case they did not stay with equitable tolling pleadings."
1999.98-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.717,2413.1,"Right, if there--"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2413.1,2413.55,--there was a pattern.

1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2450.509,2460.048,"That is correct on the facts of this case, Your Honor, but the equitable tolling doctrines have been applied in the majority of circuits that have applied the injury--"
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.048,2488.698,"Just as your rule has been applied, but would you explain to me why it is, other than it makes your argument easier, that having adopted the Clayton Act statute of limitations, we should not adopt the Clayton Act rule that the statute begins to run from the time of injury, but should rather adopt the rule that you're urging that it should run from the time of discovery of the injury."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2490.9,2491.35,--No.
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.35,2492.252,"--Yes, you are."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2496.721,2497.304,That is correct.

1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2505.494,2520.253,"Because of the... as I said earlier, the variety, and the broad variety of predicate acts, some 52 criminal statutes in nine State areas... that are there, as well as we think it's--"
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.253,2521.355,Why does that--
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2521.355,2521.905,--It's a more fair rule.
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.905,2525.573,"--Why does that make any difference, the wide variety of acts?"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2526.473,2527.675,Because--
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2527.675,2532.377,"There are a wide variety of acts that can, you know, restrict trade as well."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2532.377,2533.163,--Uh-huh.
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2556.779,2580.477,"I frankly think that it is more likely that you would not be aware of your injury in a Clayton Act situation, these economic injuries that are caused by a conspiracy, than it is that you would not be aware of your injury in the typical RICO case that, you know, that Congress had in mind, which was a case where you're dealing with racketeers."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2587.381,2596.67,"--Well, again, we would not be upset, obviously, if the Court were to adopt that rule, because we would prevail."
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.67,2597.804,"Well, this is an important issue."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2597.804,2598.189,It is.
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.189,2617.583,"And just because you... it's good enough for your case to adopt the middle rule, we're... maybe we should have appointed an amicus to argue for the lawyer who's going to be following you in the next case, for whose client it is essential that he establish, not an injury discovery rule, but an injury rule."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2625.573,2633.01,"Well, these cases, of course, are so fact-specific, but the injury discovery rule has been applied broadly."
1999.98-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2633.01,2669.116,"I mean, if this is an important issue, my colleagues having corrected me, and they may be right on that, they've given the answer, haven't they, that if, in fact, the injury in a Clayton Act case is not paying the $2 but, rather, paying the $2 knowing that the true price is $1.50, if that is the injury, then to require knowledge of that injury would often, if not always require knowledge of the cause, namely the price fix."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2669.116,2669.816,Uh-huh.
1999.98-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2669.816,2675.77,"But you don't want to cause that, and therefore you get to, the injury alone is sufficient."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2685.709,2688.428,Yes.
1999.98-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2688.428,2695.25,"It's just not that kind of problem in a RICO case, so I put that for your... for you to comment, or the future lawyer to comment."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2695.25,2695.933,Mm-hmm.
1999.98-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2695.933,2696.783,Or whoever.
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2696.783,2730.254,"Well, the majority or the largest number of RICO claims do have a fraud element, as this Court has noted, and even though the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Act has taken out securities fraud from RICO, which comprised in the 1985 ABA report, which this Court has cited twice, the largest percentage of RICO claims, there are still some claims based in fraud, and the injury discovery rule we believe is a fairer balancing test, particularly on the fraud-based claims."
1999.98-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2777.485,2784.222,"And it's really academic in this case, because there's no adversarial contest on that."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2790.842,2791.542,Yes.
1999.98-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2791.542,2793.51,"--if we reject that, that's the end of the case."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2799.248,2801.183,That is correct.
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.183,2803.45,"We don't have to decide that question, I guess."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2808.087,2817.21,"The Court could do that, could decide that the discovery of pattern is not appropriate and leave... once again, now we're down to two rules."
1999.98-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.684,2832.636,"Of course, your job is just to win the case for your client."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2837.439,2845.562,"--Well, that may be true, and we may have cases where our pure injury rule would certainly inure to the defense side, which we represent, so that--"
1999.98-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2845.562,2858.037,"Well, if we're consulting what's good for you as a lawyer, we probably should leave the state of the law in as much confusion as possible."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,2858.603,2863.424,"--Well, I don't think the confusion would help all the parties."
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2989.522,3004.097,"Do you think it's very certain to know when a person discovered... I mean, that's something very interior, when did I know of it, or even when ought to I have known, ought I to have known of a document."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,3006.049,3007.349,--It's certain--
1999.98-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.349,3011.703,"If you want a certain rule, when the injury occurs, that's pretty certain."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,3011.703,3014.322,"--That is... yes, that is very certain."
1999.98-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3025.528,3037.937,"Well, and I suppose it's analogous to when State fraud causes of action accrue normally, isn't it, injury discovery?"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,3037.937,3040.703,"--State causes of action, Justice O'Connor?"
1999.98-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3062.986,3068.29,"May I, just to satisfy my curiosity, ask just one question about this particular case?"
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,3076.978,3078.945,--That is correct.
1999.98-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3081.78,3088.37,"It's business or property, so he's not claiming damages for the long period of time that he may have unnecessarily been kept in the institution."
1999.98-896,1,18946,charles_t_frazier_jr,,3088.37,3106.332,"The complaint, the vast majority of the allegations in the complaint, Justice Stevens, allege such an injury, but under RICO that is what he cannot recover, and the prayer is so general it just says actual damages within the court's jurisdiction, which doesn't work either, but it's very vague."
1999.98-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3190.086,3190.836,"Thank you, Mr. Frazier."
1999.98-896,2,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,3194.038,3198.008,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-896,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3262.967,3273.156,"But you have a... let us suppose that we think the equitable tolling doctrine requires affirmative concealment, as there was in Holmberg, which you rely on."
1999.98-896,2,39436,richard_p_hogan_jr,,3280.06,3280.762,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.98-896,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3391.233,3394.269,"Thank you, Mr. Hogan."
