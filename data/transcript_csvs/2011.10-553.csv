2011.10-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.222,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-553, Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,12.224,17.476,Mr. Chief Justice and play it please the Court:
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,46.995,51.633,"Mr. Laycock, could you clarify one point?"
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,94.795,99.28,"Well, she was removed from her ministry at Hosanna-Tabor."
2011.10-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,145.744,157.385,"Counsel, most of the circuits have recognized a ministerial exception."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,239.87,247.043,"I think if you look at the court of appeals cases, they have not indulged in pretext inquiries for ministers."
2011.10-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,268.973,277.329,The problem with that is that it doesn't take account of the societal interest in encouraging the reporting.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,290.655,308.183,"I understand that concern, and that was my second point, that if you want to carve out an exception for cases like child abuse where the government's interest is in protecting the child, not an interest in protecting the minister, when you get such a case, we think you could carve out that exception."
2011.10-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,308.183,309.216,How?
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,311.402,318.906,The -- first you have to identify the government's interest in regulation.
2011.10-553,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,356.781,361.068,"Mr. Laycock, the ministerial exception is not something new."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,397.858,400.793,The only -- I'm not aware of any such case.
2011.10-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,454.195,461.351,"But here what we have is a claim of retaliation, so that she can't even get a hearing."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,486.566,489.101,"Well, she can't get a hearing in civil court."
2011.10-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,501.742,506.813,"Again, that -- that could be an argument you could make in the -- in the pretext hearing."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,506.813,512.383,--Well it's an argument we make in the hearing on whether the ministerial exception applies.
2011.10-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,512.383,519.387,But you're asking for an exemption so these issues can't even be tried.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,519.387,522.922,"Well, we are asking to apply the exemption--"
2011.10-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,522.922,527.143,It's almost like a summary -- like a summary judgment argument.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,527.143,528.626,--It was precisely a motion for--
2011.10-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.626,529.595,"That's the analogy, I think."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,529.595,531.495,--It was a motion for summary judgment.
2011.10-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,531.495,533.213,"No, no, no."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,546.738,552.524,I'm not entirely sure I understand the question.
2011.10-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,559.447,566.868,I'm saying if there are some substantial issues the church has that can be litigated in EEOC hearing.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,571.505,575.29,I understand that.
2011.10-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.692,587.781,I think your point is that it's -- it's none of the business of the government to decide what the substantial interest of the church is.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,587.781,590.749,"--That's one of my points, maybe the most important of my points."
2011.10-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,618.483,626.673,"Counsel, you referred to the ministerial exception, but of course your position extends beyond ministers."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,632.66,633.343,Right.
2011.10-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,641.098,649.352,"Well, let's say it's a teacher who teaches only purely secular subjects, but leads the class in grace before lunch."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,653.406,659.21,The lower courts have said that person is not covered and we are not challenging that rule.
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.264,678.622,"But I thought your position would be if she's a commissioned minister, as distinguished from a teacher who conducts grace or takes the class to chapel."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,699.552,706.291,"--If she's commissioned as a minister and if that is not a sham, then we think that makes her a minister."
2011.10-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.762,712.979,Can we try whether it's a sham?
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,715.297,716.347,Well--
2011.10-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.347,718.016,Is a sham different from a pretext?
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,718.016,723.986,"--Well, I -- I certainly meant something different from a pretext."
2011.10-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.285,759.926,"So you would allow the, the government courts to probe behind the church's assertion that this person is a minister?"
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,770.565,771.483,--That's right.
2011.10-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,771.483,775.452,"Well, different churches have different ideas about who's a minister."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,787.593,789.962,I don't -- I don't think it means that.
2011.10-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,807.406,813.827,Every one of our adherents stands as a witness to our beliefs.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,821.066,822.666,--I understand that.
2011.10-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,829.17,830.772,Lay people in many--
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,830.772,833.224,--Lay people have to be witnesses.
2011.10-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,840.812,845.365,--But the answer you gave to the Chief Justice seem to me to be this case.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,880.872,885.523,How -- how many religious functions you perform can be explored.
2011.10-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.177,891.912,And that term is a legal term.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,898.0,898.866,--That is correct.
2011.10-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.866,899.416,Okay.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,899.416,900.2,That is correct.
2011.10-553,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,900.2,901.602,Is that correct?
2011.10-553,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,901.602,906.672,But I thought with a lot of deference to the church's understanding of whether someone is a minister.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,906.672,910.224,We think there should be deference to good faith understandings.
2011.10-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.567,926.983,What makes it not true?
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,937.725,948.849,"We think -- we think if you teach the doctrines of faith, if that is per your job responsibilities to teach the doctrines of the faith, we think you're a minister."
2011.10-553,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,948.849,953.903,Would it mean that any religious teacher is a minister under your theory?
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,967.144,970.179,"If you're ordained or commissioned, that makes it very easy."
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,977.183,1005.102,"I thought that it was part of -- it was agreed that there was no fact dispute that what she did, her duties at the school, did not change from when she's a contract teacher, and therefore not a minister, and then she takes courses and is qualified to become a minister, but what she's doing at the school is the very same thing."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1019.529,1023.147,That -- that's what the Sixth Circuit said.
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1046.427,1059.753,"But you're isolating one parish, but there was something in one of these briefs that said the majority of the teachers in the Lutheran schools -- let's see where it was."
2011.10-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1064.405,1076.529,"While Justice Ginsburg is looking, I had -- I had the same impression, that whether you're commissioned or not commissioned doesn't necessarily mean you can't teach a religious class."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1076.529,1078.812,"Well, it doesn't--"
2011.10-553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1078.812,1081.947,"And again, that's something that, that can be heard."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1082.933,1093.922,"--It's not uncommon, even with ordained ministers, it's not uncommon among Protestants, to recognize an ordination from a different denomination that has similar teachings."
2011.10-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1104.879,1105.546,I'm sorry.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1133.116,1134.416,I didn't say that.
2011.10-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1134.416,1136.418,"Well, but that was the answer you gave."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1139.285,1141.637,"If she teaches a religion class, not if she merely leads a prayer."
2011.10-553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1141.637,1143.154,--What is your definition of minister?
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1151.86,1155.995,"I think if you teach the religion class, you're clearly a minister."
2011.10-553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.633,1169.889,"Okay, but this is -- you're saying a fortiori, but basically you'd be here anyway even if she hadn't been ordained; right?"
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1169.889,1170.855,--That's correct.
2011.10-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.855,1178.511,"What is your -- take, what is your reaction to a less dramatic kind of holding?"
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1260.613,1266.266,"Well, my first objection is I don't think those are remotely the facts here."
2011.10-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1275.755,1277.49,Did anyone mention that to her?
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1277.49,1279.007,--Indeed.
2011.10-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1279.007,1279.759,Really?
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1290.648,1303.041,"Page 55 of the joint appendix, which is the letter that -- where they tell her that they are going to recommend recission of her call, they say because -- because of insubordination, and because you threatened to sue us."
2011.10-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1303.041,1314.097,"I mean, does anyone explain to her, which she might not have known, that this is a religious doctrine that you are supposed to go to the synod or whatever, and you're not supposed to go to court?"
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1328.94,1334.175,You don't assess the importance of a doctrine by asking the person--
2011.10-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.175,1334.742,"No, no."
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1359.392,1361.125,--Is it -- is it in the handbook?
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1379.556,1385.027,"--Well, I don't know if it does or it doesn't, because the handbook is not in the record except for a short excerpt."
2011.10-553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1386.91,1389.495,"Well, Mr. Laycock, we're looking for a citation in the record."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1392.211,1392.797,Yes.
2011.10-553,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1427.201,1447.098,"Mr. Laycock, didn't this inquiry illustrate the problems that will necessarily occur if you get into a pretext analysis -- the question of was she told that she had violated the church's teaching about suing in a civil tribunal."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1485.057,1487.675,That's just part of the problem.
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1495.112,1516.276,"Mr. Laycock, you, in order, I think, to dispel the notion that nothing is permitted, in your reply brief you say that there are many suits that could be brought that would not be inappropriate."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1583.403,1586.022,"Well, it may or it may not."
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1597.48,1602.315,But I thought the reason that she was unfit for the ministry was that she went outside the house.
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1602.315,1602.984,That's right.
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1602.984,1611.588,"So in all of these cases, you go outside the church, you go to the government, then you have a--"
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1611.588,1628.449,"What we say in the passages in the reply brief that you're looking at is the legal doctrine, the ministerial exception as a matter of law, does not apply unless the dispute is over whether I get the job back, job qualifications, job performance or rules of ministry."
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1630.034,1640.323,"--But she could be, for any of these things, she could be disciplined, fired because she complained outside the house?"
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1640.323,1642.025,--She could be.
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1647.829,1658.901,"The tort claim could proceed, and then she would get damages and that would be all right?"
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1658.901,1660.903,She would get damages for the tort.
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1663.622,1685.721,"Did you say -- did I understand you before, in response to Justice Sotomayor and Justice Scalia, that even if she were merely a contract teacher, the fact that she teaches religion classes would be enough for her to qualify for the ministerial exception?"
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1685.721,1686.588,Yes.
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1692.108,1710.853,"Is the clincher in this case, but even -- I think you answered if she were not a commissioned minister, she's teaching the faith, therefore she can be fired, and it doesn't matter whether she's commissioned, so the commission is irrelevant."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1713.621,1715.39,--Job duties are enough.
2011.10-553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1717.823,1739.688,"Well, it was certainly for some purposes, I mean, if every teacher who teaches religion and math and a lot of other things said, I'm a minister and I'm entitled to the parsonage allowance on my income tax return, certainly that's something that a government agent would review."
2011.10-553,0,21173,douglas_laycock,,1739.688,1741.624,"Well, they do review it there."
2011.10-553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1751.496,1752.663,You may.
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1762.454,1765.406,Mr. Chief Justice and play it please the Court:
2011.10-553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.471,1798.71,Is the position of the United States that there is a ministerial exception or that there is not a ministerial exception?
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1798.71,1811.618,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the ministerial exception is understood as a First Amendment doctrine that governs the adjudication of disputes between certain employees and their employers, we agree that that First Amendment doctrine exists."
2011.10-553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1811.618,1814.92,Nothing to do with respect to the ministers.
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1821.575,1829.929,We think that the ministerial exception is one that incorporates the right of association as well as the rights under the religion clauses.
2011.10-553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1829.929,1836.668,Is there anything special about the fact that the people involved in this case are part of a religious organization?
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1836.668,1848.31,"We think that the -- the analysis is one that the Court has -- has elaborated in other cases involving similar claims to autonomy, noninterference."
2011.10-553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1848.31,1849.06,Is that a no?
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1867.804,1870.739,We think the basic contours of the inquiry are not different.
2011.10-553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.125,1875.56,That's extraordinary.
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1886.099,1895.723,The contours -- the inquiry that the Court has set out as to expressive associations we think translate quite well to analyzing the claim that Petitioner has made here.
2011.10-553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.21,1910.05,There is nothing in the Constitution that explicitly prohibits the government from mucking around in a labor organization.
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1926.26,1939.5,"Well, Justice Scalia, if I may, I don't understand Petitioner from the first half of his argument to have disputed this basic point, which is that the contours of the First Amendment doctrine at issue here will depend on a balancing of interests."
2011.10-553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.762,1962.766,"I think that the balancing of interests is different, according to the Petitioner, when one of the interests is religion."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1967.67,1968.57,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
2011.10-553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.57,1970.439,That's certainly not what the Petitioner is saying.
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1970.439,1989.25,"--Here is where I think was the core of the insight of the ministerial exception as it was originally conceived is, which is that there are certain relationships within a religious community that are so fundamental, so private and ecclesiastical in nature, that it will take an extraordinarily compelling governmental interest to just interference."
2011.10-553,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1999.124,2006.462,"Well, do you accept the proposition that one of the central concerns of the Establishment Clause was preventing the government from choosing ministers?"
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2020.954,2022.556,"--No, Justice Alito, we don't dispute it."
2011.10-553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2043.487,2044.97,"Well, suppose that that's a central tenet."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2061.448,2062.381,--Justice Breyer--
2011.10-553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2062.381,2063.883,Your view is it's not protected?
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2063.883,2065.916,--It's not protected.
2011.10-553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2106.727,2110.612,"So the fact if they want to choose to the priest, you could go to the Catholic Church and say they have to be women."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2115.583,2116.399,Right.
2011.10-553,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2147.054,2161.564,"When you say that, are you not implicitly making a judgment about the relative importance of the Catholic doctrine that only males can be ordained as priests and the Lutheran doctrine that a Lutheran should not sue the church in civil courts?"
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2177.157,2184.427,"No, we are not -- We are not drawing distinctions between the importance of a particular religious tenet in a system of religious belief."
2011.10-553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2194.535,2206.259,"You are saying that going to church -- sorry -- that going to court is a more fundamental interest than a woman obtaining the job that she wants, which happens in this case to be a Catholic priest."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2208.009,2209.561,--I am drawing a distinction between--
2011.10-553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2209.561,2217.717,"Well, I don't know why that doesn't -- I mean, you may be right, but it isn't obvious to me that the one is the more important than the other."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2217.717,2226.589,--The government's interest in preventing retaliation against those who would go to civil authorities with civil wrongs is foundational to the rule of law.
2011.10-553,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2226.589,2237.545,"Miss Kruger, if I could just clarify for a second there, because you're now sounding as though you want to draw a sharp line between retaliation claims and substantive discrimination claims, and I didn't get that from your brief."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2239.48,2253.074,I think that there is an important distinction to be made between the government's general interest in eradicating discrimination from the workplace and the government's interest in ensuring that individuals are not chilled from coming to civil authorities with reports about civil wrongs.
2011.10-553,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2255.592,2262.18,"So are you willing to accept the ministerial exception for substantive discrimination claims, just not for retaliation claims?"
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2262.18,2266.981,--I don't think that those are the only two sets of inquiries that are important in the balancing.
2011.10-553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2269.166,2274.403,I think that question can be answered yes or no.
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2274.403,2281.591,"--I think that that doesn't -- I think the answer is no, in part because that doesn't fully account for all of the public and private interests at stake."
2011.10-553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.534,2322.801,Even with respect to their religion classes and their theology classes?
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2324.17,2325.336,"Well, the government--"
2011.10-553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.336,2340.796,"Just because -- just because you have to comply with State education requirements on secular subjects, your -- who you pick to -- to teach theology or to teach religion has to be -- has to be subject to State control?"
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2340.796,2350.403,"--Justice Scalia, to be clear, the government's interest in this case is not in dictating to the church-operated school who it may choose to teach religion classes and who it may not."
2011.10-553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2370.382,2376.455,You're making -- you're making a judgment about how important a particular religious belief is to a church.
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2387.343,2389.445,"No, absolutely not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2407.074,2424.369,"On the other hand, the -- the belief of the Catholic Church that priests should be male only, you do defer to that, even if the Lutherans say, look, our dispute resolution belief is just as important to a Lutheran as the all-male clergy is to a Catholic."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2424.369,2425.952,--Yes.
2011.10-553,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2431.622,2445.449,"Do you believe, Miss Kruger, that a church has a right that's grounded in the Free Exercise Clause and-or the Establishment Clause to institutional autonomy with respect to its employees?"
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2445.449,2453.788,We don't see that line of church autonomy principles in the religion clause jurisprudence as such.
2011.10-553,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2458.607,2474.534,"So this is to go back to Justice Scalia's question, because I too find that amazing, that you think that the Free -- neither the Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause has anything to say about a church's relationship with its own employees."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2474.534,2484.924,--We think that this is one of the cases that Employment Division v. Smith may have been referring to when it referred to free association claims that are reinforced by free exercise concerns.
2011.10-553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.684,2500.686,I don't think they -- they merge at all.
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2559.222,2562.757,"--I think the answer is no, Justice Scalia--"
2011.10-553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.757,2563.124,Why?
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2563.124,2563.774,--but that is--
2011.10-553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.774,2566.309,Why is that any different from the Lutheran minister?
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2566.309,2571.03,--I would begin with looking at the burdens on association under the balancing test.
2011.10-553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.713,2607.386,"I think that's saying nothing different than what the Chief Justice suggests, that you think the one is more -- is more important to -- to Catholics than the other is to Lutherans."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2607.386,2614.04,I don't think it's a question of the importance of either function to the -- the religious association.
2011.10-553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2617.759,2624.93,"Yes, but then you have to say that it's more important to let people go to court to sue about sex discrimination than it is for a woman to get a job."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2743.991,2762.836,"Justice Breyer, I think that that is a perfectly appropriate way to come at this case, although it skips over sort of the initial inquiry, which is into whether or not the application of the regulations to the particular employment relationship results in an unwarranted interference."
2011.10-553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2762.836,2769.059,"Well, it does have the virtue of deciding a statutory question before a tough constitutional question."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2774.227,2776.579,"I think that that's absolutely right, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-553,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2789.555,2817.14,"Well, if -- if the plaintiff proceeded that way, would she be entitled to -- I assume she would -- introduce testimony by experts on Lutheranism, theologians, professors of religion about how the -- about this -- this tenet, and it isn't really -- they might say, well, it's really not that strong and it once was, but it's faded, and it's not -- it's not widely enforced."
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2826.345,2828.447,"--No, it's not how it would play out."
2011.10-553,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2828.447,2829.247,How are we going to avoid that?
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2829.963,2839.752,"Any inquiry into the validity of a particular religious doctrine is simply irrelevant to the adjudication of the dispute, which is designed to find out just one thing, which is whether the--"
2011.10-553,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2839.752,2840.185,No.
2011.10-553,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2913.633,2931.512,"--If the only way that the Plaintiff has to show that that may not have been the employer's real reason was a subjective judgment about the quality of canon law scholarship, then judgment has to be entered for the employer, because the plaintiff has no viable way, consistent with the Establishment Cause, of demonstrating that wasn't the employer's real reason."
2011.10-553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2971.487,2972.839,"Thank you, Ms. Kruger."
2011.10-553,3,21173,douglas_laycock,,3603.03,3608.783,Two or three points very briefly.
2011.10-553,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3625.812,3633.918,"Mr. Laycock, I'm not sure why the status of the individual matters under your theory."
2011.10-553,3,21173,douglas_laycock,,3651.862,3652.878,--No.
2011.10-553,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3652.878,3654.028,All right.
2011.10-553,3,21173,douglas_laycock,,3655.314,3663.584,The position of minister is categorically special because that has committed the church in the system of separation of church and state.
2011.10-553,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3671.122,3674.657,"So you would say with janitors, you can get into the pretext question."
2011.10-553,3,21173,douglas_laycock,,3674.657,3677.959,--Janitor can litigate his pretext question.
2011.10-553,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3678.611,3681.83,So you're limiting your test to whether that person is minister.
2011.10-553,3,21173,douglas_laycock,,3683.63,3693.887,"A minister is a person who holds ecclesiastical office in the church or who exercises important religious functions, most obviously, including teaching of the faith."
2011.10-553,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3693.887,3704.509,"Mr. Laycock, Mr. Dellinger has some points here about the way in which the ministerial exception relates or doesn't relate to Employment Division v. Smith."
2011.10-553,3,21173,douglas_laycock,,3724.573,3729.811,It's not that institutions are different from individuals.
2011.10-553,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3746.522,3749.04,Might not the Establishment Clause have something to do with that question--
2011.10-553,3,21173,douglas_laycock,,3749.04,3749.74,--The Establishment Clause--
2011.10-553,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3749.74,3751.19,--which applies to institutions?
2011.10-553,3,21173,douglas_laycock,,3751.19,3752.676,--That's the second answer--
2011.10-553,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3752.676,3754.676,Where the Free Exercise Clause applies to individuals.
2011.10-553,3,21173,douglas_laycock,,3754.676,3758.663,--This score has relied on both Free Exercise and Establishment.
2011.10-553,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3768.869,3769.62,"Thank you, counsel."
