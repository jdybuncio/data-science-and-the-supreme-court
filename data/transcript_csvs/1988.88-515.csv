1988.88-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.859,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-515, Sable Communications of California v. FCC; and 88-525, Federal Communications Commission v. Sable."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,14.421,17.933,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,114.396,126.356,"Mr. Taranto, do we no which is which here, I mean, of... of the calls that are really the money-making part of this operation?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,130.418,135.551,We don't have any kind of statistical breakdown of--
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.551,137.103,"Well, how... how would one judge?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,147.301,150.403,"--Well, it... it would depend on exactly what was said."
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.205,170.325,"--Well, is--"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,170.325,178.101,"--although this kind of pornographic material, I think, probably hadn't... certainly does not meet the last of those criteria."
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,221.762,224.066,--May I just be sure of one point?
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,226.807,228.377,"No, not in the statute itself, but--"
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,228.377,231.098,How do we know what Congress meant them to mean?
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,231.098,241.747,"--Well, we think that the legislative history makes it quite clear that Congress was looking at both Miller and at Pacifica when it was using those terms."
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,246.481,249.222,Is there anything in any of the committee reports that describes this point?
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,249.222,252.885,--There are no committee reports for this legislation.
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,252.885,254.946,How deeply into the legislative history must we go to find this out?
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,256.668,266.005,"It was prepared by, I think, Citizens for Decency Through Law, and put into the Congressional Record by the principal sponsors--"
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,266.005,268.517,And we're presuming that the Congress adopted the views of that particular group?
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,268.517,280.546,"--Well, I think that is a fair assumption in this case, because all of the sponsors of the legislation repeatedly referred to both the memorandum and to Pacifica and to Miller."
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,283.337,288.03,"Referred... referred in what kind of context, in the debates on the floor, or in a hearing--"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,288.03,288.221,"--Yes, in the debates on the floor."
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,304.393,304.803,"--But, it is--"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,304.803,310.85,"There was no disputing, within Congress, what the definition of indecency was or obscenity."
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.85,311.438,"--Or really no discussion, I suppose, then."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,318.584,331.583,"Well, even without legislative history, it seems to me the fairest assumption, when Congress used the term indecency, is to look to what this Court had... had said, and this Court's case on indecency in Pacifica."
1988.88-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.085,417.79,"Mr. Taranto, under law, are the telephone companies required to accept these people as customers, or is it a voluntary contractual arrangement?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,417.79,428.997,"It is my understanding that each of the telephone companies is, as part of its non-discrimination obligation, required to accept... accept these."
1988.88-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,628.681,647.242,"And, Mr. Taranto, didn't the FCC conclude that the... a scheme using access codes, scrambling and credit card payment, was a feasible and effective way to serve the states' compelling interest in protecting children from exposure to these calls?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,647.242,655.547,"--Well, I think that... that the Commission was operating throughout that four-year period not... with... a single-minded mandate to prevent minors' access--"
1988.88-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,655.547,660.641,"But didn't it reach that conclusion that I stated, fairly?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,660.641,663.962,--I'm... I'm not sure exactly what quote you're referring to.
1988.88-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,663.962,670.327,That it was feasible and effective using those things to meet the states' compelling interest in protecting children.
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,670.327,686.809,"I believe that... that the Commission was stating a conclusion about the effectiveness of reaching an inherently compromised goal, a goal that said, keep children out, but make sure adults can... can continue to gain access to the material."
1988.88-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,724.815,748.57,"Well, I think that's a concern, if the agency itself concluded that some more restrictive means of controlling this is feasible and effective, I wonder how the total ban survives our constitutional test of least restrictive means."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,748.57,756.777,"Again, I think... I think that the Commission was drawing a... a conclusion about effectiveness as to an inherently limited goal."
1988.88-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,772.256,774.9,"Well... well, you say inherently limited goal."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,780.584,793.85,"--No, I think it was the... the goal was limited by the dual congressional command in 1983 to keep this... this material available on the phones to adults, but try to keep children from gaining access."
1988.88-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,819.73,825.022,"Well, and I suppose it's more than just a congressional concern."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,828.865,830.766,The--
1988.88-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,830.766,833.307,--that adult access be considered.
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,833.307,845.506,"--Yes, there is... we have not disputed, and Congress, itself, did not differ with the conclusion that non-obscene speech is within the protection of the First Amendment."
1988.88-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,850.792,859.187,So we do have to make the inquiry about whether this is narrowly tailored and the least restrictive method?
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,859.187,874.787,"--Well, we have argued that... that this statute does, in fact, meet that standard under, at least, the plurality opinion in Pacifica, it may well be that some laxer standard may be appropriate."
1988.88-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,877.259,885.095,"Well, but, Pacifica was certainly not a case that can be read to authorize a blanket ban--"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,885.095,886.375,"No, Pacifica--"
1988.88-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,886.375,887.667,--in a criminal context.
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,887.667,888.836,--Pacifica does not go that far.
1988.88-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,888.836,889.757,No.
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,889.757,891.808,Pacifica noted the limits on its opinion.
1988.88-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,930.243,954.298,"Well, just before... before we leave this and beginning with Justice O'Connor's initial inquiry, can we interpret this record fairly as saying that the administrative agency made a determination that blocking and access codes were reasonably effective to deter use by minors?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,954.298,960.093,I don't... I don't mean to be... to... to evade that.
1988.88-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,976.055,984.21,"Well, I'm talking about... I'm talking about the one goal of limiting access for minors, as to indecent messages."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,984.21,1000.111,"--No, I... I don't think that the Commission's conclusions, as a whole, can be taken to establish the proposition that children would all but be kept from... from gaining unsupervised access."
1988.88-515,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.111,1004.695,"You think they... you think that... that the Commission did, though, decide they had done as well as they could?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1004.695,1005.234,Yes.
1988.88-515,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.527,1017.331,"And... and ever even if they... even if they thought it was reasonably effective, as Justice Kennedy says, Congress apparently disagreed with them?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1017.331,1021.936,"Well, Congress... I'm not sure Congress disagreed with the--"
1988.88-515,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1021.936,1022.137,I mean they would--
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1022.137,1023.509,--Commission's conclusions.
1988.88-515,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.169,1025.3,"--Yes, exactly."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1025.3,1026.862,"--that way, then Congress did disagree."
1988.88-515,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.862,1031.664,"And if they said this... and if they said, well, this is as well as we can do--"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1031.664,1032.444,That's not good enough.
1988.88-515,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.444,1034.565,--Congress said that wasn't good enough.
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1034.565,1038.147,"Yes, I think that... that would be one reading of the record."
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1038.147,1048.085,"Mr. Taranto, let's talk about if... if the child protection portion of it is no good, do you concede that the whole thing is bad, then?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1048.085,1051.217,The... the child protection purpose?
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.217,1059.202,"Yes, Let's assume that that child protection purpose is... is not served, or could be served in a different fashion."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1059.202,1069.488,"We... we have not defended, and Congress, I don't think even enacted the statute on any ground except the prevention of unsupervised access--"
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1069.488,1070.94,And that's the only ground on which we can uphold it?
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1073.622,1077.424,"--The indecency part of the statute, that's correct."
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.988,1090.762,Does the text of the statute say that that's the only basis for... for the indecency portion?
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1090.762,1093.844,"--No, the text of the statute doesn't... doesn't contain a statement of purpose--"
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.844,1098.949,"Indeed, what... what affects me is what you say about whether phone companies have to carry this stuff."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1135.623,1135.894,--Well--
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1135.894,1138.966,"--Instead of just downing one sector by zoning, or something of that sort."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1145.391,1149.084,--The... the measure be fore this Court doesn't impose that obligation.
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.401,1161.481,"This measure applies only to common carriers, doesn't it?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1161.481,1165.473,"--Well, this... this measure applies to the message providers themselves."
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.985,1174.352,"Yes, but the message provider is providing the message on common carrier facilities--"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1174.352,1174.569,That's right.
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.569,1175.5,--who must carry it.
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1183.515,1185.177,"Well, if... if there is a concern--"
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.177,1187.469,"If they have a public service obligation, the common carriers."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1187.469,1192.902,--Perhaps another statute could relieve common carriers of that obligation.
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.329,1238.819,"Adults have the capacity to turn off a television set, too, but most broadcasters and most sponsors, who have the power to make the judgment about whether they're going to carry pornography just short of... just short of obscenity won't do it."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1248.733,1252.816,"That... that is true, as far as I know under... under current law."
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1261.492,1273.681,May I ask to follow up on Justice O'Connor's inquiry earlier about the... the Commission's conclusion about what could... would reasonably prevent access by minors?
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1294.825,1307.054,"Well, it would certainly be harder case if... if the facts presented were a choice between a ban that made sure no minors got access, and a handful."
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.432,1349.061,"And see, those abilities are probably for the older minors."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1360.231,1369.724,"--I think that... that is certainly true, that... that the older minors get, the more resourceful they can get, the more freedom they have, the more time they have unsupervised from their parents."
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1369.874,1377.0,"--What, for purposes of this... this... what... what do we mean by minor in your... well, what, did Congress identify the age that they ware talking about?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1377.0,1377.27,"--No, because--"
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1377.27,1379.582,"Was it under 21, or under 14, or what?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1379.582,1387.456,"--Well, in... in the 1983 statute, Congress old use the term minor, and I assume used in... in the normal sense of 18 or under."
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.352,1405.572,But those children--
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1405.572,1406.934,--have access to telephones and know how to use--
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.934,1414.467,"--Have access to telephones, but they probably couldn't master these... you know, they couldn't evade the restrictions as easily, I wouldn't think."
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1414.467,1415.538,"--Well, not... not as easily."
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.355,1491.119,"Is that number just based on anecdotal evidence, or are there any studies in the record to tell us--"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1491.119,1493.149,There are no... there are no studies.
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.355,1522.388,"--But those, I suppose, include complaints by adults who wouldn't want the material disseminated to adults either?"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1522.388,1523.329,"--No, I'm referring to--"
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.329,1523.88,Just children?
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1523.88,1526.711,--adults complaining about their children's access.
1988.88-515,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.711,1526.912,I see.
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1526.912,1532.445,Let me say one... one quick word about the obscenity portion of the case.
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1532.445,1539.021,"Including an amicus here, whose... whose daughter was raped by a... by a 12-year-old after he--"
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1539.021,1539.181,Yes.
1988.88-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1539.181,1542.493,--had talked on the phone for two-and-a-half hours to one of these.
1988.88-515,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1542.493,1542.702,Yes.
1988.88-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.846,1610.568,"Very well, Mr. Taranto."
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1611.55,1621.585,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-515,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.923,1726.666,"Have there been decisions in other Circuits that came out differently from either the Fifth or the Ninth Circuit, Mr. Tribe?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1726.666,1727.906,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think so."
1988.88-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1732.26,1732.731,So--
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1738.096,1738.746,I think--
1988.88-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1738.746,1739.828,--to carry these messages?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1739.828,1748.895,"--an affiliate of Sable has argued for that position in other cases, but the client I represent here does not take any position on that matter in this case."
1988.88-515,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1751.656,1756.571,You have no view on whether the telephone companies can refuse to carry these messages?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1756.571,1764.795,"--Oh, I'm inclined to think that they can refuse, unless there is some governmental pressure upon them, in which case it's tantamount to a governmental ban."
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.732,1779.485,"Well, but, are we talking the long-lines companies or just the local companies?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1779.485,1784.12,--We're talking about the Baby Bells and the other local companies.
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.583,1789.904,Sure--
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1789.904,1794.555,But I suspect a similar proposition would be advanced with respect to the long-line companies.
1988.88-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1794.555,1807.254,"--But I... we can say that it's not settled, either from the standpoint of the policy of your client, or by a definitive decision of this Court that the carrier is not going to be told that it's required to carry the messages?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1807.254,1817.502,"Not absolutely and authoritatively settled, Justice Kennedy, but I think implausible to sustain this law on that ground, first, because it's likely they wouldn't be so required."
1988.88-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1853.215,1854.497,But... but... but before we leave that--
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1854.497,1854.605,--Yes.
1988.88-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1854.605,1862.732,--Would it be constitutional for Congress to pass a statute saying that common carriers can refuse to carry any commercial message they choose?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1862.732,1866.764,"That's an intriguing question, Justice Kennedy."
1988.88-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1891.07,1908.912,"And... and If... If that statute is... is not constitutional, then we are right back to this question, because the next question could be, would a statute be permissible allowing the option to the company to refuse indecent calls."
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1908.912,1912.375,"In any event, that would surely be a less restrictive alternative for Congress."
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.315,2060.541,"Well, unless you want to say this approach is... is like the first approach, it... it... it says you can do it, but not in this place."
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2062.974,2063.632,Not on the telephone.
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.632,2068.648,"You can do it by cassettes, you can do it by other modes, just not by telephone."
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2068.648,2069.069,I understand.
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.069,2072.379,"Why is that different, in kind, from the first approach?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2072.379,2075.812,I think the search for that kind of limiting principle is important.
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.22,2134.552,"How about the fact that it's in my home, for one thing?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2140.008,2141.347,"The phone is right in your home, as is the mailbox."
1988.88-515,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2179.001,2181.525,"Mr. Tribe, what is a blocking device?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2181.525,2184.096,"--Well, there are three versions of it."
1988.88-515,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2209.575,2212.848,"Well, the FCC never relied on the use of blocking devices?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2212.848,2212.988,--No.
1988.88-515,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2214.687,2219.552,"Has the technology changed since then, so that is now feasible?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2219.552,2223.804,"--It seems to have advanced, although the record in this case doesn't tell us."
1988.88-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2252.645,2253.874,Did... does Sable agree with that position?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2253.874,2256.805,"--That it's reasonably feasible and effective, absolutely."
1988.88-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2256.805,2259.158,And does it agree that that it's a legitimate regulation?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2259.158,2266.384,"The decision in Carlin III raised one question about that, that I think I ought, in candor, to focus on."
1988.88-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2336.343,2338.585,"Well, I'm still not sure of the answer."
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2343.419,2344.1,--Yes.
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2555.933,2559.055,But what about the impact on the child?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2579.52,2580.95,"But, Justice Scalia--"
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.95,2591.378,Is there no distinction that can be based upon the degree of harm that... that even letting a few children slip under... under the wire can cause?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2591.378,2592.908,"--There are two points, Justice Scalia."
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2601.784,2602.435,I agree with that.
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2602.765,2606.537,"The second proposition, however, is that this is not a live voice."
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.964,2615.774,--Well--
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2615.774,2620.818,And certainly a tape or a record or a video--
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2620.818,2620.948,--I'll take that.
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2623.391,2624.681,--Well--
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2624.681,2627.673,--as... as far as its impact upon the juvenile is concerned.
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2627.673,2632.795,--But does it matter whether it comes into your ear through the telephone or through the air in front of you when you put it on a record player or a tape recording?
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.931,2686.279,"I take It then, it wouldn't make any difference to your argument If the... If the... if the Commission had found that there is just no technologically feasible way of keeping this away from children at all?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2686.279,2692.394,"Justice White, I think it would depend, and in this I agree with Mr. Taranto, on what was meant by no feasible way."
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.866,2696.397,"Well, I... I know, but my question--"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2696.397,2696.537,--Yeah.
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.537,2711.248,"--let's just suppose that the Commission had found that... that there is just no way of really keeping this away from... it just won't be just a few, but practically any child that wants to can get to this."
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2711.248,2711.598,Yes--
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.598,2714.279,I would think your argument would still be the same.
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2714.279,2722.554,"--Well, I think the compelling interest in protecting children leads, as Justice O'Connor says, to a requirement of narrow tailoring."
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.8,2734.241,"well, so... so if there weren't... if there weren't a less restrictive alternative, you would think the law would be all right?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2734.241,2741.187,"--It might well be all right if large numbers of children could, in any event, get a hold of it I was about to give the example of skywriting."
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2844.008,2847.361,So how do you decipher what Congress did.
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2847.361,2855.455,"Oh, I think in an election year, in 1988, it's not too hard, Justice White, if you ask me that question to decipher what Congress did almost--"
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.455,2857.946,"I didn't say it was hard, I just wanted to hear what you had to say about it."
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2858.096,2865.933,"--I think this was... I think this was a politically popular measure to favor, politically devastating to oppose, even though--"
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.933,2866.074,"Well, that's fine."
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2877.821,2881.174,--I think that what they--
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2881.174,2885.596,"--They didn't care whether it was one child or 1,000 who could... is that it?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2885.596,2896.942,"--They had no... they were frustrated, Justice White, because there was this long colloquy between the relevant administrative agency, the FCC, and the Second Circuit, lasting for about five years, going back and forth."
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2934.409,2934.58,"Well, did the... did the--"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2934.58,2935.22,"--they just said, let's go."
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.22,2940.305,--Did they... did they seek the views of the Communications Commission with respect to this particular piece of legislation?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2941.617,2943.089,"Oh, yes, They were told by Diane Killory--"
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.089,2943.367,--What did they say?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2945.11,2946.953,--They recommended that it was probably unconstitutional.
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.953,2948.382,"Well... well, they said--"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2948.382,2949.204,And that Congress not go at far.
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.172,2976.812,"--What... what was their view of the... when they presented their views, they said it might be unconstitutional, but what about how... how... how... how safe was... did they say that... that there is a... there is a... a reasonably effective way of doing this?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2976.812,2976.932,"--Oh, yes."
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2987.639,2991.532,And... and did they testify before the committee... the committee... the--
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2991.532,2995.356,"--I believe Diane Killory did, but I'm sure Mr. Taranto will have that information."
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2995.356,2998.008,--And did they explain what they thought reasonably effective was?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2998.008,3005.242,"Well, the... they, I believe, agreed with Brent Ward, that it would almost eliminate calls from minors."
1988.88-515,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3082.993,3101.355,"Mr. Tribe, If you prevail in your... or Sable prevails, and the Indecency portion of the statute Is struck down, do... is... does the FCC still have authority to proceed the way it was proceeding up through 1987?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3101.355,3108.892,"I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that the prior law would have to be re-enacted to give it that authority, though they might--"
1988.88-515,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3108.892,3109.042,Did Congress--
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3109.042,3110.892,--find some more general statute.
1988.88-515,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3110.892,3114.825,--Did Congress repeal the prior law when it enacted the 1988 statute?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3114.825,3117.759,I believe it replaced the prior law with the 1988 statute.
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.669,3139.894,"Can I come back to your... your point about, you know, now much really important stuff is covered by this?"
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3161.048,3161.189,Uh-huh.
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.959,3166.602,And 180 million Calls in the year ending February 1984.
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3166.602,3166.823,Right.
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3166.823,3169.335,Now I don't think they called up to listen to the Carlin dialogue.
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3173.938,3176.462,"Actually, actually, the numbers dropped off dramatically."
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3198.766,3200.148,I never believed that at all.
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3200.148,3200.736,--You never believed that?
1988.88-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.736,3202.048,I never believed it for a minute.

1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3238.806,3239.997,I was about to try to do that.
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3239.997,3240.427,About to try to.
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3240.728,3240.948,Right.
1988.88-515,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3315.31,3316.461,The Big Chill?
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3316.461,3318.274,It's the very Big Chill.

1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3389.706,3391.796,It could use a completely live method altogether--
1988.88-515,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3391.796,3391.946,--Yes.
1988.88-515,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3391.946,3396.399,"--but I suppose you could say of records that people sell, they could also use live singers."
