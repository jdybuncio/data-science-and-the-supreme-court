2012.12-236,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.487,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-236, Sebelius v. Cloer."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,7.437,9.939,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-236,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,103.65,104.667,Mr. Horwich--
2012.12-236,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,104.667,112.339,There are other -- there are other provisions that refer to a petition filed.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,134.503,153.214,"--Well, those provisions would -- those provisions by their terms apply at points in the proceedings where we would entirely conventionally accept the -- the claimant's representation that the petition has been filed in accordance with the time limitation."
2012.12-236,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,157.785,164.939,But don't you -- don't you put in the Federal Register and report to Congress petitions that had been filed out of time?
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,164.939,176.764,"Well, with respect to -- with respect to reporting to -- to Congress, that's actually an obligation from the Court of Federal Claims, so I can't necessarily speak on their behalf of what they -- what they've produced."
2012.12-236,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,178.866,179.616,"Well, think about the Federal Register."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,179.616,196.16,"The Federal -- with respect to the Federal Register provision, I should first say that it has very recently come to my office's attention that the Department of Health and Human Services has not been complying with that provision for the last few years, and they are taking steps to bring themselves in--"
2012.12-236,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,196.16,197.945,So they don't file anything in the Federal Register.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,197.945,207.218,"--Well, it -- they -- they have historically, and let me -- up till about 2009 -- and again, to be clear, they're taking steps to rectify that situation."
2012.12-236,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,279.414,288.42,"Mr. Horwich, could you say a little bit more about the reporting to Congress provision, because that presumably does not happen at the very beginning, but happens more at the end or in the middle."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,295.776,339.12,"--I believe the -- the reporting provision is a -- there's a report that the Special Master is to make to the Court of Federal Claims, and there's a report that the Court of Federal Claims is to deliver and -- and those, from what I have seen -- again, the Executive Branch doesn't prepare those, because it's the Special Masters and the court that do, but the reports that I have seen, my understanding is that the report of the Special Master is delivered orally to the judges, and so I don't actually know what the contents of that are, and the report that -- and the report that the Court of Federal Claims sends to Congress is a statistical report of all -- actually, of all actions filed in the Court of Federal Claims, but it sends a kind of an omnibus report in satisfaction of--"
2012.12-236,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,339.12,341.905,"All actions filed, using “ filed ” in the normal sense."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,341.905,342.322,"--No, no."
2012.12-236,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,349.41,356.814,But is -- is the upshot of your argument then that filing means different things under different provisions of the Act?
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,356.814,357.949,"--Well, I think it means--"
2012.12-236,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.949,367.955,"And if that's so, it tends to weaken the force of your reliance on -- on filing in the statute -- on the word “ filing ” in the statute of limitations section."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,367.955,382.715,"--Well, I don't think it means -- I don't think it means different things in the Act so much as it means it -- it is to be applied with the understand -- it is to be applied as a fair stand at the time the provision is applied."
2012.12-236,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,382.715,386.684,"Well, I meant -- I meant that just to supplement Justice Kagan's question."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,387.702,402.462,"Well, let me -- let me focus for a moment then on the attorneys' fee provision, though, in terms of why -- why that is particularly good reason to think that petitions -- a petition filed is to be considered in terms of what ought to have been done."
2012.12-236,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,451.728,454.93,--That sounds like a jurisdictional argument to me.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,463.384,473.391,"Well, if it sounds like a jurisdictional argument, then I suppose the answer would be for this Court to say that it's jurisdictional, and of course, if that's true, then our position -- our position would prevail."
2012.12-236,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,502.661,503.594,I just want to make sure I heard you right.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,507.981,523.074,"--Well, what I was saying -- what I was saying in response to Justice Sotomayor's question is that if -- if it seems that that argument compels you to believe that it's jurisdictional, then the Court should reach the conclusion that it's jurisdictional rather than--"
2012.12-236,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,523.074,523.991,But your conclusion is that it is not jurisdictional.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,523.991,525.776,--We think -- we think that it is not.
2012.12-236,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.219,549.891,"So using Federal rules as your model, and Federal rules list statute of limitations as an affirmative defense."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,566.418,584.732,"Well, it seems to -- there is not anything in the compensation provision that says that it's an affirmative defense any more than -- in any way that's more explicit than what we're relying on to say that it's an affirmative defense to attorneys' fees."
2012.12-236,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.263,628.659,"Yes, one of -- one of your -- your argument you were making is that there -- since the attorneys' fees provision looks to the end of the case, it should not be construed to apply to the -- the failure to meet the filing deadline."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,652.09,661.648,--It -- it seems to us that the appropriate disposition of a case that is held to be untimely is that there is a judgment denying compensation.
2012.12-236,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.754,672.688,Other than the judgment.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,689.715,703.392,"Well, we think -- we agree that it's a judgment, but it -- but it has to be a judgment -- I'm looking here at page 26A of the appendix to the Government's brief -- refers to the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims on such a petition."
2012.12-236,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.011,707.694,Well--
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,707.694,708.546,--and so that's--
2012.12-236,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.546,709.129,--Okay.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,712.847,714.031,--Well -- I -- but I do think that--
2012.12-236,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.031,729.126,"That petition means -- means a petition properly filed; but I don't see that the -- that the statutory scheme, the provision that's at issue here, the provision for the award of attorneys' fees looks to the end of the case and not to the beginning."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,736.863,743.117,"--It's still a judgment, but it is -- it is not a judgment in connection with a petition that should be regarded as having been filed timely--"
2012.12-236,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,743.117,743.567,That's your first argument.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,743.969,744.352,--That is our first argument.
2012.12-236,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.834,769.351,"Well, wait."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,773.821,775.055,"It's clear that there's a waiver, but it's--"
2012.12-236,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.055,784.511,"And once we find that, I don't think we nit-pick the following language to unrealistically narrow it as much as possible."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,799.77,817.498,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- I think this Court's decision certainly most recently in the Cooper case from a term or two ago says that -- that this Court considers not only the existence but the extent of the waiver of sovereign immunity to be controlled by -- by canons that -- that counsel against extending -- extending that waiver."
2012.12-236,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,830.158,850.155,"Mr. Horwich, before you go to the consequences argument, just to keep on with the text a little bit, is this understanding that you have of what it means to be filed, does it have any consequences other than with respect to attorneys' fees, or is that the only thing that -- that depends on viewing the word “ filed ” in this way?"
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,850.155,869.283,"Well, I think viewing the word “ filed ” in this way also explains mechanically why the limitations issue becomes an affirmative defense on the merits as well, because Section 13 says compensation has to be awarded on a record, and the record is defined as the record on a petition filed."
2012.12-236,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,899.569,900.671,I totally lost that answer.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,900.671,901.188,--Sure.
2012.12-236,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,903.706,907.992,Could you -- could you go back and talk to me again about what you mean about not having a record?
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,907.992,908.358,Sure.
2012.12-236,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,957.674,959.376,I'm totally confused.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,968.565,984.742,"--What I'm -- what I'm suggesting is -- what I'm suggesting is that when the limitation -- when it's determined that the limitations provision applies and should have prevented the filing of the petition, and the Special Master has to decide, well, what are the consequences of that."
2012.12-236,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1003.386,1006.405,"Well, as to the consequences, let me give you these two cases."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1074.752,1075.985,"Well, there's several reasons."
2012.12-236,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1185.223,1185.873,Excuse me.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1269.21,1284.504,"--Well, the question under the attorneys' fee provision, and this is on 26(a) of the Government's brief, is a determination that the petition was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition was brought."
2012.12-236,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1290.658,1291.142,"Now, I understand."
2012.12-236,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1291.142,1312.172,"But now, look, still, the worst thing, the obvious question -- I mean, as a textual matter, but I don't know how you reconcile your position with the -- with the first words in 300aa-11, which is talking about a petition starts this whole proceeding and you want to interpret that word “ petition ” meaning a timely petition."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1325.665,1326.981,"--Yes, it is."
2012.12-236,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1326.981,1343.793,"Now, on that, Justice Sotomayor said, you only get into this problem when the attorney has filed this timeliness matter with a good reason to think his petition is timely, otherwise forget it."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1389.239,1395.076,What -- what we're worried about here is -- is not the fact that some fees may be paid.
2012.12-236,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1404.849,1405.867,"But that's in your control, the shadow trial."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1405.867,1406.65,Well--
2012.12-236,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1406.65,1408.919,You don't have to have a shadow trial if you don't want one.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1408.919,1415.723,"--Well, but -- but -- but, Your Honor, I think where we're coming -- where we're coming at this from is -- is saying what did Congress envision here."
2012.12-236,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1438.089,1440.105,Why not--
2012.12-236,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1440.105,1447.527,"The shadow trial brings up the answer that you were giving to the second part of Justice Alito's question, which you never got to finish."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1447.527,1448.56,--Yes.
2012.12-236,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1448.56,1455.633,"And you were saying -- you were giving the example, suppose this were a question of timeliness."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1455.633,1456.1,Yes.
2012.12-236,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1456.1,1466.822,"And when did the fact of the vaccine first -- or the symptoms first become manifest, and you were -- and you said that this should not be tried because -- and this is finishing off Justice--"
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1466.822,1467.358,Right.
2012.12-236,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1467.358,1468.391,--Justice Alito's dichotomy.
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1468.391,1469.224,Yes.
2012.12-236,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1515.172,1525.278,"--But there's a lot of information just in 11 -- what is it -- (c), tells what has to be put in the petition."
2012.12-236,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1534.216,1544.024,"Well, I think part of the problem is that we would be asking the Special Master to spend the Special Master's time reviewing that material, assuming that it's even in the petition, which is not always the case."
2012.12-236,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.522,1565.005,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,1571.691,1574.877,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-236,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.016,1647.807,"So if -- if you're preparing one of these filings, and you're all set to go, and on the day before your filing you say, oh, gosh, it doesn't look like we're going to be on time."
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,1661.483,1662.516,Right.
2012.12-236,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1706.112,1724.474,"My hypothetical was not that you had two days and you made it in time, but that before the -- the time -- after the time expired or you were ready to file on time, but then you decided on further research, oh, this isn't going to look like we're going to comply."
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,1730.394,1736.114,"I think that would depend -- if -- if you're late, you're late."
2012.12-236,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1771.871,1783.928,"So are you saying that the good faith and the reasonableness go to two things: One, the claim on the merits, and also the timeliness."
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,1783.928,1786.314,That is what we're saying.
2012.12-236,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1801.557,1804.609,So how do you answer the argument about a shadow trial?
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,1804.609,1810.18,--There's a number of arguments about -- about that subject.
2012.12-236,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1829.659,1831.643,How were the records accumulated and when?
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,1831.643,1832.478,--I'm sorry?
2012.12-236,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1832.478,1835.063,How were the records accumulated and when?
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,1835.063,1840.967,They are accumulated -- the system that's established is one of front-loading.
2012.12-236,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1932.727,1937.862,So is your bottom line that the record is already there for the shadow determination?
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,1937.862,1938.397,Sure.
2012.12-236,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1962.913,1971.686,"And if there is a hearing, would the claimant's attorney get -- potentially get attorneys' fees for the representation at the hearing about attorneys' fees?"
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,1971.686,1976.138,"Yes, the law is pretty clear that fees are available for time incurred on seeking fees."
2012.12-236,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1976.138,1997.253,"Do you think it would be within the discretion of the court or Special Master to look at a case and say, for whatever strange reason, this is a case where it's going to require some lengthy mini-trial in order to figure out fees and that's a bad use of everybody's time, so I'm not going to grant attorneys' fees here?"
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2007.442,2020.784,I think that might well be within a Special Master's discretion if it really is going -- if a fee determination really will require the sort of parade of horribles that the government sees.
2012.12-236,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2027.355,2034.692,You think the Special Master “ may ” award -- so it “ may ” award is discretionary.
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2034.692,2035.176,Correct.
2012.12-236,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2035.176,2038.913,"Well, that's a tough position, isn't it?"
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2046.25,2062.961,I don't know -- the -- no court and the parties have not briefed or addressed in this case the -- the extent to which the “ may ” discretion can be exercised in a procedural way that Justice Kagan's hypothetical proposes.
2012.12-236,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2076.788,2082.49,I thought you were -- I thought you were giving us that argument when you said under the fees all you need is reasonable and good faith.
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2082.49,2088.763,"Those are the requirements to be eligible for an award of fees, the statutory requirements for eligibility."
2012.12-236,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2096.6,2103.086,So is one reason that should affect the exercise of discretion is that you didn't comply with the statute of limitations?
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2103.086,2105.772,I think it might be.
2012.12-236,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2124.019,2124.836,"Well, let's take -- let's take this case."
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2147.551,2152.253,"The -- I will take the second part first, reasonableness of statute of limitations."
2012.12-236,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2217.862,2225.884,"They are arguing that they don't need to, and why should be -- why should they be put to the burden of doing that."
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2225.884,2232.955,The reason is you have to remember this is not ordinary civil litigation; it's a streamlined front-loaded process.
2012.12-236,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2253.619,2265.509,But the very fact that it's streamlined indicates to me that we should be very careful to enforce the policy of the rule which is to deter the filing of stale claims.
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2269.663,2283.756,"I think that you have to back up and acknowledge, as a starting point, that there's no question that Congress intended this program to award fees on petitions that have been denied."
2012.12-236,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2321.945,2327.183,Is the -- what's the relationship between your position and equitable tolling?
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2361.089,2373.497,The -- the -- I think that the best answer to that question is to look at the Federal Circuit -- Circuit's en banc ruling in Cloer I.
2012.12-236,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2389.923,2399.047,"I understand that, but I would assume the more typical case is when you miss a filing deadline is because the lawyer, whether for good reasons or bad, missed the filing deadline."
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2409.32,2418.343,--I think that would be a case-by-case determination as to whether the particular facts relied upon supported good faith and a reasonable basis.
2012.12-236,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2443.058,2456.568,"It does seem to me, I did not have the opportunity to ask the government this question, that the equitable tolling argument undercuts the government's position that no petition may be filed, as being an absolute."
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2460.77,2465.073,"They -- well, they fought the issue."
2012.12-236,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2465.073,2467.441,Or there can be equitable tolling in some cases.
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2467.441,2467.941,Sure.
2012.12-236,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2491.224,2510.518,"Mr. Fishman, this may be a hard question for you to answer, but is your sense of why it is that petitions are untimely filed that they usually have to do with things like, you know, snowstorms and lawyer error, or that they usually have to do with questions about the manifestation of symptoms?"
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2519.708,2524.028,My understanding from reading the case law is it's the latter.
2012.12-236,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2554.297,2569.307,"This may be a question that the Government is in a better position to answer, but do -- do you have any sense of how often claims are rejected on the ground of timeliness, what we're dealing with?"
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2592.006,2601.045,I can't imagine how it would even really put much of a dent in that government obligation.
2012.12-236,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2601.045,2603.064,Do you know how many cases we might be dealing with?
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2603.064,2603.764,I -- I don't.
2012.12-236,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2691.205,2693.338,Who pays for the Special Masters?
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2694.324,2694.84,It is.
2012.12-236,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2874.391,2876.274,Could I -- I have been thinking about your last point.
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2908.779,2910.231,I--
2012.12-236,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.231,2924.74,"I mean, I agree with you it's a terrible -- it's a terrible, outrageous thing for the Government to do, to win the case and get -- get stare decisis effect, and then to say you can't get lawyers' fees because there's never been a case, right?"
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2924.74,2925.29,--Right.
2012.12-236,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2930.728,2932.261,"We could make that up, couldn't we?"
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2932.261,2933.696,--I think that you probably could.
2012.12-236,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2933.696,2934.363,Sure.
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,2934.363,2946.154,"I think you probably could, but I think that the problem is you would then be, in essence, adopting a procedural rule though that endorses the inconsistency in the position."
2012.12-236,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3007.561,3010.68,You were going to address the shadow trial?
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,3010.68,3013.465,"Yeah, a couple -- a couple quick points."
2012.12-236,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3036.161,3039.413,Procedural grounds because the affidavits aren't sufficient or--
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,3039.413,3041.549,--Inadequate records is one reason.
2012.12-236,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3176.071,3184.427,--Are there regulations or rules establishing hourly rates?
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,3184.427,3186.81,There are not.
2012.12-236,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3186.81,3194.466,Do you have any idea from the cases what the ranges are?
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,3194.466,3195.666,For rates?
2012.12-236,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3195.666,3196.651,For rates.
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,3196.651,3199.619,It varies region by region.
2012.12-236,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3204.757,3210.125,"I know that civil rights rates, for example, are far below market rates for most law firms."
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,3212.661,3214.196,--Right.
2012.12-236,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3215.496,3216.731,Market rates for general litigation.
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,3216.731,3217.365,--Right.
2012.12-236,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3219.131,3219.767,Right.
2012.12-236,1,39245,robert_t_fishman,,3219.767,3222.969,"--but very often, it's not the rates that attorneys are actually paid."
2012.12-236,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3236.46,3237.228,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-236,2,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3239.311,3240.763,Thank you.
2012.12-236,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3242.98,3265.312,"Do you have some evidence -- numbers -- to tell us how complicated the fee award disputes are generally -- putting aside, because it hasn't until recently been an issue for cases dismissed -- but for other cases, particularly those dismissed on -- other procedural grounds."
2012.12-236,2,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3265.312,3267.331,"--Well, no, we don't."
2012.12-236,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3328.988,3331.588,But there have been dismissals on other procedural grounds.
2012.12-236,2,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3331.588,3335.475,"Well, there aren't -- there are not really other procedural grounds."
2012.12-236,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3422.831,3423.8,So your view here it's the same.
2012.12-236,2,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3437.191,3437.841,"--Well, in the case of--"
2012.12-236,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3437.841,3438.56,--do you think in some but not others?
2012.12-236,2,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3438.56,3438.96,"--Well, no."
2012.12-236,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3446.229,3446.646,"No, no, no, no."
2012.12-236,2,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3446.646,3454.635,"--if they want to -- if they want to withdraw the petition, I guess it depends on exactly the circumstances under which--"
2012.12-236,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3454.635,3456.087,"No, but my question is what is your view?"
2012.12-236,2,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3465.36,3483.654,"--Well, my view -- my view is the view that I think we would take under any fee shifting provision, which is that if a claimant wants to withdraw his or her case, I don't think that he can then claim the benefit of the attorneys' fee provision, absent some circumstances that -- that would warrant the finding of reasonable basis."
2012.12-236,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3485.723,3486.389,"Thank you, counsel."
