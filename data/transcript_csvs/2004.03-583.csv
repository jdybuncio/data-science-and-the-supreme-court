2004.03-583,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.229,"We'll hear argument now in No. 03-583, Josue Leocal v. John D. Ashcroft."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,14.368,18.454,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-583,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,65.804,90.9,"I guess what bothers me about this is that clause (b) of 18 U.S. Code, section 16 is... it says the crime of violence means any other offense that's a felony and, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,105.473,111.129,"--Justice O'Connor, there certainly is an increased risk of an accident."
2004.03-583,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,111.129,113.896,A substantial risk if a person is drunk.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,113.896,120.667,"Your Honor, I would agree that there is a substantial risk of an accident if one is driving drunk."
2004.03-583,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.667,126.528,So how is it that we should construe this provision in subsection (b)?
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,126.528,135.445,"Your Honor, subsection (b) also has the use of force as an element, and it is the use of force that is the critical terminology here."
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,135.445,141.389,"Well, before you quite get there... and of course, that's where you... you should go and I don't mean to sidetrack you."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,166.939,189.025,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I would... I would indicate that it's the categorical approach that this Court has indicated should be used in the Taylor case, as well as the courts of appeals have applied the categorical approach... indeed, the Doe case in the First Circuit did so... to look at whether or not that element is present in the underlying predicate of facts."
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.543,211.233,"Mr. Sollers, I thought your... your response to the problem of (b) was that (b) also requires not just... not just a risk that there be physical injury, but a substantial risk that physical force against person or property be used."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,232.288,233.486,Yes.
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,233.486,236.458,Or at least your... your proffered answer to the problem of (b).
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,236.458,237.367,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.346,260.029,"Well, once again, do you have to have intent in the particular case?"
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,273.404,280.835,"Your Honor, I think under the categorical approach, you look to the essential elements of the underlying offense."
2004.03-583,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,293.921,314.522,"Are you suggesting then that it should vary from State to State whether the vehicle homicide is a crime of violence, that we should look to the particular State, so that people engaged in the same conduct in one State will be subject to removal and others will not?"
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,314.522,322.611,"Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, there are a number... almost every State has a similar statute to the one in Florida."
2004.03-583,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.733,360.895,People who are drunk can intend to use force.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,360.895,361.909,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,377.968,379.454,What... what about burglary?
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,379.454,388.454,Burglary is an offense that has typically been looked at as a B offense.
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,422.634,425.978,What about the risk of the driver going the wrong way on a freeway?
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,425.978,428.29,That's absolutely--
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.29,432.915,"That's... that's a substantial risk, or it's a risk at least, of... of drunk driving."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,432.915,434.501,"--Absolutely, and so is--"
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,434.501,436.009,I don't see how that's different from burglary.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,436.009,443.977,"--I would suggest, Justice Kennedy, that it's different because it is not a intentional use of force."
2004.03-583,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,459.598,467.671,"Well, is your... is... is your argument really that there's got to be an intentional use of force or an intentional use of force in order to injure?"
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,467.671,480.674,Our argument is that there has to be simply the intentional use of force in order for it to be a crime of violence.
2004.03-583,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,480.674,487.445,"Without looking... without looking to the... to the consequence, to... to the... to the result?"
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,487.445,490.312,"Well, that's correct, Justice Souter."
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.312,491.782,He's intentionally driving a car--
2004.03-583,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,491.782,491.986,Yes.
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.986,494.215,--that's speeding along at 65 miles an hour.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,497.187,507.551,"Your Honor, I would suggest that it's intentionally driving the car, but I would not agree that it is the intentional use of force against a person or property of another."
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,507.551,509.037,What about 95 miles an hour?
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,509.037,518.119,"Your Honor, there's a continuum, and that may suggest recklessness, but again, this statute that we're looking at, the Florida statute, does not require recklessness."
2004.03-583,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.554,520.926,And you disagree--
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,520.926,521.919,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
2004.03-583,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.919,531.329,"--you disagree with Ninth Circuit that said negligence is not covered, but a reckless state of mind would be covered."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,531.329,540.245,"Your Honor, I'm not necessarily taking a position as to whether or not that's... the Ninth Circuit is accurate on that."
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.783,552.15,"Yes, but we have to look down the road to the next case."
2004.03-583,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,554.734,559.275,And you just responded to my question that it's the same in all 50 States.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,569.223,582.577,"The analysis that we believe is the correct analysis here is to look at the underlying statute to see whether it has use of force, and this statute has no such element."
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,609.802,612.857,And what about a drive-by shooting into an occupied building?
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,612.857,616.534,A drive-by shooting into an occupied building--
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,616.534,616.705,Right.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,623.526,624.369,--I--
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.369,626.87,You... you would say that the... is that covered by this statute?
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,627.713,629.199,"--Yes, Your Honor, absolutely."
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.199,629.671,--Why is it?
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,629.671,631.428,It's intentional use of force.
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.428,634.362,Against a person.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,653.885,659.542,"Your Honor, that is intentional conduct that has a substantial likelihood of... of causing injury."
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.542,662.059,So is... so is driving under the influence.
2004.03-583,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,662.969,671.635,I... I thought your argument was that there's got to be more than simply a risk of causing injury.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,686.868,687.694,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-583,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,687.694,694.67,"If it's causing... if it's... it's using force for the purpose of causing injury, then I can see at least a consistent argument."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,694.67,697.149,"Your Honor, you are absolutely correct."
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,702.805,705.527,--So you've changed your answer to my previous question then.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,705.527,708.816,"--I... I may have, and if I did, I... I apologize."
2004.03-583,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,710.181,713.646,"Well, so is recklessness enough or not?"
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,715.298,719.096,"--Your Honor, our... Justice O'Connor--"
2004.03-583,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,719.096,723.721,"The... the shooting, random shooting, in a building for target practice."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,723.721,727.558,--That is an intentional act.
2004.03-583,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,731.068,735.36,So is getting behind a wheel when you're drunk and turning on the keys.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,735.36,736.929,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-583,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,760.252,775.363,"I thought that what you were saying, which I understood, is that if somebody intentionally uses force and hurts somebody... might hurt somebody, that falls within the statute."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,813.423,817.677,"I accept that, Your Honor, Justice Breyer."
2004.03-583,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,817.677,820.399,"Yes, but what's your answer on recklessness?"
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,825.767,843.433,"Your Honor, this case is based on a... an underlying statute that has no mens rea requirement whatsoever, and a crime of violence requires an intentional use of force."
2004.03-583,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,858.832,859.204,You... you responded--
2004.03-583,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,859.204,860.484,Your answer might be recklessness.
2004.03-583,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,885.764,913.9,"--I thought you responded to Justice Breyer's first inquiry reckless, at least maybe, and if that was your answer, if I understood your... that you agreed with him, why isn't getting into a car when you are drunk inherently reckless because you know there's a high risk of hurting someone?"
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,913.9,925.871,"Your Honor, there is a continuum... there's no question about it... of mens rea, beginning... you know, you have the strict liability offense all the way to specific intent."
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,942.878,946.882,But... but that's because there's always a substantial risk.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,961.909,962.819,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,963.6,965.541,No substantial risk of use of force.
2004.03-583,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.541,967.937,May I ask this question about substantial risk?
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,984.45,991.797,"--Well, under this particular statute, it requires the causation of the injury, but it's simply a causation statute."
2004.03-583,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.425,1004.511,"So if there's... if there's clearly the substantial risk but he was lucky enough not to hit anybody, then he's not covered."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1004.511,1006.785,He'd be covered by a DUI--
2004.03-583,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.785,1008.271,"I understand, but he would not be covered--"
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1008.271,1008.521,--if he was caught.
2004.03-583,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1008.521,1010.955,--He would not be deportable.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1010.955,1013.451,Correct.
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1013.451,1018.014,But... but why when the statute says the offense by its nature includes the risk?
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1018.014,1020.986,Excuse me.
2004.03-583,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.267,1032.586,Whether or not you hit anybody?
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1032.586,1036.218,--You don't necessarily have to hit somebody.
2004.03-583,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1042.784,1042.938,"Well, excuse me."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1064.099,1064.553,--I believe that's right.
2004.03-583,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1064.553,1066.411,--but that's how I read the Florida statute.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1066.411,1067.525,"I believe that's right in Florida, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1110.007,1110.583,Mr. Sollers--
2004.03-583,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.583,1120.714,"If this were a straight criminal statute and the arguments on each side were very close, you would be entitled to rely on the rule of lenity."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1128.954,1130.812,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-583,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1153.74,1158.183,"No, but it's... it's never been regarded as criminal, a deportation proceeding."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1158.183,1167.721,"--That is not, but, of course, 18 U.S.C., section 16 is the criminal statute, and that is what we're here to decide, the reach of 18 U.S.C. 16."
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1167.721,1169.866,"--Well, it... it doesn't impose criminal penalties on its own."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1175.644,1176.116,Absolutely.
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1176.942,1177.159,Okay.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1188.998,1190.028,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1190.028,1196.65,Does the rule of lenity apply in sentencing statutes as opposed to the definition of crimes?
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1201.091,1202.744,I don't know the answer to that.
2004.03-583,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.202,1240.517,"Mr. Sollers, let... let me ask you about the recklessness problem that... that a number of us have."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1306.648,1311.849,"I understand your question, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-583,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1356.347,1371.868,"Just... just following up on Justice Scalia's question, the point would be that shooting a gun is the threatened use of... of physical force against a person or property."
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1376.243,1379.92,It's not the intentional use of any force.
2004.03-583,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1380.458,1390.406,"But why don't we interpret it as getting into a car while drunk and, as Justice O'Connor points out, while drunk and causing an injury?"
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1393.478,1400.065,"Well, certainly there is an enhanced risk from getting into the car while you're drunk."
2004.03-583,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1468.053,1485.021,The Government suggests that Congress in an excess of caution might have listed DUI because... because the decisions in the lower courts were divided on the question of the correct categorization.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1485.021,1486.136,That is--
2004.03-583,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1486.136,1489.479,And then it would do nothing... it would have changed nothing.
2004.03-583,0,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,1490.76,1497.447,"--Well, there is no legislative history that... to indicate that Congress so thought."
2004.03-583,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.37,1524.774,"Very well, Mr. Sollers."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1527.003,1535.881,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-583,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.637,1563.866,You say used against the person.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1567.127,1569.522,"We don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.03-583,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1589.295,1589.667,I... I have to tell you.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1605.149,1606.756,--Well--
2004.03-583,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1606.756,1609.729,Do you... do you tell your family I committed a crime of violence?
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1609.729,1615.673,"--There are a few things to be said about the simple offense of drunk driving, not the aggravated offense."
2004.03-583,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1616.666,1623.436,"And... and incidentally, because I thought your opening remarks were applicable to drunk driving as an offense generically and... and as a whole."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1623.436,1628.759,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, we have taken that position in the lower courts and before the Board of Immigration Appeals."
2004.03-583,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.477,1653.279,Yet the mental state is presumably the same whether it's drunken driving without injury or drunken driving with injury.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1653.279,1655.675,"That's true, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.03-583,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1658.026,1660.71,"I know you're not, but why... why don't you?"
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1660.71,1690.698,"Well, we think the... when I say that the Court need not agree with us that simple drunk driving is a crime of violence in order to hold that drunk driving resulting in serious injury is, I say that because if you take the view that physical force requires an actual crash, which is petitioner's view, which is the narrow understanding of the term physical force, it may or may not be the case... it is a debatable proposition... that if you're simply driving drunk, there's a substantial risk you're going to crash into somebody."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.429,1695.915,"Of course, it certainly would come within (a)."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1707.682,1715.317,"Well, Justice Scalia, we read threatened use and attempted use to require intentional conduct."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1715.939,1716.076,Oh.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1720.768,1721.073,--No.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.993,1738.146,"Well, then... then you... then you think (a) does not apply to ordinary DUI."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1738.146,1738.517,--That's right.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.593,1740.086,Oh.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1744.19,1746.485,We have taken that position in the lower courts.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.485,1747.245,But you don't believe it.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1747.683,1757.692,"We believe... our position in the lower courts is that it's a crime of violence under 16(b), but there are arguments... the argument the other way--"
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.692,1758.457,"Wait, wait, wait."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1761.308,1761.308,--That's right.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.308,1762.051,It's not a felony.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1763.166,1769.853,"If it's a misdemeanor, it couldn't be a crime of violence under (a) because force isn't an element and under (b) because it's not a felony."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1769.853,1770.225,Okay.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1770.225,1770.68,There are--
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1770.68,1773.818,That... that is your current position and... and we can take that.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1773.818,1774.207,--No.
2004.03-583,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1783.206,1787.376,Maybe... maybe we do and... and this depends on... on something I just don't know.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1795.262,1796.21,"Yes, there is."
2004.03-583,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1796.21,1807.084,"Then... then we do have to reach that issue because those would qualify as felonies, and on your analysis of (b), which doesn't require intent, they... they would... they would fall under (b)."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1807.084,1808.115,That's right.
2004.03-583,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1809.584,1810.965,I just want to make sure I understand it.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1826.468,1827.583,--That is our position.
2004.03-583,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1852.93,1854.621,And might be lucky and nothing happens.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1897.8,1900.606,"--We think it would be, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.64,1942.094,That's simply--
2004.03-583,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1942.094,1950.845,"Well, then... then the word substantial risk does no work in... in that... in the... in the case that Justice Ginsburg put."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1952.497,1954.893,"--No, we don't think you do, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-583,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1955.925,1957.327,Why do we need substantial risk?
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1959.268,1961.663,"--Well, here... here's the--"
2004.03-583,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1961.663,1967.524,"And the question is, what about her other hypothetical where the person is driving 90 miles an hour and hits no one?"
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1967.524,1968.928,"--Well, our--"
2004.03-583,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1968.928,1970.043,There's still a substantial risk.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1970.043,1982.84,"--our primary submission is that the crime at issue here falls under 16(a) because the use of force is an element because if you're driving drunk, you can't injure somebody without using force."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.547,2021.395,"--If your primary position is (a), then... then I think you're back to the... to the situation that ordinary DUI would come under (a)."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2025.36,2025.615,No.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.325,2038.663,I see.
2004.03-583,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2038.663,2049.675,"But in your submission, as I understand it, the attempted use or threatened use is really a worse offense than the use because it involves intent, whereas use doesn't necessarily involve actual intent."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2049.675,2053.473,"--Well, I don't... I don't think the measure of the seriousness of a crime--"
2004.03-583,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.473,2062.268,"What we're really looking at here, when you get all done with all this, is is this a person who should be sent back to Haiti because of this particular act that occurred."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2074.527,2078.447,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I think that's an important point."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2095.621,2096.159,What... what are they?
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2096.53,2101.194,"--Well, for example, simple misdemeanor assault would be a crime of violence under 16(a)."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.194,2102.02,"Well, of course."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2107.183,2117.586,"Well, that's right, Justice Scalia, but for example, reckless homicide, a depraved heart murder, which in most States is second degree murder, under petitioner's view of things--"
2004.03-583,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2117.586,2118.495,A depraved heart murder?
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2118.495,2119.815,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.03-583,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2119.815,2121.301,What sort of a murder is that?
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2121.301,2125.016,That's a... that's a... that's the... the... I think the common law term for reckless homicide.
2004.03-583,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2125.016,2128.36,A malignant and abandoned heart is what we learned in law school.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2128.593,2131.126,"I think that's... that's the same thing, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2136.039,2138.352,"That's why, I guess, reckless is a harder matter."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2206.462,2208.402,"Well, I think there are a couple of reasons why you're wrong."
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2248.405,2249.065,No.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2285.186,2292.411,"Well, insofar as the issue is whether Congress could have had this type of crime in mind, we think the answer is yes."
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2292.411,2293.459,"Yes, it could have."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2294.574,2298.251,"Well, let me... let me rephrase the question and the answer."
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2298.251,2298.994,I want your evidence that it did have.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2298.994,2304.499,"Insofar as the issue is whether Congress did have this type of crime of mind, we think the answer is yes."
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2304.499,2305.06,Because?
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2305.06,2318.517,"Because a... a... the classic example of a crime of violence, as you have just pointed out, is murder, and as I've said, reckless homicide is a form of murder."
2004.03-583,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.201,2340.332,May I ask you a question?
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2379.779,2387.292,"Well, we don't... we don't think it does, Justice Stevens, and... and that's even apart from the fact that the Congress that enacted that--"
2004.03-583,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2387.292,2387.664,Was different.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2388.201,2391.629,--statute was a different Congress from the one that enacted section 16.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.233,2411.812,I... I don't think your... your that was a different Congress argument carries much weight.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2423.041,2423.867,"Well, that--"
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2423.867,2430.76,And I think it... it is telling that this thing does seem to separate reckless driving from... from a crime of violence.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2430.76,2439.471,"--Well, that's the point I was just about to make, Justice Scalia, and we think it does separate the two, and there is no overlap."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2442.071,2445.621,Do you agree that... that the rule of lenity applies?
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2445.621,2455.159,"Well, it... it applies in the sense that if, at the very end of the interpretive process, the Court is left with a grievous doubt as to which way it should rule, yes."
2004.03-583,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2459.078,2471.81,"Would you say the same thing about... isn't there also a principle that in deportation statutes, ambiguities are to be construed in favor of the alien?"
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2471.81,2477.821,"Justice Ginsburg, there is, to be sure, language in this Court's decisions suggesting that."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.477,2486.57,"Well, what difference does it make if you concede the rule of lenity, which says the same thing?"
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2488.678,2490.285,"It... it doesn't, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.823,2491.294,--They're the same.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2491.294,2501.597,"--Our only point is that if... if the rule of lenity is to be applied here, we think that the basis for applying it is that we're dealing with a criminal statute, not that we're dealing with a criminal statute incorporated into the immigration laws."
2004.03-583,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2522.94,2526.117,You say the word violence doesn't.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2535.982,2538.294,"--That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.03-583,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2549.894,2551.752,What does actus reus mean?
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2551.752,2558.645,Actus reus means the actual criminal conduct as opposed to the defendant's state of mind when he's carrying out that conduct.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.217,2582.876,"You say if I bump into somebody getting off the bus, I've... I've committed, as far as actus reus is concerned, an act of violence."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2583.498,2585.317,"No, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.317,2586.265,"I say, excuse me, but--"
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2586.265,2588.123,We don't think so.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2588.745,2589.959,--I committed... committed an act of violence.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2592.747,2603.317,--Courts... courts have generally read use of physical force in section 16 to mean something more than force in a literal or a scientific sense.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.862,2615.122,"I bump into him really hard, really hard."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2621.067,2626.761,"--Well, of course, Justice Scalia, you would have to have a legislature criminalizing that conduct, and I think it's very unlikely--"
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2626.761,2627.67,I'm not talking about criminalizing.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2634.07,2634.525,--I--
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.525,2637.785,I don't care how hard I... I accidentally bumped into him.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2641.295,2653.655,"--Justice Scalia, if two outfielders are chasing after a fly ball and they crash into each other, the next day in the newspaper you may well read a headline that talks about a violent crash in the outfield during that game."
2004.03-583,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2668.699,2669.897,"No, no."
2004.03-583,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2669.897,2670.285,So you think it's standard--
2004.03-583,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2670.285,2672.043,You'd say it is a violent result.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.889,2681.375,It's a totally different meaning of violence.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2690.663,2693.802,"Well, I've been... I've been speaking of the thing that's being defined."
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2732.19,2740.009,"Why in the... in the House... in the Senate report on this bill, the example that they use for the first is an assault or a battery."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2746.968,2751.798,"Well, that... that wouldn't be a crime, of course, Justice Breyer."
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2751.798,2751.964,--No.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2752.541,2753.163,An assault--
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2753.163,2756.506,"I mean, it's pretty hard to assimilate your model to like an assault."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2756.506,2769.138,"--Well, the... our essential point is that legislatures define crimes with all sorts of mens rea, ranging from specific intent on one end of the spectrum to strict liability on the other."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.39,2790.042,What about negligent homicide?
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2806.556,2809.983,"I think... I think we would have to agree with that, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2809.983,2811.097,"Yes, I think you would, and boy, that's a--"
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.097,2815.638,So every driving accident is a crime of violence--
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2815.638,2817.003,"Well, no, Justice Breyer."
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2817.003,2818.322,--if there's negligence involved.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2818.322,2820.839,Most driving accidents aren't criminal at all.
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2821.582,2823.911,But any... any one that is criminal... let's see.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2830.87,2837.723,--I don't... I don't know that legislatures generally criminalize most car accidents.
2004.03-583,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2837.723,2839.043,And why isn't it if there's a traffic infraction involved?
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2845.997,2849.712,I don't... I don't think that would be a felony or even a misdemeanor.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.712,2850.167,--It doesn't have to be a felony.
2004.03-583,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2850.167,2850.455,It doesn't have to be--
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.455,2851.82,It just has to be an offense--
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2851.82,2852.192,I think--
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2852.192,2852.935,--certainly an offense.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2852.935,2856.361,--I think a traffic infraction probably would not be even a misdemeanor.
2004.03-583,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2861.645,2878.363,"--I don't know, and if you're going to... if you're... you're making an argument based on what the language read most broadly can accommodate, and if we're going to follow that criterion, then the... the reference to the... to the infraction in (a) is offense."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2890.502,2897.682,"Well, I'm... I'm not sure we are, Justice Souter, because a traffic infraction would not have as an element the use of force."
2004.03-583,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2904.164,2912.172,The offense you're... you're cited for is driving your car through the stop sign and you've just been telling us that... that using an automobile is inherently a use of force.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2914.379,2915.394,--No.
2004.03-583,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2923.899,2930.421,"Well, the offense you're cited for in Justice Scalia's hypo is negligent homicide, not going through a stop sign."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2930.421,2931.414,That's right.
2004.03-583,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2931.414,2935.212,"That's right, but you... you agree negligent homicide would... would be covered."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2935.212,2935.751,We do.
2004.03-583,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2967.906,2968.36,No.
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2974.843,2976.701,"--That's true, Justice Souter."
2004.03-583,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2977.072,2983.51,"He's making the... he's making the same argument that Justice Holmes said the dog understands, the difference between getting tripped over and kicked."
2004.03-583,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2991.949,2998.992,--I agree he's making an argument about the requirement of intent which he thinks the word use encompasses.
2004.03-583,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3054.47,3057.442,"Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb."
2004.03-583,2,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,3059.837,3064.751,Very briefly.
2004.03-583,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3105.823,3108.34,Or even injured I suppose.
2004.03-583,2,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,3108.34,3111.395,"Or even injured, quite possibly, yes, Your Honor, depending on how it's charged."
2004.03-583,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.181,3195.07,What other consequences besides deportation?
2004.03-583,2,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,3195.07,3203.615,"--Your Honor, there are... the statute is... 18 U.S.C., section 16 is subsumed in a number of different other statutes."
2004.03-583,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3203.615,3203.986,Such as.
2004.03-583,2,33069,joseph_s_sollersiii,,3203.986,3210.014,There... RICO actually subsumes crime of violence.
2004.03-583,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3252.905,3253.853,"Thank you, Mr. Sollers."
