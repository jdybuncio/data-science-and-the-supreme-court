1971.9_orig,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,710.81,723.252,"As I understand it, the record is closed or nearly closed and there will be then arguments and decision."
1971.9_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,799.792,801.702,What is the source of the --
1971.9_orig,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,801.702,805.048,The source of the funds is entirely royalty.
1971.9_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,805.048,806.229,That is not my question.
1971.9_orig,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,815.602,818.303,That is not an issue here Mr. Justice.
1971.9_orig,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,831.448,832.927,We can disregard that now.
1971.9_orig,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,832.927,834.955,You can disregard that now.
1971.9_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,870.043,876.555,"So I gather Mr. Solicitor General, if the government prevails, this does not exhaust that fund, does it?"
1971.9_orig,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,876.555,879.041,"No Mr. Judge, I was just about to state that."
1971.9_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,956.383,970.316,"And I gather 34 billion that you told us earlier had heretofore been turned over to Louisiana at the time the United States got a 190 million, are also out of the funds in the treasury of the United States?"
1971.9_orig,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,970.316,974.296,Those came from the funds in the treasury of United States.
1971.9_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1021.057,1025.421,Is there any argument Mr. Solicitor General about the form of the decree?
1971.9_orig,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1025.421,1028.01,I understand there is not Mr. Justice.
1971.9_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1072.015,1075.244,"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General."
1971.9_orig,1,43666,victor_a_sachse,,1076.776,1085.005,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.9_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1184.462,1202.911,"Mr. Sachse, I should advise you since you probably have not had a chance to see the order list this morning that the motion of the State of Louisiana under Rule 60 (b) Federal Civil Rules has been denied by the Court."
1971.9_orig,1,43666,victor_a_sachse,,1209.856,1234.024,Even so sir I believe that the reservoir equity which is in this Court and the fact that no final decree has been rendered in this case must mean that the matter is adjudged finally or there would not be this motion for a decree I think.
1971.9_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1284.372,1285.958,To whom --
1971.9_orig,1,43666,victor_a_sachse,,1285.958,1286.631,Sir?
1971.9_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1286.631,1290.0,To whom could that interest be appropriately be paid?
1971.9_orig,1,43666,victor_a_sachse,,1290.0,1292.46,"No one, no one."
1971.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2636.269,2646.257,I am not sure Mr. Sachse that I understand why this so called newly discovered evidence is before Mr. Armstrong.
1971.9_orig,1,43666,victor_a_sachse,,2678.239,2680.096,Right and we have been asking to.
1971.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2713.011,2713.579,Under the record.
1971.9_orig,1,43666,victor_a_sachse,,2713.579,2726.521,"Under the record, but we said the Supreme Court has retained jurisdiction, the Supreme Court is entertaining motions concerning the Atlantic coast states."
1971.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2761.654,2774.343,What have you asked Mr. Armstrong -- how have you asked Mr. Armstrong to rule with respect to this documentary material which you say he is now considering in camera?
1971.9_orig,1,43666,victor_a_sachse,,2774.343,2775.376,"What, we do not know what --"
1971.9_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2775.376,2779.208,"And what issue, what issue, what is he considering?"
1971.9_orig,1,43666,victor_a_sachse,,2779.208,2786.947,"What we hope we will develop is the thing that you reserve to us, I say you because you speak for the Court."
1971.9_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2970.321,2973.295,Thank you Mr. Sachse.
1971.9_orig,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2974.338,2976.468,No.
1971.9_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2976.468,2977.045,Thank you gentlemen.
