1991.90-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.258,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-1918, Kraft General Foods v. Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance."
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,14.392,17.474,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.665,167.14,"Well, Mr. Libin, now I take it that under the Federal Income Tax Code that there is a foreign tax credit and these dividends, if taxed in the foreign country, then a credit is given on the Federal income tax, dollar for dollar."
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,167.14,168.76,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1991.90-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.76,176.237,"And you think that the state has to provide a second dollar of credit, is that it?"
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,176.237,177.947,"No, we do not request that."
1991.90-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.809,195.107,Exactly.
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,211.19,231.372,"It certainly has the power to tax foreign subsidiary dividends without a credit, Justice O'Connor, but what we believe is clearly correct under this Court's decisions is that it does not have the power to single out those dividends for taxation vis-a-vis all other kinds of dividends, because they're, that is discrimination under the Foreign Commerce Clause."
1991.90-1918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.474,261.923,"Well, the state just wants to piggy-back on the Federal income tax law, a perfectly reasonable desire on the part of the state, and many states do the same thing, don't they?"
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,261.923,263.433,Many states do the same thing.
1991.90-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,278.082,291.312,"Mr. Libin, a minute ago you said you can't tax dividends from foreign commerce versus dividends from domestic commerce, but that's one... it isn't necessarily dividends from foreign commerce."
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,301.019,321.82,"Under the statutory scheme, Justice Scalia, if a foreign subsidiary does business in the United States dividends paid by it to its parent company will receive an offsetting deduction to reflect that domestic content, so that there is symmetry with respect to that situation and other domestic corporations."
1991.90-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.82,325.493,"What if, what if a domestic corporation does foreign business?"
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,325.493,342.196,"If a domestic corporation does foreign business, then under the Federal scheme, because it is a domestic corporation, it is engaged partly domestic, partly foreign commerce in that setting, its dividends are, receive the benefit of the deduction because of the domestic content again."
1991.90-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.763,359.387,"Now, I wish to understand this, and correct me if I'm wrong."
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,375.716,378.338,"Not a deduction for the dividends, Justice Kennedy."
1991.90-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.772,390.776,And is that the same both for Federal and Iowa law?
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,390.776,406.227,"Iowa allows that deduction if you elect to take a deduction for withholding taxes rather than a credit for the full amount of foreign taxes paid, namely both withholding tax and tax on the earnings of the subsidiary that paid the dividends."
1991.90-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.227,408.728,I want to be sure that I follow.
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,411.109,411.87,Yes.
1991.90-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.87,419.975,--can you deduct the same amount or a greater amount or a lesser amount under state law?
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,419.975,421.227,Same amount.
1991.90-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,421.227,423.618,That you can deduct--
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,423.618,424.449,Same amount.
1991.90-1918,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.109,435.475,"--So in one sense, then, for some taxpayers at least, there is no discrimination?"
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,435.475,445.741,"No, there will always be discrimination because the deduction for withholding taxes will not equal the full amount of the dividend by any means, it's just the tax piece."
1991.90-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,470.327,470.718,Right.
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,470.718,471.649,That's all you deduct.
1991.90-1918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.322,477.103,But overall--
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,477.794,478.232,Not a credit.
1991.90-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.816,492.394,"--Overall, Mr. Libin, your foreign subsidiary isn't treated any worse than a domestic corporation in Iowa, is it?"
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,492.394,499.587,"Yes, it is, Justice Rehnquist, because the dividends that it pays to its parent in Iowa are taxed in Iowa."
1991.90-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,503.18,510.843,"Yeah, but it's the domestic... I'm talking, not talking about a domestic, how about just an... okay, a domestic subsidiary."
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,512.385,518.389,"It's income is taxed in Iowa, that's correct, but that's a totally different tax on a totally different entity for a totally different--"
1991.90-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,518.389,525.884,"Well, but we don't necessarily weigh these things, put them into numerous sub-classes and sub-compartments."
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,532.208,534.419,"--Well, we don't believe that's quite the test, Your Honor."
1991.90-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,541.434,552.02,"Well, supposing you apply my test, which you may be right, maybe it's not the right one, but generally it doesn't favor foreign corporations over Iowa corporations, does it?"
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,552.02,564.338,"Well, we think it does even there if we applied your test, Mr. Chief Justice, because under the Armco analysis it would be appropriate to look at the fact that Iowa's tax on earnings would be applied by other jurisdictions as well."
1991.90-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,581.502,585.654,And the foreign sub has paid a tax on its earnings abroad?
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,585.654,587.046,"--Yes, correct, Justice White."
1991.90-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,587.046,592.107,As well as withheld on the dividends paid?
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,592.107,593.898,"On the dividend itself, correct, as the record shows in this case."
1991.90-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.297,651.807,"What about a foreign sub that does business only in the foreign country, doesn't ship any products or anything, nothing that it does crosses any international boundary."
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,660.243,661.632,"Yes we would, Justice White, exactly right."
1991.90-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,666.427,668.518,Or the capital investment in the first place.
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,668.518,671.951,"--Correct, the formation of the subsidiary in the first place, exactly."
1991.90-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.816,742.356,Why?
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,743.027,747.228,"--Well, number one, we're not clear on exactly how it works, frankly."
1991.90-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,799.093,804.637,"Well, don't all tax laws pressure you to operate one way or another?"
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,804.637,811.78,"Well, they give you choices, obviously, in the original structure of your operations."
1991.90-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.103,822.969,"Well, what case of ours is it that you think says that if a tax law tends to push you one way or another it violates the Commerce Clause?"
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,822.969,834.797,"Well, I think we have seen in the Halliburton case, for example, where there was a use tax imposed for property bought or manufactured or self-constructed outside of Louisiana and brought into Louisiana."
1991.90-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,847.323,849.236,You think that case is still good law?
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,849.236,857.901,"--Well, I think its basic concepts have been followed and applied in cases like Boston Stock Exchange where this same issue was raised."
1991.90-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,895.626,904.201,But the basic decision of a state to levy a tax at all certainly pushes the corporation one way or the other.
1991.90-1918,0,31394,jerome_b_libin,,904.201,904.952,It certainly does.
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,1537.417,1547.192,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.635,1641.915,"May I interrupt with just... recalling the dialogue with Justice White by your opponent, what about the suggestion that the very transaction, the dividend transaction itself is in foreign commerce, the payment by a foreign subsidiary to a domestic parent?"
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,1645.237,1651.101,I don't believe the State of Iowa has ever argued that that is not part of commerce.
1991.90-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1667.661,1685.974,"I'm not sure that's responsive to, if I understood Justice White's question at any rate, of the concern that the flow of money across national boundaries in these dividends is taxed differently than a similar flow of money within the United States, and therefore there's a discrimination, at least a differential treatment between domestic and foreign."
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,1685.974,1689.727,"Well, there obviously is a differential treatment between domestic and foreign dividends."
1991.90-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.399,1693.779,And ergo between domestic and foreign commerce.
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,1693.779,1696.881,"--No, we don't believe that that follows."
1991.90-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1696.881,1700.754,"But if the dividend is itself a transaction in commerce, why is that not so?"
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,1700.754,1717.216,Because we believe that it's not proper to focus solely on the Internal Revenue Code and therefore the Iowa treatment of dividends without looking beyond dividends to the income of the entire unitary business that is being taxed.
1991.90-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.247,1806.181,"But your opponent's point is you're not taxing the foreign subsidiary, you're taxing, you're taxing the parent."
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,1814.906,1825.534,"--Well, Kraft has stipulated that these dividends are paid by unitary, that it's part of their unitary income, that they are paid by unitary payors."
1991.90-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1911.25,1922.838,"Ms. Mason, do you defend the rationale of the Iowa Supreme Court in the test it employed to sustain the tax scheme?"
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,1922.838,1926.261,We believe that the Iowa Supreme Court was correct.
1991.90-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1926.261,1939.838,"In focusing on whether the statute benefits in-state business, you think that's the correct focus and test for a challenge under the Foreign Commerce Clause?"
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,1939.838,1947.783,"I believe the Iowa Supreme Court was correct because the Iowa income tax has, there's nothing, there's no local in-state bias about it."
1991.90-1918,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1951.066,1960.062,"Well, I would have thought that isn't the test that we would employ in, when the challenge is to foreign commerce."
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,1974.601,2000.329,Of course in this particular case the specific issue of whether a lack of a benefit to local commercial interest is alone sufficient to satisfy the discrimination problem does not really have to be decided because Iowa's position is that this is not discriminating against foreign commerce in favor of either doing Iowa business or doing business within the United States through a domestic subsidiary.
1991.90-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.95,2004.421,"Well, that isn't the rationale of the Iowa Supreme Court."
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2004.421,2005.592,--Correct.
1991.90-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.563,2029.348,"Well, what if we thought the Iowa rationale, Iowa Supreme Court's rationale was not the right one?"
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2038.875,2043.978,I don't believe that Iowa is arguing a completely new standard.
1991.90-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.217,2046.77,"Well, completely or not, it's new."
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2046.77,2052.112,--Iowa did argue to the Iowa Supreme Court that if you look at the overall burden of the unitary business--
1991.90-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.112,2054.342,"You may have argued it, but that isn't what they said."
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2054.342,2064.641,"--Well, certainly this Court could, if it wanted to, could remand this to the Iowa Supreme Court and have them decide it under what this Court says is the proper standard."
1991.90-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.81,2357.552,"May I go... excuse me, go ahead."
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2376.743,2379.866,--I'm not sure if that's really in the record.
1991.90-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2383.238,2383.589,Within the country.
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2397.628,2401.231,"No, it's definitely not would be our position."
1991.90-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.428,2417.22,"But, and the record doesn't really tell us, then, whether these companies are engaged in foreign commerce or not, if you've answered my first question correctly."
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2420.753,2430.899,"Well, since they're challenging the statute on its face, I guess it doesn't really matter now."
1991.90-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2455.157,2459.778,We don't ordinarily decide hypothetical cases.
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2459.778,2460.659,Right.
1991.90-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2466.683,2473.426,Do you concede that the payment of the dividend at least is foreign commerce?
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2473.426,2476.358,--We've never argued that it's not.
1991.90-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.956,2497.153,"Well, don't you think it would be discrimination against foreign commerce if you taxed only dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries and no dividends paid by domestic subsidiaries?"
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2499.864,2504.378,"Well, you'd have to look at what happens to the underlying earnings."
1991.90-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2507.05,2508.81,I don't care what happens to the underlying earnings.
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2520.637,2526.321,--We're not basing it on... I was not basing it on where it comes from.
1991.90-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2536.949,2540.381,But all the dividends here at issue are coming from abroad.
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2544.853,2545.574,Yes.
1991.90-1918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.574,2547.965,That seems to me foreign commerce.
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2547.965,2564.598,"That may be foreign commerce, but the point that the State of Iowa is making is that so also is then the dividends that are coming over from domestic subsidiaries, and those dividends coming over from domestic subsidiaries are deductible."
1991.90-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.598,2588.612,"Well, what if you, what if Iowa just taxed dividends from corporations organized and doing business in another state and didn't tax any, any other dividends?"
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2597.249,2601.662,I believe in that case that it probably would.
1991.90-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.211,2623.806,May I ask one other question that may be in the papers and I just don't know it.
1991.90-1918,1,36282,marcia_mason,,2639.716,2644.18,"I think, if I understand you, you're asking if we would allow like a combined--"
1991.90-1918,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2751.128,2758.044,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2822.174,2832.222,This is on the assumption that you're just free to ignore the tax placed on foreign subsidiaries by the foreign state?
1991.90-1918,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2832.222,2840.167,"No, sir, that is in fact the only issue of substance left to discuss, and I agree, and that's what I want to discuss now."
1991.90-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.167,2841.088,So you're not ignoring it?
1991.90-1918,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2841.088,2842.22,I'm not going to ignore it.
1991.90-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2842.22,2843.309,You're just about to--
1991.90-1918,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2843.309,2845.332,I'm just about to launch into it.
1991.90-1918,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2845.332,2852.375,"--Before you do, when you say it's less inclusive, it's less inclusive in terms of computing the gross income."
1991.90-1918,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2862.982,2872.537,"I don't believe that is a correct characterization of Iowa's apportionment method, but I can tell you for certain that Iowa's apportionment method is not challenged in this case."
1991.90-1918,3,31394,jerome_b_libin,,3372.277,3374.047,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1918,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3423.729,3427.933,But they do include all earned income of the subsidiary.
