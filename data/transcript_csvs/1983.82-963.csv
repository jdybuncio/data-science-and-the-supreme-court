1983.82-963,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.096,We'll hear arguments next in Massachusetts against Sheppard.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,62.33,65.342,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.122,561.984,"Listed where, in the affidavit?"
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,561.984,563.173,In the affidavit.
1983.82-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,590.091,593.263,"Was this person, Miss Smith, a real judge?"
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,593.263,595.084,"--Yes, he was a real judge."
1983.82-963,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,595.084,604.028,"In Massachusetts, Miss Smith, what is the rule with respect to the action of a judicial officer."
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,613.695,616.227,That is the position in Massachusetts.
1983.82-963,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,616.227,624.094,"So when this warrant was served, executed it had the benefit of the presumption of validity."
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,624.094,625.684,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-963,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,625.684,631.938,"Miss Smith, what would have been, if they had been successful, the real form?"
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,631.938,633.578,We would not be here.
1983.82-963,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,633.578,634.309,I know.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,637.842,648.858,"The proper form has a space in which you fill in the items listed in the affidavit or make a simple notation,"
1983.82-963,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,655.333,659.765,Is that the only distinction between the form actually used and the real one?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,659.765,668.701,This form used here has printed in reference to controlled substances in the aspect of the form--
1983.82-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.701,675.737,"In the body of the warrant those items were not listed, the items to be searched for and seized."
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,675.737,676.508,--That is right.
1983.82-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,676.508,678.459,Nor was the affidavit attached to the--
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,678.459,680.211,The affidavit was not attached.
1983.82-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.896,691.818,--So the warrant really was defective?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,691.818,699.111,"Yes, as far as the items reflecting the specific items specified in the affidavit."
1983.82-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.111,708.137,"If you presented it to the owner of the premises to be searched and he said, ""What are you searching for""?"
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,712.281,719.455,Officer O'Malley could tell that because he was the one who applied for it and specified the items to be searched.
1983.82-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,719.455,727.781,But the owner of the premises presumably could not tell what items a search had been authorized for.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,727.781,728.31,That is right.
1983.82-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,740.589,744.462,"Miss Smith, is it not correct that when they executed the warrant they had the affidavit with them?"
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,744.462,745.401,"--Yes, they did."
1983.82-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,745.401,749.445,So they could have showed them the affidavit which would then have given them a bill of particulars.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,749.445,750.797,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1983.82-963,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,750.797,762.785,"If I understand it, all that the judge had to do was simply in that space that said ""controlled substances"" was strike it out and put in ""see attached affidavit""?"
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,762.785,764.145,That is right.
1983.82-963,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,766.256,769.026,It would have made a perfect warrant then.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,769.026,776.793,"That would have made a perfect warrant, but as the court found through total inadvertence the judge failed to do that in the rush."
1983.82-963,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,776.793,777.574,He was a real judge.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,777.574,779.064,He was a judge.
1983.82-963,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,789.181,792.034,I was just going to observe he was not a member of this court.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,792.464,795.156,"No, he was not."
1983.82-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,875.636,882.512,"Miss Smith, did the police have an obligation to execute the warrant as it's written?"
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,882.512,884.543,"--I believe they do, Your Honor."
1983.82-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,887.264,898.022,"So that is in a sense some kind of an error that occurred when the police did not read it and say, look, that is not what is listed in the warrant."
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,898.022,899.251,"--Your Honor, I--"
1983.82-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,899.251,906.708,I guess if the police had read it at the time the magistrate or judge could have corrected it.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,906.708,908.037,--Yes.
1983.82-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,911.29,913.012,"Well, theme is no doubt that he would have, is there?"
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,913.012,915.905,--I would hope that he would have.
1983.82-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,922.099,930.333,"Of course, if you are a policeman the chance that you may feel who am I to tell the judge what form of warrant to use--"
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,930.333,930.983,Absolutely.
1983.82-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,952.159,958.34,--You think the police have no obligation whatever to comply with what is written on the fact of the warrant?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,958.34,961.402,"I am not saying that, Your Honor."
1983.82-963,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,975.343,988.02,"Well, if, as you told us, the law of Massachusetts is that the warrant is presumptively valid once signed then it is valid on the instant it was served."
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,988.02,989.221,That is right.
1983.82-963,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,999.798,1006.353,"Yes, but, Miss Smith, it is presumptively valid to seize what the warrant says may be seized, is it not?"
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1006.353,1008.674,"Yes, Your Honor, and the--"
1983.82-963,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1008.674,1015.008,Is it presumptively valid to seize something that is not listed in the warrant?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1015.008,1023.245,"--Not once that is determined after the fact, but the police do not wait until another court has reviewed the warrant."
1983.82-963,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1026.565,1032.019,But this warrant did not authorize them to seize the matters listed in the--
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1032.019,1033.05,--Affidavit.
1983.82-963,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1035.622,1036.573,--But they thought it did.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1036.573,1038.115,They thought it did absolutely.
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1044.247,1047.349,Did they show the person the affidavit?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1047.349,1048.46,"--No, they did not."
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1052.764,1055.413,What weight does that have?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1055.413,1058.565,I do not think it really has any weight.
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1069.584,1075.669,Isn't one of the base reasons for the affidavit to show somebody authority?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1075.669,1080.661,They had authority to enter these premises.
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1080.661,1083.153,What authority did they have?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1086.165,1089.247,The authority in the warrant placed them on the premises.
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1089.247,1091.909,Weren't they obliged to show the warrant?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1091.909,1094.001,If someone had asked to see it.
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1109.129,1111.641,The policemen were armed?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1111.641,1112.402,I'm sorry?
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1112.402,1114.513,The policemen had weapons?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1117.046,1120.219,I would imagine police officers would not go on a search without a weapon.
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1120.219,1120.796,That is right.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1120.796,1122.679,"Did they have drawn weapons, I would say no."
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1122.679,1126.871,"Well, could they be admitted because of the weapon or because of the warrant?"
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1128.794,1138.457,There is absolutely nothing in the record to support even speculation that they were admitted because they were waiving weapons at the people.
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1139.929,1140.54,Isn't that the reason for having the warrant?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1140.54,1141.871,They have a warrant.
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1141.871,1143.523,I mean they show it.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1143.523,1151.127,"They said, we have a warrant, which in fact is true, and that was enough for the people on the premises."
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1157.051,1159.262,They had a presumptively valid warrant.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1160.714,1163.736,Did the police say the had a presumptively valid warrant?
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1164.565,1165.717,"No, they said we have a warrant."
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1165.717,1175.082,"We have a warrant, which they had, which was later, later determined to be found defective because of the omission by the issuing judge."
1983.82-963,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1175.082,1186.55,Was there any requirement by statute under Massachusetts law that the officer show the warrant without a request?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1186.55,1189.783,"Not that I know of, Your Honor."
1983.82-963,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.004,1193.376,But if requested what would be the normal practice?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1193.376,1197.066,"--I think the normal practice would be for the police to go on the premises, say,"
1983.82-963,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1205.454,1211.168,Under the Massachusetts law they are not required to deliver the warrant or a copy of it?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1211.168,1212.177,No.
1983.82-963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1212.177,1215.278,Or to show it.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1215.278,1217.652,No.
1983.82-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1217.652,1224.794,"Miss Smith, there is no question, I guess, that the police were acting with subjective good faith here."
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1247.299,1253.864,"I cannot give you an absolute blanket answer to a question like that, Your Honor."
1983.82-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.827,1321.297,May I ask you a question here?
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1338.31,1369.17,"In my opinion if and only if this Court were to extend its holding in Gates where the Court announced a totality of the circumstances test for determining the probable cause aspect, if you were to extend that to determining the reasonableness of a search in this instance, I think, yes, we would have a reasonable search because the police complied with the warrant process."
1983.82-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1398.097,1404.422,If you are right on that that there is a reasonable search here then there is no need to reach a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1404.422,1408.445,--If the Court is going to extend Gates considered under a--
1983.82-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1408.445,1412.249,"Well, Gates really dealt with what kind of showing of probable cause is necessary."
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1412.249,1413.007,--That is right.
1983.82-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1413.007,1416.53,Here there is admittedly probable cause and there is also admittedly a defect in the warrant.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1416.53,1417.291,Absolutely.
1983.82-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.291,1420.072,The ultimate holding in Gates was that the warrant was okay.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1420.072,1421.402,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1421.402,1422.413,So it is a little bit different.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1422.413,1423.335,It is different.
1983.82-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.021,1438.766,I did not necessarily mean to say without the warrant.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1442.997,1443.678,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1983.82-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.54,1508.17,I suppose in answering Justice Stevens I suppose if you just said any time an officer makes a reasonable mistake there is no violation of the Fourth Amendment because it is a reasonable search.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1511.492,1512.892,We would.
1983.82-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1512.892,1518.348,Except then you hold that there has been no violation of the Fourth Amendment at all.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1518.348,1527.434,"Well, the Fourth Amendment only precludes unreasonable searches so if the search is found to be reasonable with or without a warrant--"
1983.82-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.434,1532.086,"No, but usually in searching a house you need a warrant."
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1532.086,1535.379,--I believe all of the case law says that ordinarily.
1983.82-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1548.676,1557.171,So you are saying any time it is reasonable for an officer to believe that he has complied with a warrant requirement there is no violation of the Fourth Amendment.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1557.171,1559.715,I do not think that quite--
1983.82-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.715,1562.797,But that was your submission to Justice Stevens.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1566.718,1568.959,"--Yes, Your Honor, but--"
1983.82-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1568.959,1570.351,Because they had the affidavit.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1570.351,1571.642,--They had the affidavit.
1983.82-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.383,1580.498,The only trouble was that the two pieces of paper were not put together.
1983.82-963,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1580.498,1583.74,Yes.
1983.82-963,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1734.448,1743.144,"Mr. Reinstein, let me ask you a question right at the outset if I may."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,1763.93,1803.305,"The key, I think, is the sufficiency of the words of incorporation whether on the face of the warrant there is an indication by the magistrate that he or she intended to adopt the language of another document so that if there is sufficient words of description in the warrant itself sufficient to identify either by saying ""see attached"" and the document is attached or ""see a document"" and describes the document by date and author, then I believe that that would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the particularity requirement."
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1803.305,1808.907,But without that cross reference the warrant would be invalid you say?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,1808.907,1809.859,That is right.
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1809.859,1818.364,Do you agree with your friend that the law of Massachusetts gives presumptive validity to that warrant?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,1818.364,1821.356,I do not agree with Miss Smith--
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1821.356,1824.148,"It is not presumptively valid, the act of a judge?"
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,1824.148,1838.027,--I believe that it is clear that a police officer may not treat as presumptively valid a document which he knows--
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1838.027,1840.531,Forget about the police officer.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,1851.868,1854.45,--As a general proposition that would be true.
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.45,1860.653,"So this warrant would fall within that rule, would it not?"
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,1860.653,1861.354,"No, it would not."
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.354,1862.534,Why not?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,1862.534,1870.548,"The police officer in this case, Detective O'Malley, who knew from the very outset what this investigation was about."
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1877.924,1883.818,I thought you conceded that if a clip like this or anything like it had attached the two together it would be all right.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,1883.818,1885.328,"No, not a clip alone."
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1909.564,1912.866,"If the words were ""see affidavit attached""?"
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,1912.866,1920.974,"If the words were ""see affidavit attached"" and the affidavit were attached I believe that that would be sufficient."
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1920.974,1924.858,Thank you.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,1924.858,1935.315,"I would like to respond at the outset to the description of some of the facts, which counsel for the State has described in her presentation."
1983.82-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2303.565,2312.922,"Counsel, I was just looking at the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts at page 49a in the joint appendix."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2325.851,2333.976,--The findings of the trial court are contained--
1983.82-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2333.976,2337.779,Was Justice Wilkens simply mistaken then in making that observation?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2337.779,2352.85,"--I think that that slightly overstates the extent of the findings, and in some respects I think the findings of the trial court go well beyond the testimony that was actually given in the Superior Court."
1983.82-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2397.038,2409.504,We do not ordinarily take a case to review a question of whether or not there was probable cause when the lower courts have made a finding either that there was or was not.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2409.504,2418.46,"Well, in this instance the finding of probable cause invariably is first made by the magistrate."
1983.82-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2439.605,2445.879,"When you are talking about probable cause you are always talking about after-the-fact reconstruction, are you not?"
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2450.752,2458.468,"But the preliminary decision is made before the fact, before the search is actually carried out by the magistrate."
1983.82-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2464.593,2465.942,"But that is always ex parte, is it not?"
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2465.942,2468.025,Invariably that is ex parte.
1983.82-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2468.025,2480.463,"There is no doubt, is there really, that the magistrate if he had noticed the error at the time would have corrected it and authorized the search for the items listed in the affidavit?"
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2480.463,2480.572,That is certainly a possibility.
1983.82-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2481.093,2482.524,"Well, it is much more than a possibility."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2492.381,2494.061,--Authorized a search.
1983.82-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2503.478,2507.679,We are not here to argue about the rule in Shelley's case or something that goes back to Chittie in pleading.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2519.778,2523.38,"Yes, we can assume the judge looked at the affidavit."
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2523.38,2529.925,Then he knew at least what kind of a search he was authorizing.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2529.925,2540.251,We can assume that the judge knew generally not only what kind of a search was authorized but what it was that the police had found thus far.
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2542.121,2548.516,"Counsel, before you go on."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2553.691,2558.062,I believe there are several ways of looking at the prejudice.
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2560.524,2563.244,Let me ask a follow up with this question.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2576.505,2578.715,--I do not believe it would have.
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2578.715,2579.907,You doubt that it would?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2579.907,2581.908,I do not believe that it would have.
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2581.908,2602.272,"So in what way was that prejudice, actual prejudice, apart from the theoretical argument that we are addressing here today and that is whether any technical violation of the warrant procedure requires exclusion of obviously probative evidence?"
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2602.272,2605.353,I do not think that this is a technical violation.
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2605.353,2610.556,"You would agree it was inadvertent, would you not?"
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2610.556,2614.489,It was careless.
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2614.489,2618.233,You are not suggesting that the judge deliberately omitted--
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2618.233,2619.314,"No, I am not suggesting that."
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2619.314,2619.612,--Right.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2619.612,2633.213,The requirement in the Fourth Amendment that a warrant particularly describe the items to be seized serves a number of important functions.
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2677.211,2679.723,Did they ask to look at the warrant?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2679.723,2682.044,--The police officer testified that it was showed to them.
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2682.044,2685.036,Did he ask?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2690.538,2695.173,The record does not show whether anyone read it.
1983.82-963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2711.883,2714.345,"Well, you find facts in the findings."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2718.168,2725.912,--There is nothing in the record which suggests they presumably read it.
1983.82-963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2730.085,2731.357,That is all?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2731.357,2732.386,That is all.
1983.82-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2815.741,2818.774,"Mr. Reinstein, let me go back just a minute."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2870.005,2871.017,"No, I did not say there was a finding."
1983.82-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2872.998,2880.624,"Well, this finding certainly does not support any conclusion that the detective showed the warrant."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,2880.624,2882.264,That is correct.
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3009.637,3016.682,You have been advancing the familiar arguments in favor of the strict exclusionary rule.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3062.283,3072.501,"I agree that if the search warrant had been precisely as applied for then the search that was conducted would have, in fact, been fine."
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3072.501,3073.14,Right.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3079.983,3090.201,There is a second consideration in dealing with the application of the exclusionary rule in this particular case.
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3140.695,3163.96,"The trial judge made a finding here or made a reference, not a finding, a reference to the law of Massachusetts saying a search warrant may be read with the complaint where it is attached to the warrant to provide sufficiency of the description of the place to be searched."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3178.529,3182.871,That is right so long as there was sufficient description there to incorporate it.
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3186.143,3191.228,Absent a staple or clip or a reference it falls?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3191.228,3193.89,--It is the reference which is the key point.
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3195.36,3199.103,This statement of the law of Massachusetts does not say anything about the reference.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3199.103,3200.903,"No, I do not believe that--"
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3200.903,3211.16,"A search warrant, said the judge, may be read with the complaint, that is, here the affidavit, where it is attached to the warrant."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3211.16,3213.261,--That is correct.
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3216.133,3218.066,He does not say it must be referred to.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3220.775,3232.776,--I suggest that the Fourth Amendment requires some appropriate words of description so that it is the clear intent of the magistrate to adopt the language of the affidavit.
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3286.448,3290.732,Is there any evidence of bad faith on the part of the police officers?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3290.732,3301.24,"The trial court made a finding of good faith, and the officers testified at several points that they believed what they were doing was proper."
1983.82-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.896,3336.093,"Well, your submission then includes a suggestion that an officer would be unreasonable to think that since he had the affidavit in one hand and the warrant in the other that he was authorized to search for the items in the affidavit."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3336.093,3354.565,I do not believe that that is a reasonable proposition absent something in the warrant executed by the magistrate which would tell him that the magistrate had approved the search which is described in the application.
1983.82-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3354.565,3364.883,"You also would think that the officer should not have taken the magistrate's word for saying,"
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3368.937,3371.048,They had to read the warrant and--
1983.82-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.048,3375.151,As it was issued and not just read the affidavit.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3375.151,3376.253,--That is right.
1983.82-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3416.238,3434.249,So if there is an affidavit that asks for a warrant to search a certain address and the warrant comes cut and is one number off... there has been a typographical error... the officers should have picked that up.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3434.249,3445.707,It depends on whether the error in the warrant is in the nature of an ambiguity which--
1983.82-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3445.707,3447.019,There is nothing ambiguous about it.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3451.22,3455.414,--If there is a 17 Black Street and an 18 Black Street then they cannot conduct the search.
1983.82-963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3468.503,3483.072,"If the affidavit is attached to the warrant and says 18, and the warrant on its face says 17, they should not go searching?"
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3483.072,3485.013,They should not conduct the search in that case.
1983.82-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3492.777,3500.902,"Well, there are cases against you on that, I believe, are there not, incorrect address in the affidavit where there really is a place--"
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3500.902,3523.949,The underlying principle of all the cases dealing with misdescription and ambiguity is that there has to be something which permits the officers on the scene to make a reasoned choice and to understand that the court made a finding of probable cause and granted them the authority to conduct the search.
1983.82-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3525.419,3539.358,"--But supposing you have a case that everybody involved from the magistrate to the officer to the executing officer on down intended 17 Black Street to be searched... that is the place where the defendant lives and all the rest... and they type in 18 Black Street, which is next door."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3557.169,3567.687,"--There are some cases about partial misdescriptions, but where, as I understand it, the misdescription is misleading--"
1983.82-963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3567.687,3570.528,What you are saying it is the information on the face of the warrant that makes it clear that they--
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3570.528,3582.767,"--If there is something on the face of the warrant which would either mislead or makes the police officers make a choice on the scene and leaves doubt about the intention of the magistrate, then they cannot execute the warrant."
1983.82-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3582.767,3603.781,"--Mr. Reinstein, do you not think there may be a point at which you get... I do not doubt the cases say what you say they say... but you are getting away from kind of Fourth Amendment values that are mandated by the federal constitution and get into something that is really quite finicky almost like the law of wills about misdescription."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3610.093,3616.128,I am glad that I am not in a position of having to defend that entire body of law today.
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3630.807,3634.199,May I ask another question?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3647.169,3648.898,There is no evidence in the record of that.
1983.82-963,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3648.898,3659.006,"I asked you a little while ago about good faith, and you agreed that the court below, the trial court I suppose, found good faith."
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3663.879,3673.064,There is nothing to indicate that the police officers deliberately used this warrant for some ulterior motive.
1983.82-963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3676.718,3678.598,Just one question.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3691.638,3692.557,And they had attached the affidavit.
1983.82-963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3692.557,3693.088,Yes.
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3693.088,3694.019,So that--
1983.82-963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3694.019,3696.22,Is that your only complaint?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3696.22,3702.405,--That is the substance of the criticism of this warrant.
1983.82-963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3702.405,3704.157,That is your only complaint?
1983.82-963,1,32596,john_reinstein,,3704.157,3705.427,That is correct.
1983.82-963,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3708.77,3709.841,Very well.
1983.82-963,2,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,3710.152,3710.582,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-963,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3710.963,3712.222,"Thank you, counsel."
