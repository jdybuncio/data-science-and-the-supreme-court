1982.81-1843,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.857,We'll hear argument next in Illinois versus Andreas.
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,65.254,67.832,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1843,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,571.16,576.377,In this case would your analysis be any different had it been a small suitcase?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,576.377,593.996,"I think, Your Honor, the situation might be different if you had a common suitcase which could not be clearly identified and which would allow readily easy transfer of the contents."
1982.81-1843,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,612.909,615.971,"So in this case much depends on the facts, then."
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,615.971,662.685,"I think, Your Honor, that the Court could, because of the unusual nature of the type of search which can occur at customs under the law and which can give law enforcement officials specific knowledge of the contents of the container, could take the position that once the Government finds contraband in such containers and the container is identified, even if it were a suitcase, were clearly identifiable, then Government, if it maintained reasonably continuous surveillance, could retake that container and open it up because there had been that specific knowledge and there had not been a legitimate expectation of privacy about the contents in placing it at an international border."
1982.81-1843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,662.685,673.978,"That would be true, following up in Justice Blackmun's question, only so long as there were probable cause to believe that whatever had been in the container was still in it."
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,680.412,686.675,"I think that the time factor, Justice Rehnquist, plus the type of container are items to consider."
1982.81-1843,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,707.731,714.931,"Counsel, while you're interrupted, you said the keys were along with the shipment papers?"
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,714.931,716.258,"That's correct, Justice Marshall."
1982.81-1843,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,716.258,717.539,I don't understand that.
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,717.539,725.503,"At the time... the shipment was made from Calcutta, India, to Chicago via Lufthansa Airlines."
1982.81-1843,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,732.392,733.875,For anybody to open it?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,733.875,736.5,"Presumably for customs to open it, Your Honor."
1982.81-1843,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,736.5,738.093,I see.
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,738.093,755.117,"Here both Chadwick and Sanders, which were cases cited by the Illinois appellate court in ruling on this matter, both noted that a reasonable expectation of privacy relates to what is known about the container."
1982.81-1843,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,794.617,797.725,"Mr. Devine, can I ask you a question there?"
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,816.123,817.811,"I certainly think... pardon me, Your Honor."
1982.81-1843,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,829.353,830.695,Do you endorse that test?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,830.695,834.991,"--I think it is a narrow but proper holding in this case, Your Honor."
1982.81-1843,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,875.74,880.738,"Well, I understand that, but their test, and I guess you're willing to endorse it, is quite different from merely a probable cause test."
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,883.876,886.563,"We think we meet that test, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1843,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.563,890.5,"You're not arguing for a probable cause standard, is what I'm really trying to find out."
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,890.5,894.185,"Well, I would argue... I would argue for more, Mr. Justice Stevens, yes."
1982.81-1843,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.948,908.68,"Once you have actual knowledge, is that all you need at any time after that, is probable cause to believe there hasn't been a change in the contents?"
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,908.68,917.864,"--If the container is identified, either because it's distinctive, because it's marked, or because a beeper, for example, might be placed in it."
1982.81-1843,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,929.749,939.23,I think you responded to one question by saying that if there had been a lapse of two or three days that would make it quite a different case.
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,961.018,979.51,"I think essentially, Chief Justice Burger, it would amount to that, but I would phrase it in the sense, there is nothing that happened that took away from their actual knowledge because of the reasonably continuous surveillance, the type of container, and the amount of time that was involved here."
1982.81-1843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,993.255,1008.592,"Well, certainly if it had been a cardboard carton, for example, and a half an hour had elapsed, it would be pretty easy, if it were not within the officer's view, to change the contents of the container, would it not?"
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1008.592,1016.323,"I think the ease of ability to change the contents, Justice O'Connor, is a factor to consider."
1982.81-1843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1051.98,1057.681,Was the container here one to which items could have been added within the half hour or so?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1065.569,1074.081,"I would expect that, based on the size of the container and the size of the table, it might have been possible to put something in."
1982.81-1843,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.208,1109.974,How much did they get out of the table?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1109.974,1115.909,"The street value estimate by the Chicago police officer on the scene was $100,000."
1982.81-1843,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1115.909,1117.174,How much... what was the weight?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1117.174,1122.61,"The weight does not show up on any of the common law record at this stage, Your Honor."
1982.81-1843,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.61,1125.265,Was it all the same material?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1125.265,1127.31,"Yes, hashish."
1982.81-1843,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1127.31,1132.027,Was a drill required to get to the inside of the table?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1132.027,1149.255,"It is my understanding from the record, Justice Powell, that a drill was used by the customs agent, probably on the underneath side of the table, to open up holes, first to determine if it was hollow, and then to remove an amount of substance that could be field tested."
1982.81-1843,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1149.255,1152.097,Were any drills found in Respondent's apartment?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1152.097,1158.469,There is no evidence in the record that anything such as a drill was found with the container.
1982.81-1843,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1158.469,1163.218,Was it openable in some other way besides a drill?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1163.218,1164.357,Well--
1982.81-1843,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.357,1165.295,Do you know?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1165.295,1168.34,"--We don't know from the record, Justice White."
1982.81-1843,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1168.34,1171.573,What authority did they have to drill into my furniture?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1178.868,1184.099,"It is our understanding from Ramsey and other cases that go back to Boyd, Justice Marshall--"
1982.81-1843,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1184.099,1191.065,"Can you give me any better, authoritative answer than a moving picture?"
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1191.065,1196.283,"--Than a... I didn't give you that authority, Justice Marshall."
1982.81-1843,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1198.172,1204.31,"Customs just has that broad authority, right, it's your position?"
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1204.31,1217.601,"--There may be... certainly this Court commented in Ramsey in a footnote that allowing the customs agent to inspect in effect any baggage, any person that comes across the international border--"
1982.81-1843,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1217.601,1219.71,"But this is drilling, this is drilling."
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1219.71,1226.613,"--Yes, and then replugging the holes by the customs agent after the drilling took place."
1982.81-1843,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1238.25,1246.497,"My question is, what case or what other authority do you have to drill into a piece of furniture?"
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1246.497,1253.573,"Well, I think that I would cite to Ramsey, which this Court has made, a decision which this Court has made."
1982.81-1843,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1409.884,1415.225,But in that case the individual searched was still on the premises.
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1415.225,1430.563,"The firemen had left the scene, Chief Justice Burger, and came back some four hours later after the smoke and steam had cleared away, made one search, went away again and came back an hour later."
1982.81-1843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1437.108,1442.668,Why are you arguing an extended border search rather than a controlled delivery?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1443.887,1461.458,"That argument, Justice O'Connor, was made by the Solicitor General and, while we certainly believe we could withstand analysis under an extended border search theory, Illinois is basically arguing the customs exception plus the controlled delivery."
1982.81-1843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1471.86,1474.654,You are arguing the controlled delivery?
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1474.654,1478.106,"--We are not arguing a controlled delivery exception, Your Honor."
1982.81-1843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.401,1492.71,I suppose analytically one might have a controlled delivery in connection with some other valid search that wasn't based on customs.
1982.81-1843,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,1492.71,1495.381,"I think that's certainly correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1843,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.903,1563.088,Mr. Reardon.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1563.088,1567.805,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1601.822,1607.413,What do you understand... at some point will you give your definition of what you think a controlled delivery is?
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1607.413,1619.283,"--Well, I think they have based, and I think the Illinois appellate court based its understanding of a controlled delivery upon the cases in the various courts of appeals, such as--"
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1619.283,1626.329,"What I was driving at is, when you use the term what do you mean by it, not what the courts meant."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1626.329,1645.663,"--I think that a controlled delivery, if there is one, must entail a constant, close surveillance and control over the contents that are to be seized, at whatever time they are eventually seized and taken into police control permanently."
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1645.663,1646.695,How do you keep control over the contents?
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1650.053,1655.16,"Well, I think that over the years the cases have given us imaginative ways that the Government has found to do that."
1982.81-1843,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1683.601,1690.38,"What problem, if any, do you have with the fact that they also had the keys?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1690.38,1705.483,"Well, at the time of the customs search apparently the keys were attached by Lufthansa as a part of the shipment and were with the tin package, so that when it came to customs all the customs agent had to do was to take the keys and open the package."
1982.81-1843,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1707.17,1710.59,Did the customs... did the Government keep the keys?
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1710.59,1717.494,"--Well, there's no evidence as to even whether the container at the time it was delivered was in fact locked."
1982.81-1843,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1743.187,1755.807,"Mr. Reardon, would you want us to draw a bright line where there is any period of time whatsoever when the package is out of eyesight of the authorities?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1755.807,1764.709,"--Well, I think you're asking me to go beyond the facts in this case, which I think give us an opportunity to clearly see a line."
1982.81-1843,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1764.709,1771.504,"Well, at least that would be an easy approach, a bright line is drawn and it's easy to be enforced that way."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1771.504,1775.955,"Well, possibly that would be the way this Court could go."
1982.81-1843,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1780.796,1781.733,45 minutes?
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1781.733,1796.915,"There's at least a half hour to 45 minutes where the container is not just handed to someone and then that someone, as in many cases, walks out of the airport with agents trailing him and following him by radio."
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.559,1873.243,"So he may open it up and empty it, and then he had to fill it up again."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1873.243,1878.959,"There's no evidence that it was even full at the time it was seized, other than it was, of course, later opened."
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.959,1880.006,"Well, later."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1886.425,1887.393,"Oh, it certainly did."
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1889.237,1895.578,"And there's no indication... and if there was something in it, it was either put in it in his apartment or before?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1895.578,1907.854,"--But at the time that is relevant to the seizure and to the opening of that container, no evidence has been given to us that the police weighed it, checked the weight against any earlier time when it was--"
1982.81-1843,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1907.854,1910.291,"Well, all we're talking about is probable cause."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1918.772,1921.802,"--Well, first of all, if we are talking--"
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1921.802,1931.408,"More likely than not is the standard, is it not, more likely than not, as distinguished from beyond a reasonable doubt?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1931.408,1937.576,"--Well, if we are talking about probable cause, obviously the standard is less than reasonable doubt."
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1952.695,1969.267,"I got an impression that you've suggested that when this man took the container out of the hall and took it into the apartment, then it achieved some new changed status or cloak of privacy."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1969.267,1971.531,I suggest that that--
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1971.531,1973.156,Is that your position?
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,1973.156,1974.718,"--I do say that, yes."
1982.81-1843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2011.046,2022.824,"Well, I think their argument is that you lose the expectation of privacy so long as there's some surveillance of it thereafter until the point that it's seized."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2034.803,2036.116,"Well, I agree with that."
1982.81-1843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2037.209,2043.284,What level of certainty do you think the cases show has to be applied?
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2043.284,2054.716,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, once that door closes to a private Fourth Amendment area... that is why I responded as I, did to Chief Justice Burger--"
1982.81-1843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2054.716,2061.573,"Well, do you think if the door were closed for 30 seconds that that would somehow magically change this case?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2061.573,2071.866,"--Well, let's assume that... you're making me do things that are not in the case, and that I find difficult because then I would be in a different position, of course."
1982.81-1843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2071.866,2075.084,But that's the fun we have in asking questions.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2096.81,2100.776,"Well, I think that it would be a reasonable assumption, yes."
1982.81-1843,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2100.776,2103.666,"Well, how do you escape it here?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2103.666,2107.914,"Well, let us assume--"
1982.81-1843,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2107.914,2115.161,"As of right now, with what your associate tells me, I have to also assume that somebody drilled into my furniture."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2118.082,2131.139,"--Both at the trial level and at the appellate level and in our briefs in this Court, we have specifically prescinded from any discussion of whether or not the customs search was a lawful search by a governmental agency."
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2134.888,2137.871,Could there be any possible question about it?
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2137.871,2141.228,"Well, I think Justice Marshall raised one, whether or not--"
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2141.228,2142.26,"Well, do you raise a question?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2142.26,2145.789,--I suggest that a customs search must be reasonable.
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2149.773,2153.333,"Well, are you aware that they sometimes take a suitcase and take the lining out?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2156.926,2160.377,"--Oh, I think great latitude is given--"
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2160.377,2162.517,--Unlimited latitude.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2162.517,2165.14,--but nonetheless there could be such a thing as an unreasonable customs search.
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2175.23,2184.383,And with a person they sometimes take the people into a private area and have a physician or a nurse strip them and examine them.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2189.818,2194.27,"Well, once again you're asking me to go into hypotheticals."
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2194.27,2194.832,Yes.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2194.832,2203.142,But I suggest that there may be a Rochin versus California situation at a customs depot some day that could be so extreme that it would offend this Court.
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.682,2220.103,"Well, could I return to a question I asked you a while ago."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2228.459,2232.754,"That is correct, that was the evidence that was elicited."
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.754,2250.277,"And is it a fair inference from the record that the hashish was either placed in the table in your client's house or it was... or what was found in the table, whatever it was might have been taken out, was there before it got there?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2250.277,2252.418,"Oh, it's quite possible that the--"
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.418,2253.775,Possible?
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2261.508,2263.241,"--Or it was there before the customs search, correct."
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.021,2280.827,"Well, suppose it had never been out of anybody's sight, and suppose a friend of your client's who was... this is a hypothetical."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2294.759,2298.461,Then I agree--
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.461,2300.991,Then you would have no... then you might be in--
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2300.991,2304.115,--Then we are in an extremely different case than we are today.
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.115,2312.705,--All that would then show is that the hashish was in there when it was delivered to him and it was never taken out.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2313.908,2314.845,Yes.
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2314.845,2328.34,"Now, on the facts of this case it seems to me that you are stuck with the unquestionable fact that hashish was either put there by him in the house or it was there when it was delivered."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2328.34,2334.947,"Well, the question, though, I believe is whether at the time he walked out of that door--"
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.947,2335.337,Yes.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2335.337,2351.096,"--into the hallway with a closed opaque container, that at that point the police agents who seized the package had a right to search it under Chadwick, because at that point, did they have such certainty?"
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.652,2377.6,"Well, you certainly then, you certainly want to cut off a so-called controlled search, a controlled surveillance."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2387.316,2389.908,"Well, I do for the following reasons, because--"
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.908,2398.185,"Well, why would you then... why would you say that you would lose the case if a friend was there with him and later testified that they never touched the table?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2403.169,2411.681,"--I'm sorry if I misunderstood your hypothetical, but I assumed that this friend was continuing the surveillance on behalf of the police."
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.681,2412.244,"--Well, he was, he was."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2427.207,2435.39,"Well, the question then for this Court would be whether the controlled delivery cases of the courts of appeals should be ratified in this Court."
1982.81-1843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2446.839,2449.573,"Well, let's suppose we do adopt it."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2459.787,2467.861,"Well, your original hypothetical was to me how long a break in time is necessary, and I--"
1982.81-1843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2467.861,2478.919,Might that not depend on the nature of the container and the likelihood that it could have been... something taken out or added in that interval?
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2478.919,2494.726,"--I suggest that if that would be the rationale upon which the lower court or this Court should rule, then that should have been developed by the state as a way of showing that this container had to be in the same condition that it always was."
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2494.726,2504.535,"Well, why shouldn't the question be, was there an opportunity for somebody else to put in the table what was later found in the table?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2527.29,2536.428,"The question, however, is not whether it's been in my client's possession, but whether the contents of that table are available for search without a warrant."
1982.81-1843,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.428,2551.86,"--Your theory is that it's perfectly conceivable that he himself might have taken it out in his house, in the apartment, and emerged with the thing just unchanged, at any rate, from the way it had been delivered to him?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2551.86,2552.875,I think that's true.
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.875,2553.436,But it wasn't empty.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2557.794,2573.726,"But no one at the time that that package was seized outside his door at the time of arrest, no one ever testified that the contents of that container were the same, nor could they have, if you examine the facts, because that was an ordinary shipping container."
1982.81-1843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2579.739,2582.973,None of the controlled delivery cases have required absolute certainty.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2596.639,2608.727,"Well, I suggest to the Court that the controlled delivery cases that I have seen have required such close surveillance that there could be no change in the contents of the package."
1982.81-1843,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2614.974,2617.864,"It's almost a chain of possession reasoning, like you have to have--"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2617.864,2622.236,"--That's what the courts have searched for in the Court of Appeals, and I think it is reasonable because--"
1982.81-1843,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2622.236,2630.436,"--But when you're talking about probable cause... I mean, the whole gist of what you can search in the Fourth Amendment area depends on probable causes."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2636.042,2640.979,--I'm not sure that that is the standard as I read it in Arkansas versus Sanders.
1982.81-1843,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2667.578,2679.621,But you treat this as if it were simply a probable cause like they had to search the suitcase in Arkansas against Sanders.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2702.064,2709.545,"--Well then, of course we are backing away, I believe, from the standard in Chadwick, which was that probable cause is insufficient."
1982.81-1843,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2709.545,2715.434,But certainty wouldn't have been sufficient in Arkansas against Sanders.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2720.855,2734.301,"Well, my response to that would be that if we then wish to be consistent, if that is the consistency that the Court wishes, then we should say that under controlled delivery cases a warrant is required."
1982.81-1843,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2734.301,2736.238,You're free to argue that if you want to.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2736.238,2754.246,"I can only say that I believe that is the logical consistency that I'm confronted with by the decisions in this Court, and I suggest that, whatever we look to as a standard in this case, the facts of this case... I think I agree with counsel--"
1982.81-1843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.246,2758.12,May I ask you a question about your theory on the time interval?
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2779.377,2794.496,"--I think the fact that the officers went to get a warrant once that apartment door was closed indicates to me that those officers, as well as I, knew that they had lost control at that point and that they need a warrant at that point to reassert control and to research that package."
1982.81-1843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2794.496,2799.87,"Well, they hadn't lost control at the time they handed him the package and he said, it's not too heavy, I can handle it myself."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2799.87,2804.945,But they didn't reseize it at that point.
1982.81-1843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2805.773,2812.644,"But apparently the reason they didn't at that point in time was they decided that it would be better police procedure to get a warrant, and I certainly don't think you'd criticize them for doing that."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2812.644,2815.658,"No, I don't think I'd criticize for going and getting a warrant."
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2816.752,2819.86,And certainly while the table was in the house there's no way they could get in the house without a warrant.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2824.639,2826.999,"Well, and to--"
1982.81-1843,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2826.999,2828.873,"And you couldn't enter the house, I guess, without a warrant."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2828.873,2837.682,"--For the purpose of seizing a container within which was another container, within which was the object of the warrant."
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2837.682,2848.021,"Suppose they'd waited until he had taken the package out, put it in his automobile, and then started off."
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2873.667,2881.227,"I suggest that they could stop the car under case law relating to cars, Carroll, et cetera, and the new cases on that point."
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2898.687,2909.199,"But don't you read our cases as having, recent cases, as having largely, very, very largely, expanded what can be searched in the car without a warrant?"
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2909.199,2910.84,I do.
1982.81-1843,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2910.84,2912.434,Once the car has been lawfully stopped.
1982.81-1843,1,38257,patrick_g_reardon,,2912.434,2912.434,I do.
1982.81-1843,2,39050,richard_a_devine,,3419.043,3424.119,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1843,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3536.619,3537.744,"Thank you, gentlemen."
