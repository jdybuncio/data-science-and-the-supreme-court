2018.17-1107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.56,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1107, Carpenter versus Murphy. Ms. Blatt."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,6.56,13.8,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Eastern Oklahoma is not an Indian reservation for three reasons."
2018.17-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,42.48,59.12,"Exactly when did it do this? What's the exact date? It wasn't in the Enabling Act when the state became -- when the state was pro -- well, when Teddy Roosevelt proclaimed it a state, but nothing in the Enabling Act did that."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,61.48,64.12,"I mean, our position is it was done by statehood."
2018.17-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,66.36,67.2,But at statehood --
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,67.2,68.08,-- to give you a state -- a date --
2018.17-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,68.08,100.48,"But at -- but at statehood, the tribe was still in existence. Shortly thereafter, Congress says it's not going to dismember it, and tribal members still owned property, they were getting property, and it was only after that that the government began to -- it wasn't even that it took the land away from the Indians; that through trickery and deceit, they were permitted to sell off their lands, but I'm trying to figure out --"
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,100.48,100.76,Sure.
2018.17-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,100.76,101.28,-- exactly when?
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,101.28,101.8,Sure.
2018.17-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,131.04,131.52,I'm sorry --
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,131.52,132.28,-- for any purpose.
2018.17-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,132.28,148.84,"-- what are all the Solomon cases -- all of those tribes, the issue was whether the deprivation of property was an allotment or a cessation, and in many of them, we held it was an allotment because there wasn't clear language of cessation."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,152.12,153.64,"Exactly, and that's my point."
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,192.56,212.8,"But what does that mean, Ms. Blatt? Because, as I read the history, it goes something like this -- and you said terminating all sovereignty -- what happened was that, in 1901, Congress said we are going to terminate all sovereignty by 1906. So there was definitely an express intent to do that. And then two things happened."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,242.6,244.76,"No, that's fundamentally wrong in several respects."
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,246.84,247.8,Fundamentally wrong? (Laughter.)
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,247.8,250.4,"It's fundamentally wrong because the 19 -- well, it's -- it's factually wrong."
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,252.96,255.52,Factually and fundamentally? (Laughter.)
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,255.52,256.72,And fundamentally.
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,274.44,274.76,I'm sorry.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,277.2,277.44,Sure.
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,277.44,281.24,Now you're -- are you making a distinction between the tribal government and tribal sovereignty?
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,281.24,281.84,Absolutely.
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,281.84,283.36,And what is that distinction?
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,283.36,301.36,"I'm telling you, every single cession case, the -- all that matters, and what the Court's words were in Solem, where there's a divestiture of the tribal interest in the land, a dissolution of tribal sovereignty, it has never been required that Congress has to terminate a tribe. Now let's look at the -- let's talk about the continuing --"
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,301.36,302.64,I'm still not getting it.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,302.64,303.04,Okay.
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,304.08,315.8,"What is -- just let me finish the question, yes? What is tribal -- the tribal sovereignty that you say is critical to determine whether dissolution has occurred?"
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,315.8,319.08,Some sovereignty over non-Indian-owned fee land.
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,336.36,336.76,Wait.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,339.0,340.6,Absolute no sovereignty.
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,340.6,340.8,"Yeah, yeah."
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,349.64,350.28,"No, please."
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,350.28,379.44,"There was a tribal legislature, and what they said, I guess, in, whenever it was, the Enabling Act, 1906, that the President had to approve it. Now I'm not sure I can find any instance which says because the President has to approve the laws passed by a tribal council, that that means the tribe does not have sovereignty."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,379.44,379.64,Right.
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,381.4,383.48,"If there's a case right on that, I doubt it."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,383.48,383.8,Yeah.
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,384.04,385.68,What?
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,385.68,391.36,-- Section 28 only extended the governments for purposes that were already existing.
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,430.4,439.24,"Yeah, Ms. Blatt, isn't it true that in this period, the -- the U.S. Government was doing this with respect to many, many Indian tribes."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,490.64,492.76,"Justice Kagan, that's just not true."
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,498.08,500.08,That's exactly what I'm saying.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,500.32,501.52,Just title.
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,501.52,533.92,"We would have been talking about the stripping of sovereignty if we had thought that that was relevant, because the stripping of sovereignty is there in every single one of the historic background to these cases, that the U.S. Government, at the same time that it was acting with respect to title, was also acting with respect to tribal sovereignty and was trying to strip the tribes of sovereignty. And we have never thought that that was relevant to the question."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,533.92,539.16,"I mean, you -- you can read your cases just as well as I can, and I don't see anything in there that says what you just said."
2018.17-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,540.44,541.12,"Well, I do in Parker."
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,541.12,543.6,"It's exactly what I'm saying, Ms. Blatt."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,562.6,564.04,"I mean, I think this is semantics."
2018.17-1107,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,567.04,578.96,"Well, in those cases, was there ever -- in those cases, was there an issue about the disestablishment of the tribe? Was there an issue about the extinction of sovereign power of the tribe in toto?"
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,578.96,579.84,No.
2018.17-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,613.2,626.96,"I'm sorry, but if they did that, then allotment should account for that, because the tribe was totally absent with respect to every one of those features for over 100 years in the area it was claiming."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,626.96,627.68,So in --
2018.17-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,627.68,636.56,"And despite that, the court didn't say that that was a cessation of the tribe with respect to that area."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,647.68,648.36,Sure.
2018.17-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,661.92,664.08,How could you say that? That's what they were claiming.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,667.0,667.6,Not -- Congress --
2018.17-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,667.6,668.64,-- other side was claiming.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,670.8,679.28,"For the Cheyenne River Sioux in Solem, for the Omaha tribe in Nebraska, there's not a statute that takes away the territorial sovereignty."
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,704.24,705.28,That was wrong.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,777.76,778.04,They --
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,778.04,780.08,Now you're also right on the last part.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,792.08,792.88,But they didn't want to.
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,792.88,793.08,What?
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,793.08,794.32,"When you say they should have, you're just -- you're --"
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,794.32,797.44,"No, no, no, if you are wrong, they should have."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,797.44,797.64,Right.
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,797.64,797.84,Yeah.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,797.84,801.76,"And then, for the last 111 years, there have been tens of thousands of cases that have been in state court."
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,801.96,802.6,All right.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,820.12,821.04,"Well, it was --"
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,821.04,822.48,They gave them to state courts.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,827.96,828.68,Well --
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,828.68,838.16,-- abrogation of the power of the tribe to legislate or carry on other governmental-type activities.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,838.16,842.72,So the tribe could not exercise a single power.
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.28,862.88,"What about ""affecting the lands of the tribe or of individuals after allotment or the moneys or other property of the tribe""? What about that?"
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,862.88,863.4,Justice Breyer --
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,863.4,864.92,"They can do it, but it's subject to the President."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,864.92,867.48,"No, in 1906, you're reading from 1901 --"
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,867.48,867.96,Yeah.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,867.96,878.84,"-- every piece of paper, record, book, dollar bill or coin or property, their buildings, their furniture, their desks, everything was taken away from the tribes. So I don't know how they could be doing anything."
2018.17-1107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,896.96,913.6,"But what about 1906, they say ""the tribal existence and present tribal governments of the Five Tribes are hereby continued in full force and effect for all purposes authorized by law unless otherwise provided by law."" That does not sound like an abrogation."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,913.6,916.72,If -- if -- the Act is entitled Final Disposition.
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,926.88,940.2,"But, Ms. Blatt, what you're suggesting is that the idea of a reservation is -- is -- is -- is always and necessarily linked to full tribal authority over that land."
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,992.32,1020.96,"Justice Kagan, I would concede that you have a reservation with any tribal power, not full tribal power or some federal power that displaced state power, but here it's a null set. It's fine, there is no such reservation, but you could have a reservation where just the federal government can control non-Indian-owned fee land. But any -- I'll take any act of tribal sovereignty that the tribe could exercise over the non-Indian-owned fee land and non-tribal member, and they don't even have it over the tribal members because they had none."
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1020.96,1021.48,Okay.
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1081.88,1082.28,No.
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1086.6,1090.92,"Well, Solem wasn't on the books until long after all of the cases that Solem --"
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1090.92,1091.44,Exactly.
2018.17-1107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1091.44,1101.08,"But -- but what Solem makes relevant is, when we look back to those periods, we ask about was it cession or was it something short of cession, meaning allotment?"
2018.17-1107,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1101.08,1106.0,And Congress did the same when they had allotment plus dissolution. Can I reserve the remainder of my time?
2018.17-1107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1106.0,1122.32,Certainly. Mr. Kneedler.
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1122.32,1136.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: What Congress did in the statutes at issue here is fundamentally different from what it did in the line of cases involving Solem. What Congress was doing here was transform -- transforming a territory to a state."
2018.17-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1227.92,1228.64,What's so interesting --
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1228.64,1230.6,-- all crimes of a local nature.
2018.17-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1230.6,1261.24,"Mr. Kneedler, what's so interesting about that transfer is that, in 1906, the Enabling Act does say transfer, but in 1907, the Enabling Act amendment makes clear that the transfer is only of criminal cases. And your opponent says that -- and if you read it, they're right -- that federal question issues were supposed to remain in the federal courts. Now they didn't."
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1278.52,1279.4,"Well, by it -- by its --"
2018.17-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1279.4,1289.2,"And by its words, it said all federal question cases, which include major crime act cases, should stay in federal court."
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1296.72,1302.88,"With all respect, I don't think it's fair to say functionaries. These were courts -- excuse me -- courts that transferred the cases."
2018.17-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1302.88,1304.44,Courts are not Congress.
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1304.44,1309.56,"I understand that, but -- but these were courts that were contemporaneously interpreting the statute that Congress --"
2018.17-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1309.56,1329.96,"But the problem is that Congress, when it did speak, basically said we're not going to end tribal sovereignty. So the -- the Congress, exactly around this same time period, basically says, we're not going to disenfranchise the tribes."
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1331.8,1343.56,The -- the question in this case is tribal authority -- is actually federal and state authority over lands in which there is no tribal interest at all. We -- we assume for present purposes --
2018.17-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1343.56,1345.28,"Well, there was tribal interests there."
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1347.0,1347.32,Yes.
2018.17-1107,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1382.36,1383.64,"Mr. Kneedler, could you say --"
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1383.64,1384.84,-- as Congress intended.
2018.17-1107,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1384.84,1385.44,I'm sorry.
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1395.4,1397.36,"Yes, it -- it would be -- it would be dramatic."
2018.17-1107,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1454.88,1458.96,And what is the -- what would be the definition of an Indian for these purposes?
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1458.96,1462.92,I -- I think an Indian would be any tribal -- at least any tribal member.
2018.17-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1501.32,1505.64,"All of those things can be changed by Congress, can't they?"
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1505.64,1505.8,They --
2018.17-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1505.8,1509.4,Congress has the plenary power to take -- to give or take.
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1509.4,1516.48,"Well, with respect to retroactive effects on existing convictions, there would be a serious question as to whether -- and that's no small matter."
2018.17-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1545.16,1545.4,No.
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1548.64,1549.28,But it -- it was --
2018.17-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1549.28,1552.64,And it -- and it accomplished that with the allotment.
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1552.64,1559.88,"It was more than that because the tribes in their treaties were given this -- these as permanent homelands, which was both governmental and property."
2018.17-1107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1569.72,1588.28,"Well, but the question is, Mr. Kneedler, did Congress, in fact, do that? Did Congress, in fact, decide that that was essential to statehood, or did it do something less? Did it -- did it decide that it could make do with something that was short of the cession of lands that we've required in these cases?"
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1588.28,1588.4,Well --
2018.17-1107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1588.4,1598.36,"So if I could just go back to the question that I ended with Ms. Blatt on, I mean, it seems here Congress is very clear about we have two pathways and we'd prefer cession."
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1619.56,1624.04,"If I -- if I may, there's nothing in the Draw -- in the Dawes Act that said Congress preferred one over the other."
2018.17-1107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1624.32,1625.76,"Yeah, it said that there are two pathways."
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1627.72,1628.12,The Dawes Act --
2018.17-1107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1628.12,1633.16,"-- says it's really simpler to do cession, we wish we could do cession, we can't do cession."
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1633.16,1636.6,"It's simpler, but that has nothing to do with jurisdictional authority."
2018.17-1107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1652.48,1653.4,It's agreed.
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1680.52,1680.64,I --
2018.17-1107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1680.64,1682.32,-- before we say that a reservation --
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1682.32,1682.64,I --
2018.17-1107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1682.64,1683.52,-- doesn't exist anymore.
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1683.52,1691.12,"I respectfully disagree because what they did was they broke up the nation, which was the -- and allotted it to individual members."
2018.17-1107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1734.12,1748.04,"Mr. Kneedler, before you sit down, you said very quickly the ramifications of the court of appeals decision in areas other than criminal jurisdiction."
2018.17-1107,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1764.6,1784.36,"Under this Court's cases, a -- a tribal member cannot be taxed, for example, for sales tax, cigarette tax, gasoline tax, where the incidence is on a tribal member anywhere in -- within a reservation. And a tribal member cannot be assessed state income tax at least where he resides and works on the reservation."
2018.17-1107,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1820.76,1827.28,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gershengorn."
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1827.28,1847.48,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Thomas's opinion in Parker from just three terms ago requires that the Tenth Circuit decision be affirmed. Parker confirmed that the text is what governs, and the text here is particularly clear. Congress considered hallmark language that would have disestablished the reservation and Congress rejected it."
2018.17-1107,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1875.36,1880.2,Is it your position that there's certain magic words that have to appear in statutes?
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1880.2,1881.0,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.72,1900.2,"But I think that I just quoted the very thing you did, which is from the 1906 Five Tribes Act."
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1900.2,1900.72,Uh-huh.
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1900.72,1900.92,Okay.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1928.24,1928.4,No.
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1928.4,1930.08,That is not so.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1947.04,1947.48,"So, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1947.48,1948.48,So what is the content?
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1948.48,1952.0,So I want to be very clear that we're talking about on the Congressional text.
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.8,2008.0,"And what were those? Because 1901 is followed by 1906, and I believe, though I don't want to put words in her mouth, I believe that Ms. Blatt said, if I read earlier in the 1906 Act, what I will find is lots of provisions that suggest they're simply winding up affairs, and the purpose of the government is to wind up affairs and then perhaps continue to elect a chief."
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2008.0,2008.64,"So, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2008.64,2010.12,That's what I'm interested in your view.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2010.12,2011.0,Yes.
2018.17-1107,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2057.44,2057.84,Could you tell me what --
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2057.84,2059.36,-- and over the objection of the Executive Branch.
2018.17-1107,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2059.36,2060.84,Could you tell me what remained?
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2060.84,2061.24,Yeah.
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2087.0,2088.48,That's -- that's the best you've -- that's the best you've got?
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2088.48,2095.6,"So, Your Honor, I -- there is no doubt that the -- in practice, on the ground, the legislative power of the tribe was greatly reduced."
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2107.12,2113.72,"In terms of the ongoing functioning and relationship, the best example you have of the tribe's continuing authority is hiring an interpreter?"
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2113.72,2115.68,"So, Your Honor, the -- I just want to be very clear."
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2205.48,2206.04,That is correct.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2268.88,2271.0,"So, Your Honor, I -- I understand the point."
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2315.44,2317.52,"Well, just to pause for a moment --"
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2317.52,2318.08,Yes.
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2318.08,2320.84,"-- obviously, the Tenth Circuit decision hasn't been looked at by us."
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2331.0,2351.08,"So, Your Honor, I -- it is a concern and as are habeas rules, which this Court has repeatedly upheld, and as I say, the Tenth Circuit has addressed this question squarely and said that the cases -- the cases cannot be brought in a second or successive habeas petition. Going forward, Mr. Kneedler identified the burdens on the government."
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2371.56,2371.76,What about --
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2371.76,2372.36,-- has a lot of resources.
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.36,2373.0,My question is really --
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2373.0,2374.6,"So, on the civil side, Justice Breyer --"
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2374.6,2374.68,Yes.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2374.68,2394.92,"-- which I understand is -- is your concern, I found it interesting that you asked -- that Justice Alito asked Mr. Kneedler what the impact would be, and the thing he identified, which we agree with, is that there will be limits on state authority over income tax and sales tax of tribal members on the reservation. I would agree that's significant."
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2417.92,2418.84,But just to pause --
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2418.84,2419.76,So I'm asking you -- yeah.
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2419.76,2420.08,Go ahead.
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.08,2426.72,I'm asking you what -- what you would do if you were me if you thought on all the doctrinal things that you were right.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2426.72,2427.08,Right.
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2427.08,2438.76,"Because imagine you are a small businessman in Tulsa, and suddenly our Court decision, and all they know is they're part of the reservation."
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2448.56,2454.04,"So, Justice Breyer, I'd like to make a factual point and then a ""how would I solve it"" point if you thought there was a problem."
2018.17-1107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.88,2456.96,I'm asking you whether there's a problem.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2456.96,2479.4,"I -- there is not, but let me explain why, but then, even if you disagree why -- what you could do about it, all right? I don't think there is a problem because this Court has already -- although the person may wake up and say, gee, I'm in a reservation now, in fact, this Court's cases have already limited tribal authority over non-members on fee land within a reservation. That is the point of the whole Plains Commerce line of cases."
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2521.72,2525.2,"Well, just to pause -- just to pause for a moment, you say it's not going to be any difference when you wake up."
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2530.72,2530.88,So --
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2530.88,2532.0,And you're in a reservation.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2535.48,2535.92,"So, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2535.92,2536.52,-- and we're not going to give you one?
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2536.52,2546.12,"-- alcohol -- alcohol has always been separate -- has been special in Indian lands, and with respect to alcoholic beverage in particular, there may be additional -- additional regulation."
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2553.64,2556.0,What about when operated by a member?
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2556.0,2563.36,"So additional -- yes, there would be additional regulation of a member on fee land, but that is -- but the Court has always been --"
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2563.36,2567.16,What about dealings between non-members and members on fee land?
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2567.16,2574.56,So I don't think that that's part of -- part of the -- I don't think that is part of the tribe's regulatory authority.
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2576.48,2585.08,"Well, I guess just to be -- I don't mean to -- I'm trying to find -- could -- could the tribe require those non-members doing business with members on Indian land to obtain a license to do that?"
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2585.08,2587.52,"So, Your Honor, I don't think the answer to that is yes."
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2615.44,2615.6,Right.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2615.96,2617.04,-- what should the consequences on the reservation --
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2617.04,2626.92,-- I understand that's part of the -- the remedial issues with respect to a tiny village like Pender in -- that was at issue in Parker and with respect to half of Oklahoma are obviously going to be quite different.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2626.92,2631.12,I agree that the remedial issues could be different and -- but -- although I want to address that a little more.
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2635.56,2636.32,"But, here, you have --"
2018.17-1107,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2636.32,2642.44,"There's a fundamental principle of law that derives from Sherlock Holmes, which is the dog that didn't bark."
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2653.04,2656.4,"So, Your Honor, I -- I don't think that's accurate for a number of reasons."
2018.17-1107,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2672.92,2673.44,But I mean as a --
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2673.44,2673.84,The place where you --
2018.17-1107,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2673.84,2683.64,"-- as a practical matter, have they at any time prior to this case attempted to do -- to assert any of the sovereignty that you now claim they possess --"
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2683.64,2683.8,So the --
2018.17-1107,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2683.8,2685.32,-- under this vast territory?
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2685.32,2686.6,So the answer is yes.
2018.17-1107,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2686.6,2686.76,And where?
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2686.76,2687.92,And so I'll give you an example.
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2724.08,2724.64,We have --
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2724.64,2727.4,"So this is not a situation where the -- I'm sorry, Justice Kavanaugh."
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2727.4,2728.2,"Go ahead, finish."
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2728.2,2731.16,"No, I -- this is not a situation where the tribe has been absent."
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2731.16,2739.8,"We have a lot of cases that say historical practice helps inform the text, and we have these debates about the text."
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2774.2,2785.52,"So, Your Honor, I would like -- I just want to put a footnote that I'd like to come back to you on the text because I -- I disagree with your concern about the courts, and I think it's critical to address it. But, with respect to your larger point, I'm not saying the Court needs to ignore it."
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2790.88,2791.68,This is massively --
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2791.68,2792.16,"So, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2792.16,2793.48,The size is different.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2793.48,2794.84,"Absolutely, absolutely."
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2795.2,2795.6,The number of people affected --
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2795.6,2798.48,"-- Tulsa is not Pender, but what I'm suggesting to you is the question of whether --"
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2798.48,2802.64,"If this were 1910, maybe we'd talk about differently, but it's not."
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2802.64,2822.28,"What I'm suggesting to you, though, is the difference between Tulsa and Pender comes into the question about what is the -- what is the -- the sovereign authority that the tribe gets to exercise? It is not about the question about whether the reservation continues to exist. That is a statutory question, and -- although Your Honor is correct that cases have said history matters."
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2835.72,2837.8,"What you're looking at is -- okay, you're looking at a series of statutes here."
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2850.92,2853.56,"So I don't think that the text is against us, Your Honor."
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2864.76,2885.96,"It's not a single piece of text, I'll grant you that, but it's a series of things that, together, when you look at the courts, you look at the laws of Arkansas, the forbidding the enforcement of tribal law, subjecting tribal members to state law, the federal courts transfer the jurisdiction to state courts upon statehood, it's all these acts together, which is different, in the context of statehood --"
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2885.96,2886.56,So two --
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2886.56,2887.28,-- is a major difference.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2887.28,2887.52,Yes.
2018.17-1107,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2897.08,2897.32,Right.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2897.32,2923.32,"And so those things you're talking about, the courts and others, those happened, and yet the reservation continued. Now, with respect to courts in particular, I -- I forget now which Justice said it, but the -- maybe it was Justice Kagan -- the elimination of particular powers, like the power over the courts and things like that, it's a misunderstanding, I think, of what it takes to disestablish -- what -- what sovereignty -- what reservations are getting at here. There's no particular sovereign power that a tribe needed to have."
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2939.2,2939.68,Does it matter --
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2939.68,2940.64,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2940.64,2973.88,"But does that take into account the significance of the fact that the Creek received the land in fee rather than in trust? Because, once you say the reservation doesn't matter, well, maybe it doesn't matter if you -- in -- in a trust relationship, but if you've already gotten a situation where it's ownership direct, then maybe the significance of what you can still actually do as -- as -- not whether they -- what particular powers they could exercise, but whether they could exercise any powers, then the fact that you really don't have a reservation to start with that is like the other reservations in the country, what is the significance of that distinction?"
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2973.88,2976.32,"So we think, Your Honor, that that strengthens our position."
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2993.32,2995.32,But that changed with respect to the allotments.
2018.17-1107,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2995.32,3005.56,"Yes, Your Honor. There is no doubt that the reason Congress did -- the reason they broke up the communal land ownership and broke up fee patents was to allow sort of increased sale."
2018.17-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3039.88,3045.48,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kanji."
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3045.48,3063.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I may, I would like to address three things: first, this issue of consequences; second, to return to the question of governmental powers; and, finally, to talk a little bit about contemporary understanding. With respect to consequences, there will not be turmoil from an affirmance."
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3133.88,3142.0,"Well, suppose an Indian is charged in -- with having committed a mugging in Tulsa."
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3145.8,3147.52,"If -- an Indian, Your Honor?"
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3147.52,3147.64,Yeah.
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3147.64,3155.96,"That -- well, that case would end up either being prosecuted by the federal government or by the Nation itself or both concurrently."
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3155.96,3156.24,Okay.
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3159.16,3166.36,"Well, the -- as Mr. Gershengorn said, we have these estimates from the federal government, which I think were clearly inflated."
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3171.6,3177.48,Really? There are only within -- what percentage of the population of this area would qualify as -- as Indians?
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3177.48,3180.68,"Of the entire reservation area, 9 -- about 9 percent, Your Honor."
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3180.68,3183.32,Nine percent of -- of how many people?
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3183.32,3187.28,"Nine percent of about -- the Creek population is 43,000 within the reservation."
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3187.28,3191.88,"Yeah, but all the Indians -- so this would apply as far as criminal cases to all Indians, am I right?"
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3191.88,3192.88,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3192.88,3194.32,And how many would that be?
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3194.32,3200.44,"Well, about -- we don't have exact numbers, but 50- to 60,000 Indians within the reservation area."
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3200.44,3208.88,"So, if any of those individuals was charged with any offense that would normally be prosecuted in state court, they would all have to be prosecuted in federal court?"
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3208.88,3209.68,Or by the Nation.
2018.17-1107,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3232.96,3237.92,It isn't just that. What's -- you said something about cooperative nature.
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3289.44,3290.2,Exactly.
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3324.28,3324.64,Can there --
2018.17-1107,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3324.64,3328.72,"You're talking about discussions between Congress, the state, and the Nations?"
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3328.72,3329.28,"Correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-1107,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3329.28,3333.16,And you think that'll lead fairly quickly to an agreement that will settle all these disputes?
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3333.16,3350.04,"I think these -- I think all sovereigns have an interest, a very common shared interest, Your Honor, in law enforcement. The -- the brief of the Oklahoma officials, I think, evidences that there is a very close working relationship, in fact, on the ground between the state, the local units of government, and -- and the Nation."
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3351.0,3369.52,"Can there be such a thing as a reservation that exists as an abstract matter, but in this territory, the Nation is able to exercise no sovereign powers as a practical matter? Is that a possibility?"
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3369.52,3370.56,"It is -- it is, Your Honor."
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3401.8,3416.08,"So, if we don't agree with you on that point, if we think this is a practical inquiry, can you tell me what sovereign powers the Nation retained within this territory after statehood?"
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3416.08,3419.16,"Absolutely, Your Honor. It retained legislative powers."
2018.17-1107,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3444.6,3449.16,Could tribal laws -- could tribal laws be enforced at that time after statehood?
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3449.16,3453.48,"Yes, Your Honor, just as before statehood, they were being enforced by the Secretary."
2018.17-1107,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3472.56,3486.88,"Could -- could you say a little bit more, Mr. Kanji, though, about the converse proposition, that there, indeed, have been reservations that everybody has understood to be reservations historically throughout the country, where tribal governments exercised precious little authority?"
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3486.88,3510.44,"Absolutely, Your Honor. And I'll give you a general and a specific example. Generally speaking, Congress has told the tribes over time: You -- your -- your government will be structured in this fashion. Your membership will consist of the following. You will allow this mining and these easements along your land, even if you don't want it. You will allow your children to be taken away and placed in boarding schools, even if no parent would want that."
2018.17-1107,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3552.92,3553.36,Counsel --
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3553.36,3558.04,Justice Breyer talked about the approval of ordinances by the President.
2018.17-1107,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3582.44,3587.44,"Counsel, would this expand the reach of the Indian Gaming Act in the area?"
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3587.44,3593.68,"It would not, Your Honor, in the sense that there is a compact in place between the nation and the state already."
2018.17-1107,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3597.8,3602.72,What about the Oneida Tribe idea of laches or something like that?
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3602.72,3605.08,"Well, I think that's -- that was a critical point in Parker, Your Honor."
2018.17-1107,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3669.36,3669.72,Chief --
2018.17-1107,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3669.72,3670.52,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-1107,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3670.52,3674.88,"-- Chief, may I just ask one question to follow on that?"
2018.17-1107,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3674.88,3675.44,Sure.
2018.17-1107,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3675.44,3688.16,"Your colleague also said the same thing, but when you say they've been policing and doing these things in the reservation, are you talking about the entire area in dispute right now?"
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3688.16,3699.08,"Absolutely, Your Honor. There are -- there are 44 county and municipal jurisdictions in the Creek Nation Reservation. The nation has cross-deputization agreements with 40 of them."
2018.17-1107,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3701.76,3704.24,And for how long has this been in effect?
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3704.24,3715.52,"Those agreements first started in the year 2000, Your Honor, and they -- a critical point I'd like to make in terms of disruption is they are all subject to renewal each and every year."
2018.17-1107,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3715.52,3715.84,Thank --
2018.17-1107,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3715.84,3719.56,"And in 1936, the tribal courts were reignited?"
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3719.56,3720.12,That's right.
2018.17-1107,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3720.12,3727.04,Tribal courts. And what area did those tribal courts exist in?
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3727.04,3730.4,They exercised -- they likewise exercise jurisdiction over the entire thing.
2018.17-1107,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3730.4,3731.44,Entire reservation?
2018.17-1107,3,63060,riyaz_a_kanji,,3731.44,3732.4,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-1107,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3732.4,3736.16,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Ms. Blatt."
2018.17-1107,4,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3736.16,3762.44,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Here are the two earth-shattering consequences that Congress can't fix, Sherrill can't fix, and this will stimulate you. There are 2,000 prisoners in state court who committed a crime in the former Indian territory who self-identify as Native American. This number is grossly under-inclusive because, if the victim was Native American, the state court also lacked jurisdiction."
2018.17-1107,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3848.76,3849.12,Thank you.
2018.17-1107,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3849.12,3866.08,"Well, Ms. Blatt, since there was an extension for the time on the other side, could I ask this question? There seems to be a disagreement between the attorneys here about the authority of the -- of the nation to enact and enforce laws after statehood."
2018.17-1107,4,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3868.32,3891.04,"I mean, that's preposterous to the extent that it affected non-Indian-owned fee land, non-tribal members, or tribal members. Every tribal chief that we cited, every federal court, every tribal lawyer, members of Congress, every Oklahoma historian, and the popular press recognized -- and some of these are not racist, but they are the foremost Indian scholars at the time of Oklahoma -- that the tribal governments had ceased to function. Thank you."
2018.17-1107,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3891.04,3892.32,"Thank you, counsel."
