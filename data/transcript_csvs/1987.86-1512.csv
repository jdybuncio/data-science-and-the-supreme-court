1987.86-1512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.809,"We will hear argument now in Number 86-1512, Samuel R. Pierce versus Myrna Underwood."
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,12.449,15.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,90.98,94.462,Other such factors?
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,94.462,97.134,Other special factors such as.
1987.86-1512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,97.134,97.649,Such as.
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,97.649,98.211,Yes.
1987.86-1512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,103.523,103.788,"Yes, I'm sure you will."
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,103.788,107.677,"The first issue in this case, however, is the meaning of ""substantial justification""."
1987.86-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,180.288,185.693,"Is there any reason why Congress didn't use the perfectly good word ""reasonable"", if it meant ""reasonable""?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,185.693,198.437,"Well, Justice Scalia, the legislative history suggests that the substantially justified formula was borrowed verbatim from Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
1987.86-1512,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.043,290.697,I suppose just the disagreement between two Courts of Appeals almost makes your case on your approach?
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,290.697,309.627,"Ironically, Justice White, there is a pending application or motion, I guess, before the District Court in California to award fees for the expense of engaging in the fee litigation in this case; and if our theory is right about what ""substantially justified"" means, we should be able to win that litigation because of the conflict in the Circuits."
1987.86-1512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.627,324.809,"Mr. Merrill, may I ask what standard we should use to review the lower court's finding that the Government's litigating position was not substantially justified?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,342.646,346.129,Certainly we think that in this case the appropriate standard is de novo.
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,406.544,423.053,"May I ask, in that connection, do you think that the Judge who tried the case, or the Court of Appeals that might have handled the appeal, the feeling of that Judge as to the difficulty of the issues, how close they were, and so forth, is that one of the objective factors that would be counted, or not?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,423.053,423.88,No.
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,438.953,447.45,"What if the District Judge said, I don't see how any reasonable attorney could have brought this case, based on my study of the law in the case and the arguments on both sides?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,448.403,453.73,We do not think that would be an objective indicator that would be conclusive.
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.73,456.604,I am no suggesting it is necessarily conclusive.
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,459.822,460.29,Yes.
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,460.29,462.086,By the Judge and by the Court of Appeals?
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,463.383,465.928,In a case where there is no objective indicator of reasonableness--
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,465.928,468.303,"Well, I am asking, is this one of the objective indicators?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,468.303,469.005,"--No, it's not."
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,469.005,469.568,It's not.
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,469.568,476.69,We understand objective indicators of reasonableness to be something which basically ends the argument about whether the Government was substantially justified or not.
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,487.359,490.967,Assume it is a case of first impression.
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,495.512,508.18,"In that kind of situation, it may very well be that the only thing to do is to engage in a kind of totality of the circumstances analysis, in which the Trial Judge's subjective reactions to the case obviously loom fairly large."
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,515.348,515.863,"No, of course not."
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,515.863,524.174,"And it is a little bit hard, obviously, for District Judges, having just ruled against the Government, to turn around and say well, even though I find the Government lost, they are substantially justified."
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,524.174,530.889,I think judges very frequently decide one way but acknowledge to themselves that the case was not an easy one.
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,533.747,550.615,"We certainly do not argue that every case can be resolved by objective indicators either of reasonableness or of unreasonableness, and when there are no such objective indicators, we simply think that the lower court's approach in looking at the totality of the circumstances is the best way to proceed at this point in implementing EAJA."
1987.86-1512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,550.615,563.798,"Mr. Merrill, do you agree with the Respondent that in every case, the Government has the burden of proof on the question of whether its position was substantially justified?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,563.798,565.156,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, we do agree with that."
1987.86-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.499,579.215,"Mr. Merrill, I can understand your search for objective indicators when the objective indicators are those that pre-existed the Government's action in a suit."
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,623.23,630.665,"It has no bearing on the... it didn't motivate the Government, clearly, to do what they did, by definition."
1987.86-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.393,695.734,Do you ever think you could win a case that it was unreasonable to litigate?
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,695.734,699.842,Excuse me?
1987.86-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.842,711.885,"Don't you think it is possible to begin litigation which is unreasonable, and you were foolish to do it, but for some reason, something comes up, a new argument is developed, and you win?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,713.088,714.416,"Yes, that is quite possible."
1987.86-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.416,729.27,"Well, if that is so, then, then if even winning the case does not prove that you were reasonable to begin it in the first place, how can the mere fact that some of the judges thought you should have won it prove that you were reasonable to bring it in the first place?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,729.27,740.97,"Well, subsequent developments, I think, are highly probative in the context where the basic legal issues are the same when the subsequent rulings come down as they were when the initial decision was made."
1987.86-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.357,794.887,Like the Supreme Court changing its mind.
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,804.555,805.571,--Yes.
1987.86-1512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.811,852.946,"If you can't take into consideration any subsequent events like lawsuits analyzing the Government's contentions, and the Court opinion, then I suppose that the District Court deciding has simply got to study the law as it existed and almost make a brand new lawsuit out of the thing."
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,852.946,854.259,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1987.86-1512,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,901.542,911.192,What consideration are you giving a hypothetical case where everybody agrees that you cannot lose... and you lose?
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,911.192,914.3,"--What do you mean, Justice Marshall, by everybody?"
1987.86-1512,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,915.706,916.971,No.
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,952.536,953.144,That's right.
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.157,1049.202,"But isn't it true on the stay, just reflecting, I don't remember the particular application, but this is a case that involved a great deal of money, did it not?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1050.952,1052.872,--It involved $60 million.
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1052.872,1063.384,"And it was perfectly clear that if the judgments were not stayed, the money would be disbursed and it couldn't have been recovered, which is a very powerful reason for granting a stay without looking too closely at the merits."
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1063.384,1063.743,Yes.
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.743,1065.071,The Government also comes in in these cases.
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1068.288,1070.069,I don't know.
1987.86-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1074.131,1078.066,"You would like it to be, and would not want to discourage that, would you?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1078.066,1079.723,"No, not at all."
1987.86-1512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1109.351,1118.379,"Mr. Merrill, was that view of when we grant stays clear in the 1970s at the time this particular stay was entered?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1122.831,1125.002,"There is some discussion of that in the briefs, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-1512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1161.209,1162.939,"Well, I think that is perfectly clear now."
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1172.499,1177.31,"Well, I think the dispersal of the money probably was a substantial factor."
1987.86-1512,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1177.31,1180.183,"Isn't there another factor, too, Mr. Merrill, in all candor?"
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1209.923,1215.748,"Well, perhaps we could have a judgment by the Solicitor General to be an objective indicator of reasonableness in these cases, too, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.748,1227.759,"--On the grant of the stay, the mere fact that the Solicitor General has been willing to apply for a stay shows that the Solicitor General thought it was a close question, and he is a reasonable person."
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1265.182,1275.474,"Well, I think Congress clearly did not intend that any judgment by the Solicitor General or by any responsible Cabinet Officer would be, by definition, a reasonable act under EAJA."
1987.86-1512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1284.971,1312.881,"Mr. Merrill, I have a little concern that if we were to place the amount of weight that you would have us place on a grant of certiorari or a stay here, which, as has been indicated, we often do out of substantial deference to the request of the Solicitor General, that we would have to change our posture on that if we knew that then that was going to be determinative in a later fee application under EAJA."
1987.86-1512,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1314.895,1323.064,"We certainly would not want the Court to change its standards in response to attorneys' fee litigation, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-1512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1535.31,1536.841,"Thank you, Mr. Merrill."
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1538.37,1543.273,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.499,1648.154,I take it that means there were two appeals to the Court of Appeals?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1648.154,1649.028,That is correct.
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.028,1653.308,And the Government did not appeal the adverse rulings from the other eight District Judges?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1653.308,1661.478,There were other appeals pending which were abandoned and remanded at the time of the settlement of all of the nationwide actions on the operating subsidy issue.
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.478,1672.708,"But at any rate, of all the District Court judgments against the Government, only two were appealed, and in both of those, only two finally produced Opinions in the Courts of Appeals, and both those were adverse to the Government?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1672.708,1676.424,The Government appealed every judgment below that it could.
1987.86-1512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.295,1685.827,Excuse me.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1694.481,1699.775,--I believe there were appeals pending in eight cases.
1987.86-1512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.066,1719.75,"Do you think the Congress meant, and you say the prototype it had in mind was the Government keeps litigating a matter it has lost."
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1736.432,1736.792,No.
1987.86-1512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.82,1789.068,"Do you think that Committee Report is binding on us as to the meaning of ""substantially justification""?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1789.068,1796.332,"I think that Committee Report is very strong evidence of what Congress meant when it said ""substantial justification""."
1987.86-1512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.332,1799.689,Do you think the rest of Congress knew what that case was?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1807.014,1816.541,I know that this Court has said that Committee Reports are the best source of legislative history because you assume that Members of Congress know the law and know what is in the Committee Reports.
1987.86-1512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.541,1819.025,Surely it has to depend on what the Report says.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1831.193,1834.77,It is the best source we have to determine what Congress may have meant.
1987.86-1512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.77,1836.425,Which may mean we don't have a good source.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1836.425,1840.767,I understand there is a split in the Court on this issue.
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.162,1963.53,"What if the Committee Report, Ms. Burdick, had said, what if the statute said in so many words, Congress directs the courts to award attorneys' fees to the prevailing litigants in all of these particular cases?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1965.952,1975.402,"I think that would be very strong evidence that that was Congress' intent that when the Government persisted in litigating the way it did the operating subsidy case, that fees were appropriate."
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.402,1982.274,"Can Congress tell a court, with respect to a specific case, that we want you to each thus and such a result?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1982.274,1983.352,"No, it cannot."
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.66,1998.55,Which are now before us.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,1998.55,1999.066,Yes.
1987.86-1512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.066,2002.689,Was it the same Congress that wrote this Report that had adopted the language?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2017.198,2018.837,"No, it was not."
1987.86-1512,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2018.837,2042.874,"Do we also need to look at the underlying litigation issue in litigation to know whether the Government's position was reasonable, and look at such things as the fact that the language was permissive rather than mandatory, and so forth, in the statute, to determine whether that was reasonable to litigate?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2042.874,2052.48,"In any equal access case, I believe the District Court Judge does have to unavoidably re-examine the strength and weakness of the Government's case."
1987.86-1512,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2052.48,2053.855,"Must we do so, too?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2057.807,2058.728,"No, I do not."
1987.86-1512,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2067.054,2074.894,"But of necessity, we will have to know what our standard of review is or we couldn't apply the proper one here."
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2077.799,2084.014,"I believe the Ninth Circuit used the proper standard, which was not de novo but abuse of discretion."
1987.86-1512,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2084.014,2089.154,"Well, what if it is really a question of law?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2089.154,2092.496,It is not really a question of law.
1987.86-1512,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2110.256,2116.269,What is our standard of review if it is a mixed question of law and fact?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2116.269,2136.166,"I think the analysis has turned on what are the practical implications of having a de novo review or leaving the initial determination appropriately with the District Court Judge, which was analyzed, I believe, fairly well in the amicus brief of the Alliance for Justice, ACLU, and I would join in the arguments that they made there on these practical implications."
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.4,2181.789,Wasn't that partly the nature of the case?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2201.782,2202.641,Not necessarily.
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2324.343,2332.198,Was part of the Ninth Circuit's or the District Court's reliance on this the fact that it was a lawsuit against the Government as opposed to somebody else?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2332.198,2344.772,I think the idea was that the suit was against a party who could be expected to bring substantial resources and who had already evidenced that they intended to take the case as far as they could go on appeal.
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2344.772,2350.425,"But that would be an argument in every EAJA case, because all you get attorneys' fees from is the Government."
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2350.425,2356.782,"But in the majority of EAJA cases, the issue is simply disability payments."
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.882,2393.175,"So then it was not used as a factor simply that this was a case against the Government, but it was this particular kind of case against the Government?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2393.175,2393.644,That's right.
1987.86-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2395.769,2399.158,Let me ask you a question there.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2412.341,2416.699,"Well, interestingly enough, no one grabbed on to this case except our program."
1987.86-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2416.699,2421.838,So you seem to be arguing in the second part of your argument that it is really a tough case.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2423.494,2430.537,"What made it tough was first, that the Government had decided to use it a test case, so that it became protracted and difficult."
1987.86-1512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.537,2436.441,That still doesn't make it a hard case.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2441.065,2451.155,What made it a hard case was the fact that it evolved into a six-year settlement process which required Plaintiff's counsel to undertake what the District Court Judge said was--
1987.86-1512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.155,2453.279,Your chance of losing still wasn't very great.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2455.95,2459.839,--The fact that we are going to be paid should be irrelevant.
1987.86-1512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.603,2478.473,"I know, but didn't the District Court take into consideration other factors that the availability of attorneys?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2478.473,2479.988,"Yes, the District Court did."
1987.86-1512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.988,2481.502,What do you think about that?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2481.502,2486.5,"It is clear that Congress intended, first of all, that there be other factors, having adopted the language--"
1987.86-1512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.5,2489.608,"Well, how about these factors that the District Court mentioned?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2489.608,2497.106,"--In this instance, the legislative history does not tell us if the paradigm examples that Congress had in mind--"
1987.86-1512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2497.106,2501.027,What do you think about these factors that the District Court used?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2501.027,2504.182,--I think the factors the District Court used were exactly what Congress had in mind.
1987.86-1512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.415,2513.928,"If the Government's case was so weak, how can you get enhancement over $75.00 because it is so tough?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2513.928,2523.72,"--Because the case, by the time it ended, after six years of settlement administration, proved to be difficult, complex--"
1987.86-1512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.72,2525.049,That just means it was protracted.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2525.049,2526.719,--It wasn't protracted.
1987.86-1512,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.06,2536.043,"You mean there was a pretty good chance you would lose, Plaintiffs would lose?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2536.043,2538.027,"No, there was no chance we were going to lose."
1987.86-1512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.557,2552.85,"Is the conclusion of this discussion that you can never get enhancement in EAJA cases, since the only time you get fees at all is when the Government's case is not substantially justified?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2552.85,2561.239,"That is the logical extension of the Government's argument, that if the Government is not substantially justified, you necessarily are going to lose."
1987.86-1512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2561.239,2566.847,There must be some cases in which even though the Government is not substantially justified it is not an easy case.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2567.578,2569.406,Whether it is an easy case or not--
1987.86-1512,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2569.406,2571.248,"It doesn't make a lot of sense, but it has to be, doesn't it?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2571.248,2581.76,"--Congress intended that there would be cases where Plaintiff's counsel would be awarded more than $75.00 per hour, because it expressly said, if there are special factors, more shall be awarded."
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2756.423,2761.608,Do you mean because it makes it difficult?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2761.608,2763.388,"No, that's not what I mean."
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2763.388,2765.232,What was difficult about it?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2765.232,2767.106,Let me give you a few examples.
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2789.864,2792.065,"What did you do, other than go back and forth to Court?"
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2794.423,2796.266,"--No, we didn't do any research."
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2796.266,2798.313,All you did was go to court.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2798.313,2800.764,Let me give an example of what we did outside of court.
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2820.977,2822.288,How long did that take?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2822.288,2827.397,--The settlement was signed in 1979 and the first checks were mailed out in 1981.
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2827.397,2829.161,How long did it take to do what you were just talking about?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2829.161,2830.831,About three months.
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2830.831,2832.143,Three months?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2832.143,2834.221,"For reviewing the claims, coming up with the--"
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2834.221,2834.877,How many claims?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2834.877,2835.58,--Pardon?
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2835.58,2837.75,How many claims in three months?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2837.75,2841.218,I believe that we reviewed several hundred claims.
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2841.218,2842.874,In three months?
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2842.874,2852.543,Then we came up during that same period with a procedures manual that the accounting firm could use what would give them guidelines as to what evidence was acceptable and what was not.
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2867.817,2872.644,It's a shame that the courts can't get paid like everybody else does in this.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2872.644,2881.75,"In closing, I would like to urge the Court to highlight the deference that should be given to the district courts' findings on attorneys' fees."
1987.86-1512,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2885.343,2886.671,That is a problem.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2886.671,2888.512,--fewer appeals will be taken.
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2900.492,2904.428,The Court of Appeals here didn't totally defer to the District Court's award.
1987.86-1512,1,35504,mary_s_burdick,,2906.74,2907.881,That is right.
1987.86-1512,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2924.156,2926.342,"Thank you, Mr. Burdick."
1987.86-1512,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2929.028,2944.631,Let me first briefly address the three factors that Respondents have relied on from the legislative history in support of a finding that the Government was no substantially justified in this case.
1987.86-1512,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.848,3198.83,"Was this realistically the kind of case in which, apart from EAJA, you could get lawyers to handle except on a pro bono basis?"
1987.86-1512,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3198.83,3203.219,"--No, I don't think it really is, without EAJA or some other basis for--"
1987.86-1512,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3203.219,3208.014,"But isn't the fact that there are no pro bono lawyers available, doesn't that satisfy the statutory requirement?"
1987.86-1512,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3208.014,3209.483,"--We don't think so, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1512,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3237.255,3239.816,"Thank you, Mr. Merrill."
