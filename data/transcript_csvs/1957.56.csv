1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,37.571,44.683,"In your petition for certiorari, there was no mentioned, of course, about it not being raised."
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,74.618,75.274,We did.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,75.274,76.692,Where was it first raised?

1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,224.459,227.071,"Well, it was so treated and they argued it."
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,241.773,277.495,"Yes, but you're -- you're saying here, Mr. Atkins the honorable trial court erred in admitting the statements of the defendants Nelson, Hatton and Craig when seasonably objected to because said statements were largely irrelevant and immaterial and were conclusions of the district attorney obtained by means of cross-examination, oppression, mental cruelty and the rest and obtained in violation of the Bill of Rights and of the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth -- and Fifth Amendments."
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,289.308,290.087,"Yes, sir."
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,290.087,297.005,Well now -- then you can't very well say that this refers to the jury question can you?
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,297.005,322.022,"But having -- having submitted the two questions as being matters that pertain to their constitutional rights then would not to this Court under its rules to have a right to -- to grant it on the other assignment, to the exclusion of this assignment having jurisdiction conferred by reason of the matter originating in the trial court and on to the Supreme Court."
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,322.022,342.277,"Well, Mr. Atkins, you can't raise a federal constitution question as to the admissibility of confessions, as one question and expected to hold over on the -- on the question to whether your jury was properly impaneled, can you?"
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,342.277,344.559,Accepting in -- in this situation.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,344.559,346.501,Without raising it?
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,346.501,348.37,"Yes, but I think I have."
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,348.37,351.187,Where -- I put now all -- I don't want to argue this with you.
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,351.187,351.304,"I know, Your Honor."
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,351.304,358.064,All I want to find out is where you raised these questions and where it is in the record?

1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,358.19,360.998,"Now, are those the only two places?"
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,360.998,368.707,That and then I filed a petition with the Supreme Court of our State in which are stated in the petition.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,368.707,370.975,Where is -- where do I find that in the record?
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,370.975,376.235,It isn't -- it isn't printed in the record but it's a part of the record.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,376.235,380.233,And what do you -- what -- what do you raise there?
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,380.233,383.73,That the defendants allowed -- let me read if that will (Voice Overlap) --
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,383.73,385.814,Yes.
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,385.814,388.33,It isn't -- it isn't in the printed record.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,405.113,412.305,Of course you got to show on printed record how you raise the -- raise the federal question or we can't determine whether it was raised.
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,412.305,415.118,"That's true -- that's true, Your Honor."
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,547.855,551.197,May I ask what -- what you're reading from there?
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,551.197,574.057,"I'm reading from a petition filed with the Supreme Court at the -- at Knoxville, petitioning that Court who suspend this judgment until it could be reviewed in this Court and to allow these men bail or while the cost was pending."
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,574.057,580.456,Well -- well you -- you can't raise the federal question on an application for bail.
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,587.858,591.455,"But, if Your Honor please, the question was presented."
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,593.744,595.475,Now where was it presented?
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,595.475,595.51,At the --
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,595.51,603.001,Show me in the record some place please so we can -- so we can determine whether it's before us.
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,603.001,606.233,"Well, in the -- in the brief that the state filed."
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,606.233,607.28,I beg your pardon.
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,607.28,611.059,"In the brief that the state filed, in the brief filed in this Court."
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,611.059,623.153,"Well, we're talking about what happened before you came to this Court because under the rules of this Court, we don't hear those matters unless a federal question is adequately raised below."
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,623.153,623.611,Well that --
1957.56,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,623.611,635.074,The Supreme Court of Tennessee discussed (Inaudible)
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,635.074,650.486,It was presented in this way that the State has rights but it also had an obligation that is that the State Court agreed that these were errors.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,650.486,651.114,That what?
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,651.114,656.916,That the two errors or two assignments that we have insisted on were errors.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,656.916,658.559,So that was under the state law?
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,660.167,661.687,They're errors under both cases.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,661.687,670.251,"Now, will you show us in the opinion of the -- of the Court where they considered this question and decided it?"
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,685.345,701.917,In the opinion has such it -- the reason why it was error is not given but the reason that it was error is because it violated their rights.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,733.883,740.477,"Well, did they cite any federal cases or -- or mentioned the constitutional section?"
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,740.477,750.005,They didn't mention either constitution or either section.
1957.56,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,750.005,755.401,This isn't the question of (Inaudible)
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,755.401,763.294,They -- they decided that those were errors but didn't say why.
1957.56,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,763.294,765.018,(Inaudible)
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,765.018,772.519,They didn't give the basis for the decision.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,772.519,789.795,"Well, it would be one thing if you could show us where you raised it and they didn't discussed it perhaps where they neither discussed it nor can you show where you raised it -- it raises most serious question Mr. Atkins as to whether you hear it properly or not."
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,789.795,826.405,"If Your Honor please, we -- the assignments of error of the Supreme Court and the argument on those assignments, the two assignments that is the assignment pertaining to the impaneling of the jury and the assignment pertaining to the -- the obtaining of the confession were presented as one assignment of rights that were violated."
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,879.682,879.818,"Yes, but that's --"
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,879.818,880.904,"Now, those are the same --"
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,880.904,889.753,"Mr. Atkins, that refers to the petition in this Court not as to anything that happened below this Court."
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,899.064,899.223,Yes.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,899.223,904.289,So that can't help you any so far as what happened before you came here.
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,917.356,921.585,"Then on page, if Your Honor please, on pages 9."

1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,934.934,944.279,"Well, I know but that doesn't -- what they relied on doesn't mean what you raised (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,944.279,944.977,That's -- that's true.
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,944.977,952.395,"Perhaps we could -- Mr. Atkins, I wonder if we could hear from the other side for just a few moments on this and then you can resume your argument."
1957.56,0,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,952.395,952.493,Well --
1957.56,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,952.493,969.574,I won't take all your time but I -- I would likely want to straighten out.

1957.56,2,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,1244.228,1258.368,"If Your Honors please, the assignments of error in our appellate court are the same as the motion for a new trial."

1957.56,2,26459,hobart_f_atkins,,1340.212,1350.532,You Honor that would be a useless statement to -- to go ahead say the constitution and then say of the Federal Constitution and the State Constitution.
