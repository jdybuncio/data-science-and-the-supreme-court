1975.74-6212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.673,"We will hear arguments next in 74-6212, Norton against Matthews."
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,15.396,18.129,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-6212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,37.643,41.404,We will try not to have any questions across that division.
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,42.143,42.559,Fine.
1975.74-6212,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,363.985,370.277,"But in order to get in under the APA, you have to show that the statutory remedy otherwise provided is inadequate?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,370.277,371.418,That is true.
1975.74-6212,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,476.209,486.628,"Well, is it not though that perhaps the more accurate question to ask is whether the injunctive authority that is as you say is generally available to the District Courts."
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,501.542,501.942,Okay.
1975.74-6212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,626.073,633.301,"Will that injunction be very useful, if the case was on review?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,649.328,671.946,"Well, then the government would have to come in and fight against the preliminary injunction motion and they would balance the equities in that situation, and either win or they lose or if the decision was issued favorably to the individual claimant, the way normal cases work, that claimant gets the fruits of their victory at that point, unless the other side comes in and requests a stay, pending appeal."
1975.74-6212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,671.946,675.461,Was that not very often the case?
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,675.461,677.515,"Indeed, that is the case."
1975.74-6212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,721.12,731.126,"Then because when the stay application is presented at this level, an evaluation is made of the probabilities?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,731.126,733.237,"Indeed, you would have to show a strong (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-6212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,733.237,736.275,"It is a little -- it is a little difficult to generalize about this, is it not?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,736.275,739.602,"Indeed, you would have to make a strong likelihood of success on the merits."
1975.74-6212,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,760.258,767.045,"May I ask, I gather this is an argument that there is this equity power of the District Court?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,767.045,767.667,This is correct.
1975.74-6212,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,767.667,775.898,"And that affirm, reverse or modify in no way reduced that power --"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,775.898,776.163,That is correct.
1975.74-6212,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,776.163,777.778,"-- or curtail, is that it?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,777.778,777.913,That is correct.
1975.74-6212,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,777.913,795.535,"You do not -- you are not making an argument that one may construe, affirm, modify or reverse, although you did say earlier something about a reversal might in some instances, tantamount to injunction, but this is not an argument and that any of those words should be interpreted as embracing that power?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,795.535,796.614,"You are correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-6212,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,802.946,804.424,I just do not understand.
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,815.889,816.926,That is correct.
1975.74-6212,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.258,864.844,You I presume you are speaking with respect to people who are parties to the litigation?
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,864.844,871.628,"Well, with respect to retroactive benefits, I am talking about the parties, the named the plaintiffs in litigation as well as the class."
1975.74-6212,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.628,877.705,A class consisting of people who had made claims to the Secretary and who had made them within 60 days?
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,877.705,879.005,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-6212,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.601,925.187,"Well, even if they had not applied for benefits within 60 days, if they would be members of a class, I suppose the class member filing might be tantamount to a filing for them, but at least the class could not embrace people whose claims had been denied by the Secretary more than 60 days before the class member filed."
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,925.187,926.481,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-6212,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,971.289,986.533,But can the court not make that whole class whole simply by setting aside the order of the Secretary with respect to each member of the class?
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,986.533,995.4,"Well, what would be you are saying is another word other than injunction, that would be used to define what the District Court would do, and that would be setting aside."
1975.74-6212,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,995.4,1005.734,"Well, an injunction says to the Secretary as I conceive it, “This provision is unconstitutional and you are barred from enforcing it.”"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1028.29,1034.762,The court also say that the whole class of claimants should be awarded benefits in the same manner.
1975.74-6212,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1034.762,1045.877,"Well, certainly If the class were uniformed, properly a class, the court could say that the awards in each of the cases are set aside?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1045.877,1051.727,I would have no difficult -- the word “set aside” I do not believe in the statute just as the word injunction is not in the statute.
1975.74-6212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1051.727,1062.153,That does involve the basic jurisdictional question of this Court and presumably that could be done by a Single-Judge Federal District Court?
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1062.153,1063.516,"I understand that, Your Honor."
1975.74-6212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1063.516,1081.812,"Now, on the other hand, if the holding were as my brother Rehnquist suggests that the statutory provision upon which the Secretary relied was unconstitutional, then I suppose there would still be a direct appeal of this Court under the other statutory provision, 1252, would it not?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1081.812,1082.869,Correct and that is why Lucas is here.
1975.74-6212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1082.869,1088.066,"But of course in this case, the holding was the opposite way on the merits?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1088.066,1099.625,"The problems that I have with getting relief and making the class whole is by something not called injunction, but instead called setting aside of the decisions of the Secretary for a whole class are as follows."
1975.74-6212,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1171.342,1185.72,"Why do you think that the Congress then show us this particular language, affirming, modifying or reversing the order of the Secretary as the method by which the Secretary’s decisions would be judicially reviewed?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1185.72,1193.625,"Well, I am not -- it seems to be the primary method by which the Secretary’s decisions are to be reviewed."
1975.74-6212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1209.027,1214.067,Quite a lot of these doubts you are suggesting pretty well resolved in the Salfi opinion?
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1231.772,1233.443,Let me say this.
1975.74-6212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1240.185,1245.219,How many readings to that test?[Laughter]
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1245.219,1254.928,"Salfi does not indicate in any way except with one slight exception which I will touch upon, that for instance, there is no way in which you can get injunctive relief."
1975.74-6212,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.939,1347.126,"Well, you are going with Salfi -- you are not suggesting though that the District Court would have, prior to enjoying the operation of the act of Congress, generally against anybody is not enough for you to say that it is not inconsistent with the judicial review provisions for the court to in effect enjoin the operation -- to set aside the award or to set aside the denial of the award on the ground that the Act is unconstitutional?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1352.906,1353.456,That is enough.
1975.74-6212,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.165,1385.51,"But, do you think that the setting aside a judgment of the Secretary on the ground that he acted under is unconstitutional, does that amount to an injunction?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1385.51,1397.005,I think that it amounts to injunction if there is the same bite that order would have which an injunction has which means that something has to begin happening now or payments have to start to be made now and payments would have to be made to the whole class.
1975.74-6212,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.519,1403.587,"Well, what does it imply?"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1403.587,1416.339,"I presume, Justice Rehnquist has suggested this, and it would seem that if you use the word “set aside” and treated them like an injunction, there are cases that this Court established that you have to then have a Three-Judge Court."
1975.74-6212,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.612,1431.695,"The Secretary acts under a statute and says that your claim is erroneous because the statute bars it and the Court says, “That statute is on the constitution, you cannot bar them for that reason."
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1447.48,1453.486,You are saying that an individual ordered to set aside a case would not in effect stop the enforcement of an Act.
1975.74-6212,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.486,1465.05,"Well, I mean, the statute says in an injunction restraining the enforcement or the operation of the statute as well as --"
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1465.05,1468.17,I understand your point and I would agree with that point.
1975.74-6212,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1468.17,1470.247,That in turn is set aside is probably unfortunate.
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1474.571,1475.909,That is quite probable.
1975.74-6212,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1479.839,1483.963,Now you saying reversed is tantamount to what?
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1483.963,1492.937,"Your Honor, I think if pressed to my hardest argument, I would say that reverse includes to give injunctive relief or that kind of -- I do not think that I am pressed to that point."
1975.74-6212,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1492.937,1495.86,Does a Three-Judge court would be required to do it?
1975.74-6212,0,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1495.86,1496.45,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-6212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1525.934,1528.599,Very well.
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1532.645,1535.777,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-6212,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1703.557,1739.807,"It has been suggested that if an individual claimant appeals the Secretary’s decision, after having exhausted his administrative remedies, ask for a review of that in a District Court upon the ground that the statutory provision upon which the Secretary relied in denying the claim is an unconstitutional provision that that is the functional equivalent of requesting a District Court to enjoin that statutory provision, and therefore, a Three-Judge Court is required."
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1744.082,1754.575,"Well, if his argument is that a reversal of a denial of benefits on the grounds that the statutory classification is unconstitutional is in fact an injunction --"
1975.74-6212,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.575,1759.471,"It is a functional equivalent of an injunction, he seem to phrase it, but that is what I understood he was saying?"
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1759.471,1773.07,"It may have the same consequences as an injunction as to the individual plaintiff, but it certainly is not an injunction in the sense that Section 2282 of the judicial code refers to injunctions."
1975.74-6212,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.675,1783.323,(Inaudible) at least it might (Inaudible) with respect to the entire class?
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1783.323,1788.836,That is a question that I was going to reserve until I reached the discussion of the class action aspects.
1975.74-6212,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1788.836,1793.725,"(Voice Overlap) or for everybody in that judicial district until it is reserved or stayed, would it not?"
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1793.725,1796.987,"Well, the district judges in that court might disagree, but it is --"
1975.74-6212,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1796.987,1798.879,It is all the effect that an injunction could have?
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1798.879,1814.209,"But it is certainly true that if a District Court or a Court of Appeals exercising purely legal and non-equitable powers, holds a statute unconstitutional, that is the law for that district or that Court Appeals, that circuit."
1975.74-6212,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.469,1839.199,"I have thought that in a typical Three-Judge Court situation that -- you need is a Three-Judge court just, even though you only challenge the application of the statute in a particular case, Duncan v. Walker?"
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1839.199,1840.126,I think that --
1975.74-6212,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.126,1843.692,Is that right or not?
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1843.692,1845.163,I did not think that that was right.
1975.74-6212,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.57,1866.16,"Suppose I would go into court to enjoin and claim that as applied to me, to this set of facts, this statute is unconstitutional."
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1875.463,1876.546,I think not.
1975.74-6212,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1876.546,1879.505,"Well, your answer would be yes to the injunction?"
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1879.505,1881.079,He has not stated that yet.
1975.74-6212,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.079,1887.826,Yes and he wants an injunction against its application to him?
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1887.826,1895.607,"Well then, that kind of injunctive -- I guess the frank answer is that I am not sure Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-6212,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1895.607,1897.565,What constitution was applied?
1975.74-6212,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.565,1907.22,"And yet in a declaratory judgment, expressing that a precise same proposition of law, it does not require a Three-Judge Court?"
1975.74-6212,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.22,1909.65,"Well, that is true even if you declare (Inaudible) on its face?"
1975.74-6212,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1909.65,1911.823,Yes.
1975.74-6212,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.823,1913.782,"So, that is not really involved."
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1928.192,1938.935,"And the argument is that even though, as in Lucas, for example, it may be a reversal, nevertheless, it is a reversal that is equivalent to an injunction."
1975.74-6212,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1940.849,1953.771,"Well, the Secretary's decision goes out -- the Secretary’s decision goes out the window and may not be enforced because the statute is unconstitutional?"
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1953.771,1955.162,As to this individual.
1975.74-6212,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.162,1955.912,Exactly.
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1955.912,1975.483,"But, that is not the kind of injunction that prevents the Secretary from -- and a decision by the District Court reversing the denial of benefits as in Lucas is not the kind of decision that disrupts the operation of the Act as to other parties."
1975.74-6212,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2000.207,2017.565,"But if you were going to analogize the reversing because the Section was unconstitutional to some other form of more traditional relief than that contemplated in 405, could you not just as easily analogize it to a declaratory judgment as to an injunction?"
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2017.565,2021.395,I think it would be more accurately and that will.
1975.74-6212,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2063.868,2069.884,(Inaudible) numerous decisions of this Court saying that that statute should be very narrowly construed?
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2069.884,2074.237,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.74-6212,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.237,2087.282,"Mr. Jones, am I correct in understanding, I suppose it is obvious, the District Court here is exercising original jurisdiction rather than an appellant jurisdiction, is it not? The word “reverse” is somewhat unusual for a District Court?"
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2087.282,2095.237,Although there are many circumstances in which a district in effect has a review of authority over administrative agency.
1975.74-6212,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2095.237,2100.674,"But the order, when it is changed is -- the District Court does not in effect enter an order for the Secretary."
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2103.163,2108.797,"Well, it reverses the decision of the Secretary, denying the benefits."
1975.74-6212,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.524,2126.58,"Other than this statute, does the District Court have jurisdiction to reverse orders?"
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2132.614,2139.105,I am not sure what the review provisions with regard to other administrative agencies is.
1975.74-6212,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.857,2270.073,"What happens Mr. Jones, if the Secretary says, “Well, it is a fine decision,” I am just not going to enforce it and I am just -- somebody will have to do something to me pretty bad about that decision."
1975.74-6212,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2272.599,2274.28,"No, certainly not."
1975.74-6212,2,18359,c_christopher_brown,,3108.226,3122.007,"The class that we ask would be defined practically in the same term as the class that was requested and granted in the Jimenez II case, which Mr. Justice Stevens authored for the Seventh Circuit quite recently."
1975.74-6212,3,33866,keith_a_jones,,3136.753,3137.664,Authored.
1975.74-6212,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3217.073,3218.739,Very well.
