1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.296,We will hear argument next in Adams v. Texas.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,49.794,53.424,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,147.521,165.844,"You are suggesting that there is a gray zone of some kind here where a juror, a prospective juror might be influenced by the fact that the death penalty was involved or, on the other hand, might not be?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,165.844,179.027,"I'm suggesting that as long as the juror is willing to state ""I can vote death in the right case,"" that juror is qualified vis-a-vis his feelings about the death penalty."
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,179.027,189.765,"By the right case, taking that phrase, does that mean the right case as he sees it or the right case as within the framework of the instructions of the court?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,189.765,204.902,"It means the right case under the evidence within the framework of the instructions given by the court and as he views the facts, because he is a personal representative of the community and it is he who must express the community conscience."
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,360.051,377.935,"How do you apply that to Juror White who was examined in the appendix at the upper pages, 20, 25, 27, somewhere in there?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,377.935,386.789,Juror White specifically qualified under Witherspoon on page 26 in our opinion.
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,402.486,405.456,Didn't he have a little more there?
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,415.242,418.097,"Yes, that's correct."
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,418.655,422.789,Does that suggest that he doesn't want to impose it?
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,422.789,429.629,"It may suggest it, but I think that Juror White was not absolutely disqualified under Witherspoon."
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,436.19,450.237,Look at his answer at the bottom of page 27 and the question and his answer at the top of page 28.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,450.237,453.66,It is still equivocal.
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,513.03,535.368,"After the last answer of the juror that you have just referred to, Juror White said it would probably affect me in my deliberations, and then the judge said would it be fair then to say that you cannot give us your assurance that you would not be affected by the punishment of life or death in deliberating on the facts of this case."
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,544.735,546.319,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,586.8,594.301,But both of the two questions just asked you by the Chief Justice were posed by the court and not by the prosecuting attorney.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,594.301,602.049,I don't think it matters whether the court uses 1231(b) in violation of Witherspoon or whether it is the prosecutor.
1979.79-5175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,614.455,622.919,"Well, suppose all we had was the colloquy on page 28 of the appendix, the question by the court, ""All right."
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,637.032,640.54,Does it rest on that?
1979.79-5175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,640.54,654.501,"That was the sole colloquy that the court had with Juror White or anybody else had with Juror White, do you think it would have been a violation of the federal Constitution to exclude Juror White for cause?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,654.501,656.154,Most assuredly.
1979.79-5175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.449,679.03,"What if the next question said though, what do you mean by affect."
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,698.107,699.316,It hurts me.
1979.79-5175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,699.316,703.232,"I know, but could the juror then be excluded?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,703.232,704.876,That makes all the difference in the world.
1979.79-5175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,710.029,731.367,"Then if the juror said -- if the juror had earlier said well, I think I can answer the question as truthfully and faithfully without regard to my feelings about the death penalty, but ultimately had said what I just suggested he said, then his answers would be just inconsistent, wouldn't they?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,731.367,733.194,They would.
1979.79-5175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.173,748.429,"And yet you think it is not inconsistent between his earlier answers that he could answer these questions fairly and his later answer that, well, my opposition to the death penalty will affect my verdict."
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,751.31,768.952,"I think they are inconsistent and I think the only solution is the same solution that the Fifth Circuit proposed in Burns v. Estelle, there must be continuing inquire rate of that juror to attempt to find out which of the inconsistent positions is the strong position."
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.277,782.358,"This was the last one anyway, wasn't it, and it was the one that the Judge chose to believe?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,782.358,783.516,Juror White?
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.516,785.027,Yes.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,785.027,786.251,Wasn't the last juror.
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.251,790.088,"I know, but this was the last question of Juror White."
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,790.088,793.595,Yes.
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,844.383,847.031,Do you think you should force a juror to say no.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,856.473,876.228,"I think the answers are determined by the questions in the voir dire examination in this case, very clearly, because if you have a person on the witness stand on voir dire examination, the pattern is the same in all of these cases, not only in the Adams case but in all of them."
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,917.375,920.857,"Well, does he belong on the jury?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,920.857,926.15,"Without knowing what that person means, he certainly is not subject to exclusion, whether or not he --"
1979.79-5175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,926.15,934.087,"Well, he certainly wouldn't have meant that I would be more likely to vote guilt because I am opposed to the death penalty."
1979.79-5175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.413,950.932,"Isn't the most likely meaning of affect the second question that Justice White put to you a moment ago, that it will affect in favor of resolving doubts in favor of the defendant, that he would not otherwise resolve under the judge's charge?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,950.932,962.136,"No, I think the voir dire examination shows that a number of the veniremen questioned interpreted the word ""effect"" to mean a heightened sensitivity to the case."
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,980.944,988.83,"Well, do you think that has to be developed with any juror, that he is going to treat a death case differently from a petty theft case?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,988.83,990.901,Do I think it has to be developed?
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,990.901,993.932,"Yes, do you think that needs to be developed the way you suggest it?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,993.932,995.934,Yes.
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,995.934,1000.793,And then interpret the answers as merely expressing a heightened sensitivity?
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1000.793,1012.39,"It is the only way to ascertain whether or not the juror interprets the word ""affect"" as meaning heightened sensitivity or interprets the word ""affect"" as meaning I can't follow the law."
1979.79-5175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1012.553,1018.714,"Then how about Curtis Williams, page 32."
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1039.317,1047.385,"I think, Your Honor, that Mr. Williams is a very weak example of our position."
1979.79-5175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1047.385,1063.579,What about a juror who is asked on voir dire about statutory questions and responds in favor of capital punishment but gives the same sort of affect answers and the defense challenges for cause?
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1074.65,1075.672,I'm not sure I follow the question.
1979.79-5175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1078.873,1081.286,Yes.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1081.286,1085.346,"Well, I don't think the challenge for cause exists in the law."
1979.79-5175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1095.678,1099.595,"But certainly a defendant in Texas has challenges for cause, do they not?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1099.595,1101.859,"Certainly, but I --"
1979.79-5175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1101.859,1110.822,And couldn't one of them be based on the way the particular venireman answered the three questions in the statute under consideration?
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1110.822,1116.585,"Theoretically that is possible, but from a practical standpoint it has never happened to my knowledge."
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.678,1137.435,"Mr. Bruder, let me put it another way."
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1149.443,1151.379,Exactly.
1979.79-5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1151.379,1159.455,And that the Witherspoon rule said could not be excluded.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1161.512,1161.635,Exactly.
1979.79-5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1161.635,1162.566,That is what Witherspoon stood for.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1162.566,1163.585,Exactly.
1979.79-5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1163.585,1172.333,It held that jurors could not be excluded for cause on anything less than what was defined in Witherspoon.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1172.333,1182.223,"Once they meet the threshold test, they are allowed to go on that jury and cannot be struck for any reason which is based upon their personal feelings about the death penalty."
1979.79-5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1182.223,1191.489,"But Witherspoon didn't involve how it would affect their guilt or innocence vote, did it?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1191.489,1194.166,"Yes, it did."
1979.79-5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1194.166,1212.769,"I know, but it didn't say that it was wrong to exclude the juror if he conceded that it might make him more likely to vote for innocence."
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1212.769,1228.194,I think the second prong of the Witherspoon test recites that unless it is shown that the juror will never vote for death or that his feelings will cause him to vote a certain way on the issue of guilt-innocence --
1979.79-5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1228.194,1228.623,Right.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1228.623,1230.435,-- he is then subject to exclusion.
1979.79-5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1230.435,1233.365,It is less than cause him to vote a certain way.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1237.061,1240.446,"An impartial decision, making him biased."
1979.79-5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1240.446,1241.843,On the question of guilt or innocence.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1241.843,1244.006,On the question of guilt or innocence.
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.399,1270.7,"Mr. Bruder, I want to be sure about one other thing."
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1280.418,1287.789,"Your Honor, the remedy as far as this Court is concerned is to vacate the judgment insofar as it imposes the death sentence."
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1289.33,1294.37,So you have answered my question only on the sentence and not on the basic conviction?
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1294.37,1294.589,Right.
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1303.297,1306.495,What would happen in the Texas court if we cavated the death sentence?
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1306.495,1320.286,"The Texas court would have no alternative but to either send it back for a new trial or if the Governor elects to commute his sentence to life then he has no recourse, which has been done in the past."
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.286,1322.304,Do you mean a new trial on guilt or innocence?
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1322.304,1323.5,Yes.
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1334.499,1339.434,"So if we just vacate the death sentence, there is a new trial?"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1339.434,1344.771,A high probability.
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1344.771,1348.431,And yet that is just a quirk of Texas law?
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1348.431,1349.861,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.861,1353.131,"Well, actually we would only send it back for further proceedings, not inconsistent --"
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1353.131,1353.851,Not inconsistent.
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1353.851,1359.661,"-- with our decision, and then it would be up to the Texas courts to say whether it is a new trial on guilt or innocence."
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1359.661,1359.931,That's true.
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.931,1362.885,But you are telling us that the prospect is that there would be.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1362.885,1365.881,There is a very good prospect that there would be.
1979.79-5175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.719,1377.738,And that avoids a new trial on guilt or innocence.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1377.738,1378.037,Right.
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1381.797,1394.912,"What you are saying then is that for the federal law purposes, a decision here in your favor does not affect the validity of the basic conviction."
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1394.912,1396.004,That is correct.
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1396.004,1399.568,And it is only because of the Texas law quirk that it does.
1979.79-5175,0,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,1399.568,1406.956,That is correct.
1979.79-5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1420.745,1425.553,Mr. Becker.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1425.553,1429.253,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-5175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1453.763,1461.332,"General Becker, do you agree with your opponent that the validity of the conviction is not in issue, it is just the death penalty --"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1461.332,1464.089,"Yes, as a constitutional matter, that is correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1518.784,1546.053,"The problem with your statement is that Witherspoon said that jurors could not be excluded for cause unless they unmistakably make clear that their disbelief in capital punishment would prevent them in all cases from imposing it, not could be excluded on either basis, that they could not be excluded constitutionally."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1548.564,1558.102,"Your Honor, section 1231(b) is not aimed at all at excluding jurors solely because they are against the death penalty."
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1724.941,1744.596,"I suppose you would suggest that Witherspoon is beside the point in a sentencing scheme such as you have and although you purport to be following Witherspoon as a parallel track, you really shouldn't have to?"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1744.596,1747.764,"That is precisely so, Mr. Justice White."
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1782.175,1785.293,"Mr. Becker, let me interrupt you."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1795.491,1795.809,Your Honor --
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1795.809,1798.549,Your brief says that categorically.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1798.549,1799.694,Yes.
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.694,1802.377,Now it seems to me you are arguing something quite different.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1802.377,1805.113,"Well, I don't mean to be arguing something quite different."
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.537,1835.96,On page 33 of your brief you state that the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals has held that Witherspoon is applicable to capital cases in Texas.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1835.96,1836.765,Yes.
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1836.765,1842.819,"Are they decisions decided since the statute became effect on January 1, 1974 --"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1842.819,1844.154,"They are, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.154,1845.593,-- was enacted?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1845.593,1848.118,They are under the new statute.
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1848.118,1848.819,They are under the new statute?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1848.819,1849.637,Yes.
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1849.637,1853.981,Then how you can argue that under Texas law Witherspoon does not apply?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1853.981,1862.963,What the Court of Appeals has held is that either a trial conducted in compliance with Witherspoon or in compliance with 1231(b) comports with the Constitution.
1979.79-5175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.093,1889.106,"But it is our province, is it not, as opposed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, to have the final say as to whether a decision of this Court does or does not apply to a particular factual situation in a state court."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1889.106,1891.519,"Quite so, and the idea is growing, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1924.463,1933.55,But don't you have to be arguing that in no one case can you comply with both?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1933.55,1934.649,It would be difficult.
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.649,1939.925,And you don't think the Court of Criminal Appeals said that you had to comply with both?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1939.925,1940.887,"No, No."
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1940.887,1941.852,It is either one?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1941.852,1944.302,"Yes, if a juror is excluded under either one."
1979.79-5175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.981,1961.39,But you do concede I gather then that 1231(b) would exclude some people that Witherspoon would not?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1961.39,1963.064,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1963.064,1965.316,Or that it would qualify some people that Witherspoon would not.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1967.19,1968.05,"Yes, Your Honor, both."
1979.79-5175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1968.05,1976.611,"And Witherspoon would say, as it did say, it could not be eliminated from the jury for cause."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1976.611,1977.0,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1977.0,1979.536,"That is what Witherspoon said, it was a negative decision."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1979.536,1979.961,Yes.
1979.79-5175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1979.961,1988.045,It said the state is prohibited from excusing from a jury for cause of a venireman unless they make clear the following.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1988.045,1990.786,"Well, the focal point of the inquiry is quite different."
1979.79-5175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1990.786,1994.935,"Witherspoon didn't say what people could be, but it said what people could not be."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,1994.935,2005.669,"Yes, Your Honor, but I think the focal point of what 1231(b) announces is quite different from Witherspoon and necessarily so because of our statute."
1979.79-5175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2011.72,2014.337,"Well, I suppose he is if he is the defendant's brother, too."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2014.337,2015.977,"Yes, and for all sorts of other reasons."
1979.79-5175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2016.208,2017.783,Witherspoon doesn't have anything to do with that.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2017.783,2018.482,"Yes, sir, I know."
1979.79-5175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2069.456,2080.46,"Has anybody, any court in Texas -- certainly the legislature has not -- has any court in Texas explained the meaning of the word ""affect""?"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2080.46,2097.409,"The Court of Criminal Appeals has not spoken upon the meaning of the word ""affect"" Now, I think that this petitioner's death penalty conviction will stand or fall not upon what any Texas statute says nor upon what the Court of Criminal Appeals says, but upon what was done at his trial."
1979.79-5175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2105.834,2111.706,"What is your understanding of the meaning of the word ""affect"" in 1231(b)?"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2111.706,2118.279,Essentially that a juror would be unbiased on the fact questions and deliberations that are at the punishment phase of the trial.
1979.79-5175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2118.279,2122.579,"You mean ""affect"" means impair or distort?"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2122.579,2124.631,"To be biased in deliberations, to be unfair --"
1979.79-5175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2124.631,2129.35,"Well, it is a verb so it means impair or distort or bias or excuse."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2129.35,2132.975,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2256.289,2262.861,"Mr. Becker, I notice you always said prosecutor."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2265.761,2266.662,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2266.662,2269.088,Does he do anything in Texas?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2269.088,2271.049,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2271.049,2284.831,"Well, the question I really want to ask is if we have a juror that is under Witherspoon, can he be disqualified under the Texas statute?"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2284.831,2287.573,If he is qualified under Witherspoon?
1979.79-5175,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.573,2288.837,Yes.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2288.837,2294.233,"Yes, Your Honor, he can be qualified under Witherspoon and disqualified under the Texas statute."
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.446,2471.114,"Mr. Becker, did that juror serve?"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2471.114,2474.536,"No, Your Honor, eventually he was excluded for another reason."
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.536,2479.174,"General Becker, could I ask you a question about the statutory language."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2513.26,2516.215,I have problems with the disqualification of a juror.
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.247,2520.802,Doesn't the statute plainly require his disqualification in that case?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2520.802,2524.963,"Yes, Your Honor, depending upon the interpretation that is given the word ""affect,"" and the answer --"
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.963,2537.341,"He just answers the question no and then he explains his answer and the statute requires -- I may have the negative and the affirmative turned around, but in any event if he gives the wrong answer it seems to me the statute says you must be disqualified."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2537.341,2542.849,"With no further explanation of the word ""affect,"" I have great problems with that voir dire."
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.923,2547.187,Don't you then have a problem with the statute as it is written?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2550.674,2552.189,"No, Your Honor, I don't want to redefine it."
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.009,2575.656,"The only thing that is critical under the statute is unless the prospective juror states under oath, and to say that the juror just can't do that for the reason that the juror interprets the word ""affect"" in the way that most people would interpret the word ""effect"" --"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2575.656,2586.114,"Well, the way that such a voir dire could -- the conviction might be upheld as to view the word ""affect"" that everyone understood that it meant that you could not be unbiased in your deliberations."
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.998,2604.769,But they never do.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2605.69,2607.12,"They did it in this case, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.201,2609.677,"They explained the word ""affect""?"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2609.677,2610.365,Absolutely.
1979.79-5175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.103,2620.671,That is exactly right.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2620.671,2644.83,"They did not, but they explained the process and it is the process that is important, not the definition of the word, and they said the process is you will get the fact questions, you must answer them honestly based upon the evidence, not on some whim you have, not on some subjective conclusion that you've made during the trial, but on the way the law states you must decide the question, that that is what you must do, and if you cannot do that that means that you will be affected."
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.617,2665.012,"I can see how that worked out with some of these jurors, but give me the language on Juror White, where she conceded something about what she could or couldn't do that would --"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2665.012,2666.944,"All right, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2678.69,2680.226,What page of your brief?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2680.226,2682.878,Page 20.
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.878,2683.224,Okay.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2683.224,2685.629,Actually it starts on 19 and 20.
1979.79-5175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2714.623,2723.201,"Your standing, I take it, on how the statute was applied in each case in relation to the questions put and the answers given."
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2723.201,2725.588,"Yes, Your Honor, that is --"
1979.79-5175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2725.588,2740.324,You really can't escape the proposition that was put to you that affect might mean something quite different from what it does in the specific cases set out here.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2740.324,2741.299,"That is true, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.299,2744.13,But we've just got this case.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2744.13,2745.532,That's correct.
1979.79-5175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2745.532,2760.365,"But you think this necessarily means that what she is saying, ""I will be affected,"" and that means to you, because of the form of the question, the context, that she was saying that she could not say that she would come to her conclusions based on the evidence?"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2760.365,2762.447,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-5175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2804.297,2815.025,"Just as a point of information, the language quoted on pages 19 and 20 of your brief, that is from -- is that in the appendix?"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2815.025,2817.818,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1979.79-5175,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2822.948,2825.483,So we have to look at the original record to get the whole flavor of this.
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2825.483,2834.479,"Most certainly, and there are many parts of my brief where the portions we have cited are not in the appendix and, yes, it will be necessary."
1979.79-5175,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2834.479,2835.837,The original record is here?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2835.837,2838.079,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1979.79-5175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2855.127,2856.561,Why are the records here?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2856.561,2858.267,The Court requested them.
1979.79-5175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2858.267,2859.229,We called for the records?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2859.229,2859.983,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2859.983,2861.955,In all those cases?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2861.955,2862.384,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.384,2864.062,And then denied cert or are they held?
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,2864.062,2866.069,They are pending.
1979.79-5175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3004.442,3006.743,"You say so far as you know, no other state does it?"
1979.79-5175,1,20602,douglas_m_becker,,3006.743,3007.715,That's correct.
1979.79-5175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3076.879,3079.073,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Bruder?"
1979.79-5175,2,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,3079.073,3085.619,Just briefly.
1979.79-5175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3164.878,3201.121,"Would your problem be cured, Mr. Bruder, if the judge on his own had instructed the jury that when I describe the statute to you, using the word ""affect,"" what is meant by that is that the possibility of the death penalty will not lead me to vote not guilty in a case which I might otherwise vote guilty, would that take care of it?"
1979.79-5175,2,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,3201.121,3201.363,Are you talking --
1979.79-5175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3201.363,3204.878,"You are defining ""affect"" at least as the judge --"
1979.79-5175,2,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,3204.878,3206.731,You are talking guilt-innocence?
1979.79-5175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3210.243,3211.471,Yes.
1979.79-5175,2,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,3211.471,3228.445,"I think that would -- that may satisfy the second part of the Witherspoon standard on guilt-innocence, and I think a question could be formulated to follow up on 1231(b) that would satisfy the Witherspoon standard."
1979.79-5175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3228.445,3246.409,"Now, if the Court decided that the questions and the answers taken together showed that each of the jurors questioned understood that meaning of the word ""affect"" --"
1979.79-5175,2,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,3246.409,3253.059,But we are talking about such a subjective problem that I can't see how the court can do that.
1979.79-5175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3253.955,3271.081,"I don't know if it could either, but suppose the court did -- is the court free to make this evaluation on the basis of how the juror answered the question?"
1979.79-5175,2,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,3271.081,3273.568,"The court is free to do it, certainly."
1979.79-5175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3294.406,3302.305,What you are saying is that we should go with you and force the state of Texas to amend its statute?
1979.79-5175,2,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,3302.305,3309.926,"Amend its statute or, Your Honor, construe the statute which I suspect is coming right around the corner."
1979.79-5175,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3385.282,3388.393,When was 1231(b) enacted?
1979.79-5175,2,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,3388.393,3399.326,I believe it was enacted as a different penal code article shortly after the Furman decision readopted in the 1974 penal code.
1979.79-5175,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3401.693,3414.746,"So it was reconsidered and readopted, most recently enacted after the establishment in Texas of the legislative system that was approved in the Jurek case."
1979.79-5175,2,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,3414.746,3419.474,"Well, it was enacted along with --"
1979.79-5175,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3419.474,3421.497,It is part and parcel of the Jurek legislation?
1979.79-5175,2,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,3421.497,3421.906,Right.
1979.79-5175,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3421.906,3426.252,It is not an historical survival from an earlier day.
1979.79-5175,2,35491,melvyn_carson_bruder,,3426.252,3426.988,It is not.
1979.79-5175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3431.624,3432.509,"Thank you, gentlemen."
