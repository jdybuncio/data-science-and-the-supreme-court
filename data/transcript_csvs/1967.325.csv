1967.325,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,35.92,"Number 325; James A. Watts Et Al., Petitioners, versus Seward School Board, Et Al."
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,37.117,40.035,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,783.866,788.032,Mr. Kaufmann there's a copy of the open letter in the record somewhere.
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,788.032,793.14,"Sir, the open letter is reprinted at Page 1A of our appendix."
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,802.159,805.421,Right thank you.
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,805.421,843.119,"Now, I say as if the Court -- as it was then defined by statute because after the Supreme Court of Alaska’s first step decision in this case, the Supreme Court of Alaska that the legislature of Alaska thought so ill of that interpretation that they changed the law and that was why the case was originally reversed by this Court to give the Supreme of Alaska a chance to decide whether to give retroactive effect to that new legislation, of course the Supreme Court of Alaska preferred not to give it retroactive effect when that argument was heard."
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,843.119,846.164,Mr. Kaufmann what’s the reference to false Statement?
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,846.164,864.009,"There is a finding by the school, in the findings which are appendix B to our brief, in which they make a finding that there was -- that six of the statements in the open letter were false."
1967.325,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.662,952.652,Well Mr. Kaufmann do you think the school board though is entitled to set up procedures so that accurate information is the information that will be circulated?
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,952.652,953.451,Yes.
1967.325,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.126,992.192,What about the suggestion that apparently the Alaska Supreme Court said one of the reasons for the discharge is the violation of the rule that you are supposed to -- if have any complaints or objections the ways the school is being run taking up administratively first?
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,992.192,994.93,"Yes, sir, we think --"
1967.325,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,994.93,1000.277,And if they had been here and if they had done here perhaps there wouldn’t been misinformation get out to the public.
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1000.277,1013.978,"No sir, it’s not true and in fact it is not true, because these are matters which the record shows are matters which actually had been discussed with the school board."
1967.325,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.708,1019.848,"Yes, but didn’t the Alaska Supreme Court base its ruling partly on the Fegard (ph)."
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1019.848,1021.475,Oh yes sir.
1967.325,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.85,1169.988,But we just have to offset -- you just want us to disagree with the Alaska Supreme Court.
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1169.988,1175.749,"Oh, we don’t -- we are not asking -- no sir we are not asking you to reverse the finding, we are not asking you --"
1967.325,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.749,1181.151,"But the Alaska Supreme Court says there was a violation of this rule, you say there wasn’t."
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1181.151,1182.937,"No sir, no sir it’s not our position."
1967.325,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.937,1183.699,"Well, (Voice Overlap) you just decided."
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1183.699,1185.897,"No sir, it’s not our position."
1967.325,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.475,1200.709,"So it’s a clear cut regulation, it’s just an invalid one."
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1200.709,1201.506,That is correct.
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1233.594,1238.807,"You mean this says only if you have anything you want to take up with the board this is the way you do it, that’s all it says."
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1238.807,1240.749,We think this is like Republic Steel against Maddox.
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1240.749,1243.448,"No, but that’s what you’re saying isn’t it?"
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1246.476,1247.335,That’s right.
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1247.335,1251.634,Deals nothing with except if you want to go to the board this is the way you do it.
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1251.634,1255.982,"Exactly sir, that’s exactly right."
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1255.982,1260.51,"If you don’t want to go to the board, this regulation has nothing whatever to do with it."
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1260.51,1268.202,"That’s right and furthermore, but there’s another aspect of this and that is that this regulation was never applied in practice."
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1288.311,1290.626,Was it to the public or was it addressed to the board?
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1290.626,1294.556,It was addressed to the public and it was called --
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.556,1295.868,Well the way it reads.
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1295.868,1297.566,"It was -- I mean, excuse me, I misspoke."
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1297.566,1300.804,"Just a minute, I can read it here."
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1303.182,1305.462,"That’s right, I’m misspoke."
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1305.462,1308.769,Are you saying that’s not addressed to the board?
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1309.156,1316.824,"No, no, I’m not suggesting, I'm suggesting -- it was all -- it also went to the -- it also went to the public."
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1316.824,1317.983,Of course it went there but not in the public.
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1317.983,1349.378,"I’m saying -- no what I was saying sir, is that there were previous letters from this union, from the teachers, which were actual letters to the school board in which it was never suggested that -- which the denied power for the superintendent and which it was never suggested that these were violations of the regulation, and that the only difference between those letters and this letter is that this one was also distributed to the public."
1967.325,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.449,1362.15,So you think it’s been waived then the regulation? Perfectly clear regulation but it has been waived --
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1362.15,1362.974,What?
1967.325,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.974,1364.964,"Perfectly clear regulation, but it has been waived."
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1364.964,1390.689,"No sir, I think it’s not -- I think it’s a regulation that is vague on it’s face that if it’s not vague that there was an entrapment by the whole practice and further more that there is simply not a right under the First Amendment for one group of public officials to say you can’t go to the public and criticize us without checking with us."
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1390.689,1400.644,"Tell me Mr. Kauffman did the Alaska Supreme Court say whether they believe this was a letter to the school board or letter to public, what did they say?"
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1400.644,1410.865,"Well, I think they said it was letter to the school board, I misspoke it -- I was not suggesting that this was not a letter, but it’s just a terminology."
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1410.865,1413.89,Your argument that the regulation doesn’t apply.
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1413.89,1414.467,Yes sir.
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1414.467,1427.682,"Is that you can’t read this as a letter of the school board, that is a communication to which the regulation would apply, you’ve got to read this as a communication to the general public even though it says local and school."
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1427.682,1445.057,"Sir, my suggestion is that the gravamen of the offenses this case was tried was that this people distributed it to the public, that that was really what they were being tried for and that also this is the interests that’s involved here and that therefore the regulation was not applicable."
1967.325,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1445.057,1458.178,"Well why isn’t that saying then, you say and we should read this as an open letter, even though it says open letter to the school board, it’s really a letter to the public that’s why you said open, is that right?"
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1458.178,1460.303,It certainly was a communication to the public.
1967.325,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1460.303,1467.934,"Well, in effect this was request to the school board or demand for a hearing or an open hearing."
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1467.934,1469.747,Oh it was distributed all the time --
1967.325,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1469.747,1492.237,"And copies according to the note of the end of it on 5 A of your brief says copies, statements in the school, so in effect it was a complaint filed with the school board and a request or a demand for a public hearing and the public was invited and sent copies of the letter --"
1967.325,0,25585,george_kaufmann,,1492.237,1494.394,"Well no, no sir that’s not right."
1967.325,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1511.654,1513.508,Mr. Hayes?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1513.508,1521.783,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.325,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1592.913,1595.88,But suppose they had called it murder.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1595.88,1609.146,"Well, I think if they had so defined it Your Honor that wouldn’t be the question, but I think my point my here is that Mr. Kaufmann agrees that they have done this and this is binding on all parties."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1619.961,1625.038,Well Mr. Hayes does it conclude traffic violation?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1625.038,1627.683,It might Mr. Justice.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1627.683,1629.519,Spitting on the side wall?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1629.519,1631.959,"It would depend, no particular act --"
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1631.959,1634.985,Spitting on the school sidewall. [Laughter]
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1634.985,1652.812,"It might or it might not but the point is Mr. Justice Marshall that in this type of statute where there’s a broad or it gives a broad standard, it leaves to the determination of the administration or the Court that’s administering and applying this the determination, they hold a hearing --"
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1652.812,1664.544,"They leave it up to the school board to determine as to whether or not somebody said something unfair about them, it does doesn’t it?"
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1664.544,1667.304,They might do this and this would be subject to review.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1667.304,1669.183,"Well, that’s what was done here, wasn’t it?"
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1669.183,1671.416,"No, there was much more than that done."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1671.416,1673.491,"Well, who made the original findings?"
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1673.491,1675.201,The Seward School Board.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1675.201,1678.239,And what was the open letter addressed to?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1678.239,1679.325,To the Seward School Board.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1679.325,1681.706,And who did it complain about?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1681.706,1684.398,It complained about the superintendent and the school board.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1684.398,1685.418,And the school board.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1695.977,1702.681,"They decided this -- this was perhaps -- you cut a lot out, but this perhaps one finding. [Laughter]"
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1727.842,1729.717,Is that immoral?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1729.717,1744.24,"It’s under this broad catch-all definition, its conduct that is not compatible with the position of Mr. Watts as a teacher, as an employee."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1780.411,1785.061,"Well he was perfectly moral for 15 years, wasn't he?"
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1785.061,1788.946,"Well, we don't know. We don't know, I mean nothing had come up."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1788.946,1791.319,He was retained for 15 years.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1791.319,1792.508,He was retained for 15 years.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1792.508,1798.015,He didn't become immoral until he talked to somebody about superintendent.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1798.015,1818.202,"Well, actually that's the unfortunate aspect of this word immoral but as it's been defined by statute and defined by the Alaska Supreme Court it doesn't -- it has a much broader meaning and I think it has a very acceptable meaning, it's in the same line with good cause or the good of service this kind of thing."
1967.325,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1818.202,1827.026,Do you say we should consider this case as though the statute said or the regulation said that employees maybe fired if they criticize the Superintendent.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1827.026,1830.721,"No, that's not the way it should be applied."
1967.325,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1830.721,1832.211,Well how should it be then?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1832.211,1833.487,Well it's applied as if it--
1967.325,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1833.487,1836.237,Sometimes they may and sometimes they may not.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1836.237,1840.656,That's right sometimes they may and sometimes may not and it depends on the circumstances of the case.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1840.656,1841.991,In whose judgment?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1841.991,1849.887,"In whose judgment, initially the school board subject to review by State Board of Education, subject to view Superior Court and the Supreme Court."
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.064,1910.949,What on these facts that made it improper for the teachers to criticize the Superintendent to the public?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1910.949,1916.761,Well I think we got to separate out three distinct things here Mr. Justice White.
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.85,1934.208,"Well let's assume all the statements have been true in this case, you would still be taking the same position won't you?"
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1934.208,1938.035,"Well but that ground would then be dropped, then we'll be back to just the other two --"
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.035,1938.657,What are they?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1938.657,1953.979,One is that it violates a reasonable legitimate regulation of the School Board which is in fact a grievance procedure which says you got to submit your complaints first to the Superintendent and then to the School Board.
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1956.167,1956.995,And what's the other one?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1956.995,1969.725,And the other one is the –- it applies just to Mr. Watts and that was his solicitation of other teachers during school hours to join him in a plot or to get rid of the Superintendent.
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.725,1972.299,Now was that one of the grounds the Alaska Supreme Court --
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1972.299,1982.508,"That was one of the grounds in which the Alaska Supreme Court upheld as grounds for firing Mr. Watts, said it didn't apply to Mr. Blue, just Mr. Watts that one."
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.508,1983.681,Just Mr. Watts that's all.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1983.681,1985.453,Just Mr. Watts yes.
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.547,1998.522,"And your only claim is on Blue, is that if the statements had been true, his only violation would have been the Seventh Violation."
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,1998.522,2000.155,"Correct, correct."
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2000.155,2008.058,"And that he was -- and that once he took his complaint to Superintendent, and the Superintendent did nothing about it."
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2024.112,2025.929,"Yes I think so, I think so."
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.929,2030.221,"And why would he have been free to go the public, because of the First Amendment?"
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2030.221,2031.493,"Yes, yes."
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2031.493,2038.536,And wouldn't you think in that circumstance though that New York Times would apply?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2038.536,2042.422,Well it would apply to the E7 regulation.
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.422,2057.379,"Let's assume that he satisfied the E7 regulation, he went to Superintendent nothing happened and he satisfied the regulation and then he went to the public, now the only thing is that some of his statements were actually false although he believed them to be true."
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2057.379,2060.761,"Well I think the standard might or it might not, it would just be a question of whether --"
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.761,2062.134,Well that's rather critical here isn't it?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2062.422,2063.38,Well on that --
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.38,2066.034,-- New York Times applies or it doesn't.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2066.034,2077.849,"If you are just talking about the letter Mr. Justice White, if you are just talking about the letter, but if you are talking the E7 regulation then I don't think it applies at all."
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.849,2082.208,Well I am not -- let's put the E7 regulation aside for the moment.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2082.208,2094.808,"Well, I think that there maybe a difference and I think you have to consider the interest of the state involved and I think that the interest of the State as an employer is higher and more important than the interest of the State --"
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.808,2095.059,Because they are merely saying --
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2095.059,2096.856,Merely calling it liable.
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.856,2109.737,"If you say that New York Times would apply to this case why this –- the falsity issues goes out, because there has been no finding whatsoever that there was any knowing or reckless disregard of the truth."
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2112.276,2114.414,"Yes, I understand and I --"
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.414,2117.291,This is the only issue that remains in the case then.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2117.291,2119.654,"With respect to Mr. Blue, not with respect to Mr. Watts."
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2119.654,2121.739,That's right.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2121.739,2129.698,"I think that, you know, I'd only this on that point, is I feel these are the points that are stronger and I prefer to argue them."
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.129,2155.137,Okay --
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2155.137,2156.627,But with respect to this regulation --
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2156.627,2162.247,Is your position that when you accept public employment you give up some of your constitutional rights?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2162.247,2166.513,No Your Honor that's no longer permissible.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2166.513,2169.85,But you do give up your First Amendment rights.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2169.85,2171.654,No you'd not give them but you do --
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2171.654,2185.441,Well is the requirement that you first apply to the school board before you apply to the public not a conditioning of your First Amendment rights?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2185.441,2186.684,"Yes, it is."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2186.684,2188.811,And does that not violate the First Amendment?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2188.811,2207.273,"No I do not think so because I believe its reasonable and its reasonable because one of the most important things about an employment relationship, perhaps the next most important thing to having an employee who doesn't try to knife you while he is at work, is to have a grievance procedure."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.273,2210.445,"We are not talking about his work, we're talking about this letter."
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2210.445,2210.944,Yes.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2210.944,2212.64,That was not done at work.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2212.64,2225.815,"No, but I am saying the second most important thing is to have a grievance procedure that permits the employer to find out what the grievances are and to work them out with the employees before they are made public or taken higher up."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2225.815,2235.448,And does that not interfere with the employee's right to speak whenever and wherever he pleases?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2235.448,2237.438,I suppose it does.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2237.438,2242.263,And you don't believe that it's wrong for the State to limit it?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2242.263,2244.837,"Not, not to that extent."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2255.426,2260.681,"Why, if it's just delaying why is it so essential?"
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2260.681,2261.482,Because it --
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.482,2276.248,If I understood you correctly you said that he could have filed this letter with the School Board yesterday and go out take it to the public today.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2279.137,2281.569,No I don't think those are my words.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2281.569,2291.591,"Well didn't you say, regardless of what the School Board did he could still go to the public with it, if he first gave it to the School Board?"
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2291.591,2296.574,"If he didn't get redressed, presumably if he got it redressed he wouldn't have any reason to go to the public."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2296.574,2306.144,"Well assuming he didn't get it redressed and he went to the public, do you say that's all right?"
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2306.144,2307.939,"Well yes, after he's complied with the regulation."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.939,2315.752,Well what is so holy about going to the School Board if eventually he can go to the public?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2315.752,2326.081,"Because it permits them -- it permits the employer, the school system to know what the problems are that are brought to their attention and they can work them out."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2326.081,2330.608,"Well then -- well if it is brought to the whole public, it's brought to them too."
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2330.608,2332.506,Well I think there is a distinction.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2332.506,2338.89,What you really mean is that you expect the employee to keep it within the family.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2338.89,2341.975,Initially.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2458.553,2474.927,What's wrong with the citizen wanting one to get rid of a superintendent through legal process and getting as many people as he can to join him to legally get rid of a public official?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2478.627,2483.2,The wrong part about it is using his employer's time to do it on.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2483.2,2484.169,That's all.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2484.169,2486.638,That's the principle objection yes --
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.638,2488.448,"No, is that all?"
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2488.448,2489.087,I am sorry.
1967.325,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.087,2490.081,Plus make a false statements.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2490.081,2500.137,"Well, false statements yes, but he was just closing the -- he wasn't -- that wasn't included in Mr. Justice Marshall's hypothetical."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2537.464,2543.693,"Well, this is not necessarily detrimental I submit to the employer."
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2548.055,2552.819,"The employer technically I think is the Seward School Board, that was the contract."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2552.819,2554.778,Do you have taxes up there?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2554.778,2557.293,Yes rather heavy.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2557.293,2563.05,"Well, I mean, the superintendent is not the employer."
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2563.05,2570.292,"Well he -- it depends on how you define an employer, was that the man that pays the money or is it man that controls the work?"
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2573.75,2576.569,The natural employer is the man who has the money.
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2576.569,2579.752,"Well, I think it's both."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2579.752,2624.386,"Well, the whole point as I understand it is and I repeat and if I am wrong you tell me, both of these people set out to find every lawful means possible to get rid of the superintendent and to correct what they considered to be inadequacies in the board and in order to do that they chose to exercise their freedom to speak and write and for doing that the board and the superintendent decided that their actions are wrong."
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2625.781,2631.247,I would not so state it.
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2631.247,2639.376,Isn't it that due process that party involved should decide something?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2639.376,2644.464,"No, that is not an issue in this case Mr. Justice Marshall."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2645.51,2651.327,Was there anything in that letter that didn't apply to either the school board or the superintendent?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2651.327,2653.165,"Well, I'd like to, if I might on this."
1967.325,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2653.165,2654.926,"Yeah, I don't I think understand."
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2654.926,2676.198,"Well on this other point you say that isn't -- not due process to have the same board decide -- have the employer in fact decide initially what the facts are, I submit that it's not, this is -- it may depend on the type of review you have, but here you have, in effect you have a de novo review by the Alaska Supreme Court, they ordered to hold record."
1967.325,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2700.172,2708.961,Where do we find the regulations that prescribe grievance procedure?
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2708.961,2730.884,The regulations are -- the pertinent portions are printed in the appendix to the petitioner's brief page 14 a and 15 a of the -- of his opening brief.
1967.325,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2730.884,2748.685,"Those are same ones that are on page 14 a and 15 a and now did they do that, do they say that there must be such a grievance procedure before one can go to the public?"
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2768.709,2776.597,"I don't believe it does Your Honor, it says -- what it does say is that they must go to and through the superintendent and this is what they fail to do."
1967.325,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2776.597,2791.011,"If they want to make a grievance through the board, but it doesn't say that anything that a person wants to complain about, that they must go to the board before they can take it to the public."
1967.325,1,25505,george_n_hayes,,2791.011,2799.139,"But if they do go to the board and that's what they did here they preferred to go to the board, they've got to go to and through the superintendent."
1967.325,2,25585,george_kaufmann,,3329.202,3349.363,"Mr. Chief Justice, it seems to us that the basic issue in this case is whether and I think it's been granted, it wouldn't be unfair but I think it has been granted that we are dealing here with the exercise of the First Amendment rights."
1967.325,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3523.598,3530.033,And just remember you have to -- I suppose we accept the finding that some of these statements were false.
1967.325,2,25585,george_kaufmann,,3530.033,3530.659,Yes.
1967.325,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.659,3548.167,If we do you have to have some excuse for -- you have to have some justification for saying that people should not be disciplined for circulating false statement about an institution which it claims the public should have truthful information about it.
1967.325,2,25585,george_kaufmann,,3548.167,3572.049,Yes sir and the reason for that is because we cannot have any information truthful or false if the people who are going to give the information have to be the guarantors of the truth and we submit that the principle in the New York Times be in this case is quite indistinguishable.
1967.325,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3573.709,3582.131,Why should a person have advantage of the New York Times principle however who refuses use an avenue of getting at truthful information?
1967.325,2,25585,george_kaufmann,,3582.131,3599.219,Now that was an issue in New York Times also and though the argument was made that it was all in the files of the -- in the morgue of The New York Times it would have only checked it out and the argument was this showed that they were not in good faith.
1967.325,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3632.384,3636.992,And they gave the electorate false information.
1967.325,2,25585,george_kaufmann,,3636.992,3645.016,"Yes sir, if the finding -- they didn't give them false information as to that, nobody made a finding, there is a no --"
1967.325,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3645.016,3648.233,They gave false information in the open letter.
1967.325,2,25585,george_kaufmann,,3648.233,3678.286,"That was the finding below, which incidentally we challenge and I may say that is not binding on this Court and there is another statement that was made here this morning which was also supported by this finding determination of Supreme Court of Alaska which we think is irrelevant for the reasons pointed out in our reply, but which is -- there is no record -- evidence in the record to support the statement that this was made during school hours because the person who testified to that said, well, he wasn't sure and this is also set forth in our reply brief."
