1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.553,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-9537, Juatassa Sims v. Apfel."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,10.553,50.909,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.693,132.249,I thought the forms contain spaces in which you're supposed to state the reason for your appeal.
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,132.249,139.324,"The form in question contains three lines of space, and it states, my reasons for disagreement are."
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.324,139.908,Right.
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,139.908,143.655,It doesn't state any warning on it that you must list specific issues.
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,169.246,171.351,"Well, this claimant was represented by counsel."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,171.351,172.18,"Yes, she was."
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.18,173.377,"At every stage, no?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,204.048,209.432,"Your Honor, in Social Security proceedings the scheme is different."
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.816,236.206,But--
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,236.206,237.398,--provide for a plenary review.
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.398,243.722,"--that doesn't help you I don't think, Ms. Bohr, because we're talking here about whether you have to raise it before the Appeals Council."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,252.974,255.549,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,255.549,257.863,So why don't you have to--
1999.98-9537,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,257.863,260.029,--Were you the counsel below--
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,260.029,263.622,Not at the Appeals Council level.
1999.98-9537,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.622,265.165,"--Ms. Bohr, at the Appeals Council level?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,265.165,265.574,"No, we were not."
1999.98-9537,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.574,273.842,Why wouldn't it be helpful to raise issues that the claimant thinks are important before the Appeals Council?
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,273.842,274.585,"Well, certainly--"
1999.98-9537,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,274.585,280.389,It just strikes me as rather odd that the claimant wouldn't want to raise them.
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,280.389,287.728,"--Well, certainly in this case the record does reflect that Ms. Sims' counsel raised many matters in her... in the appeal, but--"
1999.98-9537,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.728,296.51,"Some, but apparently never claimed that the administrative law judge should have ordered a consultative examination."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,298.241,299.468,"--No, it was not."
1999.98-9537,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.468,301.34,"--anywhere down the line until the district court, was it?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,301.34,302.569,"No, it was not."
1999.98-9537,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,317.549,317.928,Where does it say it doesn't?
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,333.578,337.978,"That is certainly a rule, and many agencies follow that rule--"
1999.98-9537,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,337.978,339.585,"No, no, it's not an agency follows it."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,348.373,355.048,"--But you have to look at what are the prudential considerations for the application of common law issues of exhaustion, which is what you're describing."
1999.98-9537,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,355.048,362.363,"No, I'm just saying I never saw a case that didn't follow that rule, and then what they usually argue about is whether there's an exception, and there are many."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,374.024,386.573,"The hornbook rule you're referring about is the... is a rule that claimants may be required to list issues, but you have to look at the whole statutory scheme we're talking about."
1999.98-9537,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,450.917,451.601,"Now, why?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,466.515,470.79,"--It's a combination of being informal, being simple, being nonadversarial, being--"
1999.98-9537,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,470.79,472.198,"Well, all that could say, let's bring it up."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,472.198,472.886,--all those factors make a difference.
1999.98-9537,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,472.886,473.78,We'll actually get the lawyers out of the--
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,473.78,475.895,It's a very unique process.
1999.98-9537,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,485.617,486.55,--I absolutely agree with you that there is that difference.
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,494.065,505.166,"Because it makes a difference in terms of how the agency announces... the agency has, as I said earlier, a whole panoply of regulations, rules, forms, and notices, and all those--"
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.166,505.606,"Well, they can change that."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,506.709,507.138,--But they haven't changed it.
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.138,523.255,"--Well, I know they haven't, but what you're driving us to is to say that although SSA has been very... very liberal in saying, you don't have to mention whatever your claim is, we'll look at it, and if there's anything that's wrong we'll correct it."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,563.87,574.513,"Your Honor, when you appeal a case to the Appeals Council, the... I think it's significant that they don't advise people that you have to raise issues."
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.105,580.26,I agree that they don't have to raise issues.
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,604.955,612.893,"--Well, first of all, in the Social Security context, when the Appeals Council denies review, it's the ALJ decision that goes into Federal court, not the Appeals Council denial."
1999.98-9537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,612.893,623.635,"And if it went just to the ALJ and then directly to court, as Congress... that has been proposed, to cut out this Appeals Council altogether."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,634.942,635.627,Certainly.
1999.98-9537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,656.739,662.592,You spend about... the Appeals Council is the fourth rung or the third rung within the agency?
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,662.592,663.73,It is the fourth rung.
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,714.494,729.449,"Ms. Bohr, it's also very... it's to help the agency I think, to let them correct a mistake, and it will be much easier for them to correct it if it's called to their attention than if it's not, if they're simply bypassed and it's raised for the first time in court."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,729.449,735.86,"Certainly we do not... Chief Justice, we certainly agree that the agency could set up a system like this if it wanted to."
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,735.86,737.752,"Well, it has set up... it has set up a system like this."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,737.752,742.856,They haven't set up a system where they are requiring claimants to raise specific issues.
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,742.856,743.345,"Well, the--"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,743.345,745.401,The regulations provide the review is plenary.
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,745.401,752.252,"--Well, but review... but provide... review in the Appeals Council is plenary."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,768.977,775.808,"Yes, that is what the agency is doing, and this is not an... this is not something that's provided for within the regulatory scheme."
1999.98-9537,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.015,800.008,"It says in the notice that they gave you, I take it, you have a right... not you, but your client, if you do not agree with the ALJ's decision, you may file an appeal with the Appeals Council."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,808.91,809.319,Yes.
1999.98-9537,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,809.319,812.154,So a lawyer receives that.
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,824.953,832.597,"Justice Breyer, that provision you're referring to does certainly advise you of the need to exhaust, and there's no dispute you have to exhaust that step."
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,846.517,847.136,What--
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,847.136,848.104,You might lose benefits.
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.195,859.968,"--What is the point of requiring you to go to the Appeals Council, as you concede they do, if you don't have to raise issues there that you later want to take to court?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,859.968,875.13,"Certainly people do raise issues, as I said, but the problem is, their own regulations don't mandate that you specify your specific issues, and when you're looking at imposing on a claimant this exhaustion requirement you have to look at the prudential considerations."
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.13,889.32,"So are you saying, Ms. Bohr, that if the agency were simply to adopt a rule that you must exhaust your issues before the Appeals Council in order to raise them in court, that would suffice?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,889.32,894.709,"Mr. Chief Justice, certainly we contend this is a matter for the agency and not for the court."
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.709,896.176,"Well now, I asked you a rather specific question."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,899.535,902.544,"Yes, I think the agency could seek to do that."
1999.98-9537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,931.068,933.802,What does representation mean in drawing that line?
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,933.802,935.848,"Well, that's an unclear question."
1999.98-9537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,942.567,950.595,"Do you know how it works out in practice before the Social Security Administration, before the Appeals Council?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,960.07,960.26,Yes.
1999.98-9537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1005.216,1014.876,But do we know what position the agency is taking with respect to who is a representative that will be held to this rule?
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1025.328,1026.151,Justice--
1999.98-9537,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1026.151,1028.297,"Only when they are represented by counsel, counsel meaning--"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1028.297,1036.097,"--Justice Ginsburg, all the commission has stated in their documents is that they believe this rule should only apply to represented claimants."
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1046.898,1052.821,"--Well, I'm not sure they have to make that exception for anybody, lawyers representing or mothers representing."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1088.857,1090.99,"Well, we have lodged here--"
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1090.99,1094.191,"Why... I mean, my goodness, is this really something that--"
1999.98-9537,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.191,1097.159,"--In that connection, could I ask just a factual question?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1103.117,1104.319,--That's correct.
1999.98-9537,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1107.298,1114.853,"It would seem to me the most consistent system, to follow Justice Scalia's thought, would be one that... because what's being reviewed when you get to court is the ALJ's decision."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1114.853,1121.434,"--And I think it's significant on that point, Justice Stevens, that in the Social Security context the ALJ actually wears three hats."
1999.98-9537,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.922,1166.603,"And if the ALJ commits an error that wasn't even talked about in the ALJ proceeding, if the claimant is smart enough to raise it before the Appeals Council, the ALJ can be reversed."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1166.603,1179.06,"Yes, and many times I will tell you there are many instances where claimants do not raise specific claims of error and the Appeals Council sends the cases back, because they review it, and they make a decision without identifying of issues."
1999.98-9537,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.06,1179.624,Where is the principal record made?
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1182.185,1182.708,Yes.
1999.98-9537,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.236,1188.591,But what is... what record is made of the Appeals Council proceeding?
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1188.591,1190.502,There's nothing before the Appeals Council.
1999.98-9537,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.915,1197.048,"And yet that's where we have the procedural regularity, before the Appeals Council."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1197.048,1198.4,"So there's nothing... there's no, really, oral argument."
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1202.313,1205.268,"Let me ask you a little more detail on that, Ms. Bohr."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1215.077,1217.866,"--Yes, and they... they'll take an applied request for review."
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1220.755,1224.801,"And then, do you get a decision from the Appeals Council?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1224.801,1227.521,What you get is typically what we have here in our record.
1999.98-9537,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.387,1236.862,Of what?
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1236.862,1243.309,"--Of the joint appendix, and what you have is, this is a totally... example of a boiler plate denial."
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.69,1271.79,"Well, okay... now, what if the Appeals Council grants your... grants you review, and rules in your favor?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1273.218,1277.923,"No, if they grant review, which is a very small percentage of cases, then the system is different."
1999.98-9537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1287.727,1288.431,So this is like--
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1288.431,1289.518,"--This is not a decision, it's an action."
1999.98-9537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1290.641,1292.143,--This is like certiorari denied.
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1292.143,1292.568,Yes.
1999.98-9537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1295.502,1306.379,"If the certiorari... if there's been a denial, can you go back to the Appeals Council and ask them to reconsider, or raise any new points?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1306.978,1314.438,"--There is a... the Social Security regulations have a reopening provision, and any claimant can seek reopening at the last level they have been at."
1999.98-9537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1328.394,1330.315,--What's the time frame?
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1330.315,1336.761,--I believe it's 4 years for... to ask for reopening if you're a Social Security claim--
1999.98-9537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1336.761,1339.106,"Well, can you ask for reopening after it's gone to the district court?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1339.106,1341.008,--That doesn't really happen.
1999.98-9537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1360.606,1379.707,"Well, if the attorney is prepared to go to district court at that point, having received a... an unfavorable ruling, what would be wrong with just saying he has to exhaust by asking the Appeals Council to raise any specific thing that's been left out?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1379.707,1390.085,"The problem is that... I believe what you're asking, then, if you've been denied review and they haven't given any reasons, you want them to go back and readdress the reasons?"
1999.98-9537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1390.085,1407.548,"I'm saying, assuming we think there's an exhaustion rule, since there's already a 4-year period to ask the agency to relook at it, the attorney, before he goes to the district court, says, well, I want to give the Appeals Council first crack at this, so he just reopens and says, I want you to consider A, B, and C, which you might not have considered earlier in my three line letter."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1407.548,1411.844,"Well, Your Honor, reopenings actually are quite difficult to get."
1999.98-9537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1429.951,1437.785,"So the Appeals Council already has an exhaustion concept about his own reopening, doesn't it, based on what you've just described?"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1437.785,1443.491,"They will... if you've submitted something to the Appeals Council it needs to be a part of the record, because if you're going into Federal court--"
1999.98-9537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1443.491,1444.209,"Well, that's--"
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1444.209,1449.316,"--the record is created from the documents that were the ALJ hearing, the transcript of the hearing, which is--"
1999.98-9537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1449.316,1457.762,"--So now it sounds, as I said, that there is an exhaustion concept that the Appeals Council itself applies, at least for reopening, based on what you've just said."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1457.762,1461.729,"--Justice Kennedy, I guess what I... I'm a little confused about your question."
1999.98-9537,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1467.133,1479.476,"Well, you told me that there's no reopening unless they've overlooked something that you have raised, and I said, that sounds to me like exhaustion in the present system that the Appeals Council already follows."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1479.476,1481.308,"No, that's not exactly what I meant to say."
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1549.761,1556.507,Do you think it's up to the agency what rules of exhaustion the courts apply?
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1559.845,1561.696,The... in fact--
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.696,1562.833,Can an agency--
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1562.833,1563.577,--most agencies have regulations.
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.431,1574.34,"--I know, but suppose... the ICC's gone, happily, but let's pick one of the other agencies."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1605.53,1608.594,"--I think, Your Honor, you have to look at the prudential consideration."
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.103,1616.372,Right.
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1616.792,1618.405,--You have to look at the prudential considerations.
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1618.405,1618.744,Well--
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1618.744,1619.602,It doesn't make sense to--
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.602,1620.101,--what does it tell you?
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1620.101,1621.743,--propose an issue exhaustion.
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.743,1626.672,"I think... I look at the prudential considerations, and what I say is, it's none of the agency's business."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1626.672,1627.695,But in this case--
1999.98-9537,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.695,1633.908,"That whether... you know, what we require in order to bring a case before the courts is up to the courts, not up to the agency."
1999.98-9537,0,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,1633.908,1664.643,"--But according to the McCarthy v. Madigan case, you have to look at this matter not just as a global rule, but what makes sense given the congressional intent, and given the agency's own rules and regulations and policies, and in this particular case, when you look at that, and you look at those considerations, their... the act, and the emphasis on an informality and nonadversarial system, the fact that the review is plenary by regulation before the Appeals Council, none of the prudential considerations for the application of issue exhaustion apply in this case."
1999.98-9537,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.682,1679.178,"Very well, Ms. Bohr."
1999.98-9537,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1680.696,1689.314,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-9537,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1726.929,1730.092,But counsel for the other side says the agency doesn't want its best shot.
1999.98-9537,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1731.764,1742.93,"I don't think that's an accurate characterization of agency practice, and I think perhaps it's helpful to the Court to look at the regulatory provision that was being discussed."
1999.98-9537,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1808.951,1817.454,"But Mr. Stewart, the agency itself has determined that the Appeals Council is not going to be used in a certain number of cases, isn't that so?"
1999.98-9537,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1817.454,1842.642,"--The agency is currently conducting an experiment in which, in selected States, we will dispense with the requirement that the claimant seek review in the Appeals Council as a prerequisite to seeking judicial review, and one of the purposes of that experiment is to determine whether the elimination of that stage of administrative review has the effect of increasing the rate at which disappointed claimants file suit in court."
1999.98-9537,2,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,3492.341,3496.462,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-9537,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3501.087,3504.637,My case was a Social Security case.
1999.98-9537,2,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,3509.874,3521.394,"What we're looking at here is, the Government is coming into Court and they're taking a litigating position, asking this Court to adopt a position that's simply not supported by their own agency, policies, procedures, and forms."
1999.98-9537,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3534.581,3538.478,"The Government is just thinking how long it takes them to prepare a petition for certiorari, I think."
1999.98-9537,2,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,3540.713,3543.787,"--The other thing is, we're talking about a national program."
1999.98-9537,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3582.462,3606.861,"Well, the reason that they... is that if you allow people to avoid exhaustion in several thousand cases every year, and many more, possibly, people will then go in and go to court, and they'll just think of a whole lot of reasons that they never raised before, and the judges are busy, and magistrates are busy, and to have all these new reasons hitting them that nobody's even looked at or thought about is... just adds to the work unnecessarily."
1999.98-9537,2,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,3608.243,3614.14,"I accept that, but if the point is that the agency itself doesn't even provide reasons, how is it helping the court--"
1999.98-9537,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3614.14,3616.131,Because they resolve problems.
1999.98-9537,2,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,3621.865,3628.745,"--And if the agency chooses to have that policy, then they should subject that kind of a policy to notice and comment."
1999.98-9537,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3631.634,3636.564,"You know, it's... it is the basic background law, and there's no need for it, but maybe their form isn't good enough in explaining it."
1999.98-9537,2,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,3636.564,3640.341,"But in contrast, for example, the VA form is very detailed."
1999.98-9537,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3651.364,3662.136,"Does it add anything of the nature of... Mr. Stewart says... it isn't... as I understand it, it doesn't say anything about what's going to happen to you, that you'll be precluded in court, does it--"
1999.98-9537,2,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,3662.136,3663.066,"No, there's no--"
1999.98-9537,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3663.066,3663.415,--on the VA form?
1999.98-9537,2,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,3663.415,3671.238,--There's nothing in the form itself or in the notice of the decision to the claimant warning the claimant of the... what would happen if the claimant fails to raise all issues.
1999.98-9537,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3671.238,3672.111,"Thank you, Ms. Bohr."
1999.98-9537,2,41064,sarah_h_bohr,,3672.111,3672.486,Thank you.
1999.98-9537,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3672.486,3673.219,The case is submitted.
