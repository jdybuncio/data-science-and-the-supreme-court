1972.71-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.515,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-850, United States against Mara."
1972.71-850,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,29.057,32.226,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-850,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1132.343,1149.152,"Perhaps, your summary of the adversary hearings in the electric surveillance case, perhaps is a statement of a wishful affirmative of some kind because you go away beyond anything we've ever held?"
1972.71-850,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1149.152,1165.537,"Well, in the Taglianetti case which is in 394 US, the Court summarily affirmed, granted cert and affirmed the judgment holding that the District Judge acted properly in determining who had been overheard and who had not even though the defendant wanted to --"
1972.71-850,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1165.537,1173.817,"That’s true but the discussion, in Alderman of the relevancy, the need for an adversary hearing was very explicit?"
1972.71-850,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1173.817,1174.112,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-850,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1190.402,1193.74,"He doesn't know the case, he doesn't know the prosecution, he doesn't know the defense?"
1972.71-850,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1193.74,1194.581,Pardon?
1972.71-850,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1195.587,1201.38,A judge doesn't always know the whole pattern of the prosecution's case or the defense's?
1972.71-850,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1201.38,1205.125,That’s the underlying rationale for Alderman and indeed for Dennis.
1972.71-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1580.061,1584.898,Very well Mr. Lacovara.
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,1588.374,1594.352,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1796.708,1798.128,Let me see if I get this clear.
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,1812.176,1812.86,I don’t know.
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1825.835,1826.178,Well --
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,1826.178,1827.957,-- District Court.
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1827.957,1848.2,"What if the grand jury furnished him with the typewritten list of words, totally unconnected, no message at all, just a list of 40 words or 20 words and 20 names, and ask him to write that down, would your position be the same as it is now?"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,1848.2,1860.391,"My position would be that if what he is asked to write down is germane or essential to the Government’s case to prove its case, then I would -- my position would be the same, yes."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1860.391,1867.713,So that then it does not go to the communication issue that you're -- alone that you first suggested.
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,1872.124,1873.559,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1972.71-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.664,1893.93,"If it is testimony, you have the Fifth Amendment available?"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,1893.93,1897.868,That’s -- this is exactly what we are talking about Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1972.71-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1904.291,1915.976,But that's something you have no way of knowing until you know what the -- until he actually goes before the grand jury and gives whatever form of exemplar they want?
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,1915.976,1917.989,That is correct.
1972.71-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.48,2068.166,"If the point you’re trying to reserve is not that anything which contributes to the Government’s case even a set of 20 neutral words as posited by the Chief Justice, but that what you might be asked for before the grand jury is, you know, where were you on the night of January 20th?"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2075.069,2084.434,"I would agree, Your Honor, that’s true and that’s what he should do, but he was asked for exemplars and as I stated, I don’t -- we don’t know what he was ask to give."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2092.213,2100.982,"But isn’t the demand for an exemplar by its very nature, a neutral demand and not a demand for communication?"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2123.322,2133.27,"If it is something which again is selectively germane, it is essential to the Government’s proof in a case then I say that the Fifth Amendment would apply because --"
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2133.27,2135.986,How can you know that until the case is tried?
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2135.986,2138.98,"We -- well, I don’t know."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2139.727,2150.562,"But then you say -- then in effect you’re saying, you don’t have to give any handwriting for any purpose under any circumstances and that’s the case you're putting to this Court now?"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2150.562,2152.887,That is the case that is before this Court now.
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2152.887,2158.244,"So, then all the discussion about communication is really irrelevant to the issue, isn’t it?"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2158.244,2189.182,"It is not irrelevant Mr. Chief Justice, if in the posture the question that is put forth, if he is asked certain questions about, for instance, this case whether or not it is a hijack case or a conspiracy case and certain questions along that line, in the posture of the case and the questions that maybe asked may show that what they are asking for is that selectively germane thing that they want, the essential to prove their case."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2189.182,2192.178,"Well, would you -- I'm not sure I understand just what you mean --"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2192.178,2192.475,Sure.
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2192.475,2195.051,-- Mr. Ruggiero about selectively germane.
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2207.366,2216.786,"If they are used to prove a forgery or perhaps in this case to prove a receipt, the signing of the receipt for the --"
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2216.786,2219.824,"That he signed gambling slip, that’s what this whole thing is about, isn’t it?"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2219.824,2220.46,"No, it is not."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.272,2221.959,This one?
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2221.959,2222.678,"No, no."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2229.29,2232.804,"Well, then signing of invoices and --"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2232.804,2233.393,That’s --
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2233.393,2236.071,-- Signing of invoices and related documents?
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2236.071,2237.096,That’s the issue.
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2264.897,2271.659,What about if they went to the bank and subpoenaed all his records and used the handwriting there?
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2271.659,2281.964,"That’s another question and which is something incidentally that the Court of Appeals suggested that they do do, is to go and get their investigation and what seems to be, what they did in their affidavit."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2281.964,2285.306,"But you say, they could do that?"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2285.306,2286.69,They could do that.
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2288.383,2295.418,"Notwithstanding the fact that the man’s bank records are something in the nature of personal effects, are they not?"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2295.418,2310.023,But there's a question Mr. Chief Justice between asking a man to come in the grand jury room or the US Attorney and asking him to write his name and go into a bank and getting his signature from a bank.
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2310.023,2316.525,"Even if they take the Government to the same place in the long run, you think that difference is important?"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2316.525,2317.334,"Yes, it is."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2381.061,2399.699,"What if instead of supplying an affidavit, a witness that appeared before the grand jury, just in advance of calling your client and that the same information was submitted to the grand jury, not in writing but by of oral testimony?"
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2406.495,2406.926,No.
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2406.926,2407.383,-- adhere?
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2407.383,2407.835,"No, Your Honor, no."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2407.835,2409.432,And then what's the difference?
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2409.432,2414.556,"The difference is that the witnesses have appeared before that Court, excuse me, before the grand jury."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2418.467,2422.49,And why do you -- would you suggest why that becomes crucial?
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2425.579,2439.518,"The difference is because it's based upon an affidavit submitted by an FBI agent and we have rules of procedure in cases from this Court, would set forth the procedure within the limits of a Fourth Amendment."
1972.71-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2454.445,2465.331,"But isn’t it true, Mr. Ruggiero, at least in connection with the search warrant or an arrest warrant that your normal motion to quash comes up after the search has been made or after the arrest has been made."
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2475.943,2485.193,"That’s true, that is true."
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2646.871,2650.564,"Mr. Ruggiero, you are now impinging on Mrs. Bamberger’s time."
1972.71-850,1,16852,angelo_ruggiero,,2650.564,2651.473,I'm sorry.
1972.71-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2656.362,2657.324,Mrs. Bamberger.
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2657.324,2658.418,Thank you.
1972.71-850,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2716.698,2720.713,"Would you take the same position with respect to fingerprints, Mrs. Bamberger?"
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2720.713,2723.918,I would take the same position with respect to fingerprints.
1972.71-850,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3149.486,3152.306,"We’ll pick up at that point after lunch, Mrs. Bamberger."
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3158.364,3159.75,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1972.71-850,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3300.336,3306.723,"Mrs. Bamberger, do you have any comment on the Seventh Circuit’s solution in this case by way of procedure?"
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3306.723,3307.83,"By way of -- well, --"
1972.71-850,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3307.83,3309.888,This test?
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3309.888,3313.785,The -- I think the Fourth -- the Seventh Circuit test is correct --
1972.71-850,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3313.785,3315.48,Is that the one you support?
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3315.48,3318.419,"Well, we would -- we would add one more thing to that and that is --"
1972.71-850,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3318.419,3320.674,What about the relevance as a fact?
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3320.674,3343.76,"Yes, I think that there should be a determination of relevancy not that -- based on the kind of reasonableness and not probable cause to believe that this exemplar is the same thing, not probable cause to believe that this witness will become a defendant, but a standard of reasonableness and an explanation of how this particular piece of evidence, the exemplar is relevant to the investigation."
1972.71-850,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3348.4,3355.52,"But would it be relevance in the same sense, for example, in discovery proceedings that the questions maybe made relevant?"
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3355.52,3356.666,You mean in civil matters?
1972.71-850,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3356.666,3359.889,Yes.
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3363.206,3384.192,"Yes, I understand that, Your Honor, and I think that perhaps in this case, if we look to -- that it has to be, that it should be a statement merely or a factual statement that the -- let me say this, it may not be as broad but there must be some basis for concluding that the testimony requested is relevant to the investigation going on at that time."
1972.71-850,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3384.192,3390.292,"Well, as relevant in the sense of aid to investigation to its objective?"
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3390.292,3392.98,"That it will aid the investigation, yes."
1972.71-850,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3392.98,3396.639,How do you know that in the grand jury proceeding until you've finished?
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3396.639,3397.801,"Well, you do that Your Honor, in --"
1972.71-850,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3397.801,3401.318,"Isn’t it quite different from the trial of the case, the relevancy factor?"
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3401.318,3402.06,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1972.71-850,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3409.927,3426.684,"But you are putting to that Court, it leaves the problem of trying to determine the relevancy when perhaps the District Judge would not be competent to determine relevancy to a grand jury proceeding concerning which is not fully advised?"
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3426.684,3438.88,"Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, that the Court could be fully advised and if the Government believes in a particular case, that advising the Court to the extent that it need advise the Court, in order to advise him as to what's going on --"
1972.71-850,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3438.88,3440.985,Advise them ex-parte in camera?
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3440.985,3455.263,"In a specific application so that each individual application can be determine on its own merits, not a general across the board, application of the ex-parte in camera proceeding in this context."
1972.71-850,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3471.948,3500.782,"Mrs. Bamberger, I take it one differing factor between your application of the deposition rules of relevancy in a grand jury proceedings is that in your civil proceeding, your issues are pretty well delineated by your complaint and answer whereas you don’t have any similar format for the grand jury proceeding that would enable you to say, is it or is it not within the limits framed by a particular set of documents?"
1972.71-850,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3500.782,3532.553,"Well, in the context of the grand jury proceedings that -- what you say about the civil proceeding is correct and I would say that in the context of a grand jury proceeding, the usual way it comes up is that the Government has collected some kind of case and has prepared an indictment and it goes to the grand jury to present its evidence and it has a framework with which it could make a presentation to a District Court in a contempt proceeding and the Government is not functioning in a vacuum."
1972.71-850,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3581.664,3582.844,Thank you Mrs. Bamberger.
1972.71-850,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3585.562,3590.593,"Unless the Court has any further questions, the Government will waive rebuttal."
1972.71-850,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3590.593,3592.16,"Frankly none, thank you."
