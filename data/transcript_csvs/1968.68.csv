1968.68,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.974,"Number 68, Sam L. McDonald ET AL, appellants versus Board of Election Commissioners of Chicago ET AL."
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,24.386,29.05,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.68,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,65.36,67.92,"In other words these are not people who have been convicted of crime, is that it?"
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,67.92,68.553,That's correct.
1968.68,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,68.553,69.769,They're just awaiting trial?
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,69.769,71.484,Correct.
1968.68,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,290.069,298.415,Have you made implicate -- have an intervener so you'd have a named party?
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,298.415,316.902,"No effort has made -- was made to name any persons but I presume and I would respectfully ask the Court to respect the judgement of the District Court that this was a class action and that there are in the county jail prior to each election, a certain number of persons for which --"
1968.68,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,316.902,322.713,"As I understand it, you say that it was a class action, I'm wondering what is it now?"
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,322.713,323.787,What is it at this moment?
1968.68,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,323.787,324.818,Yes sir.
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,324.818,341.849,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, the problem is that the class really cannot be seen very clearly until right before an election because it's very difficult to predict exactly who will be a pre-trial detainee on the day of election."
1968.68,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,387.54,396.058,"So, it's going to be someone who has just been put in jail the day or the two in court too before who will not be able to vote under the ordinary --"
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,396.058,396.313,Vague questions because --
1968.68,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,396.313,398.601,provision governing all absentee voters.
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,403.141,403.296,That's correct.
1968.68,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,403.296,404.281,"-- apply for ballot, is there?"
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,404.281,409.877,And we're not attacking that provision on making application within a certain amount of time as being --
1968.68,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,409.877,413.214,Because actually of general applicability to call absentee voters --
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,413.214,413.469,Yes.
1968.68,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.469,414.669,-- is that it?
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,414.669,416.115,"Well, it's a reasonable provision."
1968.68,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,426.936,433.652,"Well, let say -- I don't quite -- really, we're not here to decide what's reasonable or unreasonable, are we?"
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,433.652,437.389,"Well, I'm not assailing the provisions regarding time."
1968.68,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,441.424,443.268,"Not because they're unreasonable, are you?"
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,448.051,448.621,That's correct.
1968.68,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,448.621,450.508,-- amendment of the United States constitution?
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,450.508,453.387,I will turn to that.
1968.68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,453.387,457.422,But does the class include people who are convicted without sentence?
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,457.422,459.771,"No, they're unconvicted."
1968.68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,462.303,466.525,"The court below, did the District Court set any sentence?"
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,466.525,467.825,The --
1968.68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,467.825,471.692,They should pass the standard to represent all unsentenced inmates.
1968.68,0,40993,stanley_a_bass,,477.288,488.235,"There was some loose language, we intended and was clear but the time were litigating this, we were dealing with the pre-trial detainees rather than persons who were between that period of conviction and sentence."
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1812.982,1815.111,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court."
1968.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1882.433,1884.8,And necessary for one who's on your side?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1884.8,1885.47,Pardon?
1968.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1885.47,1892.496,"Is it necessary for one who wants to be on your side, try to put it on the basis on the difference between the privilege and a right."
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1892.496,1894.427,I don't think so Mr. Justice --
1968.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1894.427,1895.644,I would think it makes up
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1895.644,1901.184,"I don't think so at all but rather than confused right with privilege, let's talk about what it really is."
1968.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1901.184,1906.546,-- take care of one evil have to take care of every possible evil that anyone can conceive off?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1906.546,1907.557,"No, certainly not."
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1943.09,1945.951,Why were these people excluded?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1945.951,1947.106,Why were they excluded?
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1947.106,1949.246,Yes sir.
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1949.246,1952.272,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I don't know why they were excluded."
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1952.272,1955.61,"Well, don't you think the state should have some reason?"
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1955.61,1959.335,I think the state has a reason for enacting a piece of legislation in --
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1959.335,1959.863,"Now, do you think --"
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1959.863,1961.153,-- the nature of absentee balloting.
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1961.153,1973.788,Do you think the states obliged to tell somebody the reason you distinguish between prisoners awaiting trial outside the county and those inside the county.
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1973.788,1982.227,Prisoners awaiting trial outside the county Mr. Justice Marshall are outside of the county and fall into that class of persons granted the absentee ballot privilege --
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1982.227,1982.609,Aren't these --
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1982.609,1984.149,Because they're out of the county.
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.149,1987.581,"Well, they're different because they're outside of the county?"
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1987.581,1988.561,That's correct.
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1988.561,1992.383,But they're still awaiting trial by the state of Illinois?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1992.383,1993.146,That is correct.
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1993.146,1998.167,So that much they are like but why draw the line there?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,1998.167,2005.43,Because the state has taken affirmative action in granting the absentee ballots to groups of people.
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2012.991,2014.973,Can you think of a reason?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2014.973,2015.872,Can I think of a reason?
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2015.872,2016.73,Yes sir.
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2016.73,2019.304,Why they should not be granted an absentee ballot?
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2019.304,2029.925,"No, why the state made a difference a man in jail waiting for trial outside the county and a man waiting for trial inside the county."
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2038.349,2050.257,Its my firm belief that the legislature in enacting absentee ballot legislation never considered the problem of persons present inside the county in a jail awaiting trial and persons outside of a county awaiting trial.
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2050.257,2051.681,You mean he didn't know that?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2051.681,2053.708,I don't know sir whether or not they knew about it.
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2068.274,2094.658,"But that in mind as we've looked at this, can we say that we see no valid reason for distinguishing two man are charged with a crime, one has bail money, the other man has no bail money, they both committed the same crime, one can vote and the other one cannot."
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2097.829,2100.442,"I don't know of any reason at all Mr. Justice Marshall, I could not --"
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2100.442,2106.899,Aren't you obliged -- aren't you obliged to give us a -- something close to a reason?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2106.899,2146.05,"No I believe my burden sir under the language of the cases of this Court is first of all, to demonstrate that, Mr. Bass on behalf of petitioners has not carried his burden to show that there is unreasonable basis so that there is invidious discrimination, whether there is arbitrariness or capriciousness in the action of the legislature in enacting this particular legislation, and secondly, if the burden does shift to me to rational or justify the decision then its my burden to go forward with it and you asked me for a reason sir and I cannot give you a reason why a legislation beginning back in 1917 prior to the time of my birth sir, why that legislation did not contain some provision for these persons."
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2154.341,2167.364,But the legislature did consider the problem as to whether or not people in jail awaiting trial should or should not have an absentee ballot.
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2169.297,2174.762,"No sir, there is nothing in this record that would indicate that and there is nothing in the history of the legislation that would indicate it."
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2200.933,2203.6,Who did draw the distinction?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2203.6,2206.471,Mr. Bass is apparently drawn the distinction Your Honor.
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2206.471,2219.479,"No, these people tried to file their absentee ballots and election commissioner said that they were not physically handicapped, isn't that what happened?"
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2219.479,2225.068,The election commissioners and I was present at all times when this petitions for absentee ballot were presented.
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2257.223,2262.031,"Well, what is there -- what is there in the statute that this did not comply with?"
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2266.454,2295.62,"They said sir that it was physically impossible for them to be in attendance at the polls and then they attached an affidavit of an assistant warden which says they couldn't leave the premises but they did not attach the affidavit of a doctor or a Christian Science practitioner which was what was required under the statute of Illinois, and therefore the board of election commissioners being purely ministerial at this point could not accept that application or that affidavit and could not within the meaning of the statute grant an absentee ballot to do so, would have been a violation of Illinois law under the Article 29 (a)."
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2295.62,2299.031,But there's no question that this was state action?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2299.031,2299.145,I don't think --
1968.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2299.145,2301.2,"The action of the commissioners, no question about that."
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2301.2,2305.198,The commissioners acted in pursuant to Illinois statute.
1968.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.668,2314.216,Were you advising them?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2314.216,2315.343,Yes I was sir.
1968.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.343,2318.865,And that -- would you help me to draw his affidavit?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2318.865,2320.498,"Was I advising whom, excuse me."
1968.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.498,2321.294,The election commissioners.
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2321.294,2322.739,I was advising the election commissioners --
1968.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.739,2325.186,Would you help draw his affidavit?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2325.186,2329.514,"Did I help draw the affidavit for the physically incapacitated people, no I did not sir, that is --"
1968.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.514,2331.147,"No, for the election commissioner."
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2331.147,2331.797,"No, I did not, that is --"
1968.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.797,2336.448,"What is on page 26, as you named it, the end of it, 26 and 27 of the record?"
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2354.869,2355.549,That is the end of the --
1968.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.549,2361.595,"-- if they did it and you say if they did it, you'd be subject to fine and imprisonment."
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2361.595,2362.236,That is correct.
1968.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.859,2365.5,So there is a law --
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2365.5,2366.345,In the pleadings.
1968.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.345,2374.121,"So there is a law in Illinois that if the election commissioner had issued this ballots, they'd had been put in jail, or fined."
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2374.121,2376.25,There is a general provision Mr. Justice White.
1968.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.25,2380.891,You mean -- so therefore -- you're saying there is no state action that secludes these people getting --
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2380.891,2391.609,"Well, there is a state statute that precludes it but they acted in denial of the petition for an absentee ballot pursuant to an otherwise state statute."
1968.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2397.159,2412.222,Am I right Mr. Kusper of the fact that this affidavit says is that it has to be denied just specific or affirmatively written on the election law of Illinois that absentee ballot shall be not given to the pre-trial detained.
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2412.222,2413.287,"It's not exactly what it says, Mr. Justice Brennan --"
1968.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2413.287,2416.282,I know what it said but doesn't this affidavit have other fact?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2416.282,2431.735,What it says is I can't do anything other than which is permitted to me to do under the laws of Illinois and there is no provision in the Absentee Balloting Act of Illinois which allows the Commissioner to grant application for an absentee ballot on a basis of these warden's affidavit.
1968.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2431.735,2444.295,What did Mr. Boseman mean when he said I will grant future application only when compelled to do so by composing possibly accordance to incumbent jurisdiction as I'm am done on three previous occasions?
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2444.295,2458.83,"Because we were ordered on three previous occasions by the Federal Court, Judge Lynch in both cases presiding and it was not a State Court it was a Federal Court which ordered us to do it and in pursuance to that kind of an order I think we have to act, it put us between the devil and the deep blue sea."
1968.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2458.83,2460.109,"He ordered you to do, why?"
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2460.109,2468.402,"You ordered us to give an absentee ballot to a particular prisoner on three different occasions, Norman Bonds and also McDonald on two occasions."
1968.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2468.402,2485.558,Your point is that if somebody come down with an affidavit saying I'm going to be in the county on election day but I'm going to be awfully busy because I'm going to taken care of my sister's sick child and can't get to the poll.
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2499.266,2501.075,"Absolutely correct, sir."
1968.68,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2503.254,2518.524,Your submission as I see it is something like this that the state provide -- the state accords the right to vote to everybody with certain exclusions.
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2560.615,2563.569,"Well, there can be a situation in which there is no absentee voting."
1968.68,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2565.386,2572.505,That's what I'm saying that the state has no obligation to provide that the absentee voting alternative procedure --
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2572.505,2572.658,That's right.
1968.68,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2572.658,2583.13,"-- to anybody although the state might have to extend the right to vote to -- for example, resident servicemen, Franklin against Ryche."
1968.68,1,41602,stanley_t_kusper_jr,,2583.13,2583.593,I agree.
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3642.984,3644.865,I've a short comment Your Honor.
1968.68,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3690.942,3696.367,"No, no because they are not voting for sheriffs over there not on the county."
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3701.979,3704.439,"Well, we're talking about the person who lives in Chicago --"
1968.68,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3704.439,3704.999,Yes.
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3704.999,3706.27,-- who's caught out in Wheaton --
1968.68,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3706.27,3709.826,"Yes, but he is not then in custody of the Cook County Sheriff?"
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3709.826,3722.124,That's true but I would indicate that the absentee ballot procedure is that one has to cast the ballot in the presence of a notary rebook outside the state so that there is a check against fraud and finally I would --
1968.68,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3722.124,3736.283,"Have these people were so great they understood, did a thought occur to you to make a motion before the judge who has charge of the custody correctly of those thing and who could have grant a motion on your part to let them vote?"
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3736.283,3737.159,"Well, as I indicated Mr. --"
1968.68,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3737.159,3738.71,Is that thought occurred to you?
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3738.71,3744.206,It occurred to me and when I took that up with chief judge of the criminal division he indicated that it was not a very feasible --
1968.68,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3744.206,3748.074,"Yes he indicated but did you try, did you file the proceeding?"
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3748.074,3748.899,"No, we do not."
1968.68,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3748.899,3753.103,"You just attack the constitutionality, whole of it?"
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3753.103,3769.842,We took the position -- realistic position that the only way a person in jail could vote is by mail that it would be extremely and in positions on the state to require armed deputy sheriffs to takes somebody to the polls and we talk about --
1968.68,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3769.842,3777.335,"Why would it be if its added part of term maybe that -- well, the deputy sheriff would have been glad to do it?"
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3777.335,3779.793,"Well, it seems on me that --"
1968.68,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3779.793,3788.013,"But you have to go and attack the constitutionality of the law, everybody has attacked constitutionality of the law."
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3788.013,3801.994,"Well, we would submit that in terms of the consequences of pretrial detention that this is an impermissible one and this is -- absentee balloting is the only way we can meaningfully talk about a person in jail voting."
1968.68,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3801.994,3811.317,"I suppose you had to (Inaudible) to the voting place, (Inaudible)"
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3811.317,3815.348,"Well, I suppose deputy sheriff would have to go in there and that would be rather inconsistent --"
1968.68,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3815.348,3817.248,Would that violate another provision going on?
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3817.248,3823.354,That would certainly violate secrecy which would not be violated if an absentee ballot were cast in jail with the present of a notary.
1968.68,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3823.354,3827.589,But why would they have to go in there with you into the booth?
1968.68,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3827.589,3828.561,It might not be there --
1968.68,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3828.561,3833.23,Your taking to be witnesses and trials all the time I would say and nobody has to go into witness --
1968.68,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3833.23,3835.719,He is a small --
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3835.719,3851.778,"Well, I would say this that I made the value judgment and I'm responsible for that that after discussing this thing with the chief judge of the criminal division, I felt that his position was reasonable and that the only way to talk meaningfully about voting is voting by mail rather than in person."
1968.68,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3862.342,3865.36,That is the Illinois legislature?
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3865.36,3874.906,"No, that is filing of petitions for writ habeas corpus at both tandem to see if we can show that the state is foreclosing all avenues of voting back pre-trial detainees."
1968.68,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3874.906,3876.963,It occurred to you this might be a legislative matter.
1968.68,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3876.963,3880.297,Do you think you could find enough prisoners with that much interest in voting?
1968.68,2,40993,stanley_a_bass,,3880.297,3895.78,"Well, I don't know that's one of the activities about legal aid project is to try to get people interested in their citizenship rights because at present they seems to be more interested in taking there grievances to the street than to the ballot box."
