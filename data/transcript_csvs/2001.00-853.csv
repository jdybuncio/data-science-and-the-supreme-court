2001.00-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.922,"We'll hear argument next in Number 00-853, Porter v. Nussle."
2001.00-853,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,28.903,55.327,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about the meaning of the term, prison conditions, and the reason it is here is because the Second Circuit misinterpreted that term contrary to the purposes of Congress and the meaning given that term by this Court."
2001.00-853,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,107.342,113.238,What's the universe of conditions and nonconditions that you would suggest?
2001.00-853,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,126.234,147.728,"Preiser v. Rodriguez draws the line between habeas corpus petitions on the one hand challenging the fact or duration of confinement and the on the other hand conditions of prison life, or conditions of his prison life, as it refers to the petitions that we think are the universe that would be included in 1983 actions."
2001.00-853,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.617,168.59,"Well, can you give me an example, under your theory, of a case that is not covered by habeas corpus, but that also are not a condition of prison life which is a 1983 suit?"
2001.00-853,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,171.893,180.847,"Our position would be that all of those 183 lawsuits ought to be subject, are subject to the exhaustion requirement."
2001.00-853,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,183.854,193.111,"You can't think of any suit brought by a prisoner that is not controlled by the term, conditions, unless it's a habeas corpus suit?"
2001.00-853,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,193.111,217.806,"--Well, if it were completely unrelated to prison life... an example might be, for example, a lawsuit against a State tax commissioner, for example, just to take one that seems relevant in light of the earlier argument today, where the prisoner is claiming that he's been denied a refund to which he's properly entitled, and--"
2001.00-853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.806,222.806,"You're saying that all Eighth Amendment claims under 1983, which is what most of the prison cases are."
2001.00-853,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,222.806,224.268,--All--
2001.00-853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,224.268,239.664,"They claim that they've been deprived of a constitutional right because they have been sentenced to prison and the conditions of that prison, whether it's an isolated beating by a guard or anything else, are unduly... are cruel and unusual?"
2001.00-853,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,239.664,240.903,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
2001.00-853,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,282.913,284.808,That's an easier line.
2001.00-853,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,313.276,370.31,"Justice Kennedy, Congress used that term because it was used by this Court to describe a category of the universe as set forth in Preiser and again in McCarthy v. Bronson, where the court faced a similar issue under the Magistrates Act, the nonconsensual referral of petitions to magistrates, and said that all of these cases, 1983 cases are, indeed, conditions of confinement cases, and Congress wanted to use that language and that meaning given by this term so as to avoid corollary or, as you put it quite well, satellite litigation that, in fact... in fact has been spawned in the Second Circuit by the Nussle case, and we see it, for example, in Royster v. United States, which is before this Court on cert, where excessive force is no longer even involved."
2001.00-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.19,403.534,"You can certainly find some Eighth Amendment claims that have nothing to do with excessive force, I think."
2001.00-853,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,440.243,442.026,"--Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.00-853,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,459.326,480.907,"General Blumenthal, on the other side of that is the argument that Nussle makes that he said that the guards told me if I report what they did they would kill me, so are there assurances... you said the value of... no risk to the prisoners, this is going on, so that they can cure it."
2001.00-853,0,38829,richard_blumenthal,,493.419,508.07,"--Certainly in Connecticut's system, Justice Ginsburg, there are such assurances, and in the joint appendix at 11 and at other places there are requirements for confidentiality, for example."
2001.00-853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.215,546.639,"General Blumenthal, I don't really understand this."
2001.00-853,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,961.851,985.113,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For four reasons, actions that challenge particular instances of unlawful conduct such as excessive force are actions with respect to prison conditions that must be exhausted under the PLRA."
2001.00-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1142.555,1150.507,"Could you tell me on your point 1, you cited the case where excessive force applied to... prison conditions applied to a single incident."
2001.00-853,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1151.546,1153.336,McCrary v. Bronson.
2001.00-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1153.336,1157.168,And was that pre or post enactment of the litigation reform act?
2001.00-853,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1157.168,1158.334,That's preenactment.
2001.00-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1158.334,1159.236,Preenactment.
2001.00-853,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1159.236,1193.214,"And in that case was a construction of the Magistrates Act that had nonconsensual referral in cases involving conditions of confinement, and the Court interpreted the phrase, Conditions of confinement, to embrace single incidents, including excessive force, and rejected an alternative construction that is similar to the one adopted by the Second Circuit here that prison conditions refers to systematic practices, and it did so for the same reasons, really, that you should reach the same conclusion here."
2001.00-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1216.14,1217.122,What about Hudson and Farmer?
2001.00-853,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1217.122,1240.688,"Hudson and Farmer show that the term, prison conditions, can be used in a narrower sense, and that context matters, but here the context was in defining the substantive elements for proving a particular kind of Eighth Amendment violation, and the substantive standards for proving a claim really have nothing to do with whether a claim should be exhausted."
2001.00-853,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.821,1293.028,"Of course, still in all, even in Hudson, I guess, drawing a distinction between continuing prison conditions and single incident prison conditions, or single incidents that aren't prison conditions, still involves you in the same problem of satellite litigation that you say would be one of the horrible effects of adopting the same interpretation in the present case."
2001.00-853,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1296.945,1299.368,"Justice Scalia, two responses to that."
2001.00-853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1352.308,1355.891,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1357.369,1395.989,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: When Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act, it did so on the heels of at least three decisions by this Court which clearly defined the term, prison conditions, to exclude excessive force cases and those cases start, of course, with Wilson v. Seiter, which expressly held, and I will quote, the very high state of mind prescribed by Whitley does not apply to prison conditions cases."
2001.00-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.989,1398.94,What was at issue in Wilson v. Seiter?
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1398.94,1415.559,"Well, of course, that was a medical indifference case, deliberate indifference case involving the distinction between a single incident and multiple incidents, and to the extent that the Second Circuit, post Nussle, has gone on to attempt to draw a distinction of that kind, we do not defend it."
2001.00-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1425.801,1434.441,So on the other side of the line so far as you're concerned would be a number of single incident types of thing that did not involve excessive force?
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1434.441,1435.952,"--Yes, indeed."
2001.00-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.464,1465.402,But why would Congress have made that distinction and said that one... the kind of cases you're refer... shouldn't exhaust administrative remedies whereas the other one should.
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1474.843,1477.359,"Well, excessive force cases are different."
2001.00-853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1516.762,1524.738,"Isn't the answer to your argument, though, the answer that Mr. Gornstein gave a moment ago when he referred to the significance of context?"
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1575.311,1583.176,"I think that's more a policy issue than a statutory construction issue, and I think that this is just a simple case of statutory construction."
2001.00-853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1583.176,1588.079,"But the... I mean, Mr. Gornstein's argument is kind of a compared-to-what argument."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1612.604,1619.22,"Well, I think the context in which this Court has used it, and therefore in which Congress is presumed to have used it, is the latter."
2001.00-853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1619.22,1626.244,"The cases that, including the one you cite, the Government cites for the opposite proposition."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1626.244,1627.371,I think--
2001.00-853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1627.371,1640.949,"The cases say, and they have loads of language there which seem to say it, that Wilson v. Seiter and three other cases did focus on the issue of single incident versus affecting several people."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1674.33,1684.523,--There's no doubt that the cases involved do not see a principal distinction between single incident and multiple incident cases.
2001.00-853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1702.943,1704.133,That's only excessive force?
2001.00-853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1704.133,1706.3,That's only excessive force?
2001.00-853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.3,1716.982,"I see somebody in dire need of medical attention and I sit there smiling cruelly... please, get me a doctor."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1716.982,1718.844,--That is exactly--
2001.00-853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1718.844,1720.611,You call that excessive force?
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1720.611,1721.481,--That's... no.
2001.00-853,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1724.804,1725.178,Well--
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1725.178,1725.985,There... it's... indeed--
2001.00-853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.985,1731.168,"--It has nothing to do with the things you were saying, then, cruelty, and savagery, whatever."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1731.168,1732.223,"--Well, the term is--"
2001.00-853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.223,1735.718,"You can be just as cruel and savage without applying excessive force, if you do it right."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1735.718,1752.881,"--The... we can have words mean whatever we want them to mean, but this Court has made it clear what it means when it refers to excessive force, and that is the mens rea that we were just talking about which, after all, comes from Judge Friendly's seminal opinion in Johnson v. Glick."
2001.00-853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1804.503,1805.852,That's what I don't understand.
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1844.988,1858.062,"I can't speak for Congress' intention, but I can speak for the meaning of the words as they've been defined by the Court, and there is an obvious distinction under this Court's cases."
2001.00-853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1864.869,1867.219,"Well, but we're also talking about reaching a sensible result."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1867.219,1877.252,"--Well, the sensible result is the result that this Court has often reached in the past, which is to say to Congress, if this is what you want to do, do it in the way that you're supposed to do it."
2001.00-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.252,1881.82,But it really isn't quite that clear what Congress wanted to do as between these two views.
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1881.82,1924.487,"Well, of course, if Congress is ambiguous, then we go back to the default position, and the default position is, we go back to dictionary meaning, and this Court held in McCarthy v. Bronson that if you just look to the dictionary definition of the term, prison conditions, you're not talking about excessive force cases, and in McCarthy this Court said, however, we don't use the dictionary definition because when the Magistrates Act was passed Congress is presumed to have been looking to Preiser, but once Congress gets mushy, as they really are in the PLRA, because some sections use the term prison conditions, some sections don't, and that's even true in the title 42 amendment, so--"
2001.00-853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1924.487,1936.521,"Mr. Williams, there's a case that has come up in various forms where violence, random violence is what characterizes the prison system."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,1971.474,1984.236,"--I'm not sure that this Court has ever told us exactly what the mens rea is that must be met in such a case, and I think that will be the answer to the question when that case arises."
2001.00-853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2004.094,2007.662,"Well, it's hard to say it's deliberate indifference when you're beating up on someone."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2007.662,2014.126,"If you're suing the individual guard, of course, you're dealing with an instance of brutality."
2001.00-853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2021.11,2022.981,The warden knows that this is going on.
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2026.324,2035.565,"If the warden is aware of it and is tolerating it, then it becomes policy, and then this Court is going to have to say, well, what's the standard of liability for the warden?"
2001.00-853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2040.809,2050.489,"I would think that just the usage, ordinary English, what the words mean, when a condition pervades a prison, then it's a prison condition."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2050.489,2085.051,"Well, I think that that gets off into the single incident versus multiple incident issue, and I prefer to think of it in terms of the mens rea, and I can conceive that an argument might well be made, and in fact I would be happy to make it, that where it is so pervasive that the warden is charged with actual knowledge of... there's the municipal liability cases under 1983... that he's charged with knowledge of it, then I would say that the Johnson v. Glick standard applies, and it's not a prison condition, but you could make the other argument just as well."
2001.00-853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2095.164,2111.76,"Why in the world would Congress... you can give us no inkling of why Congress would sit down and say, whether there has to be exhaustion of administrative remedies ought to depend upon what state of mind the actor is going to be held to?"
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2132.845,2165.966,"--I would think that the reason for that, if Congress had a reason, is that Congress knew that because of the very high bar this Court has a record in excessive force cases, combined with the fact pleading requirement, that the concerns Congress had about frivolous litigation and undue meddling of the district courts in their business are already met by existing law, and therefore the PLRA need not be concerned with it and indeed, I think just about everybody agrees that the concerns of Congress in enacting the PLRA was precisely those two things, neither of which readily fits the excessive force model."
2001.00-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2165.966,2177.191,"But if you have a guard who is sadistically beating people, certainly that seems to be the sort of thing that might easily be corrected, at least for the future, by exhaustion."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2177.191,2179.894,"But that, again, is a policy question, Chief Justice."
2001.00-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.894,2198.282,"Well, it is, but when we're trying to figure out what Congress really intended here, I think one shies away from a distinction which is perfectly technically sound but doesn't seem to have anything to do with what people thinking about the desirability of exhaustion would have thought about."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2198.282,2216.655,"Well, when you look at the entire PLRA, and I was a little dismayed in preparing for oral argument to realize that the entire PLRA isn't in the joint appendix to our briefs, but when you look at it in its entirety, the presence or absence of that phrase, prison conditions, is quite interesting."
2001.00-853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2265.609,2269.4,"But here the prisoner suits, it happens to be the caption for the provision."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2275.392,2279.039,"Yes, it is, and then in the context of the section they go on and draw the distinction."
2001.00-853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2287.208,2310.574,"What would we do with a case where the prisoner said, these guards are beating up on me, and the reason they are is that this prison doesn't give guards any training, doesn't supervise them, so my 1983 suit is against the guards that beat me up, but they're also against the officials in the prison who are responsible for training and for monitoring?"
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2312.236,2324.904,"They go two different directions and, of course, as we know, that is common place in prisoner's suits, that they have multiple counts, multiple claims, and some of them are dismissed early on, some of them go a little bit farther, and so forth."
2001.00-853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.736,2356.285,"--Suppose I believe that policy was relevant, would I then be right to think that the isolated beating case is perhaps the strongest case where you should require exhaustion, for the reason that the prison doesn't want such a person on its payroll, and if the prisoner is right, they'll find out about it fast and get rid of him--"
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2356.285,2361.9,"No, actually, the difficulties of removing a civil servant who has--"
2001.00-853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.9,2362.635,"--Oh, but I'll take action."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2362.635,2374.765,"--When you combine all of his Laudermill rights with all of his rights under the collective bargaining agreement, moving that guard or taking meaningful disciplinary action against him is not going to be necessarily that fast."
2001.00-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.503,2395.167,"You say that a prison guard who maliciously beats up on people is just there to stay, so to speak?"
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2395.167,2396.39,"Well, one would hope not."
2001.00-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2396.39,2397.653,One would.
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2397.653,2406.621,"But the fact of the matter is that, like all public employees, they enjoy a number of due process protections and, like most public employees, they also enjoy union protection."
2001.00-853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2406.621,2408.372,Many of them are not public employees any more.
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2408.372,2408.85,I'm sorry.
2001.00-853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2408.85,2410.969,Many of them are not public employees any more.
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2416.751,2417.309,I agree.
2001.00-853,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.723,2421.082,In those cases there wouldn't be a problem in getting rid of a guard.
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2421.082,2424.257,"Well, there's probably still a pretty effective union contract."
2001.00-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2566.672,2568.991,"You're not out of time, but you're welcome to sit down."
2001.00-853,2,33696,john_r_williams,,2568.991,2569.197,Out of ideas.
2001.00-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2569.197,2569.197,"Yes, okay."
2001.00-853,3,38829,richard_blumenthal,,2575.225,2581.609,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I am not completely out of ideas."
2001.00-853,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.059,2772.322,"Thank you, General Blumenthal."
