1975.74-891,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,64.087,"We will hear arguments next in Paul against Davis, 74-891."
1975.74-891,0,19771,carson_p_porter,,70.853,75.011,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-891,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,125.92,127.898,"Well, there is quite a difference between the two, is there not?"
1975.74-891,0,19771,carson_p_porter,,127.898,133.88,I do not think there is any question about that Mr. Chief Justice and that is the real heart of the case.
1975.74-891,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,344.962,349.357,It is so but you do not need to concede the correctness of that decision.
1975.74-891,0,19771,carson_p_porter,,356.946,358.007,You are exactly right Your Honor.
1975.74-891,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,490.92,497.997,Well supposing that there had been an inadequate showing in your view of significant loss.
1975.74-891,0,19771,carson_p_porter,,509.175,519.318,"Yes, Your Honor, what we are saying is while we are admitting for the purposes of argument, these actions were taken under color of law which put us under the first aspect of 1983."
1975.74-891,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,550.851,554.001,Can I ask his diversity or citizenship I suppose you could see on the Federal Court
1975.74-891,0,19771,carson_p_porter,,554.001,555.369,No question about that Your Honor.
1975.74-891,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.369,559.799,Were about a 115 of these people pictured as active shoplifters?
1975.74-891,0,19771,carson_p_porter,,559.799,562.123,There were 121 persons.
1975.74-891,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,562.123,575.029,"I am just looking in what was reproduced here in the appendix about half or more are women, along with this annex “A” that appears in the appendix at page 8 was that distributed to the businessman too?"
1975.74-891,0,19771,carson_p_porter,,575.029,577.159,"That is the cover letter I believe Your Honor, Yes Sir."
1975.74-891,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,577.159,581.473,And how about the material on page 9.
1975.74-891,0,19771,carson_p_porter,,586.79,589.623,Yes Sir at page 9 is a continuation of annex “A”.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1590.382,1594.968,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-891,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1621.36,1622.967,"Well, not that there had been damage."
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1626.412,1650.388,"May I please refer this Court, and it is in the appendix to the response that the employer of Davis gave its very last page of the appendix and if I may it is very brief. Just read directly the question, “As a result of the flyer, did you feel that you might have to possibly limit the places that he would possibly and the future go in as a member?”"
1975.74-891,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1652.416,1654.216,Are you on page 30?
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1654.216,1657.074,I am at page 35 Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.74-891,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1657.074,1659.327,35.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1659.327,1664.495,"In the appendix, the numeration, right at the very end."
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1710.191,1712.02,Will you read on Mr. Taylor?
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1712.02,1714.182,"Yes, of course."
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1726.941,1729.075,So there are no restrictions?
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1729.075,1734.112,"If you please Mr. Justice, the situation had not come up."
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1752.085,1757.8,"How long after the flyer was circulated, was this evidence taken?"
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1757.8,1760.413,This was taken in January.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1767.225,1769.781,"And there had been no restriction in the end, anytime?"
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1769.781,1772.13,There had been possibly.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1925.522,1932.626,"Mr. Taylor, as you get into the constitutional issue which as you said it does interest me."
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1938.462,1938.732,Hardly.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1938.94,1939.862,You do not mention it?
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1939.862,1941.468,Mr. Justice Powell.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1941.468,1942.938,May I finish my question?
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1942.938,1943.999,Yes Sir.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1943.999,1953.693,"You use different terminology quite different for the ACLU, punishment without a prior due process hearing."
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1978.567,1980.345,I understand the question.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1980.345,1983.433,"What is your position, restraint or prior restraint."
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,1993.08,1998.647,"The reason I was opposing was to try to give you, I say I was opposing to try to give you a reasoned answer."
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1998.647,2000.837,"Yes, if you would address that, I will appreciate it."
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2000.837,2001.827,Thank you.
1975.74-891,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2059.639,2067.534,You do not (Inaudible)Mr. Taylor base your claim on a protection of reputation based on Kentucky Law.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2084.914,2097.573,I would suggest Mr. Justice Rehnquist that as a matter of fact Baker is helpful in this and so is York where they talk about an abuse can be so gross.
1975.74-891,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2174.105,2180.436,Is the Constantineau case a 1983 action?
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2180.436,2183.2,"No, if it please Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.74-891,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2183.2,2185.752,It is just an action to --
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2185.752,2189.876,It was directly appealed from a three-judge panel which had held the statute.
1975.74-891,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2196.308,2197.09,Than it was.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2203.158,2205.674,May I respond that is --
1975.74-891,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2205.674,2207.829,I think it have to be it in getting to federal --
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2207.829,2209.761,I believe that --
1975.74-891,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2209.761,2211.003,(Inaudible)
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2211.003,2213.309,Mr. Justice Rehnquist --
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2213.309,2217.099,When was it?
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2217.099,2224.521,It is a 1983 action but I know it was a statute held unconstitutional then I believe by direct appeal to this Court.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2226.23,2228.305,Mr. Taylor.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2228.305,2229.659,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2229.659,2239.124,You asked the question indicating that whether or not 1983 would apply to confer a federal jurisdiction would depend on the degree of the defamation.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2275.965,2279.959,I would not see that fact situation as similar to this.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2279.959,2280.816,Not similar.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2280.816,2283.15,May I distinguish why with your permission.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2283.15,2285.952,Of course.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2285.952,2299.245,"Or as a matter of fact it is interesting that Baker had the First Amendment aspect as you recall where the distinction in Baker was made because I mean they do, police officers have a right to communicate it."
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2334.253,2343.354,"Mr. Taylor, if you were the lawyer accused of using falsified testimony, would you not consider that rather raw also."
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2343.354,2344.871,Would I consider it raw?
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2344.871,2351.069,You said this was a raw case and you used that to distinguish the case that I put to you.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2351.069,2359.715,"I believe I would Mr. Justice Powell but I think in considering my remedies, I would not feel that I was in a comfort, in a position."
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2362.559,2363.702,May I put another one to you.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2398.453,2399.262,"No, I do not think so."
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2399.262,2402.735,No prior restraint in that situation.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2402.735,2406.474,Your Honor I think that you have some other aspects of law there.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2416.778,2420.244,No state action in teaching classes.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2421.794,2424.071,I was going to add a little more to that sentence.
1975.74-891,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2461.604,2468.845,"Excuse me counsel, you get along better with that microphone if you will stay about six or eight inches away from it.[Laughter]"
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2468.845,2470.37,Thank you.
1975.74-891,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.319,2554.117,"Well, no one found this man guilty in official proceeding?"
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2554.117,2559.367,With all respect Mr. Justice Rehnquist the police department tried him in there.
1975.74-891,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2571.183,2579.638,"Well, I thought the presumption of innocence that you just mentioned was directed to criminal proceedings, directed at ultimate incarceration of the person?"
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2579.638,2593.881,I think a presumption of innocence is shared and possessed by all of us at all stages in our life and in the proceeding of a criminal case.
1975.74-891,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2641.433,2653.898,"But why in answer to Justice Powell’s question when one professor calls another man a fraud and perhaps accuses the most plagiarism, why can the same principle be invoked, if they are state employees?"
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2653.898,2660.393,"I think possibly, one might want to consider a bit."
1975.74-891,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2775.679,2777.001,I think no.
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2777.001,2777.305,Thank you.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2777.305,2782.068,May I just ask one final question?
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2805.844,2809.264,May I respond that I understand what you asked me is indeed --
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2809.264,2817.795,"Well, my concern is whether or not your position does not run head on into the First Amendment?"
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2829.212,2830.023,Yes.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2830.023,2833.819,"This is on the egregious case, but there are lot of cases that are not?"
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2833.819,2844.162,Of course this is a case of where -- I think I must come back to your analogy of your question a couple of minutes ago about the professors.
1975.74-891,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2848.236,2851.879,Warring publicly on educational television?
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2851.879,2852.426,That is right.
1975.74-891,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2885.905,2903.956,"Mr. Taylor, you might be able to sustain what it is involved here in the preliminary hearing to do the first, but you still got to go across the notion that he has a private hearing before rather than after."
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2922.654,2925.666,"A I read Constantineau, no."
1975.74-891,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.666,2927.734,"Whether you have any hearing any time there, (Inaudible)?"
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2927.734,2930.528,"But of course, the statue was abrogated."
1975.74-891,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.093,2950.037,"We know, but you also have to argue then that it is not enough to repair the damage afterwards?"
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2950.037,2953.058,Oh! You take what you can get Mr. Justice White.
1975.74-891,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2971.542,2985.331,"Well, then how do you distinguish Mr. Justice Powell’s inquiry about the two professors, we are assuming there state maligning and there is just of much of a good name that issue there as here?"
1975.74-891,1,21618,daniel_t_taylor_iii,,2985.331,2985.955,That is true.
1975.74-891,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3085.787,3088.941,Mr. Porter you have a little time left.
1975.74-891,2,19771,carson_p_porter,,3090.423,3094.17,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-891,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3094.17,3096.48,You have about five minutes remaining.
1975.74-891,2,19771,carson_p_porter,,3096.48,3098.055,Thank you Your Honor.
1975.74-891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3196.952,3198.393,(Inaudible)
1975.74-891,2,19771,carson_p_porter,,3198.393,3199.552,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3199.552,3211.507,Suppose (Inaudible) that an injunction result on the right track.
1975.74-891,2,19771,carson_p_porter,,3217.492,3218.777,In state court proceedings?
1975.74-891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3218.777,3224.305,-- against the police continuing to take a proof that the allegation was false?
1975.74-891,2,19771,carson_p_porter,,3224.305,3224.964,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.413,3231.115,On the grounds that there was irreparable injury involved?
1975.74-891,2,19771,carson_p_porter,,3231.115,3232.674,Yes sir.
1975.74-891,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3249.127,3272.722,"Was this procedural delay that you had referred to, part of some program in Kentucky that is generally called the early diversion of cases that is deferral of any prosecution in certain types of cases, first offender and so forth or was it just administrative inadvertence that no prosecution proceeded?"
1975.74-891,2,19771,carson_p_porter,,3272.722,3278.343,"No, Your Honor it is a specific provision in the Kentucky Law where the respondent in this case --"
1975.74-891,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3278.343,3281.402,From the application of it though?
1975.74-891,2,19771,carson_p_porter,,3281.402,3289.239,"Well, according to the transcript that was presented at the evidentiary hearing there were no prosecuting witnesses present at the time."
1975.74-891,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3335.604,3342.848,If your standard determines what cases may be filed away?
1975.74-891,2,19771,carson_p_porter,,3342.848,3343.592,"No sir, Your Honor."
1975.74-891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.738,3376.966,"Well suppose this case was over and he had been found guilty and fined with $100.00, he paid the fine and then the publication was made, the circulation was made with the words “active shoplifter” on it and he sued and asked for an injunction?"
1975.74-891,2,19771,carson_p_porter,,3376.966,3383.335,I think Your Honor that he would be entitled to a defamation relief even under those circumstances because --
1975.74-891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3383.335,3386.066,In whatever condition in this case was?
1975.74-891,2,19771,carson_p_porter,,3386.066,3394.252,"Basically, I would concur, except I wanted to correct what I perceive to be in this statement of the status of that provisional in the law."
1975.74-891,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3394.938,3395.655,Thank you gentlemen.
