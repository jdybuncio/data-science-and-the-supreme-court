1978.77-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,74.332,We will hear arguments next in New York City Transit against Beazer.
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,138.858,139.596,Thank you.
1978.77-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.35,218.337,"Well, it is conceivable as it is not that if we were to decide that the Court of Appeals have been incorrect on the constitutional issue, we would not have decide the Title VII issue ourselves, but send that back?"
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,218.337,220.867,Send the Title VII question back?
1978.77-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,220.867,222.836,"Yeah, under the new statute."
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,222.836,223.925,To the Circuit Court?
1978.77-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.925,224.994,Yes.
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,224.994,227.388,"That could be done, that could be done."
1978.77-1427,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,227.388,230.976,But didn't the Circuit Court say there was a violation of Title VII?
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,230.976,232.226,"No, the Circuit Court did not."
1978.77-1427,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,235.711,238.353,"Well, it did for the purposes of attorney's fees, didn't it?"
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,238.353,244.66,The District Court found that Title VII violation for the purpose of awarding attorney's fees.
1978.77-1427,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,257.026,267.979,"Well, did the â€“ did either Court or anybody suggest why the constitutional issue was reached without deciding the statutory issue?"
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,267.979,272.545,"No, as a matter of fact I think it went just the other way in the District."
1978.77-1427,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,279.194,281.367,Do you see anything odd about that?
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,281.367,288.997,"Do I see anything odd of it, I certainly do, but that is the way the original District Court decision went."
1978.77-1427,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.997,292.568,And the Court of Appeals apparently didn't find anything wrong with that either?
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,292.568,296.076,Apparently they did not.
1978.77-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,332.459,333.862,For all jobs?
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,333.862,335.629,For all jobs.
1978.77-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,358.582,365.414,The District Court opinion would not let a drug addict run one of these --
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,365.414,377.162,"Well, the District Court specified motorman, conductor, bus operator and positions dealing with power equipment."
1978.77-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,567.704,568.603,Sometimes what?
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,568.603,571.734,"Sometimes for some, for some heroin addicts."
1978.77-1427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.034,586.958,"Ms. Offner, before you get too deep into your argument, I would like to ask you a question about the precise class we are talking about."
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,600.612,600.858,Correct.
1978.77-1427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,600.858,613.115,"You say that's but -- now what is the state of the record with respect to persons who formerly used methadone but do not now taking any drugs at all, say someone who had gone on rehabilitation program and claimed he was cured."
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,618.63,631.522,"There was very little attention paid during the course of the trail to people who detoxified from methadone, in another words people who were totally drug free."
1978.77-1427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,701.328,707.148,"So your view would be that the there is no absolute exclusion of those persons who have been free for four, five years?"
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,707.148,707.497,Correct.
1978.77-1427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.497,711.214,And certainly the language of 11(b) itself would be consistent with your explanation --
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,711.214,714.885,That is correct Mr. Justice Stevens.
1978.77-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,714.885,719.737,"Three of the four members of the class were presently participating in methadone, were they not?"
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,719.737,728.343,"Yes, that is right."
1978.77-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,759.834,761.229,In how many years?
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,761.229,769.997,Two years in treatment.
1978.77-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.47,825.958,"Ms. Offner, if this were a diversity case or the issue had been whether or not methadone participants can be satisfactory employees and the District Court had heard the evidence it did and made the findings it did, would you say that successful argument because it made to a Court of Appeals that its findings were clearly erroneous?"
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,825.958,827.374,That is not my contention --
1978.77-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,827.374,827.606,You don't have to --
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,827.606,829.222,-- Mr. Rehnquist.
1978.77-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.97,832.323,You do not have to go that far here.
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,832.323,834.504,No I don't go that far.
1978.77-1427,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1282.568,1291.249,"May I ask Ms. Offner, I am correct am I not in my understanding that the Court of Appeals didn't reach the Title VII issue?"
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,1291.249,1293.819,"It did not reach the Title VII issue, yes."
1978.77-1427,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1293.819,1299.977,"And since it didn't do so, how or why is that issue now before us?"
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,1299.977,1306.793,It was one of the questions that are posed in the petition for Cert Mr. Justice Stewart and Cert was granted on that issue.
1978.77-1427,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1306.793,1317.647,"That was a question wholly undecided by the Court of Appeals, whose judgment we are now reviewing, isn't that?"
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,1317.647,1319.271,That is quite true.
1978.77-1427,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1328.053,1329.115,Alright.
1978.77-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1329.115,1348.948,That could not be uncommon perhaps with a view to keeping the matter before the Court for possible remand for consideration by it if there were no other basis of disposition?
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,1348.948,1353.135,I do not disagree with the Chief Justice.
1978.77-1427,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1353.135,1360.804,"Ms. Offner, are you going to address the argument of the effect of the Rehabilitation Act?"
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,1360.804,1372.016,"Yes, I do intend to do that."
1978.77-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1537.959,1540.693,There were judgments for back pay here?
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,1540.693,1544.008,There were judgments for back pay for the members of the class.
1978.77-1427,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1562.244,1575.976,"Ms. Offner, I gather that you do not concede far from it that the statute, even as amended this past October, requires you to hire these people?"
1978.77-1427,0,32250,joan_offner,,1575.976,1582.229,"That is exactly right Mr. Justice Stewart and that is our position, yes."
1978.77-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1598.229,1621.848,We'll resume at this point at 1'o clock.
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1626.31,1629.518,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.419,1690.159,"But isn't it possible that the district court thought that it might as well reach it, titles of the equal protection issue first because the Title VII issue also had a constitutional issue in it?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1690.159,1692.525,I do not know why the district court decided this.
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.525,1694.219,"But there was, wasn't there?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1694.219,1695.444,Yes.
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.444,1707.531,"And furthermore, the constitutional issue in the Title VII question involved the constitutionality as an act of Congress?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1707.531,1711.581,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1711.581,1713.726,"But in any of that, that is possible?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1713.726,1722.688,I was just trying to recall whether the Transit Authority raised the constitutional issue relating to Title VII at the time that --
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.688,1725.491,"Well, it certainly had it at the time of the district court ruled?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1725.491,1726.413,Yes it had at that time.
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.413,1729.196,Yes.
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1729.196,1737.797,Counsel for petitioners has overdrawn the scope of respondent's argument and of the decisions of the courts below.
1978.77-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.253,1788.788,"Mrs. Greenberg, you lay some stress on the fact that the rule is unwritten, do you feel that helps you or hinders you or is it a neutral fact?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1788.788,1801.068,I think that it helps us in the sense that it goes to the degree of deference which this Court should afford to the Transit Authority's rule.
1978.77-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.068,1812.319,Haven't we said that a Municipal Corporation's rule is -- when it is challenged constitutionally just as if the New York Legislature enacted a statute to that effect?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1812.319,1831.246,"That may be so, but even when this Court is evaluating a legislative rule as it did in Murgia, it paid a great deal of attention to the legislative -- the basis for the legislature's action."
1978.77-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1831.246,1833.801,And that would [Inaudible] whether it is written or unwritten?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1833.801,1835.83,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1835.83,1854.106,"Mrs. Greenberg, isn't it correct that the issue isn't a classification of methadone users, but rather the question is whether Rule 11 (b) as interpreted to include methadone users is too broad, that is irrational because it is too broad?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1854.106,1867.549,"Rule 11 (b) is directed only to practices by incumbents, that is persons already employed by the Transit Authority."
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.048,1910.873,It begins -- more precise to say anyone who falls within the terms -- who would fall within the terms of 11 (b) if an employee and then they construe 11 (b) to include methadone users?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1910.873,1928.417,"Yes, that is certainly part of our argument that is irrational to do so, particularly in view of the consideration that is given to all other employees and applicants, some of whom may violate rules."
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1930.84,1943.731,But you would not consider 11 (b) irrational if they did not define methadone users as persons who use drugs within the meaning of the rule or would you?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1943.731,1948.362,Well we are of course representing methadone users.
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1965.384,1967.643,"Well, they do have such a rule?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1967.643,1968.057,Pardon?
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1968.057,1988.749,"They do have such a rule, which is quoted on page 5 of petitioners' brief, yeah that's what we are talking about and you don't contend that, that rule would be irrational if the definition did not encompass methadone users as I understand?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1988.749,2005.857,"If it did not encompass present methadone users and only encompassed present narcotics users who did not have the permission of the medical director, we would not consider it irrational."
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2035.324,2051.654,"Just like Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked about the statute, cannot we look at the rule as thought it were somewhat like a statute and we have to determine its meaning by the way it has been construed and it has been construed in some of these fringe areas to require individualized treatment, and in other areas, it includes methadone users."
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2061.63,2063.79,"Yes, it is too broad a rule."
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2102.039,2106.431,Does that become a business of the court?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2106.431,2108.154,"No, it does not become the business of the court."
1978.77-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2117.119,2122.424,"But then it went on -- it is going to review that determination, is it not?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2122.424,2135.182,I should think that if the Transit Authority abused its discretion in and designated a job that was obviously not safety-sensitive such as file clerk job --
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2135.182,2144.499,But the accountants would handle a lot of money. Revenue people -- their money comes in an small bits and pieces.
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2174.22,2185.808,"There is nothing in the record to support the proposition that a successful methadone patient who has been rehabilitated, who has been identified as employable --"
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2185.808,2188.442,"So who has been, if you --"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2188.442,2188.854,Pardon --
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2188.854,2201.536,"If we accept the idea who has been rehabilitated, that's one thing, but how do you identify a rehabilitated one and what does the record show about the success of rehabilitation?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2201.536,2230.798,"The record shows that after an initial period of adjustment which can last from a few weeks up to at most a year, that after that period has passed, the vast majority of methadone patients are employable and at that group, the group that has been in treatment for a year or more, is directly comparable to any group of applicants for positions in the Transit Authority."
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.798,2236.546,"If that is so, why did the district court put aside the sensitive positions?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2236.546,2254.069,"The district court acting out of an abundance of caution, wanting to adopt the least intrusive of rule that it could, allowed the Transit Authority to set aside certain jobs to fit within the --"
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.069,2257.801,"I know what it did, but I wonder why?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2257.801,2264.288,"Well, I think again it is difficult to know why the district court did what it did."
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.962,2284.01,"I would suppose based on what you just said a moment ago that you would think that, that reservation of those positions would also violate the Equal Protection Clause?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2284.01,2300.459,I think it is a more difficult case because the Transit Authority already has a structure for -- it in fact already does designate certain jobs as sensitive or non-sensitive.
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.459,2314.759,"I know but whatever the job is, you just said that these people who have been running the program successfully for a year are just like the general population, and yet the district court did not think so obviously?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2314.759,2325.123,"They are just like the general population, some of whom may -- the Transit Authority will employ and some of whom it won't."
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.513,2341.793,Yes but the district court let the Transit Authority as a -- just on a per se basis exclude any methadone -- the district court let the Transit Authority apply its rule to any sensitive position?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2341.793,2343.416,Yes it did and we --
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.416,2346.071,Without individualizing anything?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2346.071,2351.229,Yes and it is our position that there was no basis in the record for doing so.
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2351.229,2353.553,Which you have not challenge that here?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2353.553,2354.517,We did not challenge that.
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2354.517,2355.646,What about the figures that --
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.646,2364.325,But it is some indication that the district court thought there was a difference?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2364.325,2371.004,It is only an indication I think Your Honor that the district court was proceeding very cautiously.
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.004,2374.239,Was the proceeding irrational?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2374.239,2375.78,Was the district court proceeding irrational?
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.78,2377.63,"Yes, in drawing that distinction?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2377.63,2377.991,Perhaps.
1978.77-1427,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.991,2385.636,"Now there is a difference between motormen driving the train at 80 miles an hour and a porter pushing the broom at one mile a year, isn't it?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2385.636,2387.836,"Yes, there is. [Attempt to Laughter]"
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2387.836,2399.769,"What about the figure that your friend gave us that out of 600 patients, only 10 are found free of the addiction after two years of therapy, was that figure wrong or is it supported by the record?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2399.769,2407.07,That figure is I would say an aberration; the context from which that was drawn is the following.
1978.77-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.232,2492.115,"When you say the great weight of expert opinion, you do admit, I take it, that there was conflict in the district court that different views were presented and he chose to believe the one that he thought was more persuasive?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2492.115,2493.581,Not really.
1978.77-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2556.471,2569.358,"What if instead of all this testimony being presented to the district court first, it had been have presented to the New York Transit Authority and after giving exactly the same testimony, the Transit Authority had adopted the rule, it did."
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2575.564,2578.117,I think we could have gone in on that record.
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2621.699,2629.067,"[Inaudible] determined employable, did anyone define or did they agree on a definition of employability?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2629.067,2642.98,"Everyone was talking about people who were free of drug use, of illicit drug use, free of alcohol abuse, people who had in fact employment records."
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2660.598,2686.255,"Would it be extraordinary to at least have a rebuttable presumption that the people then employed who in some capacity, who went into a methadone program had not yet shown such objective symptoms as to alert their employers, in other words that they were performing?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2686.255,2687.041,Exactly.
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2687.041,2691.27,"There are degrees, there are degrees of addiction and they will certainly know that, don't they?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2691.27,2697.882,Two of our named plaintiffs were employed by the Transit Authority were fired solely because they were in methadone treatment.
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2721.129,2722.722,You mean in the tower?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2722.722,2722.932,Yes.
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2722.932,2723.672,In his control?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2723.672,2724.116,Yes.
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2724.116,2742.696,"But suppose they had a tragic accident and it could be traced to some aberration of this man, naturally exposing, that would expose some rather difficult liability questions, wouldn't it, perhaps they knowingly retained a person who is an addict?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2742.696,2746.687,I think it -- perhaps it could expose them to some.
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.886,2844.838,Did you agree with the one year test?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2844.838,2847.696,"Yes, we did agree with the one year test."
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2847.696,2853.029,But that wasn't your proposal or was it?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2853.029,2861.13,"I think, by the time we put in a proposal, we did agree that --"
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2861.13,2864.003,"How did you arrive at that, just based on the --"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2864.003,2881.683,"Based on the evidence, which was that it takes a little time for -- first of all, it takes a little time for a methadone patient to become stabilized on his dosage, go in there and build up to a certain dosage."
1978.77-1427,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2928.047,2932.456,"You mean after the one year, he is off of drug forever?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2932.456,2933.491,After one year --
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.491,2935.553,If he is on methadone drug?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2935.553,2941.217,"In a methadone treatment program, the patient is still taking methadone --"
1978.77-1427,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2941.217,2942.459,But he is stabilized --
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2942.459,2946.597,-- but he is stabilized and he is as employable as anyone else.
1978.77-1427,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2946.597,2948.999,As long as he takes methadone?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2948.999,2950.889,He is employable as long as he --
1978.77-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.889,2954.87,"Except where it might make a difference in the safety position, isn't it?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2954.87,2960.66,We would certainly not concede that exception.
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.66,2963.047,"No, but the judge conceded that that there is exception?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2963.047,2966.254,Yes.
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2967.266,2992.11,"You are not really suggesting that a person who has been one year -- that this generalization that doesn't probe into what the degree of the habit was before the methadone treatment, how much methadone they took, but then when they are stabilized on whatever the dosage is which might be very high, medium or low, is that person is employable as an airline pilot, for example?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,2992.11,2999.436,I don't know what the standards or performance required of Airline Pilots are.
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3102.418,3103.851,How does this advance your argument?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3112.498,3115.41,The argument is that there is no --
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3115.41,3117.344,This is an irrational classification?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3117.344,3118.5,It is an irrational classification --
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.5,3124.63,"It would be equally irrational I suppose if they excluded alcoholics on a blanket basis, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3124.63,3151.336,"Not necessarily, because under the Transit Authority's procedures, screening procedures, they can tell who would make a good employee, whether he is a methadone patient or whether he is a former alcoholic, there is no -- the classification here is between persons whom the Transit Authority will not even give individualized consideration to."
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3151.336,3155.058,"That is the people to find in Rule 11 (b) as construed onto methadone users, so it is rational or it is irrational?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3155.058,3164.504,"So the methadone patients and people with histories of drug abuse, 11 (b) does not talk about histories of drug abuse but there is no question that the Transit Authority does --"
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3164.504,3166.692,It is so construed to cover them.
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3181.477,3188.305,"Yes, the record tells us that 46% of the employees of Transit Authority are Black or Hispanic."
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3203.25,3205.27,Do you really mean it is irrelevant?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3205.27,3206.572,Yes.
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3206.572,3213.433,Then how do we know that the exclusion of the methadone users has a disparate impact on Blacks and Hispanics?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3219.645,3224.646,We would not contend that it has a discouraging effect on all Blacks or Hispanics.
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3224.646,3226.802,Then how does it violate Title VII?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3226.802,3233.484,"Because it -- the individuals who are affected by it, a Black --"
1978.77-1427,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.484,3239.56,"Would you say it was unlawful, even if every person rejected for this reason, was replaced by a person of the same race?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3239.56,3259.74,"Yes Your Honor, because the individuals who are rejected are entitled to be considered on their merits and not on the basis of a criterion which has the effect of excluding disproportionately large numbers of Blacks and Hispanics and does not the meet the business necessity test."
1978.77-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3259.74,3262.48,Where do you get your disproportionate?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3273.771,3275.936,"I am not sure, I'll enter into that proposal definitely."
1978.77-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3293.356,3303.027,So percent of Black or Hispanic methadone users is higher than the percentage of Black or Hispanic members of the population as a whole?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3303.027,3320.521,Yes and the fact that the Transit Authority has even arguably reached some kind of racial balance in its workforce does not immunize otherwise discriminatory non-job related practices from scrutiny under Title VII.
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3320.521,3327.983,I still don't understand why then you say 46% is irrelevant to this whole picture Mrs. Greenberg.
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3327.983,3330.875,I am saying it is irrelevant for two reasons.
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3332.227,3335.972,"What if it was 86%, will it make any difference?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3335.972,3340.004,"First of all, we would have to know it would not make a difference if --"
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3340.004,3347.47,One of the claims here is that this â€“ the impact is discriminatory on Negroes and Hispanics?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3347.47,3349.091,Yes.
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3372.57,3378.82,"My question is just about irrelevancy, you cannot really say that it is irrelevant in making these evaluations?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3378.82,3398.806,I am saying that is irrelevant in the absence of any data about what -- even if all of their policies did not result in a -- it's irrelevant because we don't know what the racial composition of their applicants were.
1978.77-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3415.456,3429.375,"But would not you say that if 100% of the applicants were Black or Hispanic, and 100% of their employees were Black or Hispanic, it still violate Title VII, because the ratio of methadone users to the population in general?"
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3429.375,3452.167,"I would say that it would still violate the Title VII, yes Your Honor, because the individuals who would be affected and those individuals are -- it is to individuals that the act is directed, would still being unlawfully discriminated against."
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3452.167,3454.354,Do you have anything further counsel?
1978.77-1427,1,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3454.354,3457.095,"I have no further comments, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3457.095,3462.307,"Thank you ladies, the case is submitted."
