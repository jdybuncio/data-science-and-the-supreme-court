2006.05-381,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.036,We'll hear argument first in case 05-381 Weyerhaeuser Company versus Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company.
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,10.428,13.711,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,67.486,71.687,Can I ask you a preliminary question before you get too far into your argument?
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,88.05,88.481,--Yes.
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,113.228,118.941,"You may consider it as an anticompetitive act, but it does not say you may regard it as a violation of Section 2."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,118.941,119.582,No.
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,119.582,130.339,"And as I read the instructions, it did require there be three elements of the violation of Section 2 which, two of which were not discussed by the Court of Appeals."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,130.339,135.291,"Well, Your Honor, there is no, there is no contention here about monopoly power."
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,138.653,140.326,Do you concede there is monopoly power?
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,140.326,142.436,We are not disputing it before this Court.
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,142.436,154.704,"But is that relevant to the question whether, if there is monopoly power plus an attempt to preserve that power or require that power, plus an anticompetitive act, is that a violation of section 2."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,154.704,165.491,"Well, Your Honor, our view is what the Court has said in cases like Trinko, is that the test is monopoly power and anticompetitive conduct."
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,171.956,179.56,"But you do agree that the conduct in itself is not sufficient to establish a violation, the question of whether the conduct plus the monopoly power--"
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,179.56,179.931,Yes.
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,189.697,200.974,"--And so you're arguing not only that the pricing conduct was not itself sufficient to prove a violation, but it also was not even an anticompetitive act that may give rise to damages?"
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,200.974,203.558,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,209.079,215.154,"Obviously, if there's just an anticompetitive act without a violation of the statute, then there would be no basis for damages."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,215.154,229.802,"I think that's right, but I guess the way I think the Court has approached determining anticompetitive act, anticompetitive conduct, is it's the kind of conduct when engaged in by a monopolist or an entity that has a dangerous probability of cheating it, it is a violation of this statute."
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,229.802,233.054,"Of course in the Brooke case, it may not have even been a monopolist."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,233.054,239.349,"Well, because Brooke involved a claim under the Patent Act."
2006.05-381,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,262.957,287.764,"Well, it's a little different here in that in the Brooke Group cases, of course, the alleged anticompetitive conduct was pricing too low, which has at least a direct benefit to consumers either in the short term, certainly in the short term, and arguably in the long-term as well, while here that is not the form in which the anticompetitive conduct, that's not the form the anticompetitive conduct takes."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,292.856,298.81,"--Your Honor, we don't, we don't think that that difference is a distinction that warrants a different test, for several reasons."
2006.05-381,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,337.819,344.144,"Have we ever identified that as a benefit that the antitrust laws try to achieve, people get higher prices for what they sell?"
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,344.144,344.963,--Yes.
2006.05-381,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,358.131,366.498,"So in Brooke Group, we said it's a benefit when prices are low to consumers, and in this other case we said it's a benefit when prices are high to suppliers."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,366.498,379.956,"Because the benefit that I think the Court is looking at in both cases is not the particular price levels, but in achieving and ensuring free price competition because of the central role that price plays in the economy."
2006.05-381,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.689,406.474,"I assume it's a benefit to consumers if the supply of the needed goods is increased because of higher prices being paid for those needed goods, and I assume when a higher price is paid, more of those goods will be forthcoming, which will benefit consumers who want those goods."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,406.474,408.735,"--That is our second argument, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-381,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,408.735,422.605,"Well, you don't have that in this case, do you, because I thought the, I thought one of the arguments on the other side was the inelasticity of the supplies, so that no matter what they were paying, basically the same amount of wood was ultimately going to get processed; is that correct?"
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,422.605,423.056,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-381,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.454,481.606,I presume it could lead to lower consumer prices too.
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,509.042,520.352,"That's exactly right, Justice Scalia, and that's what the record reflects here, that Weyerhaeuser invested in its lumber mills and created a process that got more value out of a log."
2006.05-381,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,549.0,557.845,Was there any argument in the trial court or in the briefs of the Court of Appeals as to how to calculate cost?
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,572.714,582.239,"Well, our view, Justice Kennedy, there really wasn't, because the district judge had made clear his view in the pretrial motions that there wasn't a need to prove prices, and that--"
2006.05-381,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,582.239,584.613,But that was the end of it at the trial court.
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,584.613,600.062,"--But our position is, and there has certainly been some writing on this in the literature, is that what one does is take the cost of producing the output which includes the allegedly predatory price of the log, and here logs are 75 percent of the cost so it's a very big cost."
2006.05-381,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,615.101,619.916,"Mr. Pincus, how do you determine the price of the logs?"
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,673.511,674.66,No.
2006.05-381,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,710.935,717.189,"It's not clear to me that we have to get into this but if we do, I'm not sure about your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,731.929,732.781,And it might be--
2006.05-381,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,732.781,740.034,"And if Weyerhaeuser wanted to drive somebody out of the market, then they go after the logs which are open to both parties."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,740.034,746.83,"--And Your Honor, as the Court observed in Brooke Group, there really wasn't a need there to get into how the test works and we think there isn't here."
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,836.318,837.81,May I ask this question?
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,864.988,870.612,"And the only anticompetitive conduct alleged was pricing conduct, Your Honor?"
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.612,870.822,No.
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,889.135,890.985,"No, it wouldn't, Your Honor."
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.985,893.367,Even if the whole purpose was to drive it out of business?
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,893.367,895.357,Even if that was the whole purpose.
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,895.357,897.23,Pursuant to a plan to acquire a monopoly.
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,897.23,910.837,"And the reason for that, Justice Stevens, is it's very hard to distinguish, especially for the judicial system to distinguish, between hard-fought competition and anticompetitive intent if all we're looking at is what's in people's mind set."
2006.05-381,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,914.521,921.065,"Why is it so hard if you take Justice Stevens' premise that there's an agreement and we take that as a given, as a given premise?"
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,921.065,945.231,"--Well, because there won't be a given premise in every case, Your Honor, and the problem is the Court has to write rules that will, that will govern conduct, primary conduct of business people in the market, and a rule that says if you can prove intent then you don't have to worry about prices and costs is a rule that opens the door to second-guess, judicial second-guessing of prices--"
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,945.231,947.442,"No, but only intent plus monopoly power."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,949.615,950.474,"--You do, Your Honor."
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,950.474,951.886,There aren't too many cases that fit this.
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,951.886,964.765,"As the Court has recognized in the section 2 context, the problem of deterring procompetitive conduct is even more serious because you don't have the threshold requirement of proof of conspiracy, as one does in section 1."
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.047,970.578,"No, but unilateral conduct where you have monopoly power."
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,972.57,978.324,"--Well, Your Honor, market definition is a complicated issue and it may be hard for businesses--"
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.324,984.599,It was an issue that was resolved by the jury in this case and I don't understand you to be disputing the resolution of that issue.
2006.05-381,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.599,998.186,What do we do in the correlative situation where there is an allegation of predatory selling rather than predatory buying if you had the same situation posed by Justice Stevens?
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1005.342,1007.814,"--It would not establish a violation, Your Honor."
2006.05-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1024.944,1025.756,But that did not involve a monopoly.
2006.05-381,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1027.445,1034.099,"--But it involved the test for predatory pricing, Your Honor, under Robinson-Patman."
2006.05-381,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1062.228,1063.029,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1068.863,1072.977,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-381,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1163.325,1170.852,"Would you describe the hypothetical Justice Stevens posed to your, your brother, would you describe that as just aggressive bidding?"
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1182.138,1195.826,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I understood Justice Stevens' hypothetical, and he can correct me if I'm wrong, to posit a case in which there was dynamite evidence that the defendant had a monopolistic or exclusionary intent."
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.621,1204.962,"No, you have to have the monopoly power as well."
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1204.962,1208.385,"Well, that is also true, and with regard to a claim of attempted--"
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.385,1224.075,"In your view, if as the jury was instructed in this case there was proof of monopoly power and intent to maintain or preserve that power, plus anticompetitive acts, does the anticompetitive act have to be in and of itself a violation of the Sherman Act?"
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1224.075,1228.908,"--Well, I think you need to have all three of those elements in order to state a claim of attempted monopolization--"
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.908,1230.54,"And if you do have all three, is that enough to prove a violation?"
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1230.54,1236.124,--That would be enough to state a claim for attempted monopolization under this Court's decision in Separate Forks.
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.124,1237.734,And isn't that how the jury was instructed in this case?
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1237.734,1247.111,In our view the jury was instructed that it would be sufficient to establish an anticompetitive act to find that petitioner priced its logs--
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.111,1254.105,"Yes, but if it was not instructed it would be sufficient to find a violation of section 2 by those, by that accounting, is that not correct?"
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1254.105,1266.883,"--That is correct, Justice Stevens, and the jury was also instructed and in our view the jury was properly instructed with regard to the other two elements, namely a dangerous probability of monopolization and a specific intent to monopolize."
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1278.561,1280.133,Go back to my hypothetical.
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1292.451,1293.85,"No, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.781,1300.284,Even if it was for the sole purpose of driving the company out of business in order to accomplish the goal of getting a monopoly?
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1300.284,1314.914,"--That would be evidence, and it may be powerful evidence, of a monopolistic intent, though courts have noted that even with regard to that requirement it's famously difficult to distinguish between a legitimate competitive attempt on the one hand and an illegitimate monopolistic intent."
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.914,1315.235,"No, no."
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1330.856,1332.036,"No, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.879,1346.086,Will you need to meet the prongs of the Brooker test even if you otherwise prove a violation of section 2?
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1346.086,1351.62,"Well, I'm not quite sure what it means to say that you otherwise prove a violation in that example."
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.62,1355.142,You prove monopoly power plus an intent to maintain or acquire it.
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1355.142,1356.452,That is insufficient.
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1358.034,1359.904,That's insufficient to prove a violation of Section 2?
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1359.904,1369.482,"--It is insufficient to prove a violation of section 2 because you have to have some conduct that is classed as exclusionary, and in our view that is the content that the Brooke Group standard supplies."
2006.05-381,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1379.636,1392.235,I assume you could have a company that has a dynamite evidence of seeking to monopolize and the means that they choose is just idiotic.
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1414.92,1415.73,Justice Scalia--
2006.05-381,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.73,1418.432,And that's what you're asserting is the case here.
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1418.432,1424.586,--You could have an incompetent monopolist more generally or an incompetent predator in this specific context.
2006.05-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.875,1441.938,But there is no evidence of monopoly power and it isn't even remotely at issue in that case.
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1441.938,1460.479,"--That's right, and it wasn't an issue simply because it was a Robinson-Patman Act case and all that is required under the Robinson-Patman Act is the possibility of harm to competition and there was some disagreement about whether a showing had been made of that requisite possibility between the majority opinion and your dissenting opinion."
2006.05-381,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1476.399,1489.339,Would your answer be the same if you added to Justice Stevens' hypothetical very high barriers of entry that would prevent other competitors from entering the market after the target was driven out?
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1489.339,1502.348,"High barriers to entry, Justice Alito, would be very relevant to the inquiry under the second prong of the Brooke Group standard, namely whether the defendant had a dangerous probability of recoupment in the long term."
2006.05-381,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1635.234,1642.388,"You also, I take it, have to have an equally limited approach on the recoupment analysis, then."
2006.05-381,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1646.782,1647.052,Yes.
2006.05-381,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1677.501,1678.893,"Thank you, Mr. Shanmugam."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,1683.505,1687.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please The Court."
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1725.545,1746.09,"But even it does hurt the suppliers and the antitrust laws are just as, I don't know just as, but they are just as concerned about a group of small farmers or a group of small growers or a group of small fishermen faced with a monopsony buyer as they are with a group of consumers having to fight off a monopoly seller."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,1746.09,1747.329,Justice Breyer--
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1747.329,1748.761,"I mean that's pretty well established, isn't it?"
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,1748.761,1755.026,--Well I'd like to point out that the Mandeville Farms case that Mr. Pincus cited does not stand for the same--
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1755.026,1766.603,"No, no, Congress has actually passed special legislation that the Mandeville Farms is consistent with the Farmers Cooperative and so... you want me to write the proposition that the antitrust laws are not concerned--"
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,1766.603,1767.233,"--Oh, absolutely--"
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1767.233,1772.006,"--with the monopoly buyer who would in fact exploit a group of small suppliers, farmers?"
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,1772.006,1772.687,--Absolutely not.
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1772.687,1773.107,Okay.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,1773.107,1785.456,"But in this particular context which the Ninth Circuit repeatedly emphasized, in an inelastic market like this one raising input prices is not going to increase supply and--"
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1785.456,1787.366,"That can't possibly be right, can it?"
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,1812.483,1813.153,--Drive prices down.
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1813.153,1813.944,--Right.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,1841.653,1855.782,"Absolutely, and that is exactly what Weyerhaeuser's plan was here, as shown by their own materials, that their plan was and in fact they did foresee and project that log prices would go down in 2001--"
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.782,1857.753,So where we are is at the problem.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,1869.42,1870.071,--But you're not--
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.071,1874.014,"Here we have bad effects, bad possibilities."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,1952.766,1970.307,"--Well, as to Brooke Group and what the Court's being asked to do here, Justice Breyer, is to go down the same path that it did in Albrecht versus Harold Company in '68 when it agreed to treat completely symmetrically minimum and maximum vertical resale price restraints."
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.085,1982.315,--I agree with you.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2002.709,2003.119,Well--
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.119,2010.412,"One test is if they are not going to make money legitimately out of this in the long run, it's bad, unless they can explain it away."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2013.384,2029.225,"--The problem with granting a safe harbor for above cost input purchases is that it does not work well in this context, especially in an inelastic market."
2006.05-381,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2036.86,2050.9,"What about the fact that the woodsmen in Justice Breyer's story are rational actors as well, and they don't have to be geniuses to realize that they are in a better shape having two buyers rather than just one."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2073.764,2084.731,"Well not, that's not quite correct, because the signals that the higher input prices show, yes, they do generally incent more production in a, in a typical market."
2006.05-381,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2188.509,2202.188,"Well if he is, if he is that rational and foresighted, why isn't he rational and foresighted enough to know that he ought to be selling some to the other, the other processor even if that processor is not bidding as much?"
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2202.188,2207.88,Well we did actually have some record evidence in this case that at least a few people were doing that.
2006.05-381,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2250.64,2258.353,"If we don't take the Brooke Group approach, is the alternative to ask the jury to do what the instructions in this case ask them to do."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2258.353,2258.644,"--No, it's not."
2006.05-381,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2258.644,2269.931,To decide whether Weyerhaeuser bought more logs than it needed in order to prevent its rivals from obtaining the logs that they needed at a fair price?
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2279.588,2286.674,"We don't contend that the instruction was perfect here, but if one looks at the instruction as a whole and--"
2006.05-381,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2286.674,2288.094,But you think it was sufficient.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2288.094,2288.704,--Pardon me?
2006.05-381,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2288.704,2290.457,You think it was sufficient enough.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2290.457,2309.609,"In this case it was legally sufficient and I point out that this Court very recently has issued a decision in the first case of the term, Ayers vs. Belmontes, where you looked at the question of the catch-all mitigation factor in California in the penalty phase of a capital murder case."
2006.05-381,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2318.264,2320.716,Who proposed the instruction in this case?
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2320.716,2336.866,"The instruction, the paragraph that is subject to the great criticism on the other side, was a paragraph that was drafted by the district judge and handed out near the end of the trial and then commented on by the lawyers in, prior to--"
2006.05-381,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2336.866,2340.827,There was no requested charge on this point by the plaintiff?
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2340.827,2354.508,"--That's... as to the issue of predatory pricing, plaintiffs, as we make clear in our brief, actually submitted a predatory pricing instruction three weeks before the trial."
2006.05-381,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2412.866,2413.797,What does that mean?
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2421.571,2435.97,"--Well, what it meant in this case, Justice Alito, is that it meant what, how much did Weyerhaeuser artificially increase the log market above where it otherwise would have been?"
2006.05-381,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2450.28,2452.402,Why is that the standard of fairness?
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2465.359,2480.17,"--The... if you look at the Ninth Circuit opinion, the Ninth Circuit made it clear that the instructions as a whole provided sufficient guidance."
2006.05-381,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2490.668,2496.221,"Maybe you didn't, but that basically left the jury on a, on a free float, didn't it?"
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2496.221,2498.001,"Well, I don't think so if you look at the evidence."
2006.05-381,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2546.764,2547.164,Okay.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2577.855,2581.327,And we don't contend that it was a perfect instruction.
2006.05-381,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2583.058,2583.889,"No, I realize that."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2583.889,2584.379,--Okay.
2006.05-381,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2584.379,2593.977,"And I'm saying if we follow your lead, we're going to try to take that and make it a closer to perfect instruction, and what should we say must be added to it?"
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2593.977,2595.617,It's quite simple.
2006.05-381,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2613.919,2614.349,Why?
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2634.513,2638.687,"--Justice Ginsburg, you will know because of the evidence in the case."
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2667.174,2668.025,Why did they say they needed it?
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2673.729,2674.43,--We did.
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.43,2675.432,Fine.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2731.9,2755.026,"Well, as to the paid a higher price than necessary, the language we would suggest could be used in another case and passed on by this Court, is the following: Paid a higher price than necessary to move the log market to higher levels than otherwise would have prevailed in order to injure competition."
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2755.026,2755.867,Oh.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2782.244,2783.195,But here--
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2783.195,2796.443,--is that they can find this person guilty even if all he wants to do is so second-guess that market that he gets the logs and will sell them at a huge profit later on in a competitive selling market.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2796.443,2804.387,"--We don't have a situation here, Justice Breyer, where Weyerhaeuser presented evidence that they were the most efficient and able to pay higher prices."
2006.05-381,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2812.033,2813.423,What if it were the highest cost producer?
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,2831.645,2838.29,"--Well, one of the reasons that one can't go in this direction here, Brooke Group was a pricing only case."
2006.05-381,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3007.921,3015.107,Do you... do you agree that you couldn't have made it on Brooke Group because they were selling these logs at a profit?
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,3015.107,3017.278,"--I didn't quite hear that, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-381,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3017.278,3028.675,"Do you agree that you could not have prevailed under the Brooke Group test because Weyerhaeuser was, was making a profit on these sales even though it had bid up the price of the logs?"
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,3028.675,3034.418,We do not agree as to the evidence in this case.
2006.05-381,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3073.715,3075.546,"It's ultimately a jury question, I assume."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,3075.546,3077.749,--If Brooke Group is applied--
2006.05-381,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3077.749,3079.288,"But that question was not put to the jury, right?"
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,3079.288,3080.57,--That's correct.
2006.05-381,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3084.944,3090.177,"So then, would you be entitled to a remand on that or not, given that you withdrew that instruction?"
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,3090.177,3097.982,"--If the Court concludes the Brooke Group applies to this case, then the instruction was incomplete, it was not correct, and we would be entitled to a remand and a chance to retry the case."
2006.05-381,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3097.982,3111.541,"But what about the recoupment prong, given that Weyerhaeuser doesn't have market power in the selling market and that mills were entering, new mills were coming on line during this period."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,3113.322,3116.294,"Well, the recoupment is not in the output end of things."
2006.05-381,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3302.867,3303.618,I'm losing you.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,3309.712,3321.64,"--Well, they have also asserted in their briefing that as an independent ground for reversal, the instruction was so standardless that the verdict cannot stand."
2006.05-381,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3321.64,3322.542,Regardless of Brooke Group.
2006.05-381,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3322.542,3346.397,"But isn't that something that we've got to consider because if, if we disagree with them on Brooke Group, we've got to do it in the course of making a choice between a Brooke Group instruction and something else, and the only something else we've got right now is what we have in this case and we ought to, we ought to decide whether in fact that is good enough."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,3346.397,3347.336,I agree with that.
2006.05-381,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3347.336,3353.6,"And so I mean, I think, they may not have made that an independent basis of reversal but we've got to consider it."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,3353.6,3358.124,"I agree with that, but I would like to point out these facts in terms of the way they contributed to it."
2006.05-381,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3379.486,3381.89,I'll stipulate to that.
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,3381.89,3382.488,--Right.
2006.05-381,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3382.488,3392.056,"Assuming they don't have a leg to stand on in complaint, we have still got to face what the alternative to a Brooke Group kind of instruction is."
2006.05-381,2,36062,michael_e_haglund,,3397.619,3398.761,That's correct.
2006.05-381,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3490.981,3492.13,"Thank you, Mr. Haglund."
2006.05-381,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3494.521,3496.174,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-381,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3646.104,3646.762,You can finish your sentence.
2006.05-381,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3646.762,3655.18,"Where there's not sufficient evidence in the record to go to the jury under the proper jury instruction, the proper outcome is for the claim to be dropped from the case."
2006.05-381,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3655.18,3656.832,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
