1996.96-272,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.248,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-272, Metropolitan Stevedore Company v. Rambo."
1996.96-272,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,9.838,12.208,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.96-272,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,52.476,58.891,"Well, do you take the position that it would be improper for the ALJ to ever make such an award?"
1996.96-272,0,38699,robert_e_babcock,,58.891,60.851,To ever make a nominal award?
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1454.591,1468.502,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1512.28,1517.383,Do you think that this is a reasonable award within the meaning of 908(h)?
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1523.717,1525.257,"Well, we think that--"
1996.96-272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.257,1526.99,One dollar is not as best you can.
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1530.583,1538.247,"--Well, we think that in determining an award that is reasonable the administrative law judge should take cognizance of the entirety of the statutory scheme."
1996.96-272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1590.329,1591.891,Where did this come from?
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1623.262,1626.303,--It's been around since approximately 1980 or so.
1996.96-272,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1638.101,1640.282,"Well, I thought that wasn't the board's position."
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1640.282,1648.89,"--For... during the 1980's, the benefits review board repeatedly issued opinions that disapproved of the practice of continuing nominal awards."
1996.96-272,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.873,1661.206,"Was that just in... because it felt bound by court of appeals decisions, or on its own?"
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1661.206,1694.939,"--I think that was on its own, and the reason I say that is, we cited at page 20, footnote 8 of our brief the relevant benefits review board's... board decisions, and one of those was a case called Morin, M-o-r-i-n, and that case arose out of Maine, and there was no First Circuit decision on point that addressed the question of continuing nominal awards, so I think the fact that the board in Morin evidently regarded the practice of continuing nominal awards as legitimate indicates that it wasn't simply acquiescing in binding circuit court decisions in the relevant circuits."
1996.96-272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.939,1698.752,"Well, they couldn't adopt one position in some cases and another position in other cases."
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1707.749,1731.374,"It was certainly influenced by other circuits, but during the 1980's, even when the board was expressing general opposition to continuing nominal awards, when a case would arise in a circuit in which there was binding circuit precedent saying continuing nominal awards are appropriate the board would say, despite our disagreement, we feel obligated to apply the standard announced by the relevant court of appeals and decide the case on that basis."
1996.96-272,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1731.374,1743.342,Did the court of appeals in the eighties when the benefits review board was taken... did they simply direct the award of nominal damages on their own when the benefits review board had said no?
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1743.342,1743.801,No.
1996.96-272,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.785,1748.875,"It came from the court of appeals, though."
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1750.324,1751.676,--It didn't come from the benefits review board.
1996.96-272,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1771.699,1776.522,"Mr. Stewart, could an employer ever cut this out by saying... take this case."
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1786.609,1787.791,--Yes.
1996.96-272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.769,1890.557,"Mr. Stewart, on the other question, even though you argue that there can be nominal damages you say in this case there's no basis for it and the ALJ simply found that this was a case in which nominal damages were not appropriate."
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1891.018,1891.288,Well--
1996.96-272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1891.288,1893.199,--That is apparently not the petitioner's position.
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1900.585,1901.306,"--No, we do think so."
1996.96-272,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1939.56,1965.758,"So when you say probable, when you talk about the probability judgment, the probability judgment is not a probability judgment that there will be work as a crane operator and he will continue to do it, or be unable to continue to do it, the probability judgment simply is that there is one kind of wage earning physical activity that he cannot do now, and so long as that probability is shown, the nominal damage award is appropriate."
1996.96-272,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1966.259,1967.901,"No, that's not our position, with respect."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2056.36,2062.783,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2100.999,2110.943,"Mr. Pierry, did the ALJ decline to make an award in this case, nominal or otherwise, because he felt he had no authority to make nominal awards?"
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2111.754,2112.906,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.906,2113.855,Yes.
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2120.26,2136.142,"The problem is, as we have pointed out, I think the Solicitor has also pointed out, there was a failure to consider, at least a failure to write down in the opinion various factors that have been outlined in section 908(h) as important to consider when determining loss of earning capacity of an injured worker."
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.205,2149.499,"Well, do you think the ALJ has to write down and deal with every single one of those sections under section 908 in making an award?"
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2149.499,2150.511,"--Well, yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2158.057,2163.39,And so your view is that the ALJ simply has to use kind of a checklist--
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2163.39,2164.081,Well--
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2164.081,2167.063,--of every one of these things that are mentioned in 908(h)?
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2167.063,2179.028,--I think he has to at least go through most of the factors and indicate that based upon all of the factors which have been considered relevant in the determination of loss of wage-earning capacity he does not find any loss of wage-earning capacity.
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.028,2180.5,"He could skip some of them, I take it."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2180.5,2182.691,"Well, I would think that he should cover all of them, because--"
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2182.691,2183.832,I thought you said most.
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2183.832,2189.877,"--I did say most, but I think that the Administrative Procedure Act really requires explicit determinations on all relevant factors."
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.877,2193.798,Why isn't this enough to show that he hasn't lost any earning capacity?
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2210.06,2210.982,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2223.239,2225.641,"And all ALJ orders normally do that, you think?"
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2225.641,2229.231,"Truthfully, Your Honor, I don't know if all of them do, but they should in this situation."
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.231,2229.452,I don't think any of them do it.
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2239.079,2252.7,"I disagree, Your Honor, just because under the section 908(h) that we're dealing with here, they specifically list certain factors; qualitative factors, I would admit, such as the nature of the injury, the degree of physical impairment, and whether or not the claimant is capable of doing his usual pre-injury--"
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2252.7,2263.035,What if the ALJ simply found... simply made a finding that I've reviewed all of the factors set forth in section 908(h) and find no loss of earning capacity?
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2263.035,2264.517,"--That would be a very difficult case, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2264.517,2265.949,Why would it be difficult?
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2265.949,2268.43,Because I believe that the Administrative Procedure Act requires--
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.43,2272.101,What provision of the Administrative Procedure Act would require that?
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2272.101,2274.983,"--Your Honor, I wish I had that before you at my fingertips but--"
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2274.983,2277.206,"Well, I thought if you were going to argue it you probably would have it before you."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2277.206,2277.754,--Yes.
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.082,2289.282,But you have no idea what the section is.
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2289.282,2291.676,"Your Honor, I have quoted it in my brief, and I forgot it."
1996.96-272,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2292.217,2306.624,"But what you're suggesting is it would be a routine thing, and more formal than substantial, if it's just that, I list these things, I've considered every one of them, and that's it."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2306.624,2317.381,"Well, I think as to certain factors that are very important factors, such as the factors that are set out in 908(h), those ones at least should be dealt with in a very substantial manner by the administrative law judge."
1996.96-272,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2317.381,2318.062,"Well, what do you mean?"
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2363.183,2365.784,"Well, Your Honor, the record is unclear in that regard."
1996.96-272,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2400.145,2412.073,"But did his lawyer in that modification proceeding initiated by the employer, did Rambo's lawyer ever say to the ALJ at least give us an award of nominal damages?"
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2413.984,2424.682,"--No, I don't think so, Your Honor, and I think as the Ninth Circuit stated Rambo's contesting of termination of his benefits also included his assertion that he's entitled to any lesser amount under--"
1996.96-272,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2424.682,2434.437,"If that's so... I haven't even thought about... what's bothering me in the statutory part of this case is that I guess Mr. Babcock says, read that statute."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2461.256,2462.007,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2462.007,2478.916,"And he says, how do we make that consistent with those words, wage-earning capacity, and at that point, I think maybe the SG's interpretation is within the envelope, but it should be the Secretary of Labor to whom we defer on such matters, that has thought this thing through."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2502.502,2510.087,"Your Honor, I guess what I'd point to is really the language of Congress in terms of the state of the art in section 908(h)."
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.038,2602.219,"Well, that's not any different from what happens in a normal civil trial, which I assume is the model."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2606.813,2608.593,"That's correct, Your Honor, yes."
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2608.593,2611.125,--under the Administrative Procedure Act that's required to be conducted on the record.
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2611.125,2611.686,That's correct.
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.686,2617.67,"Well, you know, a regular full dress civil trial is the model for that, and it happens all the time."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2620.442,2622.104,"The difference is section 922, though."
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2629.597,2632.589,"Well, there are some civil actions that allow modifications, too."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2647.449,2648.48,"That is true, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2658.275,2667.141,"Well, in a divorce for child support or alimony certainly one of the primary issues is the earning capacity of each spouse."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2667.141,2668.603,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2676.889,2681.162,But typical divorce statutes in States make exactly the same provision.
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2681.162,2682.972,"You may be correct about that, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2683.443,2685.293,What you propose is so sensible.
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2692.199,2694.099,"Yes, I think, Your Honor, you're right."
1996.96-272,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2728.841,2731.204,"Mr. Pierry, isn't it how can we drop out 922?"
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2740.591,2741.55,That's exactly right.
1996.96-272,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2778.446,2787.582,Do you defend the Ninth Circuit standard of a possibility instead of a probability?
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2787.582,2788.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2790.484,2794.075,"That certainly is not what most courts have followed, is it?"
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2794.075,2804.02,"In this particular case I do defend it, and if I may explain, I think the question of who has the burden of proof and what that burden of proof is depends on at what stage of the proceedings the question is raised."
1996.96-272,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2825.616,2828.979,"Yes, so what's the employer's burden of proof on a modification request?"
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2828.979,2833.421,"--I believe that it's the same preponderance of the evidence standard, that the employer has to prove--"
1996.96-272,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2837.624,2838.273,"Well, that's what I asked you."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2844.096,2844.397,Yes.
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2857.607,2859.968,"But the Ninth Circuit didn't put it that way, did it?"
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2859.968,2860.779,"That's true, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2860.779,2870.985,"I mean, you agree that the burden in this case is on the employer, and what the employer has to show is that it's less likely than not that there will be a future impairment."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2870.985,2871.876,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1996.96-272,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2871.876,2890.799,"Maybe I'm repeating a point Justice Scalia has made before, but the burden of the... in the particular proceeding seeking modification that was had in this case was one in which the employer assumed the burden of proving that there should be a complete termination of benefits, and the ALJ found that that burden of proof had been sustained."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2893.951,2918.586,"Your Honor, I believe that what the ALJ... the Ninth Circuit said about the ALJ's decision was that the ALJ's decision did not take into account certain specified factors, and therefore that his decision was not supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, and I believe that the Ninth Circuit, when faced with the evidence that was presented, which really was only the increase in earnings, they decided that--"
1996.96-272,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2918.586,2924.86,"Well, it was increase in earnings, and also there was testimony that the man might theoretically lose his job later, and so forth and so on."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2924.86,2925.09,--That's correct.
1996.96-272,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2938.791,2950.987,"You see, part of the problem is that your client at that stage of the proceedings did not argue in the alternative, a) don't make any reduction, and b) if you do make a reduction, don't terminate but allow me to keep the nominal award."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2951.929,2955.612,"--Your right, Your Honor, and that was because he was relying on years of precedent regarding--"
1996.96-272,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.612,2959.733,"Right, and I was very sympathetic to his position, but he lost."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2959.733,2960.224,--That's correct.
1996.96-272,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2960.224,2970.919,"I take it your answer to that is, send it back so that findings can be made on some of these various factors that the court... that the ALJ did not specifically address."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2973.103,2973.443,"No, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2991.783,2992.674,Start all over again.
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,2992.674,2992.885,--Right.
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.885,3004.341,"Well now, is it a substantial evidence... I thought earlier your objection to the ALJ's decree was not a substantial evidence one, but that he hadn't made the necessary findings."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,3004.341,3006.124,"Your Honor, yes."
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.086,3030.339,"So... the provision of the Administrative Procedure Act you referred to, by the way, simply requires that the record include a statement of finding and conclusions and the reasons or basis therefore on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,3033.421,3034.462,"Well, that's the problem, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.61,3067.064,"--This is a substantial evidence objection you're making, not a findings objection, it seems to me."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,3067.064,3067.635,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3107.609,3114.405,But the same language could be honored by simply assigning present value and saying that's good for all time.
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,3129.174,3129.494,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3138.3,3143.406,Is part of the problem that the 1-year time limit works as a one-way street?
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,3151.83,3153.16,"That's true, Your Honor."
1996.96-272,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3183.07,3188.275,"--Well, maybe they could simply be treated as nominal requests and knocked down."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,3191.367,3197.111,"That's true, but it would definitely impede judicial efficiency and economy because of all these requests that would be coming in from claimants that had been denied."
1996.96-272,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3221.445,3222.336,Mr. Pierry--
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,3222.336,3222.717,There's no question--
1996.96-272,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3222.717,3245.24,"--Mr. Pierry, is it... isn't it so that anybody who has a physical disability, as Rambo certainly did, anybody who has that, can always get one of these nominal damages award, because there would always be a risk that at some time in the future their disability, physical disability would make it impossible even to do, say, the crane work?"
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,3245.24,3247.621,"--I would like that to be the case, but I don't think that is the case under the law."
1996.96-272,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3247.621,3250.533,"Well, I'd like to see what is the stopping point on your theory."
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,3260.521,3261.933,I don't think there always is.
1996.96-272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3279.685,3283.986,You're relying on the fact that this is a proceeding to alter the original award.
1996.96-272,2,43184,thomas_j_pierry,,3296.495,3297.236,"--Yes, Your Honors."
