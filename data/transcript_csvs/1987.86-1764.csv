1987.86-1764,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.27,"We'll hear argument next in number 86-1764, Bethesda Hospital Association versus Otis Bowen, Secretary of Health and Human Services."
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,55.118,58.801,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1764,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,294.32,304.888,I would assume though that the intermediary could reallocate the claimed costs under some other category that was permissible.
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,313.064,315.415,"No, that's not correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1764,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,324.031,330.426,"But aren't there cases where it's difficult to characterize costs, or there's some question as to their proper characterization?"
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,330.426,334.569,"Oh, there are cases in those instances but that's not what we're talking about today."
1987.86-1764,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,334.569,349.871,"Well, insofar as the rule is concerned, might not there be instances where how to characterize a cost is open to question and so it serves a purpose to submit the issue to the fiscal intermediary for its determination as to allocation?"
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,349.871,366.253,"The fiscal intermediary is required and they spend about 300 hours on a medium to large hospital doing the audit of the cost report, and they are required to look at each and every cost and determine how it is to be allocated under the regulations."
1987.86-1764,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,536.952,539.584,Were you aware that that was an option?
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,539.584,557.449,"It's not clear at the time these cost reports were filed whether these particular hospitals, I believe they may have been aware of that option, but they may not have determined that they wanted to continue with this litigation at that point."
1987.86-1764,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,583.138,586.919,"Yes, but you know you're not going to get more than you ask for."
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,586.919,587.44,That's correct.
1987.86-1764,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,602.611,606.634,"We'll resume at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Homer."
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,606.634,608.193,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1764,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,608.193,627.435,"Mr. Homer, you may continue."
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,627.435,628.997,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1764,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,788.549,794.073,"I suppose if the Statute were clear, it really wouldn't make any difference whether it served any purpose or not."
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,801.209,803.95,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1764,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.482,846.358,"If you win, I suppose you... you say the regulation is invalid?"
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,846.358,848.111,The regulation has been declared invalid.
1987.86-1764,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.111,854.075,"Well, if the regulation is invalid, what will you do with your next cost report?"
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,854.075,863.551,The next cost report would be filed under the prevailing regulation at the time and that's invalid.
1987.86-1764,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,863.551,865.872,And you would include this item?
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,865.872,870.366,We would follow the regulation that's in existence telling how we include it.
1987.86-1764,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.976,903.75,"So the government position is that if you claim the regulation is invalid, which you did, you should file your cost report as though it weren't in effect."
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,903.75,908.054,"That's correct, Justice White."
1987.86-1764,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.054,908.224,What's wrong with that?
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,914.85,920.462,"Well, it gets down to a matter of being a trap for the unwary."
1987.86-1764,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,923.843,927.886,Is to live up to a regulation even though you claim it's invalid.
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,927.886,930.208,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1764,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,944.679,953.996,Even though you're about to claim that it's invalid?
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,953.996,956.688,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1764,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.138,972.549,"Well, you know what to do now that it's been declared invalid."
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,972.549,974.101,"--As a matter of fact,--"
1987.86-1764,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,974.101,976.153,I said you did.
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,976.153,977.995,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1987.86-1764,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1041.651,1048.502,"Mr. Homer, is there any analogy that would favor your side in the income tax field?"
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,1060.542,1064.616,The Secretary's position is that the latter course will not work.
1987.86-1764,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1067.116,1069.888,I know what the Secretary's position is here.
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,1073.14,1080.166,"--There is no analogy in the income tax field in this instance, because the Secretary's position is that--"
1987.86-1764,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1080.166,1082.798,I'm trying to give you one and you don't grasp the bait.
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,1082.798,1086.29,"--Yes, I think there is an analogy."
1987.86-1764,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1086.29,1087.161,"I think so, too."
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,1087.161,1113.979,"What I should say with regard to the Secretary's position on his concession as to the sufficiency of a cover letter being a basis for PRRB jurisdiction is that when he conceded that, he conceded away his entire case."
1987.86-1764,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.954,1126.276,I wondered why he conceded that.
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,1160.7,1162.14,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1764,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.14,1163.061,And takes no action at all.
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,1163.061,1163.532,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1764,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.134,1166.233,That's a big loss.
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,1166.233,1170.998,He concedes this cover note point in footnote 8 on page 11.
1987.86-1764,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1170.998,1176.504,In order to give you a way of avoiding 1(B) and (C).
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,1176.504,1183.417,That would appear to be the basis because that would avoid 1(B) and (C).
1987.86-1764,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1201.16,1201.31,Right.
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,1201.828,1207.404,And that is why he has conceded the whole thing away with this concession.
1987.86-1764,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1325.684,1329.698,"Give him credit, at least."
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,1335.481,1340.026,He attempts to urge ambiguity through the argumentation.
1987.86-1764,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1349.232,1352.845,"He is arguing it is clear in his direction, which is even better than ambiguous, right?"
1987.86-1764,0,34609,leonard_c_homer,,1356.596,1361.129,"Well, you're correct that he is arguing it's clear in his direction."
1987.86-1764,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.785,1474.245,"Thank you, Mr. Homer."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1476.618,1493.558,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1764,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1531.993,1536.337,"Mr. Pincus, most administrative remedies can give you relief."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1553.589,1567.259,"Well, Your Honor, we think that there are two questions presented in this case, and we rely by analogy the way the Court has interpreted other exhaustion requirements under other parts of the Social Security laws in cases like Southland and Ringer."
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1610.617,1615.961,"But Mr. Pincus, what is your answer to Justice Scalia's point that there was no administrative remedy?"
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1620.094,1621.186,"Well, on the--"
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1621.186,1623.657,"That's a yes or no, I think."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1623.657,1624.436,--Yes.
1987.86-1764,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1688.452,1699.339,"Mr. Pincus, why can we treat these regulation cases differently from the other ones that you say are lurking there in the wings to pounce upon us if we come out this way on regulation?"
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1734.678,1739.261,"Well, Your Honor, we don't think that language has anything to do with a substantive claim."
1987.86-1764,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.26,1819.61,Where will we find that?
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1819.61,1824.143,--That is on page 3... the relevant language is on page 3(a) of our brief.
1987.86-1764,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.477,1861.78,"When you said, this language, Mr. Pincus, it's just a solid page."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1863.63,1874.598,"--Well, let me... the language on which we rely is excerpted maybe a little more clearly on the top of page 15 of our brief."
1987.86-1764,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.202,1935.881,"Is your interest in this case just to make sure you follow the letter of the law, or do you, does the Secretary really have some substantial reason for wanting this to happen?"
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1935.881,1939.914,"Well, Your Honor, the Secretary has very substantial reasons for wanting this to happen."
1987.86-1764,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.735,1959.307,What is efficient about filing a useless claim?
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1959.307,1963.659,"--Well, Your Honor, as I said, there are two categories of claims."
1987.86-1764,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.123,1984.445,What about the claim that's involved in this case?
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1984.445,2006.831,"The type of claim that's involved in this case we think there are also the important reasons that the Court has recognized in Ringer, which are while the provider might think that the only way it can get relief is if the regulation is overturned, it might be that the provider is wrong about what the regulation means, and that if the claim had been raised before the intermediary, the intermediary would have interpreted the regulation to award relief."
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2008.21,2016.397,"Yes, but isn't it true that in Ringer there was an express requirement the Statute spelled out what had to be exhausted before you could get judicial review."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2020.02,2033.818,"--Well, Your Honor, we think that in the dissatisfaction language of subsection (A)(1) and in the language that I've just referred to in the expedited judicial review provision, Congress has made clear that there is a similar exhaustion requirement here."
1987.86-1764,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.818,2037.271,Or at least you think it's clear enough to justify your regulation?
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2037.271,2047.339,"We think it's clear, but if the Court thinks it's ambiguous, we think that the Secretary's interpretation is certainly reasonable and that the Court should adopt it."
1987.86-1764,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2047.339,2052.451,Has the Secretary been consistent in the past?
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2052.451,2054.773,"Yes, Your Honor, in our view, the Secretary has consistently--"
1987.86-1764,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2054.773,2057.016,The Amicus says he hasn't been.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2057.016,2068.083,"--Yes, and we explain in our brief in some detail the argument on pages 35 and 36 of our brief, we respond to the argument that there has been some inconsistency."
1987.86-1764,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.521,2088.007,"Well, does it do the Secretary any good to make them file this claim?"
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2095.391,2100.656,"We think that the claim might go away, either because he's entitled to relief on some other basis or for some other--"
1987.86-1764,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.656,2105.509,I thought it was also because... would the intermediary ever look at the claim if it were filed?
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2105.509,2107.189,--Yes.
1987.86-1764,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.523,2123.16,"And I suppose, would the intermediary say, well, this looks like a straightforward claim that is barred by the regulation except we think it's too big, I mean, it's just erroneous."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2129.224,2135.108,"Well, Your Honor, the intermediary certainly could say that even under the theory advanced by the provider that the claim is wrong."
1987.86-1764,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2135.108,2158.305,"Well, Mr. Pincus, do you think if all that was done here was to attach a cover letter, that the cost report filing was just as it was, but a little cover letter were attached, that the intermediary would then go into the merits of that and try to figure out some way to adjust the amounts allowable to take account of it?"
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2158.305,2159.164,Yes.
1987.86-1764,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2159.164,2164.72,I mean it sounds like the cover letter the intermediary isn't concerned with looking at it at all.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2164.72,2174.698,"Well, the Secretary believes that part of the intermediary's obligations are to look at things in cover letters and to do the kind of evaluation to which I've just referred."
1987.86-1764,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2176.748,2177.319,Was there--
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2177.319,2181.954,--We think the cover letter option is really for the convenience of the provider more than anything else.
1987.86-1764,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2182.935,2196.713,--Was there ever an express regulation explaining that providers could file such a cover letter and it would suffice?
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2196.713,2206.489,--This rule has evolved through cost reimbursement decisions of the Board which are reviewed by the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration.
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.51,2275.039,"What about the first claim filed before all this development took place, I mean, just relying on the statute as it was written and the regulations which say fill out the form in accordance with regulations."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2280.672,2284.682,"--Well, Your Honor, those... it might be--"
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2284.682,2284.893,"--Somebody's got to go first, you know."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2284.893,2285.814,--it might be a different case.
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.338,2294.331,"You rely on the word, dissatisfied, that they really were not dissatisfied because they didn't tell you in advance?"
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2294.331,2296.182,"--We rely on the word, dissatisfied."
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.464,2304.169,The (F)(1) which gives him an additional remedy but doesn't say anything about what happens at the administrative review.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2304.169,2305.22,"Well, Your Honor, we think that, that--"
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.22,2308.79,"But apart from (F)(1), all you've got is the word, dissatisfied, isn't it?"
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2308.79,2316.147,"--We also have the fact that this was called the Provider Reimbursement Review Board and it was designed to review something, not to make decisions."
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.147,2320.278,Designed to review a lot of audits and facts and figures but not the validity of the regulations.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2320.278,2328.074,"Well, Your Honor, it does not review the regulations but what it does review is review intermediary determinations."
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.484,2336.02,"Determinations that intermediaries have authority to make, not review determinations they don't have authority to make."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2339.934,2345.688,"--Well, Your Honor, again, I think it's a mistake to concentrate on the particular narrow question involved here."
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2347.768,2348.439,I don't agree with you at all.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2354.523,2368.834,"--Well, Your Honor, we think that the principles that the Court has applied in the other social security contexts indicate that even where the Court has held that even where the particular decisionmaker does not have the authority to decide the claim, exhaustion may be appropriate."
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2368.834,2370.934,If the Statute says you must exhaust.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2372.495,2375.487,"But those statutes, Your Honor, those statutes, the statute there referred to a final decision."
1987.86-1764,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2430.62,2437.673,"Mr. Pincus, if you prevail here, will you do so on a regulation that has been declared illegal?"
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2437.673,2443.476,"--Well, nothing about the exhaustion requirement has been declared illegal, Your Honor."
1987.86-1764,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2459.458,2469.686,"So far as the case being so open and shut, certainly the panel below didn't think it was, did it?"
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2469.686,2473.966,"Well, Your Honor, the panel indicated that perhaps it might come out--"
1987.86-1764,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2473.966,2475.007,The other way.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2475.007,2475.977,--the other way.
1987.86-1764,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2475.977,2478.391,"The other way, if it hadn't been bound by a prior Sixth Circuit case."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2478.391,2495.842,"But the prior panel came out our way and a number of other courts of appeals have come out our way, and we think that this is a very appropriate case if this Court or other courts have felt that the statutory language is ambiguous, this is a textbook case for deference to the agency."
1987.86-1764,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2519.887,2524.061,There's nothing unclear about being dissatisfied.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2531.285,2544.565,"Well, Your Honor, the language is dissatisfied with a final determination of the... and I'll skip a few words... fiscal intermediary... and I'll skip a few more words... as to the amount of total program reimbursement due the provider."
1987.86-1764,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.001,2578.948,I would look on it as you're dissatisfied with the fact that the provider gave you all the provider could possibly have given you.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2591.387,2597.08,That's looking at the statutory language.
1987.86-1764,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2626.864,2636.03,"Mr. Pincus, what about this to solve that problem you're worried about where somebody doesn't ask for relief which the provider could have given, and he's still dissatisfied."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2673.508,2682.134,"Well, Your Honor, we make that argument in our brief as an alternative argument and we certainly think--"
1987.86-1764,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2682.134,2683.035,For a different purpose.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2683.035,2686.587,--that's a possibility if the Court disagrees with our principal submission.
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2721.352,2738.064,"Am I correct that you would substitute for the word, dissatisfied, you say what the Statute really means is every time the provider receives less than the amount claimed in the cost report filed in accordance with the regulations."
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2746.84,2752.122,We think the supplemental level is the functional equivalent of claiming the amount in the cost report.
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2776.941,2787.199,--When did the Secretary first make it known publicly that a side cover letter of that kind must be made in order to preserve the rights such as at stake in this case?
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2787.199,2796.296,--The first reported case that we were able to find we discuss in a footnote on page 34 our brief.
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2821.964,2824.605,But the rule was just developed on a case by case basis.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2827.139,2834.353,It was developed on... it is now spelled out in a provision in the manual that the Secretary issues to guide providers in filling out cost reports.
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2834.353,2835.384,And when was that issued?
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2835.384,2837.477,"That was issued in July, 1981."
1987.86-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2837.477,2838.348,1981.
1987.86-1764,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2838.348,2841.458,The current version which makes everything clear.
1987.86-1764,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3101.504,3103.043,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
1987.86-1764,2,34609,leonard_c_homer,,3105.304,3116.25,Let me first focus on the issue of dissatisfaction.
1987.86-1764,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3200.86,3207.234,"Are you saying there's no decisional process going on within the Board before they short change you, as you put it?"
1987.86-1764,2,34609,leonard_c_homer,,3207.234,3209.245,"--At the Board, that's right, Your Honor."
1987.86-1764,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3237.344,3241.715,"Well, how about a decisional process of the intermediary?"
1987.86-1764,2,34609,leonard_c_homer,,3241.715,3260.698,"At the audit level, there is a process by which the intermediary takes the costs that have been entered in the cost report and reviews them to assure that the costs were indeed incurred, and that they have been treated by the provider in accordance with the regulations."
1987.86-1764,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3260.698,3263.912,"But there's some judgment exercised there, surely."
1987.86-1764,2,34609,leonard_c_homer,,3264.502,3265.514,"That's right, Your Honor."
1987.86-1764,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3267.217,3274.599,"--Well, but how different is an accounting type judgment than the sort of judgments many other legal review boards make?"
1987.86-1764,2,34609,leonard_c_homer,,3274.599,3280.544,It's no different than any other government contract on a cost basis.
1987.86-1764,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3351.615,3352.015,I do.
1987.86-1764,2,34609,leonard_c_homer,,3382.496,3383.838,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1764,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3421.854,3426.026,"Thank you, Mr. Homer."
