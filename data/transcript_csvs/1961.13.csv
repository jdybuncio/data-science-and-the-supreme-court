1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,14.423,18.836,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please?"
1961.13,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,53.223,54.971,In the interest of the two?
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,54.971,56.0,Apparently it isn't.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,67.491,70.038,Was that simple too?
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,70.038,78.831,Lincoln Mills [Attempt to Laughter] -- this Court apparently considered a more difficult problem than the Law Review experts have since.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,79.204,82.508,"That's the normal course of affairs, that's the normal course of affairs."
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,82.508,83.684,"Yes, I --"
1961.13,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,83.684,88.472,Why don't you say some members of this Court have considered it more difficult?
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,88.472,91.363,They probably still in most cases.
1961.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,345.573,348.681,You say that clause is not found in the record?
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,348.681,352.023,The -- only a part of the clause was printed in the record.
1961.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,375.298,378.293,Was there any objection to -- how they would provide it?
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,378.293,379.506,There is no objection at all.
1961.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,386.016,387.416,"You do that, please."
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,387.416,388.011,Thank you.
1961.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,388.011,392.282,"Did you say Mr. Previant, these are the same contracts we had in [Inaudible]?"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,392.282,393.175,Yes.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,751.477,764.892,"Is the common ground -- is that con -- common ground between you and the respondent would agree all around that 301, its purpose would've been barred by the Norris-LaGuardia Act?"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,764.892,765.709,I'm -- I didn't hear the last sentence --
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,765.709,771.312,"Is it agreed all around that but for 301, Norris-LaGuardia would've barred this?"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,771.312,772.57,I can't speak for counsel.
1961.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,779.692,782.292,"Both of them, Mr. Previant, I thought you said that --"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,782.292,784.36,"Well, the court below find -- I think probably so."
1961.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,784.36,787.147,"The court -- the Court of Appeals acted, I gather on --"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,787.147,789.016,I would amend that answer.
1961.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,792.482,793.981,That there was no labor (Voice Overlap) --
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,793.981,794.639,That's correct.
1961.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,794.639,798.358,Whereas the Court of Appeals assumed there was a labor (Voice Overlap) --
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,798.358,802.807,"Well, it appeared that literally it would be and nevertheless the policy expressed in 301 to make a difference."
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,802.807,810.254,"But I was just wondering on what assumptions we must go, there was a labor dispute?"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,810.254,812.609,We believe that that is an incontrovertible assumption --
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,812.609,813.544,Alright.
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,813.544,818.104,-- under the definitions of the Act and then the cases under the Act.
1961.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,851.998,856.287,What's the third -- what's the third of the Circuits that's gone against you?
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,856.287,861.387,"The only Circuit that has is Fifth Circuit, the First, the Second and the Seventh."
1961.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,861.387,861.994,Seventh.
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,862.867,863.771,Have --
1961.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,863.771,864.806,The Bull case in the --
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,864.806,869.867,"The Bull case is in the Second, Mead case in the First and Sinclair Refining in the Seventh."
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,869.867,900.156,"Now, refresh my recollection to (a) go on the grounds first to [Inaudible] and you tell me your position, on the ground that 301 left untouched Norris-LaGuardia or that the policy determination of the courts to call upon to make because of Lincoln Mills continued as a policy attributable to 301 to what Norris-LaGuardia explicitly prohibited, which is it?"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,900.156,907.41,I think it could be best summarized that they believe that 301 does not touch Section 4 rights.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,925.983,930.549,"And an injunction in labor cases is procedural law, is that it?"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,936.894,938.24,We don't believe so.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,950.919,951.169,[Inaudible]
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,951.169,953.017,-- legislation of substance rather than a procedure.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,953.017,997.836,"Do I make my question clear to you Mr. Previant because I believe it's important whether the court that withheld [Inaudible] and you did not -- we don't have to go underground that they go, whether the courts and or you suppose that whatever scope is left for judicial construction or evolution out of 301, it can't touch Norris-LaGuardia or that construing 301 as a mandate of the courts to make appropriate national labor policies, it would -- it would derive from 301 or from its own notions of wisdom, legal wisdom that Norris-LaGuardia is a good national policy."
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,997.836,1001.103,I think that they accept the latter that Norris-LaGuardia --
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1001.103,1013.218,"In other words, that not allowing an injunction, denying the federal courts the right to issue an injunction, is still an application of 301, you don't have to bother Norris-LaGuardia, is that it?"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1015.376,1013.218,No.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1052.875,1057.919,It's because of 301 that you don't have to construe Norris-LaGuardia that way?
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1057.919,1058.409,No.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1089.8,1123.847,"Because -- I don't mean to be dialectic about this, but just to me there is a great deal of difference, whether my problem is that 301 doesn't touch Norris-LaGuardia despite the large at leave that Lincoln Mills gives me in construing its scope, that 301 doesn't touch it because Congress has been specific for -- that applying 301 and forgetting all about the Norris-LaGuardia except if there's a light on policy out of 301, disallows such injunctive power."
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1123.847,1137.781,"I believe it would be fair to say that except for the area which is indicated by 301, they believe that the congressional intention was clear that 301 would not touch Norris-LaGuardia."
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1147.776,1164.217,"I don't think you mean not to answer my question specifically, but still I don't understand whether I am to make an independent judgment on the power that is left to the judiciary under Lincoln Mills in construing 301."
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1179.478,1193.684,"Well, insofar as the opinion might reflect the process to which these courts have gone through, they have first, I believe, laid Norris-LaGuardia down next to the facts and they have said that this is clearly a Norris-LaGuardia case."
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1232.693,1238.371,No -- not prior to 301 but Norris-LaGuardia would cover it?
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1238.371,1240.564,"Prior to 301, Norris-LaGuardia did cover it."
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1240.564,1240.772,It --
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1240.772,1241.118,Yes.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1242.345,1254.051,"And the whole question is what part does 301 play if any in our construction and not a question of writing under the Railroad Labor Act either, is that right?"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1256.757,1260.11,"Well, in these cases, the Railway Labor Act would have no bearing."
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1260.11,1269.929,"Alright, so that we don't have to deal with that problem of what to do with two statutes which deal with that specific problem, at least two statutes in the same field."
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1269.929,1271.61,"Well, we just have the Norris-LaGuardia and 301, we don't have no --"
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1271.61,1273.786,That's – I will get more enlightened as you go along.
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1273.786,1275.561,Alright.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1706.379,1733.398,"As I remember, you would correct me Mr. Previant, but in the course of legislative history that you know, at least relating to the subject matter you've just traversed, those are separate provisions, but there was -- was there any -- were there any amendments proposed with reference to 301 itself dealing with this problem which said that this should include the right to [Inaudible] --"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1733.398,1742.044,"Well, 301 was initially put into the statute at this time, in the Taft-Hartley amendments."
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1742.044,1747.572,Yes but there wasn't anything with reference with 301 that tied it up with the question of an injunction.
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1762.826,1766.719,"Well, I think that 301 grew out of this."
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1778.394,1778.513,Yes.
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1778.513,1782.751,-- and that there had not been enough limitation placed upon the activities of labor unions.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1802.801,1810.164,And out of it came this -- whatever you call that -- this thing that had to be construed by this Court --
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1810.164,1810.624,Well --
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1810.624,1827.941,"-- that after 301 has evolved out of that legislative process, was there any history bearing on whether 301 was construable so as to allow it to be a -- concluding out of which the silkworm of remedies including this one could be woven?"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1827.941,1831.765,It seems to me that that was the test which this Court set itself to in the Lincoln Mills case.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1831.765,1858.359,"But was that -- yes, I know it did and that's why we're here now but was there any legislative light bearing on the scope left to the courts in dealing with 301 so as to say, “Well, we enforce contractors, this may -- you may go into a federal court now to enforce a contract with a federal right and therefore you may have all the implements, all the armamentarium of remedies for enforcing a right?"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1858.359,1862.738,I don't believe that there is anything in the legislative history which would so indicate.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1862.738,1864.394,Alright.
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1864.394,1874.622,"Certainly, I believe that this Court, both the majority and the dissenting opinions canvass that history very thoroughly in the Lincoln Mills case."
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1910.424,1912.863,"In terms, they weren't doing anything (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1912.863,1913.371,"Well, (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1913.371,1914.808,[Inaudible]
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1914.808,1915.599,They went further.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1957.393,1971.164,"And do I infer from what you've just said that if this controversy reached a magnitude towards the -- permits this fragment of the United States to certify it as a national emergency, that then the Attorney General could move in?"
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1971.164,1972.44,I think there would be no question --
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1972.44,1972.745,I thought that that is --
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1972.745,1973.217,-- under the national emergency provision.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1973.217,1974.219,-- a specific statute.
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,1974.219,1975.411,Yes.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2000.764,2003.959,But you couldn't have this procedure any how?
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,2003.959,2007.405,That's right.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2050.804,2055.993,But Norris-LaGuardia itself had some of the restrictive features of some liberating people.
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,2055.993,2056.675,Yes.
1961.13,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2058.775,2063.05,Is there under no circumstances ever can you have an injunction to labor disputes?
1961.13,0,21378,david_previant,,2063.05,2063.245,No.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,2886.121,2889.527,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please?"
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2960.115,2968.394,Was there an agreement to arbitrate in terms of a promise or was it just optional?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,2968.394,2971.802,"Well, there is an elaborate grievance procedure."
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2973.338,2974.574,I don't -- I don't find it in the record.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,2977.625,2983.645,"Well, the part -- a portion of it if Your Honor please is in the record beginning at page 9."
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2983.645,2985.251,"Yes, I -- but I didn't --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,2985.251,2994.161,"But the entire contract, I will tell you how it has occurred in all likelihood although I had nothing really to do with the record in this Court being the respondent here."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3209.227,3223.548,"But Mr. Miller, if I may say so, you're leaving out the real purpose and drive and force behind what we say when we say Norris-LaGuardia Act."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3233.732,3236.263,"Well, if Your Honor please, certainly it's true."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3236.263,3269.043,"And that is just as valid in 19 -- that was just as valid in 1947 as it was in 1932 and what you're saying is that when we have a statute which says enforce, we must shut our eyes to everything else except to say, here is a contract between two people and enforce -- usually carries with it not only damages, damage remedy but injunctive remedy and that we must shut our eyes completely to a consideration which was wholly unrelated to that namely the place of the federal courts in our scheme of things."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3269.043,3274.545,"Well now, if Your Honor please, I'd like to address myself exactly what you say because I don't think this is true."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3290.426,3294.201,"Enforce means mandatory injunction, specific performance --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3294.201,3294.321,Certainly.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3294.321,3295.633,-- is that enforce mean?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3295.633,3296.028,"Well, enforce means that (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3296.028,3296.878,When you (Voice Overlap) --
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3296.878,3299.32,-- that it means -- that it means equitable power.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3299.32,3300.389,"Well, does it?"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3300.389,3302.601,"Well, that's the only way really to enforce the contract."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3304.987,3311.509,"Well, then lots of -- lots of contracts that are not enforced as a matter of balancing conveniences --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3311.509,3312.065,But that's why -- what it --
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3312.065,3316.83,-- and you can go in to the court of equity will refer you to money damages.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3316.83,3316.955,Yes.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3316.955,3334.352,"What I'm saying is you -- for me at least, you have to address yourself to the exclusion from your consideration of the, for me, the vital facts about the Norris-LaGuardia Act namely the restriction upon the doing of things by the federal court which brought them into dispute."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3334.352,3338.07,"Yes, now, I will like to get just to this Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3345.529,3348.326,"I don't mean generally in this dispute, in the exercise of this jurisdiction or --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3348.326,3349.027,That is right.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3349.027,3353.031,-- butting into labor controversy which really belongs to the state courts.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3353.031,3365.486,"And the Congress -- the Congress felt so insensitive by it that they did and I think it was for the first time, at least it's for the first time according to some of the commentaries, I haven't checked if these -- if this is true."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3409.483,3410.033,I don't agree with that.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3410.033,3410.58,-- with [Inaudible]
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3410.58,3411.784,I don't agree to that.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3411.784,3413.838,"That's what the public policy statement is, if Your Honors please."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3413.838,3444.151,"Yes, I know it says that with the driving forces, you will read the most powerful speech in the Senate, for that matter in either house in support of that Act, it is from Senator David Reed from Pennsylvania, one of the most conservative men then in politics who spoke that of -- practitioner of extensive practice on behalf of heavy industry in which he said forth his experience why it was undesirable to have things -- this kind of litigation in the federal courts."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3444.151,3450.91,"Well, I understand Your Honor that you -- your point is that the federal courts were not to enter this area."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3501.952,3520.05,Show me a single statement in the debate on the Taft-Hartley Act in which there's any indication of a change of view by Congress that the federal court should not as a matter of equity go and make injunctive relief except where Congress specifically made that change.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3520.05,3525.54,"But if Your Honor please, Mr. Hartley himself in answering a question on the floor and it's in the (Inaudible)."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3533.912,3536.661,"So, that some of it -- there were some specific changes that they particularized --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3536.661,3537.95,"Well, now -- I would like to (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3537.95,3542.166,-- and Judge -- and Judge Clark -- as Judge Clark sets forth in the Bull case.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3542.166,3544.89,I would very gladly go to that one right now.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3610.813,3611.774,"But Mr. Miller, you can't --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3611.774,3612.284,Now --
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3612.284,3619.228,"When you talk at large, the -- what the House proposed they threw out and what the Senate did was restricted."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3619.228,3626.01,"But now if Your Honor please, the Conference had to put the two together."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3632.936,3636.086,"A little thing like that, a little thing like that."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3636.086,3647.203,"But, if Your Honor please, isn't it more important that the House as it both already made up their mind what they did, it isn't the Conference Committee that passed this Act, it's the Congress that passed this Act."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3664.995,3668.097,"Did they say that, “We leave it to the usual process of the law?”"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3668.097,3670.857,That's what the Conference Committee report says.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3670.857,3672.22,The usual processes of the law?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3672.22,3672.85,Yes.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3672.85,3673.503,Those words?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3673.503,3674.037,"That is correct, if Your Honor please --"
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3674.037,3677.532,The discussing of -- without any record to the Norris-LaGuardia (Voice Overlap) --
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3677.532,3681.453,"Without any reference to the Norris-LaGuardia Act, they just said we will leave it to usual processes of the law."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3681.453,3686.588,"Without any reference -- you say that by that statement, they impliedly repealed the Norris-LaGuardia Act?"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3686.588,3693.429,I don't say by that statement they impliedly repealed the Norris-LaGuardia Act but they don't think the Norris-LaGuardia ever applied in the situation in the first place.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3693.429,3695.925,"But that's a different story, isn't it?"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3697.578,3701.041,"I think if that's true, it's the easy the way to go in it and I think it is true."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3701.041,3701.819,Alright.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3702.022,3719.437,"I think it is true, if Your Honor please, because there is nothing in what we are here asking this Court to answer that stops any union, any employee from banding together and making a collective agreement."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3766.746,3787.955,"Really Mr. Miller, they were concerned in Norris-LaGuardia no matter how [Inaudible] the agreement is, you cannot get in an injunction in a labor controversy in the federal court subject to qualification but must go to the state court because you don't want to embroil the federal courts in this kind of business."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3787.955,3792.777,But the Congress put the federal courts in business.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3792.777,3796.763,"Yes, but whether it did it by way of injunction is the issue here."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3796.763,3806.595,"Yes, I understand if Your Honor please, it may be and I maintain in this part of my argument in our brief that Norris-LaGuardia never applied to our situation here."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3806.595,3807.863,"No, I was (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3807.863,3827.873,"So, you don't have to get to the problem of accommodation although more certainly I think you could arrive at it in this direction and it may be that for many minds have not used, to say look, we see the real abuses, the real feeling for Norris-LaGuardia on the one hand and the Labor Management Relations Act on the other and we can reconcile it."
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3859.898,3861.668,"Mr. Miller, may I ask --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3861.668,3862.065,Surely.
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3862.065,3869.624,"I gather the procedure, whatever its steps are under this agreement was not in fact followed, was it?"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3872.485,3874.559,That is correct if Your Honor (Voice Overlap) --
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3874.559,3874.578,They were not --
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3874.578,3876.745,There were none of them followed.
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3887.327,3910.699,"Do you make any point even though this has no terminal compulsory or binding arbitration, do you make any point that nevertheless under Lincoln Mills and 301, the failure of the union to resort to those procedures or what they were of itself justified under Lincoln Mills and 301 and statutes --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3910.699,3920.701,"Let me give Your Honor please, when they bypass any grievance and instructions, I've got no quarrel with them putting up a picket and to advertise anything under the sun."
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3944.364,3949.783,"Although -- let me get this, you say there's a stipulation in the case that there was no grievance --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3949.783,3950.499,They have --
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3950.499,3952.268,– which would make this procedure applicable?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3952.268,3959.396,They have agreed then so that they had no grievance without any particular reasons.
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3959.396,3964.246,"But they did go before the joint state committee at some time or other, didn't they?"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3964.246,3964.773,Yes.
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3970.043,3971.288,Please.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,3971.288,4008.944,"Once the employers had brought their suit under Section 301 and had obtained after hearing and the putting on of evidence for both sides, a permanent injunction restraining the union from violating the contract, then the unions sent notice to the employer that it elected to go before the joint state committee and claim damages by virtue of the employer getting an injunction against the union to keep it from violating its contract."
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4030.747,4032.576,"Now, what happened to their claim before the (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4032.576,4040.751,"Well, as soon as that happened, they said the -- we have a right to damages because you have -- you went to court and gotten an injunction."
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4081.962,4085.38,Did they -- did they then asked the District Court for damages?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4085.38,4086.114,No sir.
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4095.333,4097.35,But the bond is a thousand dollar bond.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4097.35,4104.738,"Now, the reason for the bond if Your Honor please is not because of the Norris-LaGuardia Act at all because we didn't proceed pursuant the Norris-LaGuardia Act."
1961.13,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4117.365,4122.207,"If this case could be reversed, the liability could be addressed on that bond?"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4122.207,4124.393,I take it this is possible if Your Honor please.
1961.13,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4124.393,4126.267,So the case did not -- were moot.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4126.267,4129.581,"If Your Honor please, again, you're bringing up the point."
1961.13,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4144.122,4146.961,Would you go so far as to withdraw it?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4146.961,4147.417,I --
1961.13,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4147.417,4147.629,[Inaudible]
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4147.629,4148.352,It is in the manner.
1961.13,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4153.143,4154.841,(Voice Overlap) -- you're not pressing it?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4154.841,4156.171,I am not pressing it.
1961.13,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4156.171,4164.343,"You do concede that if the case should be reversed, damages to the extent of the penalty of the bond might be assessed on it."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4164.343,4171.154,"If Your Honor please, I have not briefed this point but I think it's entirely possible that that is correct."
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4171.154,4172.852,"Mr. Miller, may I just come back a moment --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4172.852,4172.999,Surely.
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4172.999,4174.071,-- to the question I asked you.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4193.779,4199.934,"Well, the union -- the union asserted, I should put it this way."
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4216.955,4226.792,Well then I'm clear you're not relying on their failure to proceed under the procedure as a basis upon which you're entitled to a restrain.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4226.792,4235.072,"I think when they bypassed it, if for no other reasons, we had a right to go to court."
1961.13,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4235.072,4237.362,You are relying on that though.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4237.362,4238.012,This isn't true.
1961.13,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4238.012,4240.482,It didn't go through the procedures so you say you have a right to go to court.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4240.482,4249.487,"When they didn't go through the procedure and they went out and in effect struck as counsel very, very (Voice Overlap) puts it."
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4249.487,4250.184,That's what I (Voice Overlap) --
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4250.184,4256.071,We had a -- we had a right because of their action not to initiate the grievance procedure but to go straight --
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4256.071,4258.877,"Well, that's what -- that was my original question Mr. Miller, whether --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4258.877,4259.558,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4259.558,4286.724,"-- whether you're relying to support the restraint [Inaudible] on the failure of the union to go through this procedure, notwithstanding it has no terminal arbitration provision, as a support on the authority of Lincoln Mills in 301 for the restraints you've got entirely apart from Norris-LaGuardia consideration."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4286.724,4293.507,"Well, if Your Honor please, there are -- I think there are three good questions in -- behind what Your Honor is getting at."
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4310.418,4312.088,And on the authority of Lincoln Mills.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4312.088,4313.379,And this would be true under the (Voice Overlap) --
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4313.379,4319.402,Even though Lincoln Mills involved a contract with a terminal arbitration procedure and this one does not.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4319.402,4334.889,"Yes, and I think there comes the second question I mean, since Lincoln Mills, when you have agreed to proceed in this manner is, is there in the law which Your Honors maintained must grow up in this area."
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4347.152,4347.653,"Well, I know (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4347.653,4349.266,[Inaudible] of the question.
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4349.266,4356.74,"But I'm asking this on the premise that this procedure does not provide for terminal arbitration, does not provide for terminal arbitration (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4356.74,4360.797,This contract does not have the compulsory arbitration feature --
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4360.797,4361.282,It does not.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4361.282,4361.64,-- which (Voice Overlap) --
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4361.64,4365.472,"Nevertheless, finds several steps of a procedure under rather a lot of procedures."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4365.472,4366.736,That's right.
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4367.43,4376.232,And your point is that under the 301 the failure of the union to proceed in that manner if they had a grievance under this contract --
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4376.232,4376.421,Certain --
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4376.421,4384.161,-- entitles you to injunctive relief on that Lincoln Mills -- the decision of Lincoln Mills supports you even though in Lincoln Mills there was a terminal --
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4384.161,4385.781,I think this is correct Your Honor.
1961.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4458.252,4474.46,But do you think 301 would go so far as to entitle the party claiming a breach immediately to go into court without first exhausting the grievance procedure whatever it may be whether it ends up in terminal arbitration or not.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4474.46,4479.343,I think it's quite possible Your Honor for it to be either way depending upon what the violation is.
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4479.343,4489.34,I notice your complaint though isn't the counts in terms of seeking specific enforcement of a contract to submit to the grievance procedure is much broader than that.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4489.34,4491.853,"Yes it is, if Your Honor please."
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4492.344,4495.073,You didn't draw it in light then of 301.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4495.073,4499.442,We -- its brought under 301 if Your Honor please.
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4499.442,4501.969,It doesn't confine to the --
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4501.969,4504.207,It was -- it was -- I didn't --
1961.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4504.207,4505.428,-- to the enforcement of --

1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4556.439,4556.718,Why would that --
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4556.718,4557.301,-- speaking to enforce --
1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4557.301,4562.689,Why would that have given you any more right to an injunction then it would've been given on to something else?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4562.689,4564.154,"Well now, if Your Honor please, you've touched a real good point."
1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4564.154,4572.165,"Do you not -- do you not still have to meet the problem of whether or not 301, that Act, implicitly repealed theNorris-LaGuardia Act?"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4572.165,4579.763,"Well, we still -- we -- this -- as you put it, Mr. Justice Black, only entitle us to go to court."
1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4589.678,4595.47,Do you -- despite the Norris-LaGuardia and that therefore it's to that extent explicit to repeal Norris-LaGuardia Act?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4595.47,4597.117,"Now, I don't think if Your Honor please (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4597.117,4597.925,"I mean, implicit (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4597.925,4606.675,"-- to get them into a repeal of Norris-LaGuardia, but I would gladly address myself to Your Honor's problem."
1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4660.091,4666.28,Don't you have to add one clause to that kind of -- despite the prohibitive statements of the Norris-LaGuardia Act?

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4711.419,4712.987,I think this is a possibility.

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,4723.336,4738.997,"Well, if Your Honor please, I think because of a principle of law which we went into below which nobody has brought up or even made a point here until Your Honor brought it up and I thought this is what Your Honor was getting at in the first instance when you first started asking these questions."

1961.13,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5038.061,5049.655,"So thereby this stipulation as I understand, you have taken out everything except the question that you're arguing here namely is there power under 301 to enforce the agreement once it was made."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5049.655,5052.58,"I think if Your Honor please, that is exactly correct."
1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5052.58,5055.599,You would say to enforce the agreement by issuing an injunction?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5055.599,5057.017,That is correct if Your Honor please.
1961.13,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5057.017,5062.305,"Well, if that's the only way it could be enforced, why of course, enforce does just as well."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5062.305,5068.287,I understood you both to say the same thing.

1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5123.805,5128.946,You think no other collocation of words would fairly state the issue.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5128.946,5131.534,"Well, I cannot say that that's true if Your Honor please."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5150.014,5150.666,That's right.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5158.366,5158.869,I don't want to stop there.

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5181.105,5185.814,I don't mean to suggest if Your Honor please that that is the only consideration.

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5224.115,5229.786,"Well, but if Your Honor please, you're not -- you aren't getting what I thought I would say."

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5279.514,5283.084,I have -- I don't have any quarrel with Your Honor at all.

1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5318.521,5325.332,"Now, the question is whether this enabled you to get an injunction in a labor dispute despite the Norris-LaGuardia Act?"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5325.332,5329.28,"Except for one thing if Your Honor please, there's a violation of a collective agreement."

1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5336.666,5337.552,That is the only question.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5337.552,5338.695,"That is the question, most definitely."

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5358.714,5360.783,And I maintain that for two reasons.

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5415.966,5416.629,And the only way --

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5416.906,5419.791,-- we can ensure is to get the injunction.

1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5431.072,5431.78,Could you?
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5431.78,5434.025,I think you can if Your Honor please.

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5434.287,5434.503,I think (Voice Overlap) --
1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5434.503,5436.795,-- the Norris-LaGuardia Act doesn't apply.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5436.795,5437.311,That's right.
1961.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5437.311,5438.703,But assuming it applies.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5438.703,5449.303,"Oh, then we most certainly would have to call it repeal, call it accommodation, call it whatever word one wishes to use, your -- well, Your Honor, would most certainly be correct."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5449.303,5467.503,In an ordinary Norris-LaGuardia in a conventional regarding the ordinary -- leave out 301 altogether where there is an agreement and an injunction is sought which was enforceable by injunction up to 1932.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5497.012,5503.703,"But if Your Honor please, the contract, they were considered were not collective agreements. They were contracts that won't join the union."

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5504.745,5506.157,-- to get a collective agreement.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5506.157,5512.349,"But they were also -- the state of -- laid by industrial relations was a little different, considerably different if you will --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5512.349,5513.551,Yes.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5513.551,5522.65,"-- in 1932 from what it wasn't, 1947 as today, but even 1932, there were outstanding collective bargaining agreements."
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5557.873,5571.868,"If Your Honor please, there is nothing in the congressional history or Norris-LaGuardia Act dealing with collective agreement only with these restrictive things on making collective agreement."

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5575.813,5577.969,There weren't any collective agreements though I know there were some.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5577.969,5578.298,And you didn't take --
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5578.298,5579.493,But that wasn't the problem.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5579.493,5582.153,And you think -- and you think they didn't go to the federal courts to try to enforce them.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5584.151,5599.982,"Well, I am sure that they endeavored to enforce collective agreements and I'm right here in this Court seeking to enforce a collective agreement, but most certainly, we aren't endeavoring to keep any union any employees from banding together to make such agreements."
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5599.982,5601.322,No.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5609.549,5610.349,Well -- but if Your Honor please --

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5611.358,5616.457,The Congress puts them back in 1947 even if they did withdraw.
1961.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5616.457,5621.753,[Inaudible] right about that.

1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5655.57,5657.141,You are correct Your Honor.
1961.13,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5659.576,5662.697,It says that they shall have jurisdiction to enforce the contract.
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5662.697,5665.468,It doesn't take anything away from it in enforcing it.
1961.13,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5665.468,5675.423,"Now, do you have -- Congress surely would have the power if it had gone on, nobody would dispute it, I take it and said, all of this despite the Norris-LaGuardia Act --"
1961.13,1,36262,malcolm_miller,,5675.423,5675.792,That's your --
