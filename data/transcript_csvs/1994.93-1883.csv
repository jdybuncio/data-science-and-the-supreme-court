1994.93-1883,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.286,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-1883, Eloise Anderson v. Verna Edwards."
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,75.14,77.391,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1883,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,285.138,297.507,Does the rule only apply insofar as people in the household are asking for the Federal-State assistance to them?
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,321.122,323.141,"--Well, Your Honor... Your Honor's question--"
1994.93-1883,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,323.141,323.822,--money?
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,323.822,326.795,--Your question implicates the lump sum rule.
1994.93-1883,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,338.002,344.577,"Well, can someone opt out of the unit and say, I don't want assistance any more, so don't count me in?"
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,344.577,346.517,"Well, there are two answers to that."
1994.93-1883,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,376.367,381.36,"Let's say it is not a father, mother, and their children."
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,393.267,399.682,"Under current California interpretation of Federal requirements and Federal regulations, no."
1994.93-1883,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.779,433.624,Is your answer the same even though the person who hypothetically won the lottery would be an emancipated adult?
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,436.847,446.602,"--Well, Your Honor, that person would not be eligible for AFDC, because the persons eligible for AFDC are limited to dependent children under the age of 21 and their caretaker relative."
1994.93-1883,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,446.602,451.966,--So what would happen if he lived with the mother and father and dependent children?
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,451.966,460.203,"If he lived with that household, his income would not be considered available to the others, in the same way, Your Honor, as, for instance, Mrs. Edwards, who is one of the named plaintiffs in this case."
1994.93-1883,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.563,515.398,"No, a care... but the caretaker could presumably have, if it's a woman, her own resources, and if she takes into the household a couple of indigent nephews, I take it she could apply for AFDC assistance for the nephews and not herself--"
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,515.398,516.587,That's correct.
1994.93-1883,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,516.587,519.749,--and California couldn't mandate that she be in the unit?
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,519.749,522.173,"No, if... as long as they're nephews."
1994.93-1883,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,524.554,525.494,"No, I said nephews."
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,525.494,527.026,"--No, Your Honor, that's correct."
1994.93-1883,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,530.968,535.641,And you can't consider her income in determining what the nephews get?
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,535.641,536.502,That's correct.
1994.93-1883,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,561.679,595.163,"Just to clarify it... these regulations are very confusing to me... the nonneedy caretaker with the two indigent nephews, and one of the nephews comes into some money, they're both in the assistance unit, but later one of the nephews comes into some money, gets a tort claim or a lottery ticket or something and has money, can that lucky nephew get out of the unit?"
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,595.163,600.374,"--If... only physically, essentially."
1994.93-1883,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,602.916,607.598,"No, stays right there in the household, but doesn't want the benefits any more."
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,609.481,620.639,"--If that person was in an AFDC recipient... in an assistance unit and be receiving AFDC at the time, that person... that person's income would be deemed available to the other nephew."
1994.93-1883,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,634.587,644.304,"Suppose it's his cousin and they had been in the same unit under this California whatever, unit filing rule?"
1994.93-1883,0,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,644.304,661.525,"Well, Your Honor, in that situation, currently under California law and policy, the individual would not be able to... once the income was received, the individuals would be deemed... who are in that assistance unit at that point would be deemed to be ineligible for such time as it takes to spend the money down."
1994.93-1883,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,931.282,933.795,"Very well, Mr. Eckhart."
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,935.496,949.044,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1883,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1035.29,1039.435,I take it one of the dependents is not the outside source.
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1039.435,1041.484,"--That's absolutely right, Justice Kennedy."
1994.93-1883,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1041.484,1043.137,Do the regulations make that clear?
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1043.137,1043.989,I think they do.
1994.93-1883,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1122.068,1126.613,"Well, on page 30 I think that may be the thrust of the regulation, but--"
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1160.844,1162.236,"--There are two answers to that, Justice Kennedy--"
1994.93-1883,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1162.236,1164.187,Why isn't he a nonlegally responsible individual?
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1164.187,1176.666,"--He is a nonlegally responsible individual, but he's being included with the other child not solely because of his presence in the household, but rather because, in addition to being in the household, he has claimed AFDC with the same caretaker."
1994.93-1883,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1184.079,1186.199,"I see, so it's the word ""solely"" that it--"
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1186.199,1187.721,--Or it's... or presence in the household.
1994.93-1883,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1199.168,1203.432,"--So the difference, then, is between presence in the household and, I take it, membership in the unit."
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1203.432,1209.417,"--Or, more practically, the fact that that person is having aid claimed for themselves under the auspices of the same caretaker."
1994.93-1883,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1209.417,1217.741,Except California's attorney here today says that someone can't opt out of the assistance unit.
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1217.741,1219.16,"Justice O'Connor, we disagree with that."
1994.93-1883,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1284.634,1287.225,And you think California can't have a different rule?
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1287.225,1289.168,"--We don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1883,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1299.544,1324.502,"I thought California's rule was, he can pull out, but that the time at which the attribution is determined and the drawdown is computed is the time at which he received the entitlement to that money, so even if he does get out afterwards, you have fixed the rule for drawdown of that lump sum payment."
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1324.502,1327.725,"--Justice Scalia, I think you've correctly interpreted the way California applies--"
1994.93-1883,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.725,1328.596,And you disagree with that interpretation?
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1328.596,1329.347,--We disagree with that.
1994.93-1883,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.808,1339.723,"Not only to opt out, but to remove the drawdown requirements from the rest of the unit."
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1339.723,1340.424,--That's right.
1994.93-1883,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1342.186,1343.646,After winning the lottery?
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1343.646,1347.319,"--After winning the lottery for successive AFDC periods, which are months."
1994.93-1883,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.929,1368.323,"It would apply to a child, too, or just a nephew?"
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1368.323,1370.053,"Well, if you're... by child you mean a direct offspring--"
1994.93-1883,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1370.053,1370.884,"Yes, direct offspring."
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1370.884,1373.445,"--Well, direct offspring, if you have two siblings, then--"
1994.93-1883,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.445,1377.857,"It's not family-friendly, if it's encouraging kids who win the lottery to leave home."
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1377.857,1378.468,--Not to leave home--
1994.93-1883,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.468,1379.049,I mean--
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1379.049,1386.335,"--In fact, that's... our view is that the person need not leave home, but simply in this next month not have AFDC claimed for themselves."
1994.93-1883,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1389.848,1401.936,"--But that would not be the case if what the person got in a lump sum wasn't enough to take that person off AFDC, so they would still... then the income would be attributed to everyone in the unit."
1994.93-1883,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1401.936,1404.437,"--For that... for that next month, that's absolutely right."
1994.93-1883,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1511.768,1513.529,"Thank you, Mr. Engelmayer."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1516.6,1522.515,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.418,1640.384,The rule only applies if the caretaker is also applying for assistance--
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1640.384,1642.034,The consolidated--
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1642.034,1642.674,--is that the point?
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1642.674,1643.553,--assistance unit rule?
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1643.553,1643.984,Uh-huh.
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1643.984,1644.565,No.
1994.93-1883,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1669.973,1674.737,So what's wrong?
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1674.737,1682.802,"So what's wrong is that when they take that step, when California does that, what it does is, it actually looks at the situation and says, we have two assistance units."
1994.93-1883,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1711.63,1718.626,"How does the... it sounded to me like a compromise, like the two nephews and the two children are there."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1724.229,1724.988,Uh-huh.
1994.93-1883,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1724.988,1732.824,"So am I right, it seems to say, look, for purposes of what the grant size is, we're going to give you as if it were four regular children."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1746.863,1747.634,That's incorrect.
1994.93-1883,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1747.634,1748.075,All right.
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1763.323,1776.252,"But in fact that's not what is happening here, and the Solicitor General's assertion that with lump sum income they would allow people to simply opt out is not found in any regulation or policy and is clearly contrary to California's practice."
1994.93-1883,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1776.252,1779.564,But what's wrong... what have I said that... I'm trying to understand it.
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1783.478,1791.933,"As I understand your interpretation, you're suggesting that the State would only attribute the caretaker's income to her children, but it doesn't just do that."
1994.93-1883,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1795.847,1796.144,Oh--
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1796.144,1806.782,"--and the other... the nonsiblings, the cousin, and what's wrong with that is that in doing so they violate the plain language of the three Federal availability regulations at issue in this case."
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1815.388,1816.009,"--Ms. Meiss, you're--"
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1816.009,1817.138,--nonresponsible individual.
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1817.138,1831.408,"--You're always up against a hard argument when you say, it violates the plain meaning, and these are regulations of the HHS."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1846.778,1849.389,"If you look at the plain language of the regulations, they're clear."
1994.93-1883,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1855.665,1856.697,It doesn't say... it says solely.
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1858.358,1860.451,--But that's exactly what they're doing in this case.
1994.93-1883,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1860.868,1864.131,"Well, but I think if you're going to talk about the regulation you have to quote it accurately."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1864.131,1864.541,--Mm-hmm.
1994.93-1883,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1864.541,1867.003,"It says solely, and I think that's a very important word."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1867.003,1874.138,"But that is the reason they're doing it, Justice... they are attributing the income because these individuals live together in the same household."
1994.93-1883,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.03,1880.443,"No, they are doing it because he's a member of the unit receiving payments."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1880.443,1883.946,"--No, they're... they start out... this is--"
1994.93-1883,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1883.946,1885.396,"I mean, that's their argument, but--"
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1885.396,1895.613,"--They're argument is... they start out, though, with two units, and then they combine those two units, and it's when they take that step of combining those two units that they're violating the availability principle."
1994.93-1883,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.674,1904.799,"--These are very, kind of, intricate, technical provisions."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1913.274,1927.724,"--Well, we're saying her interpretation ignores the language of the regulations which forbid proration or reduction, forbid assuming a contribution of support, and say that you can't count as available income when somebody doesn't have the legal ability to make it available."
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1943.756,1947.999,Why do we owe no deference to the agency's interpretation of its own regulations?
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1947.999,1965.691,"Under the case Thomas Jefferson University and other precedents of this Court, if an agency's interpretation is contrary to the plain language of the regulations and is inconsistent with the contemporaneous interpretation that the drafters gave to those regulations, then no deference should be owed to them."
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1966.339,1972.764,Where is your evidence of a contemporaneous interpretation different from the one the Secretary is now advancing?
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,1972.764,1998.61,"--What they're now saying is that they can force a contribution of support, and that they can join these two assistance units, and if you look at 42 Federal Register, which we cite on page 22 of our brief, it's very clear that the Secretary at that time said there was no basis, no legal basis for forcing a contribution of support, but that's precisely what they're doing in this case is, they're forcing that contribution."
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1998.61,2006.116,"Did the Secretary ever take a position that States could not combine the two units, as California and 28 States do?"
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2012.842,2016.953,The Secretary has said that States may do this.
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2076.672,2080.313,They're arguing that it's susceptible to its reading.
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2090.9,2093.803,--We're saying that... that's correct.
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2096.014,2097.305,By your argument--
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2097.305,2097.956,--language of the regulations is clear.
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2097.956,2110.016,"--you have to say that this language is clear and leaves no room for interpretation, even though the Secretary responsible for the regulation has argued otherwise."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2118.64,2120.791,"That's correct, Your Honor, we are doing that."
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2174.156,2182.12,We have given deference to the Secretary's position even in cases where her position is not stated in a rulemaking.
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2182.12,2194.979,"Yes, that's correct, but in this case... in this case, the plain language of the regulations is... we believe is very clear."
1994.93-1883,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.705,2250.035,"Well, it isn't necessarily saving money."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2262.464,2266.898,"Well, the State says that the reason they do it, Your Honor, is to save money."
1994.93-1883,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.898,2274.131,"Well, it does save money with respect to this unit, but if it didn't save that money, every unit would have to get that much less."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2274.131,2275.242,Not necessarily.
1994.93-1883,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.313,2278.855,"Not necessarily no, either."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2279.984,2280.585,--That's correct.
1994.93-1883,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.585,2282.328,--You really can't say the money's coming out of welfare.
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2283.107,2293.045,"But the State admits its purpose here is to save money, and that they feel they're allowed to do that because of the economies of scale that exist in shared living situations."
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2335.09,2342.726,And it is the three availability regulations and not any statutory peg that you... on which you base your case?
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2342.726,2373.525,"Well, we also base our case, Your Honor, on the court's interpretation of the language of what income and resources can be attributed to an individual under 602(a)(7)(A), which is the basis on which the State says it gets its discretion to define assistance units, so we also have that statutory claim, and we also make... as interpreted by this Court and the regulations basically flesh out or make concrete the availability principle and how it's used in this."
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2421.167,2440.571,But what do you do with the matching inequities that the State presents to us if we were to adopt your view of this... they have it set out graphically on page 39 of their brief... and the comparison that they make among units that they assert are similarly situated?
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2440.571,2452.458,"Well, in one sense it's a false issue, because the issue in this case is not just the number of individuals in the home, but the legal responsibility that those individuals owe to one another."
1994.93-1883,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.433,2498.949,"Well, I gather the State is also saying, and I guess the Government is agreeing, that if California wanted to, it could consider that to be a single unit, too."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2524.035,2524.433,--No.
1994.93-1883,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2549.702,2560.648,"And there's not between a brother and sister, but that's by statute, I suppose."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2560.648,2561.449,--That's correct.
1994.93-1883,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2661.875,2663.766,Is there any empirical information?
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2690.363,2716.76,"Well, as a practical matter, the children that we're dealing with are children who are taken in by these relatives, are by definition abandoned or orphaned, they're victims of abuse or neglect, and so most of them come to the households with greater needs, with far greater needs, emotional needs, and many of them are simply dropped off, as happened in one of our plaintiffs' case, merely with the clothes on their back and nothing else."
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2738.195,2748.36,"Well, in this situation, can the caretaker be eligible under the foster care program, and apply to be--"
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2748.36,2748.791,--No.
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2748.791,2749.472,--the foster parent?
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2749.472,2750.463,"No, because--"
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2750.463,2751.064,Why not?
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2751.064,2755.636,--Because by definition the children in this situation do not meet the foster care definition.
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2755.636,2756.427,Why?
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2756.427,2771.975,"Because the foster care program requires that children be removed from a home at a certain point in time, that they be... that they go through the court system in order to have foster care placed, and these children aren't."
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2777.852,2783.934,"And the caretaker couldn't go to the court and say, please do what's necessary--"
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2783.934,2784.384,--No.
1994.93-1883,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2789.967,2795.661,"--When you say Ms. Meiss, is that by State law or Federal law, Federal regulation?"
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2795.661,2797.143,It's both State and Federal law.
1994.93-1883,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.143,2797.895,The foster--
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2797.895,2806.269,"And what I mean is that... is that... yes, the foster care system is again a joint... what I mean is that these individual children don't qualify."
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2961.93,2967.864,"--Well, I thought the Solicitor General's attorney said that person could opt out of the unit."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2967.864,2972.187,"--That's simply incorrect, and I don't think that's what he meant to say, because that is not the rule."
1994.93-1883,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2995.893,2998.006,I thought he could opt out of the assistance unit.
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2998.006,2998.867,Who could?
1994.93-1883,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2998.867,2999.856,The one who gets the money.
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,2999.856,3001.388,"Well, he can't if--"
1994.93-1883,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3001.388,3003.34,He can't opt out of the assistance unit?
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,3003.34,3004.291,--No.
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3012.065,3013.157,But the nephew could.
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,3013.157,3014.597,--and the child off... no.
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3014.597,3016.059,"If it's a nephew, the nephew can opt out--"
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,3016.059,3016.556,No.
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3016.556,3017.687,--according to the SG.
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,3017.687,3019.929,If it's the nephew that gets the outside income?
1994.93-1883,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3121.727,3127.931,"Well, I guess we don't really have the opt-out situation and the lump-sum question before us here."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,3127.931,3152.886,"Well, as a matter of fact, the class definition says that any individual... it's true none of our named plaintiffs received a lump-sum income, or outside income, but the class definition is, any individual affected by this policy, and at the time this was submitted to the district court we had a joint stipulation of undisputed facts, and one of those facts was that outside income would be treated in the same way, so I do believe the matter was before the district court."
1994.93-1883,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3240.335,3242.025,"Thank you, Ms. Meiss."
1994.93-1883,2,33910,katherine_meiss,,3242.025,3243.327,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1994.93-1883,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3243.327,3244.866,"Mr. Eckhart, you have 5 minutes remaining."
1994.93-1883,3,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,3244.866,3247.868,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-1883,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3365.858,3376.725,"You're saying you can only combine units where they are only a single caretaker, or at least where everyone in the unit could be under a single caretaker?"
1994.93-1883,3,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,3376.725,3379.297,--I believe that is... that would be the limitation of--
1994.93-1883,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3379.297,3380.588,Where does that limitation come from?
1994.93-1883,3,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,3381.359,3381.897,--The limitation--
1994.93-1883,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3381.897,3383.229,--create other units as well?
1994.93-1883,3,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,3383.229,3396.229,"--Well, the limitation does come from the availability rules, that if you were dealing with a situation of a man in the house, the mother's boyfriend, who's not the father of the children, who's not applying for AFDC, I think that's a limitation."
1994.93-1883,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3405.613,3408.996,So the availability rules do have something to do with the formation of units.
1994.93-1883,3,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,3413.51,3417.601,"Well, to the extent that all the persons... well, let me clarify."
1994.93-1883,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3445.27,3446.171,I don't see why--
1994.93-1883,3,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,3446.171,3447.291,--The two women are not related.
1994.93-1883,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3447.291,3454.837,"--unless you accept the theory that the respondents here have been urging, that there is a limitation that springs--"
1994.93-1883,3,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,3454.837,3456.648,"Well, there's a limitation, Your Honor--"
1994.93-1883,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3456.648,3457.539,--from the attribution rule.
1994.93-1883,3,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,3457.539,3464.314,"--There's a limitation that arises out of 606(a) of 42 U.S.C., which lists those individuals who can be caretaker relatives."
1994.93-1883,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3526.324,3527.126,"Thank you, Mr. Eckhart."
1994.93-1883,3,20810,dennis_paul_eckhart,,3527.126,3527.514,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1994.93-1883,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3527.514,3528.68,The case is submitted.
