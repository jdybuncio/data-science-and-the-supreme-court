1985.84-1602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,0.0,We will arguments first this morning in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby.
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,3.785,6.57,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,183.02,190.006,"But when a motion for a directed verdict is made, the evidence is all in the record, is it not?"
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,190.006,194.91,"The evidence is all in the record that the plaintiff wishes to put before the court at that time, that is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,196.227,201.314,The plaintiff will have inevitably put his evidence all in at that stage.
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,201.314,202.547,--That is correct.
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.532,475.471,What about credibility questions where there's just a straight conflict between two sets of affidavits on a question of fact?
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,475.471,492.25,"Your Honor, when that happens, whether it happens at summary judgment or whether a credibility question arises at trial, in the plaintiff's case, the duty of the district court is to draw the inferences in favor of the person opposing the motion, and therefore that result ought to be the same on either motion."
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,492.25,495.035,Which means it goes to trial.
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,495.035,505.99,"Absolutely, if there is a specific fact in dispute at either state of the proceeding, then the plaintiff is entitled to go past those motions and submit the case to the jury for a resolution of that fact."
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,505.99,525.321,"Well, can the libel plaintiff just rely on his complaint to establish a... he asserts a... some... he attacks the particular statements and says they are false."
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,525.321,526.554,"Your Honor, the--"
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,526.554,532.308,The defendant comes back and says they are true.
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,535.177,536.279,"--I understand, Your Honor."
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,542.182,542.765,Yes.
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,542.765,545.431,The advisory committee noted that the Third Circuit had adopted that rule.
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.431,545.883,Mm-hmm.
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,545.883,555.322,"The Third Circuit had allowed plaintiffs to pass a motion for summary judgment on some evidence and good faith pleadings, and the advisor said we want to change that rule."
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,565.445,565.978,Well--
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,565.978,572.232,"So a libel plaintiff should not he permitted, as any other plaintiff should not be permitted to proceed past summary judgment when a statement--"
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.232,576.584,--Is that another error... is that another way you say that the Court of Appeals erred in this case?
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,576.584,578.469,--The Court of Appeals did not say that.
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.469,579.802,What did it say?
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,579.802,590.759,"The Court of Appeals said that because libel... excuse me, because summary judgement is a threshold issue, it's unfair to make plaintiffs marshal all of their evidence at the summary judgment stage--"
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.759,591.343,I agree.
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,591.343,606.453,"--And secondly, it said that because state of mind is at issue, it's inappropriate to apply the clear and convincing standard because otherwise we would have summary judgment granted, is the inference that you draw from the Court of Appeals' reasoning there."
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.453,619.529,"You don't think there are any... any of the statements that the Court of Appeals said should go to trial, that any of them involved real credibility questions?"
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,619.529,620.046,"No, I don't."
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,626.767,628.134,That's Allegation 11?
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,628.134,634.638,"--There are six allegations of the nine remaining that are attributable to Mr. Eringer as the source, one of which is 11."
1985.84-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,793.424,808.784,"Mr. Branson, in fraud actions brought in state courts, frequently the burden of proof is said to be by clear and convincing evidence, actions to set aside a will, that sort of thing."
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,815.188,824.527,"Yes, Your Honor, there have, and we readily admit that there are state court decisions from the state supreme courts that disagree with the rule we are stating."
1985.84-1602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,838.303,840.905,"Are there any, are there any holdings, any holdings supporting your position?"
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,840.905,842.171,"Yes, there are, Your Honor."
1985.84-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,866.723,876.844,"You say also, don't you, that the Court ought to consider the statement and the Chief Justice's opinion in Hutchinson v. Proxmire in the light of the Bose case?"
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,876.844,879.63,"We have suggested in our brief, Your Honor, this."
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.628,1015.834,"So in libel cases, neither a judge nor a jury is really entitled to just disbelieve a witness if there's no contrary evidence:"
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1015.834,1019.555,"--He's not entitled to disbelieve a witness if there's no... well, in the Bose case, Court--"
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1019.555,1022.257,"--Well, is that right or not?"
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1027.391,1027.874,--It's not... it is--
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.874,1032.159,--before the witness may be disbelieved.
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1033.109,1053.839,"--What the Court is permitted... what the Court is permitted to do under Bose is to accept a trial court determination that a witness is not credible and yet notwithstanding that admission, assess the record and determine whether there is competent evidence by a clear and convincing standard of actual malice because the author in the Bose case was deemed by that trial court not to have been credible."
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.345,1081.259,"The defendant gets on the stand, or say it's a reporter gets on the stand and says I just didn't know that that was false, I had no reason to believe... and the judge says I... writes an opinion and says I just don't believe him, or the jury says I just don't believe him, and yet the other side didn't come up with any concrete evidence."
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1081.259,1091.464,--That case would have to be reviewed under Bose by an assessment of the totality of the evidence to determine whether there were sufficient grounds to find that that reporter in fact entertained--
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1091.464,1099.97,But you wouldn't... but you would... wouldn't you have to take the judge's or the jury's judgment that this fellow was just incredible?
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1099.97,1100.82,"--Well, you might have go take--"
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.82,1103.922,"And you just put his testimony aside, right?"
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1103.922,1110.076,"--We may put his testimony aside, but what the Court said in Bose was that that doesn't provide a basis for the plaintiff to prevail."
1985.84-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.489,1134.107,But that's not enough under any standard.
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1134.107,1134.757,--Absolutely.
1985.84-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1134.757,1144.73,"I mean, you don't have to go to a clear and convincing standard to say that failure... disbelief of a party upon whom the burden of proof is isn't enough to support the burden of proof of the other side."
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1144.73,1145.582,That's precisely our point.
1985.84-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.205,1170.298,"But the Court of Appeals does... well, but your... if you're relying on the point you just made, you should be able to make your case without the clear and convincing standard on review of summary judgment."
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1170.298,1171.098,Why is that?
1985.84-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1171.098,1187.409,"Well, if the whole thing turns on whether or not the disbelief of a... of your reporter would support an inference, an affirmative inference for them, that fails under the normal summary judgment standard as well as the clear and convincing standard."
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1187.409,1187.959,I agree.
1985.84-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1240.711,1250.567,"Well, do you agree that in this case, do you agree with the Court of Appeals that there was enough under the normal standard of summary judgment to support its ruling?"
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1250.567,1262.807,"No, I don't because the Court of Appeals uses the language that a reasonable jury could find actual malice on the following facts, and then it discusses Eringer in the manner that we have discussed him."
1985.84-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.932,1275.8,But how... what if you're wrong?
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1280.169,1289.692,"--Well, on a... well, on a preponderance, the plaintiff would fail as well because even on a preponderance, evidence of negligence is not evidence of actual malice, plain and simple."
1985.84-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1289.692,1297.563,"--The fact that the Court of Appeals, in your view, relied on negligence, is insufficient regardless of what summary judgment standard you apply."
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1297.563,1305.319,"It should be, unless you adopt the view that if the plaintiff puts some evidence in the record that is admissible on the case, he puts some fact in dispute."
1985.84-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.319,1305.953,But that--
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1305.953,1308.021,"That's the, that's the holding of the Court of Appeals."
1985.84-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.021,1315.175,"--Well, but that isn't correct even under summary judgment rules in a number of other areas of the law that don't have anything to do with clear and convincing."
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1321.329,1329.685,"Well, but the Court of Appeals has said that this evidence of negligence could give a jury grounds for finding actual malice."
1985.84-1602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1367.744,1382.653,Which of the nine allegations that the circuit court said should go to trial do you think would have been prohibited or would have been resolved by summary judgment under a clear and convincing standard?
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1382.653,1386.355,"Well, Your Honor, we believe all of them would, and that's the holding of the district court."
1985.84-1602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1396.413,1407.519,You take the position that the summary judgment standard should be the same as that applied on a motion for directed verdict?
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1407.519,1407.785,That is correct.
1985.84-1602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1408.285,1416.173,Is it clear from decisions of this Court that on a motion for directed verdict that the clear and convincing standard would be applied?
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1416.173,1417.691,In an actual malice libel case?
1985.84-1602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1443.489,1444.841,What case were you referring to?
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1444.841,1446.674,"Time, Inc. v. Pape."
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.674,1453.364,"Well, I take it the Court of Appeals agrees with you, that at the directed verdict stage the clear and convincing standard applies."
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1453.364,1454.864,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.732,1458.782,It says it is.
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1458.782,1460.518,"I'm sorry, I said... I made a double negative."
1985.84-1602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1485.585,1487.768,Very well.
1985.84-1602,0,20631,david_j_branson,,1487.768,1494.607,"We believe Rule 56 has a clear purpose, and the purpose is to end litigation that should not proceed to trial."
1985.84-1602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1584.082,1588.903,Mr. Lane?
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,1588.903,1594.371,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court,--"
1985.84-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.553,1775.457,"Are you arguing that no matter what standard that you apply here on summary judgment, that you should win?"
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,1776.824,1800.072,"--That is true, but also we would go further and say that the clear and convincing standard should not be applied here at this level, and the difference, if I may say, Your Honor, between a directed verdict and summary judgment, it's not the amount of time the plaintiff has to conduct discovery, it is the difference between cross examination in the presence of the person or the trier of the fact."
1985.84-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.482,1849.172,"But if there's an actual conflict in the evidence, you don't resolve it at either summary judgment or--"
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,1849.172,1850.622,Or directed verdict.
1985.84-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.622,1851.238,--Yes.
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,1851.238,1852.207,"Yes, that is our position."
1985.84-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.207,1864.432,"But I suppose you could just disregard a defendant's witness that you didn't believe, and if you believed him, you might hold for the defendant, if you didn't you wouldn't."
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,1864.432,1868.717,"That is correct, but in order to believe or not believe, you must hear, you must see him."
1985.84-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.717,1871.586,But you couldn't do that on summary judgment.
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,1871.586,1872.369,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.205,1906.592,"Well, Mr. Lane, let me go back a minute to where you responded to Justice White's question."
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,1906.592,1907.309,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1907.309,1930.374,"If the presence of the judge's ability to judge credibility by seeing the witness personally is so important in the clear and convincing test, how can an appellate court ever say that there was not clear and convincing evidence here if a trial court has found otherwise."
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,1930.374,1941.348,"This is the independent review mandated by New York Times v. Sullivan, and that is it is an independent review based upon the entire record, the determination by the jury, the determination by the court."
1985.84-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.967,1947.752,But the witnesses aren't.
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,1947.752,1960.31,"That is correct, but at least the appellate court has the advantage of the view of the jury or/and the view of the trial court in reaching its conclusion, something totally absent here."
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.65,2157.756,"Mr. Lane, am I correct in, as I listen to your argument, and listening to your opponent, you are in effect saying that the evidence already in the record is adequate to meet the clear and convincing standard."
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2157.756,2159.875,"--I am saying that that is true, but that is not--"
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2159.875,2163.242,He is saying the evidence in the record is insufficient to meet the preponderance standard.
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2163.242,2163.942,"--Yes, that's correct."
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2163.942,2169.663,So both of you seem to say it really doesn't make much difference what standard we apply if we look at the correct part of the record.
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2169.663,2178.752,"I think it is very important not just in this case but for other cases that the standard that be applied is not clear and convincing at this stage, at the summary judgment stage."
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.219,2180.954,"But you are primarily interested in this case, I assume."
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2180.954,2181.321,--Yes.
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2181.321,2182.138,Not a lot of other cases.
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2182.138,2182.906,"Yes, yes."
1985.84-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.156,2193.279,"Well, the Court of Appeals seemed to... the Court of Appeals seemed to think it was important because it carefully applied only the non-clear and convincing standard in reviewing the record."
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2193.279,2197.666,"That is correct, but the Court did not distinguish and did not say what it would have done if there was clear and convincing."
1985.84-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.6,2207.105,"If we disagree, if we disagree with you, perhaps we ought to find out what the Court of Appeals would think."
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2207.105,2208.905,"Well, I think it's clear what the Court said."
1985.84-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.425,2213.275,"Oh, yes."
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2222.531,2223.231,No.
1985.84-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.231,2224.9,Wouldn't we ask the Court of Appeals?
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2224.9,2228.602,I think that the clear and convincing standard should not be the standard.
1985.84-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.602,2231.054,"Oh, I know, but suppose we disagree with you?"
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2231.054,2231.721,Well--
1985.84-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.721,2233.006,"Then we remand, don't we?"
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2234.089,2235.556,--That's correct--
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2285.106,2302.15,"--I must confess I have some, some difficulty understanding that argument because I think, as Justice Rehnquist pointed out earlier, do we not assume for purposes of... or doesn't the trial judge in evaluating the motion assume that all of your witnesses are telling the truth and draw all inferences favorable to your side of the case in evaluating the testimony?"
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2302.15,2302.783,The trial court should.
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2302.783,2304.785,So how can credibility held you any?
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2306.102,2309.554,"The trial court should but did not in this case, Your Honor."
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.173,2311.373,But that doesn't go to the standard of proof.
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2311.373,2311.956,--I beg your pardon?
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.956,2315.041,That doesn't go to the question of standard of proof.
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2315.041,2330.234,"No, but the trial court did not do that in this case, and the reason the trial court did not do that is because of Mr. Bermant, on behalf of the defendants, came in with a massive self-serving statement which we have seen in libel cases, and that is the allegation of I am pure, I am pure of heart."
1985.84-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2366.525,2370.711,"Well, that's what Hutchinson v. Proxmire was talking about in that statement, wasn't it, that--"
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2370.711,2371.177,Yes.
1985.84-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2371.177,2380.952,"--a defendant can't just come in with a long, self-serving statement about how great he is and how truthful he is and expect that to stand up on summary judgment if there is contrary evidence."
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2380.952,2394.027,"That is correct, Your Honor, and I think that Bose takes that further when Bose says that this can be reviewed, but it must be reviewed after the record has been established, after the record, which is a record of cross examination."
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2430.533,2438.739,"Yes, but let me ask you again, do you contend that the cross examination will do something other than prove that the witness is totally a complete liar?"
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2449.829,2461.904,"--In this particular case, Your Honor, I think that the standard, any standard applied would have prevented the Court from having dismissed on those kind of questions."
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.904,2467.041,My question is directed at the argument that there's something special about credibility of witnesses--
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2467.041,2467.425,Yes.
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.425,2474.045,"--as a reason for having a different standard of proof on summary judgment, to which an answer is made, well, what difference does it make?"
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2479.033,2479.616,But the Court should--
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.616,2485.17,"--You then say what's left, is that enough to raise an issue, and I don't understand the cross examination argument."
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2485.17,2492.423,"--If the Court is asking are all the inferences to be taken to favor the nonmoving party, yes, of course, but they were not taken in this case, as I have stated."
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2492.423,2504.75,"Right, but you have argued, well, you didn't have an opportunity to cross examine in front of the trier of fact, and I'm saying, well, if you did have that opportunity you could perhaps prove that the witness is a total liar, but don't you assume that on summary judgment?"
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2506.133,2506.683,Yes.
1985.84-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.683,2507.785,--about needing to cross examine.
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2508.252,2520.343,"Well, we are drawing the distinction, for example, between summary judgment and a judgment notwithstanding the verdict which follows, or in the case of Bose, for example, which follows an entire record being made."
1985.84-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.984,2613.435,--I thought you said there was a First Amendment right to have it tried and decided by a jury.
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2613.435,2615.571,"If so, I misspoke, Your Honor."
1985.84-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2638.92,2646.074,"Well, after reading this record, one might truthfully say a chill on both your houses."
1985.84-1602,1,36182,mark_lane,,2646.074,2704.862,"--I believe that the... all of the concerns, the legitimate concerns of the news media having a great deal of room within which to make error, even without adequate investigation, all of those concerns have been addressed by New York Times and all the progeny, including Hutchinson and the most recent case Bose, but I think that those concerns can be addressed by... not by abrogating the ordinary rules regarding summary judgment, but by after trial, after the full record has been made, after the plaintiff has had an opportunity to vindicate himself... money is important to many plaintiffs when they bring actions, but to many of us, to many of those who are not plaintiffs, and even to some plaintiffs, the right to vindicate one's position is of great consequence, in some cases of greater consequence."
1985.84-1602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2843.269,0.0,"Mr. Branson, you have three minutes remaining."
1985.84-1602,2,20631,david_j_branson,,2845.638,2847.638,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.375,2935.463,"Yes, but we have normally had a judgment of a court on the right standard, haven't we?"
1985.84-1602,2,20631,david_j_branson,,2935.463,2938.748,"--You normally, Your Honor, have had a record made according to the right standard--"
1985.84-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.748,2939.448,"Yes, yes."
1985.84-1602,2,20631,david_j_branson,,2939.448,2952.49,"--With the exception of New York Times, where that case was tried on the strict liability theory, and you applied the clear and convincing standard, the actual malice standard, and you made the assessment and did not send that case back to Alabama for a trial in the Alabama courts."
1985.84-1602,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2952.49,2963.196,"Well, what you say has some virtue, I suppose, to say a particular standard should be applied for one court and tell another court to apply it can be a pretty abstract proposition."
1985.84-1602,2,20631,david_j_branson,,2970.886,2975.856,"If you apply the clear and convincing standard to summary judgment, I will agree with that, Your Honor."
1985.84-1602,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2977.04,2977.706,"Thank you, gentlemen."
