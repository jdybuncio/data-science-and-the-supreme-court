1983.83-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.618,We'll hear arguments next in Ohio v. Johnson.
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,8.404,24.914,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, on January 25, 1979, one Thomas Hill was shot to death at his apartment in the City of Mentor on the Lake, Lake County, State of Ohio."
1983.83-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,176.728,188.853,"Mr. Shoop, is that a common practice in Ohio for the judge to refuse the prosecution's demand to go on to trial?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,193.673,195.689,--Correct.
1983.83-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,195.689,198.125,"Is this a common thing, this event that occurred here?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,198.125,204.029,The event is not directed at whether or not it's common to reject the prosecutor's plea.
1983.83-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,246.356,246.906,Who?
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,248.474,249.091,Both.
1983.83-904,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,252.426,255.212,Did they specifically mention double jeopardy?
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,255.212,255.812,Yes.
1983.83-904,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,255.812,266.103,"And I take it, under Ohio practice, grand theft is a lesser included offense of aggravated robbery--"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,266.103,266.936,Not in every instance.
1983.83-904,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,266.936,268.253,--Or at least is a lesser offense.
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,268.253,269.405,It is a lesser offense.
1983.83-904,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,269.405,271.671,All right.
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,271.671,284.497,"On November 26, 1980, following the written arguments, without any testimony even offered or proffered, the trial court was persuaded to accept the guilty pleas, as I said."
1983.83-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,307.863,311.998,"It's possible that he'd serve only five years altogether, isn't it?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,311.998,328.609,"It is possible that he could serve only five years, and likely that he would serve even less because of the Ohio Adult Parole Authority's interpretations and understanding and control of release of those that are incarcerated under indeterminate sentencing."
1983.83-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.532,368.901,"Mr. Shoop, you mentioned that the motion was granted without any testimony."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,374.655,377.424,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.83-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,432.761,443.216,"Mr. Shoop, the Supreme Court opinion never says clearly whether involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,466.082,468.434,I agree with Justice O'Connor.
1983.83-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,492.815,494.834,"Well, do you know which the court was holding?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,494.834,513.979,I can only understand from all of the court's holdings in Ohio that there is no decision that we can find which specifically states that murder or involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of the crime of murder.
1983.83-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,537.161,539.113,Are the two offenses mutually exclusive?
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,539.113,542.482,"In my argument I say yes, they are."
1983.83-904,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,582.559,594.2,"Mr. Shoop, before Justice O'Connor's question, you made the statement that the Ohio courts have reached their conclusion on federal double jeopardy grounds."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,617.13,652.619,"I would have to state that armed robbery... excuse me... aggravated robbery and grand theft, that because of peculiarity in the charging verbiage that was used, aggravated robbery can be charged either as threatening the force or, in the second section, having a concealed weapon or weapon upon their person, whereas theft then would only encompass the theft."
1983.83-904,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,667.729,678.104,"This takes me, of course, to what I regard as a very strange rule, this syllabus rule you have in the State of Ohio, and I'm not sure it's in effect anywhere else."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,685.626,695.732,"I don't believe that it's all state law, because they apply all of the Blockburger tests in their application and understanding."
1983.83-904,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,760.091,773.748,"When the trial judge indicated he was going to accept these pleas, did the State ever propose dismissing those charges and going ahead on murder and aggravated robbery?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,773.748,775.2,"--No, the State did not."
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,803.953,813.392,"May I ask, though, in Johnson itself, did the Ohio Supreme Court uphold that involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,813.392,816.511,I do not believe that they stated it is a lesser included offense.
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.735,835.389,"Is there any difference between the two offenses as a matter of Ohio law, other than the mental state of the defendant?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,835.389,836.675,--Yes.
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.608,842.912,"What is there, other than the mental state of the defendant, that is different between the two offenses?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,842.912,856.652,"We have a lower offense which has a separate, distinct element necessary in its proof, and a higher offense which also has a separate and distinct element."
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,856.652,860.123,"And what is that element, apart from the mental state of the defendant?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,860.123,865.342,It is only mental in... that is part of the misinterpretation of the Ohio courts.
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.066,878.252,"In other words, in the murder case you have to prove purpose."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,878.252,880.454,Purpose to kill.
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.454,880.954,Purpose to kill.
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,888.023,888.923,All right.
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.844,893.327,"No, no."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,904.569,908.704,--The act of committing some misdemeanor.
1983.83-904,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.816,944.96,"Well, Mr. Shoop, on this question, getting back to my brother Blackmun's question to you about that silly rule of yours on syllabus, do I take it that they (1)... those two paragraphs, they are the holdings, are they, of your Supreme Court?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,948.348,952.383,"Under syllabus law, that is initially--"
1983.83-904,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,952.383,954.418,What is syllabus law?
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,966.56,976.415,"--Initially, the limitation would be there if the syllabus can be construed to be clear and unambiguous on its face."
1983.83-904,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,976.415,978.117,All right.
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,994.377,997.745,Yes.
1983.83-904,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,999.864,1004.435,--How does that differ from what paragraph 2 says?
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1019.444,1021.21,--Yes.
1983.83-904,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1028.3,1032.268,"Well, I have some... well, it may be wrong, but that's your law apparently."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1033.618,1035.87,I think I understand our problem.
1983.83-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1140.806,1142.489,You said they are entirely different.
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1150.079,1151.429,Correct.
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.582,1160.617,"But then if he's guilty of involuntary manslaughter, he cannot be guilty of murder."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1160.617,1161.636,I disagree.
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.636,1165.604,"Well, how can he have both no mental state and the wrong mental state?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1166.388,1168.556,"Ah, now we're beginning to understand."
1983.83-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1171.075,1174.71,"On that point, you said they were mutually exclusive, did you not?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1174.71,1176.062,--That is... that is my argument.
1983.83-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1176.062,1179.347,"But if that's so, if you find that person--"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1179.347,1179.78,"No, I didn't say the--"
1983.83-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1179.78,1180.68,"--Well, you said that."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1192.588,1194.274,"--No, I did not say... I hope I did not."
1983.83-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1194.274,1198.891,"I thought you did in response to my question, that you believed that it was mutually exclusive."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1198.891,1204.962,Then I perhaps did not understand your question as to the mutual exclusive proposition.
1983.83-904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1204.962,1207.764,You don't think they're mutually exclusive.
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1207.764,1208.297,No.
1983.83-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1220.155,1221.674,"But then, if I understand you--"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1229.447,1235.267,We've never had that opportunity to present that one full litigated issue or trial.
1983.83-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1235.267,1242.837,"--So whatever the law may be with respect to matters arising under the Green case, Green v. the United States, are not at all present here."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1242.837,1245.222,We have not had one full hearing yet.
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1245.222,1248.508,"Mr. Shoop, let me go back, if I may."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1272.89,1273.726,Absolutely.
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.726,1276.694,"So we should follow you, rather than the Ohio Supreme Court."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1276.694,1280.295,I would think that I would ask the Court to accept--
1983.83-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.295,1283.497,And to disagree with what the Ohio Supreme Court said about Ohio law?
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1283.497,1285.047,--I understand.
1983.83-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1303.745,1320.171,"Now, whether you are correct or not, or whether the Ohio court is correct, what does it have to do with this case when there was a guilty plea taken on the two very minor charges, and you never got any kind of a homicide case before either a jury or the court?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1320.171,1322.139,--That is part of--
1983.83-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1322.139,1323.908,So this is really academic discussion.
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1323.908,1324.491,--Correct.
1983.83-904,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.024,1360.931,"Let me ask you, Mr. Shoop, don't you think the Ohio court would have reached exactly the same result without any regard to federal standards under your double... under your multiple count statute?"
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1381.078,1383.53,"They could, but they didn't."
1983.83-904,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.53,1384.047,"Well, I think they did."
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1384.047,1388.767,They did this through application of Blockburger.
1983.83-904,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.443,1411.364,You think that they were necessarily relying on federal principles.
1983.83-904,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1411.364,1412.114,Correct.
1983.83-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1415.834,1421.072,Mr. Purola.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1421.072,1441.134,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, obviously some portion of the Ohio syllabus rule is important in this case, and obviously, even though double jeopardy seems to be all around the case, the judgment below rests on an independent adequate state ground."
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1472.503,1474.438,Do you suggest that's binding on this Court?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1474.438,1477.14,"I suggest that it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1477.14,1490.78,"Well then, if that's correct, then a state court could decide federal questions, cases like this on federal grounds, and hide behind a syllabus rule which was silent on the grounds."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1493.832,1495.768,"Only, sir, if--"
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1495.768,1514.932,"I can assure that, speaking for one member of the Court, the Ohio syllabus rule would have no weight with me whatever when it would permit a court to hide behind... or to decide a federal question, and insulate it from review here by this specious kind of charade."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1514.932,1526.62,"--The only way they could do that, sir, would be if the syllabus was a mask, and clearly in opposite to what the controlling language in the opinion was."
1983.83-904,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1555.64,1563.246,"If you know, why does the Ohio court file an opinion?"
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1566.947,1583.576,"The Ohio jurisprudence, Your Honor, is that the opinion is to explicate the facts of the case, and the syllabus that goes with the opinion is the rule which is to be read in light of the facts of the case."
1983.83-904,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1600.788,1615.797,"Mr. Purola, as to the second paragraph of the syllabus in this case, dealing with murder and manslaughter, it just says basically that the prohibition v. double jeopardy requires the result."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1634.675,1637.311,"--Precisely, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-904,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1640.996,1641.865,Right.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1657.04,1663.378,I cannot argue that federal considerations are not present in the opinion.
1983.83-904,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1681.323,1683.275,"Well, you have two issues."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1690.095,1701.069,"--I think, however, that the Long decision requires the Court to look at the opinion, to determine if within the four corners of it there is an explication of some independent state law ground."
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.496,1728.803,What about the multiple state statute that the court referred to as implementing double jeopardy principles?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1733.707,1735.54,I think in syllabus 1--
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.54,1736.742,"Well, no; in the opinion."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1740.778,1742.23,--With regard to syllabus 2.
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.23,1742.646,Exactly.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1750.967,1753.619,"The multiple count statute is what I identified, yes."
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.769,1803.752,Under the multiple count statute.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1803.752,1804.387,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1806.121,1813.409,"But then they would be taking exclusive responsibility, were it not asking a sharing of a federal ground."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1813.409,1814.292,--Yes.
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.669,1858.021,Say that again.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1858.988,1861.473,"I used the word ""killing"", sir."
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.473,1863.925,Did he plead guilty to--
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1863.925,1866.211,He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.
1983.83-904,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1905.352,1907.788,--Even though he wasn't tried and convicted?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1907.788,1909.271,"Absolutely, sir."
1983.83-904,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1911.09,1917.81,"Of course, Brown v. Ohio involved a trial of a lesser offense."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1917.81,1921.262,In Brown I believe that--
1983.83-904,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1921.262,1924.214,"This is a good way, if you could get away with it, isn't it?"
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1929.785,1964.041,"--I am not sure I can say why the trial judge did it, but my position was at that time that at the general issue, at the arraignment, the Rule 11 proceeding, he had the absolute right to enter the statutorily authorized pleas which are, I think, identical to the federal pleas... guilty, not guilty... and only no contest requires the consent of the court, and he was able, at that time, to not have any prosecutorial participation in his plea when he entered--"
1983.83-904,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1964.041,1970.779,And why does that follow... why is the State then prevented from going ahead with a murder charge?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1970.779,1973.063,"--Well, because there is an extant conviction."
1983.83-904,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1984.454,1986.204,But not with the State's consent.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1986.204,1989.99,"Indeed, the State's consent at this stage wasn't required."
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.227,1995.694,Is there any appeal?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,1996.762,1997.746,--Yes.
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1997.746,2015.64,Could the State have taken an appeal from this rather extraordinary action of the trial judge on the question of the trial judge's authority to take the plea to a minor offense and deny the State the right to go to trial on the murder charge?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2015.64,2020.877,"I know of no Ohio practice, Your Honor, that would allow an appeal at that point on that issue."
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2038.506,2042.291,May I ask you a question about the tactics involved in this case?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2048.712,2053.515,"That's the reason, sir."
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.515,2054.799,"That's the only reason, I gather."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2054.799,2055.55,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2055.55,2057.967,"Otherwise, I assume you would have asked for a trial--"
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2088.956,2098.644,"Justice O'Connor, I don't agree, respectfully, with what I think is the underlying premise to your question."
1983.83-904,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2114.173,2129.016,"Well, the point is, the State has never been given an opportunity for even a single trial, and the defendant has been in the position of himself forcing this situation and asking for it."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2137.871,2160.868,"Well, I think that the double jeopardy clause might reach its highest point if this further trial is protected or is precluded, because it is precisely this present conviction, brought upon by this accepted final plea, that makes this case just like all others in which a prior judgment has precluded the trial."
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2168.241,2172.943,May I ask... Justice O'Connor suggested that the judge was forced to accept the plea.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2177.162,2178.296,"Without question, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-904,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2193.958,2210.468,"Mr. Purola, you say that the ultimate acceptance of the plea and judgment entered on it makes it just like our other cases where trial and conviction or conviction on a lesser offense barred conviction on a greater offense."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2217.573,2218.239,"Yes, there were."
1983.83-904,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.239,2220.775,Don't you think that's... it's factually different.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2225.577,2229.964,I don't think it's factually or legally different.
1983.83-904,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2249.826,2260.816,"Well, one difference, I suppose, is that the State did have an opportunity to proceed to contest a judgement in at least one of its count."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2260.816,2271.208,"That's correct, sir, but that is only important if somebody wants to equate the State's right to proceed with the defendant's right to be free from former jeopardy."
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.451,2313.918,Are they the same offense as murder?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2313.918,2315.237,"--Sorry, sir?"
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2315.237,2316.587,The same offense as murder?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2316.587,2317.403,No.
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2320.789,2321.724,What about my question?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2324.093,2325.726,"No, sir."
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2325.726,2327.711,"He was charged with murder here, wasn't he?"
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2327.711,2330.163,Charged with murder and involuntary manslaughter.
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2343.804,2362.301,"I inquired of your friend... and perhaps you wish to address it... is it common or usual or frequent practice of judges to do what the judge did here, accept a plea on a relatively minor charge and foreclose the right of the State to go to trial on the major charge?"
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2362.301,2365.253,"In my experience, Your Honor, I have never seen it."
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.688,2376.192,Not that you won't tender a plea again?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2376.192,2378.826,I suppose it will depend on how I do here.
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2432.645,2435.313,"If the case had gone to trial, could he have been convicted of both offenses?"
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2442.003,2443.253,--Yes.
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2443.253,2443.869,He does?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2443.869,2447.555,"In this case if it had gone to trial on all four, he could have--"
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.555,2447.99,No.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2449.34,2450.323,--Right.
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.811,2457.679,And get consecutive sentences for the two?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2457.679,2460.38,I do not believe he could get consecutive sentences.
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.903,2475.224,"You mean the jury could bring in a verdict on both, but he couldn't enter judgment on it."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2475.224,2475.774,That's right.
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.606,2504.826,It seems to me what you just said is inconsistent with what you told me a little while ago.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2511.313,2512.297,"Oh, yes."
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2522.205,2524.238,"Well, he would always ask for the lesser offense."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2526.507,2527.273,"Oh, no."
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2537.548,2530.644,Suppose they had gone to trial.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2555.692,2556.792,"Absolutely, he has that power."
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2556.792,2559.311,"Then the State would have had its day in court, wouldn't it?"
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2559.311,2561.83,Would have had its trial on this indictment.
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2563.782,2570.936,There's no doubt about the judge's power to direct a verdict on the grounds that the evidence would not support the verdict of murder.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2570.936,2574.638,"Rule 29, almost identical to the federal rule, that kind of case."
1983.83-904,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2628.105,2630.24,"It's almost instantaneous, I guess."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2630.24,2630.69,Yes.
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.607,2635.878,"Well, you've decided the whole case when you say under a final judgment."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2643.948,2644.548,Precisely.
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.5,2650.536,"Then a final judgment, wrapping up the whole case."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2650.536,2659.207,"Well, yes, but that will all depend on how... the outcome of this hearing, obviously."
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2659.207,2666.147,The State's position is that there is no valid final judgment outstanding now.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2666.147,2670.432,I don't know if the State argued that.
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2670.432,2670.899,Part of its position.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2670.899,2672.717,"I'm sorry, sir."
1983.83-904,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2672.717,2674.067,Part of its position.
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2674.067,2674.567,He's really not in prison is what he's saying.
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2677.352,2678.402,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2678.402,2680.887,"So there must be a valid judgment, I would think."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2680.887,2681.989,Three and a half years he is.
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.989,2692.112,"Let me ask you also, is there anything in the record indicating what your advice was to your client when you advised him to plead guilty?"
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2692.112,2706.454,"There is nothing in the record to that, except the arraigning judge asked us, the defendant and myself, what problems might be being created by this offer of--"
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.454,2713.008,Was there any discussion then about whether there might be a trial on the more serious offense?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2713.008,2714.044,--No.
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2719.412,2724.733,"If I were the defendant, I would wonder what's going to happen to the other count."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2724.733,2728.035,"Well, I think it was clear."
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2734.707,2736.323,You mean at the time of his plea?
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2736.323,2739.242,"--Or shortly thereafter, before trial was scheduled."
1983.83-904,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2739.242,2740.944,"Well, I know, before it."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2746.229,2747.465,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-904,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2747.465,2750.217,"You want some credit for foresight, I would think."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2763.875,2769.362,"The fundamental difference with Jeffers, however, Jeffers did three things."
1983.83-904,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2965.374,2970.862,"Mr. Purola, may I ask one other question about the situation immediately before the guilty plea was accepted?"
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,2978.016,2979.967,"I could not have prevented it, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-904,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3174.176,3181.163,"Well, it survived up until 1969 without... or '67... without ever incorporating the double jeopardy provision as v. the states."
1983.83-904,1,16772,albert_l_purola,,3181.163,3182.881,Precisely.
1983.83-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3227.21,3230.095,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Shoop?"
1983.83-904,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3230.095,3232.964,"Just a few comments, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.83-904,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3362.199,3364.432,You indicate that the State has done everything it could have done.
1983.83-904,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3374.657,3375.423,Yes.
1983.83-904,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3396.903,3403.342,"If you would have dismissed, then went to trial on murder, and you lost, you would have been through."
1983.83-904,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3403.342,3406.461,On the murder.
1983.83-904,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.246,3412.532,You would have been through entirely.
1983.83-904,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3412.532,3416.75,"Under double jeopardy, your provision is."
1983.83-904,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3416.75,3419.619,May I ask just one more question?
1983.83-904,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3419.619,3420.302,Yes.
1983.83-904,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3420.302,3431.326,"If you prevail and there's a new trial and you convict this man of murder, get a judgment for murder, would it be your view that the judgment for manslaughter would remain in effect?"
1983.83-904,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3431.326,3436.063,"Under 2941.25, no, I do not believe that it would."
1983.83-904,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3446.853,3457.977,"So it's your view, if I understand you, that you can kind of treat the manslaughter conviction as kind of a hedge and keep that in effect in the event you lose the murder trial, but if you win the murder trial, then you'll take the murder rather than the manslaughter."
1983.83-904,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3457.977,3459.013,--Yes.
1983.83-904,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3459.679,3460.296,But you can't have both.
1983.83-904,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3460.296,3464.398,--I do not believe that the courts would allow us to have both at this time.
1983.83-904,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3464.398,3467.951,"Thank you, gentlemen."
