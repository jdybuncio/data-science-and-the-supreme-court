2009.08-1008,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.587,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-1008, Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Insurance."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,9.539,27.483,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Since the inception of the Rules Enabling Act, this Court has repeatedly held that within their scope of operation, rules promulgated under that Act govern the practice and procedure of Federal courts in diversity and Federal question cases alike."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,73.881,90.308,"But this is a procedural standard that has a manifestly substantive purpose, which is to restrict recoveries of penalties."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,115.725,124.231,"--Well, to begin with, I -- I don't think that it's a substantive rule because it reflects a policy."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.359,145.31,They didn't want to have class actions.
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,145.31,148.679,"--They certainly did not want to have class actions, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,148.679,154.166,"And how is it different from Cohen v. Beneficial, the security for costs?"
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,165.206,179.866,"Well, the Cohen case I think is different in this respect, although when Cohen was decided shareholder derivative actions together with class actions were under Rule 23."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,236.654,242.308,You could say just as well here that the question isn't addressed by the Federal rules.
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,274.41,288.603,"--Well, the reason is that Rule 23 actually does address the issue, and it's the same issue that the -- that the State rule tries to address, which is whether the matters may be certified as a class."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,346.206,363.651,"This Court in its recent decisions has been sensitive to not overriding State limitations, and so has read the Federal rule to avoid the conflict."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,386.85,404.894,"Well, I would -- I would actually first go back to what the Court said in Walker, and I don't think it's -- Walker v. Armco, and I don't think it's disavowed that that the Federal rule is given its plain meaning, and when a collision is unavoidable, the Court -- the Court recognizes conflict."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.961,436.079,But there wasn't a cap on damages in Gasperini.
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,437.746,438.781,--It wasn't -- excuse me.
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,439.898,448.721,--It was that we want the courts to exercise a role in checking these damages so they won't be excessive.
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,448.721,461.629,"Well, the -- the Court in Gasperini said what it saw was a substantive principle of New York law, was that damages could not exceed reasonable compensation for the -- for the plaintiff's injuries."
2009.08-1008,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,510.878,519.817,"Under -- under your theory, are all of the statutes set forth by the Respondents in their appendices invalid in Federal court?"
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,519.817,522.785,"No, Your Honor, certainly not."
2009.08-1008,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,534.327,535.093,"Well, not half."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,535.093,537.862,"--Well, a significant number."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,572.868,602.201,"So suppose in this case the New York legislature, instead of having a statute that covered penalties generally, minimum recoveries generally, wrote into each statute, each penalty statute, each minimal recovery statute, that this suit must -- may not be brought as a class action -- instead of having an encompassing statute that covered all of them, wrote into each individual statute that limitation."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,602.201,604.803,I would agree that that presents a very different question.
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.264,643.345,"So you -- are you telling me that even if New York had provided for a specific penalty for a specific matter, the Federal court could disregard that and make it a class action, even if the State that created the right said, this is a right for an individual only?"
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,643.345,662.175,"Well, I -- again, I think that's what the best answer to that question would be, because the -- the right in a class action is still an individual right; it's simply the -- the question is simply whether multiple claims of multiple parties can be aggregated in a single action."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,668.662,682.089,"Are you saying that even if it -- then you are telling me it doesn't make any difference whether they do it across the board, as they did here, or in each penalty statute it says no class action."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,682.089,691.195,"Again, what I'm saying is it certainly may make a difference in the sense that the Court doesn't have to go nearly that far to resolve this case."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,701.483,702.4,"Well, does it or not?"
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,712.774,713.441,Yes.
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,721.98,730.82,"So you are saying that even if New York didn't use this shorthand, even if they incorporated it into each penalty statute, your answer would be the same--"
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,730.82,736.824,"--Yes, my answer would be the same, but this -- the result here doesn't turn on that answer being correct."
2009.08-1008,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,736.824,737.557,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,764.743,776.432,"I think -- I think it's procedural in the sense that it establishes -- if it establishes a right, the right it establishes is procedural and procedural rights don't override the--"
2009.08-1008,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,776.432,780.919,"Counsel, you get $100 or you don't get $100."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,786.406,797.964,--Whether you -- when -- when what determines whether you get it is the form of the action that you have brought in a Federal court and whether it has been brought aggregated with other--
2009.08-1008,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,797.964,805.534,"Then under your view, there is absolutely nothing, no law that the State could pass that would not conflict with Rule 23--"
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,805.534,806.034,--No.
2009.08-1008,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,806.034,808.486,--as it -- as with respect to class actions?
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,808.486,815.157,"I mean, one thing that the Court could do is that it could establish a cap that applied with respect to--"
2009.08-1008,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,815.157,816.073,You mean the State could do.
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,816.073,817.457,"--I'm sorry, yes."
2009.08-1008,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,840.755,844.407,"Well, it has to apply to individual actions as well?"
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,844.407,863.721,"I think -- I think if -- if the application of the -- of the statute depends on whether -- whether the action is brought as a Rule 23 action in Federal court or not, to me that's -- that is placing consequences on a procedural issue, and is not a matter of substance."
2009.08-1008,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.279,877.23,Have they applied it?
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,886.253,890.955,--I -- I actually haven't found one that applies it to actions arising under other State laws.
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,896.942,899.425,--There is no New York Court of Appeals decision to that effect?
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,899.425,900.061,--That is correct.
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,919.523,923.426,It depends upon the persuasiveness of the reasoning of the court.
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,923.426,923.992,Yes.
2009.08-1008,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.359,976.942,Can't a statute be both?
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1010.615,1013.65,"Well, a statute certainly phrased that way could do both."
2009.08-1008,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.071,1022.34,"Well, you are begging the question."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1027.577,1035.898,"--Well, the -- the question I think is -- is what basis would there be for construing it to be both?"
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1039.302,1043.853,Because the statute may put forth both a substantive policy and a procedural policy.
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1098.84,1107.779,"--Well, I -- I certainly agree that statutes of limitations are generally applied by State courts to foreign causes of action."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1126.34,1132.661,"Well, that is not altogether true, because there was always recognition that a so-called built-in statute of limitations was substantive."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1132.661,1146.154,"If -- if the right of action itself is delimited, as opposed to a statute of limitation which, you know, cuts off your ability to sue but supposedly doesn't cut off the underlying right, yes, I think that's right."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1193.866,1203.138,I thought Byrd turned on the characteristics of a Federal court and that is the judge/jury relationship.
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1203.138,1223.116,"--Well, Byrd -- Byrd turns in part on that, but it also turns on -- on the Court's view that -- that that issue, whether a case -- an issue is decided by -- by jury or judge, is -- is one that is not substantive under the Erie doctrine."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1228.704,1233.741,"Well, it wouldn't matter what the answer to that was, with the Seventh Amendment looming over that case."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1233.741,1259.391,"--Well, you know, the Court didn't decide it as a Seventh Amendment issue, and -- and because that particular question, I think, was -- was a question that arose out of a State law administrative scheme, I think it's controversial whether it -- whether the Seventh Amendment would apply, and the Court, I think, advisedly decided that as an Erie case rather than as a Seventh Amendment case."
2009.08-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1262.343,1267.462,Can I ask you one brief hypothetical?
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1267.462,1267.945,--Sure.
2009.08-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.945,1279.786,"Supposing this statute, instead of being as broad as it is, said any statute imposing penalties against insurance companies may not be brought as a class action, any claims brought under that statute?"
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1279.786,1294.529,"Justice Stevens, I think the outcome there would more clearly be the same, because, again, it would not be -- it would not be part of the -- of the New York State law definition of the right to insurance--"
2009.08-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.529,1298.564,"I thought you said that if it puts a ceiling on it, that would be -- that would be substantive rather than procedural."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1298.564,1303.801,"--Well, if -- if -- if the Court put a ceiling on rights of action under its own law--"
2009.08-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.801,1304.551,Right.
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1304.551,1308.187,"--its own State laws, that I think becomes a substantive matter."
2009.08-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.679,1326.881,"Well, you can make it a claim brought under the insurance code, instead of against insurance companies."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1326.881,1327.25,Yes.
2009.08-1008,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1366.208,1374.045,What if the basis for the restriction is the additional administrative costs of a class action?
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1384.42,1411.07,"Well, there -- that I think would be a statute that is serving a manifestly procedural interest, and if the Federal courts have not chosen in their rules to impose an administrative charge on class actions, a State law that purported to do so would -- would not -- not have any application to Federal procedure."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1438.571,1440.673,How is it different from security for costs?
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1448.993,1469.007,"--Well, the -- the -- as I understand the Court's reasoning in Cohen, the security was -- was not just for the cost of the action, but for the plaintiff's liability to the corporation that was created under State law in the case of an unsuccessful derivative action."
2009.08-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1506.365,1512.369,"Without the bond, the remedy would be -- I don't -- this is a plaintiff that had to put up security for costs."
2009.08-1008,0,41826,scott_l_nelson,,1512.369,1524.76,"--Right, and -- but -- but the remedy I'm referring to is the defendant's right to recover damages from the plaintiff under State law if a derivative action was unsuccessful."
2009.08-1008,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1551.578,1552.344,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1566.57,1592.602,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As some of Justice Ginsburg's initial questions point out, this case falls within the heartland of Erie because allowing plaintiffs to recover State law penalties in Federal court that they can't recover in State court on a State law cause of action would powerfully distort ex ante forum choices, which is precisely what the Erie doctrine seeks to avoid."
2009.08-1008,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1592.602,1605.529,"But isn't Rule 23 a judgment by Congress that class actions that meet the criteria of Rule 23 are fair and efficient, correct?"
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1607.346,1608.73,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-1008,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1608.73,1621.888,"Under your theory, any State could pass a law that says no cause of action under State law can be brought as a class action ever."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1625.673,1627.223,"Two points, Your Honor."
2009.08-1008,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1672.918,1674.085,You haven't quite answered my question.
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1674.085,1675.204,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1008,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1675.204,1685.16,"Your State can come in and say, no State cause of action will ever be subject to class treatment."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1689.63,1694.665,"Well, Your Honor, if the State is talking about its own State law causes of action, the State is the master."
2009.08-1008,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1701.187,1701.904,No.
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1719.316,1731.291,"--Well, Your Honor, it could be, if a State said that no State cause of action could be brought as a class action, that that -- you have to look at what the State was doing in making that rule."
2009.08-1008,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1732.074,1732.774,Just what it's doing here.
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1749.435,1757.874,"--Well, Your Honor, no, because the policy choice here is a substantive policy choice to limit penalties from being distorted in a class action case."
2009.08-1008,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1757.874,1758.374,It's a policy choice.
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1758.374,1768.814,"Well, if the -- if the State, Your Honor, makes a policy choice, it is a substantive policy choice, as I believe -- your hypothetical, at some points, was talking about what sounded like a substantive policy choice."
2009.08-1008,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1783.056,1783.675,So you have answered my question.
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1787.043,1788.077,--A State--
2009.08-1008,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1788.077,1795.747,"And -- and a Federal court, sitting in diversity, could never aggregate those claims, those State law claims?"
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1795.747,1797.283,"--For State law claims, yes."
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1821.964,1837.241,"Counsel, do I -- do I understand your response to turn on -- let's say the State, for example, limits class actions because it doesn't want vast exposure under the penalty provisions that you could get in a class action."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1852.417,1854.519,"Well, the Erie -- you could, Your Honor."
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1861.639,1862.891,How do you -- how do you tell?
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1862.891,1864.827,"--Well, Your Honor, it's not always easy."
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1877.318,1887.257,"I suppose it's pertinent, then, whether they do it, as I think you were -- was discussed earlier, on an across-the-board basis or on an individual basis?"
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1887.257,1894.346,"--I think that's something that one could look at, as part of determining how -- what is the design and operation in State court."
2009.08-1008,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1932.42,1935.304,"Counsel, how can you say that?"
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,1954.885,1962.674,"We are -- we disagree -- I mean, what the court did in Rudgayzer -- they did not say, this applies broadly to all New York -- to all Federal causes of action."
2009.08-1008,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2036.687,2053.13,"Suppose the reason -- suppose the reason that they did that -- suppose they are very honest about their reasons, and they say, we think class actions are very often a very good thing, because a lot of people who are hurt can get some recovery and it acts as a deterrent."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2087.953,2090.155,"I think that's exactly what they did here, Your Honor."
2009.08-1008,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.155,2098.392,"All right, if that's exactly what we did, why isn't that second-guessing the judgment of the rule that they are saying it is efficient -- an inefficient procedure."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2108.533,2115.62,"I'm sorry, to the extent -- the hypothetical I thought you were saying, they were recognizing that it would be overdeterrence--"
2009.08-1008,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2115.62,2139.736,"Overdeterrence because they feel that the class action procedure is one that leads to forcing companies to settle, and to that extent the class action procedure does not lead to the efficient determination of disputes but to the inefficient and unjust determination."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2141.385,2141.868,"--Right, Your Honor."
2009.08-1008,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2149.388,2149.922,"No, it does."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2152.974,2153.926,"Well, I think--"
2009.08-1008,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2153.926,2156.628,It's the judicial process and its expanse--
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2156.628,2156.978,--I think--
2009.08-1008,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.978,2161.746,--that forces the settlements that create unjust results.
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2161.746,2164.198,"--Right, but I think there they are looking at the unjust results."
2009.08-1008,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.484,2178.642,"That may be, and suppose they said, you know, a 30-day period for appeal creates unjust results in our opinion, and therefore we think it is more efficient to have a 90-day appeal period."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2180.994,2182.01,"--No, because then you would--"
2009.08-1008,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.01,2182.61,So how is this different?
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2182.61,2184.779,"--Because then you would have a clear Hanna problem, Your Honor."
2009.08-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2241.949,2247.119,"Yes, well, let me be -- I just say I want -- I want to be sure I understood your answer to Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2262.296,2263.981,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.424,2290.112,And that would -- that would apply not only to statutory causes of action but causes of action based on New York common law.
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2290.112,2290.612,--Right.
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2314.045,2314.645,But I guess--
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2314.645,2315.295,--under Erie.
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2315.295,2329.154,--But -- but wouldn't Justice Stevens's hypothetical suggest that they were less concerned about the impact of -- of the class action procedure than they were about its procedural efficiency?
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2343.564,2344.08,Right.
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2344.08,2351.753,"--but it's not appropriate to say, we don't like the class action procedure as a general matter."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2351.753,2352.17,Right.
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2352.17,2357.538,"And in Justice Stevens's hypothetical, it applied across the board, which would cause me, anyway, to think it was the latter."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2357.538,2358.924,I would agree with Your Honor.
2009.08-1008,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.131,2373.333,"It has to be one or the other, though."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2392.794,2395.43,"No, Your Honor -- again, I think they can blend."
2009.08-1008,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2431.955,2447.714,New York doesn't have -- as the -- the question that Justice Sotomayor asked and that Justice Stevens asked -- doesn't have any anti-class action as a procedural policy.
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2472.246,2473.046,"--Precisely, Your Honor."
2009.08-1008,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2516.675,2548.913,"One -- one question that was raised by the other side is, well, if you're saying this kind of restriction -- restriction on class action -- applies in a diversity case, why not a State that says we love class actions and we want class actions to be -- not to be hemmed in by all of the Rule 23 requirements?"
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2548.913,2558.971,"--Then, Your Honor, you would have a Hanna issue because Rule 23 does set forth the criteria for a Federal court to certify a class."
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2613.772,2619.009,"Well, it -- it only reflects a substantive choice -- if it is a substantive choice."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2639.173,2652.897,"Well, Your Honor, I think what you can -- you can assume that, if they are not changing their criteria and not changing the rules governing all class actions, but singling out particular causes of action or particular penalties, that it's done for a substantive reason."
2009.08-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.747,2732.432,Let me just be sure I am not lost on one point.
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2742.657,2743.973,"--New York law, Your Honor."
2009.08-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.757,2746.742,"The language doesn't limit it that way, does it?"
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2746.742,2753.229,"--You are right, Your Honor, but, again, you read language against certain background assumptions and norms that States when they're--"
2009.08-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2753.229,2760.05,"Well, let me ask you this question: Supposing it did apply to statutory cause of actions created by New Mexico law?"
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2760.05,2762.752,"--You know, and the truth is, Your Honor, I think it still wouldn't matter at the end of the day."
2009.08-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.427,2785.015,"But it seems to me that your position basically is that New York can decide what kinds of cases shall be brought as class actions, period."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2785.015,2791.169,"Well, Your Honor, if New York decides, for substantive reasons -- and we are talking about New York causes of action--"
2009.08-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.169,2791.535,"Well, whatever the reason--"
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2791.535,2792.035,--Okay.
2009.08-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2792.035,2793.002,--for some good reason.
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2793.002,2793.335,Right.
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2801.791,2804.227,But the question is New Mexico causes of action.
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2811.23,2816.967,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that would raise some interesting questions about New York's power to--"
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2816.967,2823.288,"What it would do, it seems to me, is make it clear that was not a substantive decision, but, instead, a procedural decision."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2823.288,2823.773,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1008,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2826.342,2831.127,"But it could be -- it could be, as I -- the example of the statute of limitations."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2864.8,2865.35,--Absolutely.
2009.08-1008,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2865.35,2877.108,"New York might well say, look, we don't hear in New York penalty cases, and so we are not going to entertain the sister State claim for any -- when we wouldn't entertain our own."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2886.213,2888.332,And I think the point -- I agree 100 percent.
2009.08-1008,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2926.339,2947.454,"Well, they -- they bring up the Class Action Fairness Act, which allows a plaintiff -- they allow a defendant to remove a class action from a State court to a Federal court, but they also allow a plaintiff to initiate an action in the Federal court."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,2947.454,2959.179,"That's correct, Your Honor, but the Class Action Fairness Act, on its face -- and the legislative history actually makes this point explicit -- it had no intention to change the operation of the Erie doctrine in class actions."
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3129.455,3131.306,"Thank you, Mr. Landau."
2009.08-1008,1,19410,christopher_landau,,3131.306,3133.842,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
2009.08-1008,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3133.842,3135.908,"Mr. Nelson, you have 4 minutes remaining."
2009.08-1008,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,3135.908,3137.96,Thank you.
2009.08-1008,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3174.317,3184.125,"There -- when you are dealing with a Federal statute, there's a -- there's a factor that doesn't come up when you are dealing with sister States, and that is the Supremacy Clause."
2009.08-1008,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,3198.783,3200.435,--I think that's right.
2009.08-1008,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3242.545,3249.234,--I can't see how that's so when they limit just a particular remedy or penalty.
2009.08-1008,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,3269.029,3273.349,"--Well, but that's an aspect of -- of the fairness and efficiency of proceedings."
2009.08-1008,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3333.805,3338.541,"But it didn't say that about Rule 59, and it didn't say that about Rule 41(b)."
2009.08-1008,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,3338.541,3352.718,"--And -- and Rule 59 doesn't occupy the territory of the standard to be applied, and Rule 41(b) as construed in Semtek just does not address preclusive effect."
2009.08-1008,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3404.318,3405.218,"You can finish your thought, if you like."
2009.08-1008,2,41826,scott_l_nelson,,3405.218,3417.859,"--Well, the thought is that that's an indication that amenability to class actions should be treated both for plaintiffs and for defendants as a matter of procedural right governed by the Federal rules."
2009.08-1008,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3418.326,3418.959,"Thank you, counsel."
