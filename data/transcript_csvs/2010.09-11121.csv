2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.11,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-11121, J.D.B. v. North Carolina."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,8.808,11.922,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,67.078,73.194,"Ms. Blackman, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not clear on what you are proposing."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,98.72,99.542,Justice--
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,99.542,113.083,"--or do we just say, you know, what would a minor -- I don't know, a general minor regard as restrictions upon his departure?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,113.083,123.448,"--Justice Scalia, what we are proposing is that the test be a court may consider age in determining whether a reasonable person in the juvenile--"
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.448,124.103,I understand that.
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,124.103,125.005,--So we are not--
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.005,129.098,"So you mean 15, 14, 13, 13 1/2?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,129.69,140.332,"--We did not suggest that it be calibrated by age, although in State court jurisdictions many of them are and are not finding that a difficult test to perform."
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,140.332,143.523,"It's not -- if not calibrated by age, how is it to be calibrated?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,143.523,151.352,It is to be the exercise of reasonable judgment by the judge taking into account common sense--
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,151.352,152.426,Common sense?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,152.426,153.58,--community experience is one.
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.58,166.063,"And -- and -- and how -- how is the law enforcement officer going into the confrontation going to know whether a judge is going to be applying a 15-year-old rule, a 13-year-old rule, or whatever?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,166.063,173.768,Clearly in the jurisdiction in which he practices he should be aware of the fact that a court utilizes that type of--
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.768,174.654,Do you think that's clear?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,174.654,177.205,--But we're not suggesting that that be done.
2010.09-11121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.151,183.711,Why isn't this all subsumed under the voluntariness rule?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,183.711,192.691,"--As this Court has frequently recognized, the voluntariness inquiry is more difficult for courts to perform than the Miranda custody one."
2010.09-11121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,195.633,200.287,"Well, at least it's the court performing it, not the interrogating officer, as Justice Scalia's questions point out."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,200.287,205.624,"--The police officer plays a role in the voluntariness, also."
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.673,225.156,"What about mental deficiency, if -- if age should be one of the factors, deciding whether the individual regarded himself as in custody or not, why shouldn't mental deficiency be so as well?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,245.758,246.616,--No.
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,246.616,247.131,No?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,250.366,267.749,"Age is different because, number one, it involves restrictions on freedom of movement, so the circumstances of the interrogation are going to be understood and interpreted differently by a child than it would be by an adult."
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,277.4,280.014,You could say both of those things about the mentally deficient.
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,286.876,300.124,"As far as I know, there hasn't been the recognition in the law that there is, as to children, that proves such as the mentally handicapped are unable to--"
2010.09-11121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,300.124,308.23,"Well, what about this test which comes from three cases, the first being Berkemer, the second Stansbury, and the third I'll tell you in a second?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,379.042,384.925,"--Well, we're simply making the point that there's not necessarily going to be a floodgate opening."
2010.09-11121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,386.173,396.304,"No, no, but I mean what Justice Scalia was really asking is, do you favor something like this test that I read, which is open as to circumstance?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,410.481,413.344,--Conceptually absolutely.
2010.09-11121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,413.344,413.625,Thank you.
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.781,424.567,"Even -- even if you said no, you're pushing us there, because there's no basis for treating a childhood any differently from these other factors."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,459.412,471.707,"Your Honor, what we are talking about are a complex of characteristics which are unique to children, and that's what we are examining in this case."
2010.09-11121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.707,476.264,"Ms. Blackman, what is complex about a juvenile investigator?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,515.095,517.291,I agree completely.
2010.09-11121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,537.601,542.784,And then is it your point that he has to do something more than the read the standard Miranda warning?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,546.019,550.766,Obviously his age would factor into whether there was a valid waiver.
2010.09-11121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,555.53,558.954,"Well, but doesn't it follow from there that we have to have a -- we have to change the warning?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,558.954,560.666,--Not necessarily.
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,575.67,580.184,Are you asking trial judges to make -- to do something that is realistic?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,603.746,605.412,Your Honor--
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,605.412,607.374,You think a trial judge can really do that?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,607.374,616.76,"--State courts have been performing this analysis now for several decades, and they haven't indicated that they have difficulty doing so."
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,618.61,620.274,They must have greater imaginative powers then.
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,620.274,621.52,--What?
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,621.52,626.33,They must have greater imaginative powers than I think I would have under those circumstances.
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,626.33,629.537,Part of your question--
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,629.537,636.616,"When you take a particular set of circumstances, and the judge would say, if I were 13, I would not understand that I could go."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,639.714,641.738,--Your Honor--
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,641.738,642.937,Can you slice it like that?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,642.937,648.133,--What we are talking about here is relative youngness and relative oldness.
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.821,660.523,We need empirical data for that?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,660.523,661.627,--Excuse me?
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.627,664.505,We need empirical data for that?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,664.505,665.999,Empirical data does exist.
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.999,666.62,To show that--
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,666.62,667.306,I'm simply pointing that out.
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.306,672.425,"--the closer to adulthood a child is, the more like an adult he is?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,673.938,678.062,I'm simply pointing out that the empirical data supports that.
2010.09-11121,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,679.666,701.499,"Do we need either imaginative powers or empirical data to know that when a 13-year-old is brought into a room in his school, taken out of class, four people are there, two are police officers, one is assistant principal, threatened with custody, that that person is not going to feel free to take off and leave?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,701.499,702.853,--We do not.
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,715.77,717.232,"Well, sympathetic cases can make bad law."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,733.793,741.899,"--A judge should be able to consider that, and under the clear circumstances of this case, it is unlikely that a--"
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.899,756.012,"When the policeman sees him, he's dressed in baggy jeans, you know, down around his thighs, and when the judge sees him he's wearing a Buster Brown jumper suit."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,760.355,766.285,--I'm not sure I understood the question.
2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,767.951,772.198,The whole point--
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,772.198,772.604,Yes.
2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,772.604,781.445,"--The whole point of the Miranda rule, I thought, was to provide clear, objective guidelines about what the police are supposed to do."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,829.179,833.412,It doesn't change the rule itself.
2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,856.443,876.705,"Would it be -- is it enough if the officers in this situation said, look, you're free to leave, you know, whenever you want, but -- and then goes on -- or do they have to think -- now, maybe -- maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't think that's true, or maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't feel that he can leave if he's got the vice principal there and they want to talk."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,876.705,887.788,"I mean, that is an objective circumstance that occurs in the course of an interrogation which is very weighty in determining if custody occurs."
2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,889.22,895.816,"I'm thinking it would not even be enough if they told the 13-year-old, look, you can leave, but I want to ask you some questions."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,902.074,917.838,"--It involves all of the circumstances which are arising during the course of these interrogations, but certainly advising someone that they are free to leave and advising them that they are free not to answer questions is almost half of the Miranda warning, and it is giving the child--"
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.838,919.707,What if the parent tells them not to leave?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,927.427,934.367,"--Whether that would factor in depends, I think, upon whether they're acting as an agent of the police, because what we're looking at is--"
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.367,934.726,"No, no."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,936.716,939.442,--Oh.
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.444,951.454,Are you answering my question?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,951.454,952.624,"--No, I'm not."
2010.09-11121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,966.239,970.939,Would be one relevant factor that would be considered was that nobody called the parents?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,970.939,976.619,"It is relevant in this situation, because -- by North Carolina law."
2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,982.783,984.542,How is that relevant to the Miranda inquiry?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,993.972,1001.286,What I understood the question was: Was it relevant that a parent was not contacted?
2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1009.767,1010.766,Independent of what?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1010.766,1012.681,--Independent of Miranda.
2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1012.681,1013.445,"Well, right."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1014.409,1027.282,But that is an additional reason why police officers need to be aware of what the age is of a child that they are interrogating because of independent obligations arising out of State statutes.
2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1027.282,1034.425,"So is your answer to Justice Ginsburg that, no, the fact that a parent was not notified is not relevant to the Miranda question?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1038.955,1045.301,"No, I believe it remains relevant to the Miranda question, because--"
2010.09-11121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1045.301,1049.846,The question really is if he is in custody.
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1060.508,1062.25,--That is correct.
2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1062.25,1065.442,"Oh, so it's not just that they have to call the parent; they have to wait for the parent to show up?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1065.442,1070.685,"Because of State statutory requirements, here they were."
2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1078.792,1084.785,That's not -- that's not pertinent to the Federal law question on the Miranda warnings.
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1084.785,1093.128,"I understand that, but I'm just explaining that independent bases may arise for which an officer has to be aware of the age."
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1101.063,1104.738,What if the age of the person being questioned is unclear?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1104.738,1119.102,"If the interrogation is occurring under circumstances where the officer should have known, then I think the burden remains with the officer to consider this, and that could arise from--"
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1119.102,1128.281,"Suppose -- suppose the person shows an ID and it shows the person is 19 years old, and the officer looks at him and says, he looks like a pretty young 19-year-old?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1128.281,1141.264,"--If there is no way to verify the information that the child is giving, then the officer accepts the ID as being the age of the person he is interrogating."
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1141.264,1148.903,"What if -- I mean, under my example, what if the child -- what if the person looks like a minor but has an adult ID?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1148.903,1150.694,I think that if--
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1150.694,1152.997,Does the officer have an obligation to look behind that?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1152.997,1154.024,--Um--
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1154.024,1155.284,Or the other way around?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1162.037,1169.757,--The officer has to proceed on the basis of his observations.
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.11,1184.635,Is there a good faith--
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1184.635,1197.536,"But if there -- if there is no reasonable basis upon which the officer could discern that this is a child, if he has no reason to know, then the rule that we are asking to be put into effect would not apply."
2010.09-11121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.536,1200.088,--Does a good faith mistake make it okay?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1210.27,1210.595,Yes.
2010.09-11121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1224.322,1246.218,"The way you phrase the question, you say, may the trial -- whether trial courts may consider the juvenile's age in Miranda to make the in-custody Miranda determination."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1258.775,1262.061,"No, it is must."
2010.09-11121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1282.916,1283.817,So--
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1283.817,1285.249,--in determining if there's custody.
2010.09-11121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1285.249,1304.702,"--are you saying, going back to the hypotheticals that some of my colleagues posed, police officer comes across an individual, looks older or looks younger, doesn't know, and just engages that person and says come over here and let's talk for a second."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1308.281,1311.971,"It's a simple enough matter, but no."
2010.09-11121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1313.2,1314.027,So if they're not required--
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1314.027,1318.43,"--as a Terry stop, where Miranda is not coming into play at all--"
2010.09-11121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1318.43,1323.221,"--Perhaps not, but it's -- if it's outside a school, school corner."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1335.564,1345.119,"--We're not in a custodial interrogation setting, I think in your question, and so Miranda is not coming into play at all, but I mean, this is a matter--"
2010.09-11121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1345.119,1349.601,"It is, because it's a stop with no reasonable suspicion."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1358.659,1369.91,"--If there is a custodial -- if we have restraint on freedom of movement which is rising to the degree of a formal arrest, it's a simple enough matter to ask."
2010.09-11121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1369.91,1381.457,"So why don't we go back to the test that Justice Breyer suggested, which would answer many of the hypotheticals here, that the objective fact is what is known to both?"
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1381.457,1382.811,What is known to both.
2010.09-11121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1382.811,1399.792,"That way you don't get into what the 13-year-old is thinking inside himself or not, because that then becomes subjective; you don't go back to what others might think are special characteristics or subjective characteristics."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1404.618,1405.129,Yes.
2010.09-11121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1419.368,1420.445,"I think that's clear, but that's different."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1426.327,1426.717,--Indeed.
2010.09-11121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1426.717,1442.387,"And I'm hard pressed to think that anyone would believe that if you took a 9-year-old out of his classroom and the assistant principal walked him into a room and said these guys want to talk to you, that that 9-year-old would think he's free to leave."
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1442.387,1443.804,I agree.
2010.09-11121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1443.804,1444.424,Right.
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1449.109,1451.04,Correct.
2010.09-11121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1466.85,1473.714,I guess part of my problem is it's just in some respects hard to put the Miranda in the context of a -- let's say a 13-year-old alone.
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1492.56,1505.324,"--Well, Miranda is the only procedure to date that anyone uses, and constitutionally they are -- everyone is entitled to some advisement so that they can make an informed choice."
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1522.695,1525.029,--Could I go back to an earlier question?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1541.261,1565.338,"I think that one's status as an inmate, for example, can be characterized as objective, and certainly that has been taken into account because inmates share that same baseline restriction on freedom of movement that children do, and so this court in -- Shafter -- for example, characterized it as what would the reasonable person in the inmate's position have understood as to his freedom of movement."
2010.09-11121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1571.642,1572.048,But what are they?
2010.09-11121,0,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,1583.298,1608.074,"--I think that's for other litigants to press upon this Court upon proper records with input from experts as to whether it relates to the special susceptibilities of children, how cognitively different they are which is affecting their perception and judgment of what's going on about them, and those are questions for another day."
2010.09-11121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1611.499,1612.51,"Thank you, counsel."

2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1653.736,1654.422,You would add none?
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1658.577,1661.114,--This Court has not said--
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1661.114,1661.816,"Well, I mean here."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1661.816,1662.889,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1662.889,1666.933,"There's a big sign jail cell, the door is unlocked."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1670.421,1675.368,"Well, Your Honor, I think you have to look at the obvious circumstances."
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1675.368,1675.946,Is he in custody?
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1683.119,1684.086,"I think he may be, Your Honor."
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1684.086,1685.066,"Yeah, so do I."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1685.066,1686.092,If that's how you want--
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1686.092,1687.199,I'll just tell you one other circumstance.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1687.199,1687.418,--Yes.
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1687.418,1688.476,He only speaks Spanish.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1688.476,1691.557,"Well, Your Honor, I think it affects--"
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.557,1693.363,Ukrainian is the only thing he speaks.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1695.493,1697.92,"--Your Honor, I am willing to take that into account."
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1697.92,1698.232,Thank you.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1706.342,1708.097,I am willing to take that into account.
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1708.097,1708.347,Okay.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1746.227,1749.949,"Your Honor, because those are obvious circumstances that everyone agrees--"
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1749.949,1752.811,"And it's obvious whether he's 8-year-old or 2 2, too."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1753.325,1760.485,"--The problem is, Your Honor, you have to think like an 8-year-old or think like a 15-year-old in order to determine the situation."
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1760.485,1760.902,Right.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1770.179,1771.064,I think the difference--
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1771.064,1772.855,What is exactly the -- the difference?
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1772.855,1777.665,--The difference is with the Ukrainian is that you look at whether the knowledge was actually acquired.
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1798.723,1799.124,I haven't said that.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1832.366,1833.739,I think--
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1833.739,1834.235,That's all.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1834.875,1837.005,"--I think that's right, Your Honor, and age--"
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.005,1838.206,"Well, if it's right, then you--"
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1838.206,1849.984,"--Well, no, age is an objective fact, but what -- what they're asking us to do is to use age in a way where you're having to figure out what a -- what that person would think."
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1867.078,1872.602,"--You know the sentence I'm referring to in my dissent, presumably?"
2010.09-11121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.132,1879.215,Some people don't -- some people don't read the sentence.
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1882.799,1885.007,I'm -- I live always in hope.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1885.007,1886.236,I'm aware of it.
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.854,1896.554,"Well, I mean, the thing about known to both and relevant to a likely belief as to whether he's in custody or not."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1900.865,1902.344,"I'm willing to accept that, Your Honor."
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1902.344,1902.796,Fine.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1902.796,1903.619,I am.
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1903.619,1904.134,"Well, then, perfect."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1904.134,1908.148,But I don't think it includes age in the way they want to use it in this particular situation.
2010.09-11121,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1908.148,1911.558,What do you mean by use it in this situation?
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,1948.969,1968.221,"Well, Your Honor, the officer may not know the age, but if he does, in this situation he did, and -- and if the officer is in a middle school, there is still a problem with having to figure out what his actions and how they -- what they are and how they affect a juvenile of a particular age."
2010.09-11121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.954,2033.695,"He probably couldn't leave the classroom, either, could he, the classroom where he was studying?"
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2033.695,2035.501,"Your Honor, he probably could not."
2010.09-11121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.501,2045.789,So the -- the additional coercive effect of not being able to leave probably didn't make a whole lot of difference.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2060.059,2062.536,"Well, I think that's right, Your Honor."
2010.09-11121,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2064.931,2073.116,"And we look at what is the normal school setting just like we looked at the normal business settings, he's in class, all the children are around him."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2099.066,2104.355,"--Well, Your Honor, I think feeling free to leave somewhere is not the entire test for custody."
2010.09-11121,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2111.56,2124.602,"But you say associated with a reasonable man, and when we construct the reasonable man, you're asking me to think of a 25-year-old sitting in a seventh grade social -- social studies class."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2124.602,2126.829,"--Well, Your Honor, I think a reasonable--"
2010.09-11121,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2126.829,2128.355,That's a little hard for me to imagine.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2128.355,2137.971,"--Well, a -- a reasonable person is one of ordinary reason and intelligence who knows what custody looks like, essentially, and is informed by 45 years of case law."
2010.09-11121,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2151.386,2162.138,"Excuse me, haven't we repeatedly said that it's going to be very difficult for a defendant to show that his confession wasn't involuntary if there was no Miranda violation?"
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2180.55,2188.47,"--Well, Your Honor, I agree with that, but the voluntariness test was complex because you did consider so many factors."
2010.09-11121,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2198.433,2199.475,That doesn't answer my question.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2225.917,2238.599,"--Well, Your Honor, in -- in voluntariness, you don't necessarily have to have custody to prove that a statement is involuntary, and of children who are particularly young, that will come into play significantly."
2010.09-11121,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2243.954,2254.846,"So are you happy with the rule that says, no, not in the objective Miranda test, but, yes, age should be elevated as a prime consideration in the voluntariness test?"
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2254.846,2268.621,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think it is already a significant factor in the voluntariness test, and I think particularly for young children, I think you're going to see that continue to occur."
2010.09-11121,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2268.621,2276.401,"General Cooper, I'm not sure how I understand or that I understand how this would be turning Miranda upside down."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2316.819,2327.867,"Justice Kagan, admittedly sometimes Miranda has gray areas, because you do look at a combination of factors, but it's informed with 45 years of case law."
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.499,2349.951,Why?
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2372.176,2373.156,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2373.156,2374.477,What is the answer to that question?
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2374.477,2375.475,--You over Mirandize.
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2376.442,2377.284,"Oh, well, you over Mirandize."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2404.471,2405.373,Your Honor--
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2405.373,2408.111,"Now, what happens to destroy the criminal justice system?"
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2411.505,2412.922,--A lot.
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2440.343,2448.327,"Why not the first thing, hey, kid, we're here talking, but you want to leave, just open the door and leave."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2453.758,2455.532,"Well, he may not want him to go, number one."
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.532,2458.646,"Oh, oh, oh, I see, I see."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2458.954,2461.727,"Well, you know, you want to talk -- you want to talk to the kid."
2010.09-11121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2471.079,2472.046,He's not free to leave?
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2473.676,2477.102,"Well, no, because that's a Berkemer situation, a traffic stop."
2010.09-11121,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2477.788,2485.474,"--For search purposes, is age consciousness required?"
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2531.229,2541.205,"--Well, Your Honor, I think when you're dealing with voluntariness, when you're dealing with consent to search, when you're dealing with waiver, you're looking at the particular juvenile."
2010.09-11121,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2546.838,2550.278,I thought all the police officer was looking at when he said
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2557.047,2558.264,"--Well, it might--"
2010.09-11121,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2558.264,2560.254,He's under the age of consent.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2560.254,2564.161,"--It might have been, in this circumstance, that he didn't own the house."
2010.09-11121,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2568.625,2570.044,He can't consent to a contract.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2570.743,2572.799,"--And, Your Honor, you are right."
2010.09-11121,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2618.57,2626.115,"Counsel, do you agree with the solicitor general's view that a blind person should be treated as a blind person for -- for these purposes?"
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2626.115,2628.451,"--I think I do, Your Honor, because--"
2010.09-11121,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2628.451,2631.221,And a deaf person should be treated as a deaf person for these purposes?
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2631.221,2634.487,--It's an obvious external circumstance.
2010.09-11121,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2634.487,2635.299,As is youth.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2640.79,2644.013,But you don't have to get into the mind of the blind person or the deaf person.
2010.09-11121,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2649.896,2651.594,"You know, I don't agree with that."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2661.38,2665.957,"--Well, Your Honor, I think it's different because it has to do with something that is obvious."
2010.09-11121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2685.317,2688.555,The blind person doesn't have a different mind.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2688.555,2689.612,That's correct.
2010.09-11121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.612,2691.543,The deaf person doesn't have a different mind.
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2710.495,2714.809,"I think you're absolutely -- absolutely right, and yes, too, Your Honor."
2010.09-11121,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2749.388,2767.474,"If the law goes down that route, then one of the chief advantages of the Miranda rule, which is that it's a relatively simple objective test, is eliminated, and the law of Miranda begins to resemble the law of voluntariness."
2010.09-11121,1,38914,roy_cooper,,2774.912,2777.804,"We support Miranda, Your Honor."
2010.09-11121,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2793.556,2795.5,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2809.04,2811.561,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-11121,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2828.089,2828.651,I'm sorry.
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2832.744,2858.638,"--The only statements that are going to be suppressed under Petitioner's rule that would take age into account that aren't already going to be suppressed under existing constitutional doctrines are statements that, first of all, the prosecution has carried its burden to prove are voluntary under a voluntariness test that already takes age into account, and second of all, are given under circumstances that don't otherwise meet the definition of custody; that is, formal arrest or its functional equivalent."
2010.09-11121,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2869.362,2870.017,Why?
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2900.133,2918.359,"Well, Your Honor, I think the critical difference between blindness, deafness, and other sensory disabilities and age is what Justice Scalia said a few minutes ago, which is, in the case of a blind or deaf person, you can try to figure out what the circumstances surrounding the interrogation that are observable to that person are, and then--"
2010.09-11121,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2918.359,2919.912,But that's all we're doing with the young person.
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2945.124,2956.332,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think you're doing the same thing, and I think it's easier to put yourself in the mindset of a person with a sensory deprivation than a person of a particular age, and let me explain why."
2010.09-11121,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3021.336,3023.345,Limit it to when the age is known.
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3058.767,3063.046,"Well, Your Honor, I think there are sort of two parts to your question."
2010.09-11121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.76,3108.224,"The officer doesn't have to think like a 13-year-old, he has to think the way a 60-year-old judge would think a 13-year-old thought, right?"
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3109.191,3112.676,"That's right, Your Honor, and it may depend what -- which particular 60-year-old judge--"
2010.09-11121,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3112.676,3115.558,"But that isn't -- to me, anyway, that is not the question."
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3141.219,3152.193,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that the main problem here is that it's going to create more confusion for officers because it's another factor they have to put into the test, and it's--"
2010.09-11121,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3152.193,3152.438,What's the--
2010.09-11121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3152.438,3154.323,Why don't we require Miranda always?
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3154.323,3155.615,--The courts--
2010.09-11121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3155.615,3158.276,Is there any harm in requiring it always?
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3163.971,3173.076,"--I think it's very unrealistic that every time an officer opens their mouth they have to give Miranda warnings, and I think it would fundamentally change the nature of police interactions with the public."
2010.09-11121,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3188.64,3189.48,Mr. Feigin--
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3189.48,3190.026,And there's no reason to--
2010.09-11121,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3190.026,3190.615,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3190.615,3191.645,--Please.
2010.09-11121,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3191.645,3198.912,"Do you think that a 00 a person with Down's syndrome, that that should be taken into account in this inquiry?"
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3198.912,3202.271,"I'm not sure how that would be taken into account, Your Honor."
2010.09-11121,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3221.445,3223.735,So how is that different than blindness or hearing?
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3235.653,3237.335,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2010.09-11121,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3237.335,3244.305,"They barely look at you, they barely -- you know, there are characteristics that show you a lack of absorption of information."
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3244.305,3267.326,"--Your Honor, I may have difficulty dealing with this particular hypothetical because of my lack of knowledge of the particular symptoms of Down's syndrome; but if you're dealing with a suspect who simply can't absorb information about the world, then that's going to be a sensory deprivation that's going to be taken into account, because it's going to subtract circumstances away that that suspect can't perceive."
2010.09-11121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3306.577,3318.452,"We don't want Miranda warnings to be given where they are unnecessary because they are only necessary to prevent coercion, and where there's no coercion, we want confessions, don't we?"
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3322.077,3323.306,"That's right, Your Honor."
2010.09-11121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3323.306,3324.288,Isn't that the basic reason?
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3324.288,3325.113,"That's right, Your Honor, and--"
2010.09-11121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3325.113,3328.709,So it's not cost-free to require Miranda warnings.
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3328.709,3329.501,--That's right--
2010.09-11121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3329.501,3333.842,"It's a good thing to have the bad guys confess that they're bad guys, right?"
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3333.842,3336.597,"--That's right, Your Honor, that's what I was trying to say earlier."
2010.09-11121,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3336.597,3353.5,"--Before you -- you are so quick to answer that's right, isn't it so that the manual that this very officer was given to use said before you question a child, give Miranda warnings?"
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3353.5,3355.15,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
2010.09-11121,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3355.15,3362.851,"Apparently the people who train these juvenile officers think it's a good thing, not a bad thing to give a Miranda warning."
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3362.851,3392.905,"Well, one reason they may think it's a good thing and one reason I think the Court doesn't need to accept Petitioner's rule here, is that officers often will give Miranda warnings, for precisely the reasons Justice Sotomayor was suggesting earlier, which is that when officers do give Miranda warnings, it's going to be -- and those Miranda -- the Miranda procedures are all validly followed, there's not going to be a real robust voluntariness inquiry because in most cases where the Miranda procedures are followed, the statements are going to be found to be voluntary under the voluntariness test."
2010.09-11121,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3411.735,3412.59,Finish your sentence.
2010.09-11121,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3412.59,3417.68,"Specific environment, namely custody, which is defined as a formal arrest or its functional equivalent."
2010.09-11121,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3418.785,3419.331,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-11121,3,17489,barbara_s_blackman,,3421.153,3432.946,I think what's very odd in this case is that the only party that didn't consider J.D.B.'s age was the courts.
