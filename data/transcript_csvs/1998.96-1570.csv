1998.96-1570,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.758,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1570, NYNEX Corporation v. Discon, Inc...."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,9.567,12.97,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.96-1570,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.617,137.283,"So if costs were passed on to the consumer, that's just irrelevant?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,137.283,150.812,"It's very relevant for regulatory purposes, but the question in a rule of reason analysis in the removal services market is whether or not a price now put in the conditions of competition in that market were changed, where..."
1998.96-1570,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.812,170.212,"It seems to me if you have a monopolist that's the buyer and the agreement is to eliminate all but one supplier, and if you assume that those costs are going to be passed on to the consumer, I don't know why that isn't part of the competitive analysis, at least under the rule of reason."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,170.212,178.159,"The...  I think the important portion that is relevant under the rule of reason, as I say, it's not whether local telephone rates were raised."
1998.96-1570,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,196.502,197.293,On that question...
1998.96-1570,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.293,205.628,"Suppose we could show the costs were passed on to the consumers, and that that was the necessary effect of this, and it's a rule of reason analysis."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,211.882,223.253,"In a rule of reason case, Justice Kennedy, I think that fact, the fact that costs were passed on, is irrelevant to the rule of reason antitrust analysis."
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,223.253,226.812,"But may I just interrupt with, what about the costs of removal services?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,233.276,234.889,"That's the core of the case, Your Honor."
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,234.889,243.575,"And don't they allege that they did, that Technologies bid $998,000, and the plaintiff was bidding about half that amount any they mark it up to amounts still less than..."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,243.575,245.155,Just...
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,245.155,249.359,Haven't they alleged that the costs of removal services were artificially enhanced?
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,249.359,252.432,"No, I don't believe they have, and I'd like to explain why."
1998.96-1570,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.214,264.53,"May I ask just preliminarily before you make that explanation, who was in the removal business, other than ATT Technology and Discon?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,286.344,291.119,"The complaint alleges at least four people, four companies in the business."
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,346.735,364.446,"Oh, but why doesn't it, if that's a main purchaser in the market, and if the people who made the agreement...  the whole thing is kind of strange, but anyway, if the people who made the agreement had for its purpose higher prices for removal services, why does it matter that they were willing to pay the higher prices?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,364.446,365.338,I think...
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,365.338,369.782,"Because those prices then, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, are passed on to the ultimate consumer of telephone services."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,369.782,385.073,"I think what matters about it is that if there is no change in the terms of rivalry in the removal services market, and I'd like to get to that in a minute, why I think that's true, then the fact that a buyer voluntarily pays more doesn't change the market price, doesn't change the market output."
1998.96-1570,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,416.743,450.505,"But isn't there going to be, even as you describe it, a tendency to inflate price even in the event that NYNEX tomorrow morning, or tomorrow morning after the complaint was filed, decided that it didn't want to pay that much, because it had already demonstrated that in fact it would pay an inflated price, the competitors...  I will assume for the sake of argument there were three...  knew that it would pay the inflated price, and therefore I assume there would be a tendency on their part to say, let's hold them to their inflated price, or something like it."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,462.114,480.285,"I think the reason that it would return to the competitive price is the fact in this industry, where there are no barriers to entry, the complaint alleges not just that these people were in the market, but that this business can and was performed by telephone companies for themselves."
1998.96-1570,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,480.285,483.926,"Well, you may...  and I realize that, so in fact there's a fifth player here..."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,483.926,484.226,Right.
1998.96-1570,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,484.226,492.523,"I know, but isn't the point at this stage that that is a matter for litigation under a rule of reason analysis?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,513.126,519.672,"No, I don't agree, and the reason I don't agree is the point I'm coming back to with barriers to entry."
1998.96-1570,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,567.564,569.154,"Sorry, I thought he didn't."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,618.995,619.646,"Well, it is true..."
1998.96-1570,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,619.646,621.118,"So there's no doubt about that, is there?"
1998.96-1570,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.118,623.17,It's a different product they were selling.
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,626.151,628.062,"I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
1998.96-1570,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,628.062,630.763,"They're selling a different product, so the price could be higher."
1998.96-1570,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,630.763,631.915,"Yes, right, a little higher..."
1998.96-1570,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.915,637.959,"They're selling removal services plus a kickback, so the price for the removal service is quite low."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,637.959,639.399,You could certainly analyze it...
1998.96-1570,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.399,641.041,"It might have been the best price in the market, actually."
1998.96-1570,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,641.041,646.775,"So there's no doubt about that, but there's also no doubt, I take it, that the consumer paid more."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,667.04,667.191,But it was...
1998.96-1570,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,667.191,667.521,Yes.
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,667.521,668.152,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1998.96-1570,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,668.152,668.443,Go ahead.
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,668.443,678.08,"I agree that the allegation is that they were exercising monopoly power in the telephone services market, but the important point is, that's not the relevant market for the analysis here."
1998.96-1570,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.039,711.042,"What about the purchase of removal services, as opposed to the sale of removal services?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,712.765,714.868,In the purchase of removal services?
1998.96-1570,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.868,715.179,Right.
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,715.179,738.183,"Well, certainly I think you have to say the complaint fairly alleges that there were two principal buyers of removal services, but the allegations of the complaint are focused on the provider's side of the equation and, of course, here, since this is...  we're considering a motion to dismiss, we have to take the allegations in the complaint."
1998.96-1570,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.183,743.976,"It's alleging a conspiracy between the provider and the purchaser, right, and..."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,743.976,744.447,That's correct.
1998.96-1570,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.447,750.471,"When such a conspiracy is alleged, wouldn't the monopoly power on the part of the purchaser be relevant?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,750.471,765.99,"Only if there were adequate allegations that the terms of market-wide competition in the removal services market had changed, and here...  here I come back to what I tried to explain before."
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,770.124,784.473,"Actually, as I understand it there's...  there were two purchasers, the exchange sub of AT&T as well as the NYNEX sub, and the allegation is, they agreed to create a monopoly in the purchase of removal services."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,784.473,793.559,"That was one of the allegations pressed below, that you could say that, if I understand the question correctly, that there was a conspiracy between two separate subsidiaries of NYNEX."
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,793.559,797.452,"Well, no, between the NYNEX MECo, or whatever it is..."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,797.452,797.612,Right.
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.612,806.889,"and the AT&T subsidiary that consumed removal services in its exchange business, in the..."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,806.889,807.039,Yes.
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,836.218,843.262,"Isn't the complaint fairly read as indicated, they wanted AT&T Technologies to have all the removal business?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,843.262,856.78,"I think the complaint is fairly read, and now I refer to paragraphs 100 and 104 of the amended complaint, where the allegation is that the power over price was to be in NYNEX's hands, and also if you look at the briefs they're filed in the court of appeals."
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.573,878.536,"What paragraph again is that, just so I know?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,878.536,880.596,That's paragraph 100 and 104.
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.596,881.257,"Okay, thank you."
1998.96-1570,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,881.257,884.109,"Mr. Young, you're not treating this as a pleading..."
1998.96-1570,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,884.109,895.125,"The cases that come up on a motion to dismiss are more apt to be moving targets than if you'd gone through and litigated the thing and there was some sort of a factual record, I think."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,896.417,904.672,"Well, the...  one thing, though, I think is clear, and that is, we have the final theory before us."
1998.96-1570,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,919.821,941.577,"Mr. Young, that's the part that I don't understand, because it's not clear to me whether your position is, there is no claim to state, or no claim was adequately stated, the insufficient statement versus, given this situation, there is no possible claim to be stated."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,941.577,945.52,I guess I'd answer that question this way.
1998.96-1570,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,978.452,984.837,"On that, you gave us a precise question about the Second Circuit's theory about group boycott."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1004.098,1010.172,"No, I don't believe so, because the question presented did not use the words per se, it said, group boycott."
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.103,1041.594,"May I ask this question, Mr. Young."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1045.097,1045.297,Yes.
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1045.297,1064.259,"in the market and, assuming that's correct, is it your position that even if the people in the business do engage in a conspiracy to exclude somebody entirely and drive them out of business for all sorts of improper purposes, that could never be an antitrust violation as long as there are no barriers to entry, because always somebody will come back later because they can't succeed?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1064.259,1091.537,"The...  Justice Stevens, I think the right answer to that question is, as long as what we're talking about is a vertical nonprice agreement, then the appropriate analysis is the rule of reason analysis, and it is...  as long as there genuinely are no barriers to entry, it may well be that the allegation is that people have acted for a bad reason in terminating the supplier, but that's not..."
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1091.537,1102.383,"And the bad reason in this case is, to exclude this company from the market permanently and entirely no matter what it takes, that's perfectly all right, because other people can always get back in and replace them?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1102.383,1102.654,Because...
1998.96-1570,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.654,1104.366,That would never be an antitrust violation.
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1104.366,1110.529,"Because the relevant question is, what is the state of rivalry in the market, not whether a particular supplier goes out of business."
1998.96-1570,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1110.529,1118.867,"Just getting back to the relevant market one more time, let's assume a universe in which, because of the regulatory scheme...  let's assume this."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1147.975,1153.699,The best authorities that I would point to...  I could not point to any authority of this Court.
1998.96-1570,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1172.792,1174.072,Thank you.
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1174.072,1187.782,"But those two cases...  I'm sure that there are others, but those two cases have a particularly good explanation of why it is that a monopolist who raises his rates is, that is not an antitrust problem."
1998.96-1570,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1190.204,1191.713,A regulated monopolist.
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1191.713,1195.096,"Regulated monopolist, excuse me, yes, why that is not an antitrust problem."
1998.96-1570,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.9,1228.618,"Could I ask...  I frankly tend to agree with you about what result you get when you apply the rule of reason, but I'm not sure that...  I certainly didn't understand when I voted to grant the petition that we were talking about anything except a group boycott in violation of section 1, and that's a term of art, and the term of art means the kind of thing that is a per se violation."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1235.603,1253.655,"Well, I think this Court in Northwest Stationers certainly suggested that there could be group boycotts that are not analyzed under a per se approach, but in terms of the question presented, plainly the Second Circuit indicated meant group boycott to subsume both per se and rule of reason."
1998.96-1570,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1253.655,1267.503,"But even on that reading, and you're probably right on that, why still don't we send it back and see...  let them have a crack at whether there is a different rule of reason and conceptualization that might apply?"
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1267.503,1268.825,Because...  two reasons.
1998.96-1570,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1273.9,1281.043,"Well, but we'll be disposing it if we do what you invite us to do and, in fact, in the first instance we won't be acting as a reviewing court."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1281.043,1284.476,"The second reason, which I think is probably the most..."
1998.96-1570,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1284.476,1285.017,The better reason.
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1285.017,1285.437,important is...
1998.96-1570,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.253,1310.825,"Well, we wouldn't be saying the complaint is good enough."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1314.929,1316.349,If I might...
1998.96-1570,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.349,1319.4,"I mean, that's what we would be saying if we sent it back."
1998.96-1570,0,33725,james_r_young,,1321.002,1328.607,"One more...  if I could say one more thing before I close, I haven't really talked about the section 2 conspiracy claim at any great length."
1998.96-1570,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1336.685,1337.726,"Very well, Mr. Young."
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1339.188,1353.437,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.96-1570,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.516,1585.899,"Well, that's true when you have identified a restraint on competition."
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1620.432,1639.134,"This argument may turn out to be one that could be substantiated even in summary judgment proceedings factually, but it seems to me to rest on drawing too much out of some passing references in some of the allegations of the complaint..."
1998.96-1570,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1639.134,1640.966,"Well, I think he's making a further argument..."
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1640.966,1641.147,at this stage of the case.
1998.96-1570,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1641.147,1641.557,Mr. Wallace.
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1653.745,1665.573,"Well, we certainly would file a complaint, I hope, that would be clearer in its theories of what the violation is."
1998.96-1570,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1717.736,1725.132,"Well, all right, assume...  I'm having trouble understanding, and the part I don't understand is, I'll assume any facts you want."
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1764.226,1783.09,"Well, in...  I think under these allegations the facts that could make it out would be that they could substantiate that this was a conspiracy to monopolize that market..."
1998.96-1570,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1783.09,1784.091,"No, no, those are conclusions."
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1784.091,1784.352,and show some...
1998.96-1570,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1784.352,1785.902,I'm asking you about facts.
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1785.902,1786.202,Mm-hmm.
1998.96-1570,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1786.202,1790.754,"That's a conclusion, a legal conclusion."
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1790.754,1791.164,Yes.
1998.96-1570,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1791.164,1808.495,"I want to know what facts there are that, if we assume this motive, is a regulatory problem and not an antitrust problem, and if we assume giant entry barriers, only two firms...  as tall as the Empire State Building those entry barriers."
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1817.404,1850.946,"Well, the facts are that, as alleged, that they discriminated against this participant in the market in order to exclude him from the market even when he was offering fully adequate competitive services at a more favorable price, and that there were no legitimate business reasons for the decision, but it was designed to mask the regulatory violation."
1998.96-1570,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1850.946,1855.248,Does that mean something other than what I said I would assume...
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1855.248,1855.989,Other than just...
1998.96-1570,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.989,1861.032,that what they did...  I assume they bought from A for this bad reason.
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1871.06,1871.27,But...
1998.96-1570,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1871.27,1875.113,"and they did it for this bad reason, to chisel the consumer."
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1877.725,1878.315,That...
1998.96-1570,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1878.315,1879.256,"And if so, what?"
1998.96-1570,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1879.256,1902.231,"That they...  it's also alleged that they conspired together to take steps to see to it that the plaintiff here, the respondent, was excluded from that market because of the threat that his competitive offers would unmask the conspiracy, the regulatory evasion conspiracy."
1998.96-1570,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.084,1937.336,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1939.67,1945.223,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.799,1975.961,"That was quite a different fact situation, was it not, Mr. Brown?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1975.961,1979.824,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, as I understand Klor's..."
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1979.824,1981.547,"I mean, could you answer the question?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1981.547,1981.825,Yes.
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1981.825,1985.598,"Don't you think that was quite different, with a number of different parties involved?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1985.598,1995.446,"I think that is true, Your Honor, in terms of the number of parties involved, but in terms of the structure, the violation that was being addressed, I don't believe it differs."
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1995.446,2000.13,"Well, you need a group to make a group boycott, don't you?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2000.13,2021.815,"Well, Your Honor, as I read Northwest Stationers, in terms of its description of what a per se approach generally involving, a joint effort by a firm or firms to disadvantage a competitor of one of the participants in the boycott to keep them from access to a market, or from certain critical components that they need to compete."
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.27,2047.872,"MECo is really an agent for NYNEX, was it not?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2047.872,2060.809,"I don't disagree with that, Your Honor, but to sell to New York Telephone, who was actually the ultimate purchaser...  MECo was just a reseller...  MECo had to approve every vendor and qualify it."
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2060.809,2066.681,Why is that any different from saying that NYNEX's purchasing agent had to approve every vendor?
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2066.681,2068.184,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think it is different."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2081.172,2082.614,Without selling to NYNEX.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2089.708,2090.61,"That's true, Your Honor."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2090.61,2090.848,Which is NYNEX.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2090.848,2091.859,And in this case we did...
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.859,2095.953,Why is this case any different...  let me put it another way.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2127.203,2130.034,"No, Your Honor, and I think we've gone beyond that."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2130.034,2131.696,Why have you gone beyond that?
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2131.696,2149.478,"First of all, Your Honor, Discon, my client, and AT&T Communications, in addition to some minor vendors who I will deal with if Your Honor would want me to, were approved by MECo to sell to NYTel."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.363,2159.365,"I'll change my hypothetical, then."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2178.617,2181.498,"As you put it, Your Honor, no, I don't think it does."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2181.498,2183.219,"Now, what have you added to that?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2183.219,2186.203,"All right, Your Honor, these things."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.818,2228.019,Right.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2246.881,2256.879,"I don't think that would make it an antitrust violation if that was the sole, unilateral act, Your Honor, but if we're dealing in a Colgate context, and we're going to say..."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.879,2258.359,"No, it's not unilateral."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2276.602,2282.396,"You haven't stated a conspiracy to do anything to any third party as to that point in time, Your Honor."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.396,2283.057,"Yes, I have."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2287.171,2311.156,"No, you're not, Your Honor, not within the context of the antitrust laws, and why I say what I say is, and why I use the term unilateral, if you're to go forward without any intent to damage a competitor of the person with whom you're dealing, with whom you, as the widget purchaser, is dealing, that's one thing."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2333.531,2349.031,"Well, how have I effected a...  I mean, I haven't harmed...  that may give you a cause of action against me, where you add to my hypothetical not just that I want to help my son-in-law, but I...  these other two companies that I'm driving out are owned by enemies of mine, and I really want to hurt them."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2365.901,2366.412,"All right, Your Honor..."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2366.412,2378.3,"As soon as my son-in-law leaves that company, I can immediately open it up for bids and people will come in and, since there are no entry barriers to this particular industry, I can ask for as low a price as I want."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2378.3,2382.364,"Your Honor, my response to that would be twofold."
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2422.462,2426.272,"Mr. Brown, may I ask a rather fundamental question that cuts across the whole case?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2427.934,2428.455,Yes.
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2428.455,2433.969,"Now, it seems to me there are at least two different ways one might describe that market, and I want to know which one you say."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2458.545,2469.973,"The answer to that, Your Honor, is very simply, is that Rochester Telephone is not characterizable as being in the same market if we deal with sales to NYNEX."
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.925,2477.747,So you do not contend that the...  that the market which included Rochester Telephone was monopolized or restrained?
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2478.337,2480.951,"I am saying it can be read, Your Honor, at both levels."
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.951,2482.251,"Well, how do you read it?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2483.472,2493.478,"How I read it, Your Honor, is that this is an attempt to monopolize a market for the provision of removal services..."
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2493.478,2496.252,"I understand that, and I'm asking you how do you define the market?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2499.932,2501.544,It would not include Rochester Telephone.
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2501.544,2504.475,Does it include or not include AT&TC?
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2504.475,2509.228,"AT&TC is ATC Communications, Your Honor, is the..."
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.228,2512.421,It's the interexchange network in the State for AT&T.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2512.421,2512.591,Yes.
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2512.791,2514.671,"And they use removal services, too."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2514.671,2515.122,That's right.
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2517.924,2519.944,"So it does not include that entity, either."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2519.944,2520.255,That's correct.
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2522.007,2526.249,So the market we're talking about is the single purchaser of NYNEX.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2526.249,2527.08,Yes.
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2527.08,2527.511,Okay.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2527.511,2528.75,Yes.
1998.96-1570,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2528.75,2547.843,"In responding to Justice Scalia's hypothetical, the exclusive requirements contract and the son-in-law, is your answer that there is no actionable antitrust violation even if the supplier is a monopolist?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2547.843,2550.334,"Your Honor, if the..."
1998.96-1570,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2550.334,2552.367,The purchaser is a monopolist?
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2552.367,2560.693,"If the purchaser's a monopsonist, has control...  Your Honor, I think that that's a more difficult question."
1998.96-1570,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2562.582,2563.303,That's not what...
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.303,2563.824,That was my question.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2563.824,2567.677,"I misunderstood you, then, Justice Scalia."
1998.96-1570,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2568.707,2576.813,I think to make your hypothetical work you have to assume that Justice Scalia's purchaser of the services is a monopolist who then passes on the cost to the consumer.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2576.813,2576.941,Yes.
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.854,2596.075,It seems to me it's a strange...
1998.96-1570,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2596.075,2602.098,"So part of the agreement with the son-in-law and the purchaser is, and we'll pass this cost on to the consumer?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2602.098,2603.578,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1998.96-1570,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2603.828,2605.36,Then is there an antitrust violation?
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2605.36,2618.29,"I believe so, Your Honor, because the purpose there, even though the effect may be on ratepayers, you can only affect that purpose by eliminating competition in the supplier services market."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.353,2632.001,The reason...  but the reason the consumers are subject to the whims of a monopolist is not anything that's been done in this contract.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2652.203,2659.118,"Well, Your Honor, that brings about who really has the authority as between the antitrust laws..."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.118,2671.397,"But I thought the purpose of the antitrust laws was to stop individuals from creating monopoly power, and the monopoly power that is hurting these consumers is not a creation of this deal, it's a creation of the State."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2671.397,2680.37,"That monopoly power, my response would be, Your Honor, cannot be abused in this case unless they fix the supplier markets in a manner violative of the antitrust laws."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.37,2696.892,"Well, there are regulatory...  I mean, in awarding monopoly the State also supervises it, so there are punishments that can be meted out by the appropriate regulatory authority, but I find it hard to see how you can blame that monopoly power upon this transaction."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2696.892,2701.186,We're not attacking...  we're not attacking the purchaser for being a monopsonist.
1998.96-1570,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2713.655,2717.735,Can I ask you the same question that I asked the Solicitor General?
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2720.687,2721.829,"No, if you would, please."
1998.96-1570,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2722.96,2724.613,Right.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2805.296,2806.556,All right.
1998.96-1570,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2806.556,2817.303,"What additional facts, and as far as entry barriers are concerned, I'll assume whatever entry barriers you want, whatever you think you plausibly can prove as to lack thereof, or not lack thereof."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2818.665,2822.118,"I think, Your Honor, in response, there are probably a couple."
1998.96-1570,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2839.438,2860.533,"What evil motive...  now...  in other words, there is a human being called a manager, and we're looking into his mind, and I can see that that manager might want to cheat the consumer, on your theory, I've got that one, by raising the price above what he really paid when he tells the regulator."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2867.887,2868.458,Right.
1998.96-1570,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.918,2886.218,Mm-hmm.
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2886.218,2892.984,"However, in 1985, New York Telephone said, we can't tolerate these markups any more."
1998.96-1570,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2912.849,2913.54,"No, I've got that."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,2953.034,2953.235,Right.
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.916,3034.689,"But your client can certainly...  but NYNEX can certainly be punished by the regulatory authority, can it not?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3034.689,3036.8,"Yes, but not for antitrust violations."
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3039.642,3046.017,"No, but for passing on these phony prices to consumers, certainly the New York regulatory authority could get after it."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3046.017,3065.059,"I think that's accurate, Your Honor, and I think they did adjust the rate basis, and they fined them, and so did the Federal Communications Commission, but that again doesn't address the antitrust issues and, in fact, in this industry the FCC has acknowledged that this industry in terms of antitrust, from the times of the AT&T breakup case forward."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3087.694,3100.193,"Mr. Brown, may I suggest something that maybe you are adding to the hypothetical that Justice Stevens...  that Justice Breyer proposes?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3119.554,3121.447,"Ultimately, every..."
1998.96-1570,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3121.447,3127.721,"If you are unsuccessful in driving everybody else out, the scam would be disclosed."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3139.54,3140.241,Yes.
1998.96-1570,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3141.29,3143.79,Could you explain one allegation?
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3155.581,3180.655,"No, Your Honor, what...  where this was occurring is, my client was an intervenor in hearings before the New York State Public Service Commission, and New York tells internal security...  and there's a mention of it, to try to establish that my client was involved in payment of certain personnel within the NYNEX group to ensure it would get business."
1998.96-1570,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3213.767,3220.553,"What are you going...  what do you intend to show, any, again, facts...  I'm back to facts."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3259.339,3259.629,Yes.
1998.96-1570,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3260.067,3260.387,What?
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3260.387,3263.361,The purpose is to buy from A only to discipline B.
1998.96-1570,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3263.361,3270.916,"And what do...  I mean, do you have any fact at all that's going to show that, other than the fact that what the buyer did was always buy from A?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3270.916,3271.357,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1998.96-1570,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3271.357,3272.686,"What, for example?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3272.686,3273.868,They're pled in the complaint?
1998.96-1570,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3273.868,3275.117,Like what?
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3275.117,3290.979,"Winning on bids which then, when AT&T Communications went in with a higher bid, it would...  the bid would be retracted and awarded to AT Communications without any further notice to my client."
1998.96-1570,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3292.121,3297.634,"Well, is the fact that they disqualified your client from bidding, perhaps, an answer to the question?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3297.634,3297.634,They...
1998.96-1570,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3297.634,3298.004,"In other words, they didn't just say, I'm going to buy from A."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3307.782,3311.115,"Your Honor, I believe that's another additional fact."
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3320.1,3323.894,How is that any different from the hypothesis of a requirements contract?
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3337.353,3341.544,"Well, Your Honor, I think...  I think I can answer that two ways."
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3371.114,3378.079,"But I asked you, what's the difference between a requirements contract and the statement to your client, we won't even have you bid?"
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3378.079,3378.77,All right.
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3401.734,3402.635,"Thank you, Mr. Brown."
1998.96-1570,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3402.635,3403.364,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.96-1570,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3403.364,3405.297,"Mr. Young, you have 2 minutes remaining."
1998.96-1570,3,33725,james_r_young,,3405.297,3408.739,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't want to impose on the Court."
1998.96-1570,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3409.96,3412.761,"Well, it wouldn't impose on the Court if you answered one question for me."
1998.96-1570,3,33725,james_r_young,,3412.761,3413.172,Certainly.
1998.96-1570,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3413.763,3420.187,"When your opponent kept referring to AT&T Communications, was he really referring to AT&T Technologies?"
1998.96-1570,3,33725,james_r_young,,3421.857,3423.45,AT...
1998.96-1570,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3423.45,3430.826,"AT&T Technologies is the one, the AT&T sub, that was the...  that actually provided the removal services, was it not?"
1998.96-1570,3,33725,james_r_young,,3430.826,3431.377,I believe that's correct.
1998.96-1570,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3431.377,3433.779,And so when he said Communications he meant Technologies.
1998.96-1570,3,33725,james_r_young,,3433.779,3440.113,At one point I think when he was talking about purchasers he referred to AT&T Communications as a purchaser...
1998.96-1570,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3440.113,3443.335,That would have been this AT&TC that I was referring to earlier.
1998.96-1570,3,33725,james_r_young,,3443.335,3443.515,That's correct.
1998.96-1570,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3443.515,3443.776,Right.
1998.96-1570,3,33725,james_r_young,,3454.761,3457.214,"There are actually, I think, two markets alleged."
1998.96-1570,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3465.881,3466.201,Right.
1998.96-1570,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3466.201,3467.634,"Thank you, Mr. Young."
