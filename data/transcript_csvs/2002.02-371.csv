2002.02-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.916,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 02-371, Virginia v. Kevin Lamont Hicks."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,9.274,11.78,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,60.908,72.596,"Well, was... was the State applying some State law notion of standing, because certainly Virginia can have different rules for standing than the Federal court might have."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,72.596,84.272,"There is absolutely no indication in the record, Your Honor, that the State supreme court was doing anything other than applying what it thought was this Court's overbreadth jurisprudence."
2002.02-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,84.272,92.303,"Well, but on... on the matter of standing, would we necessarily assume they were applying some Federal standard?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,92.303,94.845,"Your Honor, you don't need to assume that in this case."
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.43,117.586,Did they cite our cases?
2002.02-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.586,118.606,There's... there's no--
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,118.606,119.058,They did.
2002.02-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,119.058,122.736,"--There's no citation of any Virginia case in the opinion, is there?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,122.736,128.356,"There is no citation when discussing the... the standing issue, the overbreadth issue at all."
2002.02-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,177.22,189.447,"But if we were to hold for you on that ground, the Virginia Supreme Court would be free to say on remand, would it not, that it has decided to take a more generous view of standing?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,189.447,191.483,"--It certainly could do that, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,202.841,208.249,"But when we're not talking about substantive law, why is that really an... an issue for us?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,208.249,211.015,"Well, Your Honor--"
2002.02-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,211.015,211.95,They can do what they want.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,212.702,217.55,"--Your Honor, they... they believe they are required by this Court's jurisprudence to grant--"
2002.02-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,217.55,219.232,"Well, but they didn't say that here."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,228.336,231.671,"--Your Honor, I believe we... we do know based on the portions of the record I read."
2002.02-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,236.574,241.021,"Well, they... they did with respect to... to substantive law... the substantive doctrine overbreadth."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,252.487,264.658,"Your Honor, I... I think of the... the recently decided case of Virginia v. Black cross burning where in that case the criminal defendant raised claims under both Federal and State law."
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.44,274.063,"Mr. Hurd, that's not the issue anyway, is it, whether they would have had a narrower interpretation under State law?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,274.063,274.853,"No, Your Honor--"
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,274.853,283.525,The issue is whether... whether they adopted a broader interpretation under State law than Federal law would require.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,283.525,284.273,--That's--
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,284.273,285.044,Isn't that the issue?
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,285.044,286.029,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.029,290.723,There's no indication that they were adopting a broader interpretation than Federal law requires.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,290.723,291.866,That is correct.
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.809,334.963,"And if they were correct about what our standing rules are, they would have to follow those standing rules, wouldn't they?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,337.031,337.878,That's--
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.878,339.546,"--basis for standing, could they?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,339.546,341.179,"--That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,350.736,355.662,"If they... if they were wrong in interpreting our cases, they still could have done exactly that they did."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,355.662,359.187,"--They could have, Your Honor, but there's no indication that they did."
2002.02-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,359.187,360.393,They didn't say so.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,360.393,361.317,They didn't say so.
2002.02-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,361.317,366.381,"So if we sent it back and then they said so, then we'd have to take the case and decide whether they're right or wrong on the merits."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,366.381,367.91,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,367.91,368.295,Yes.
2002.02-371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,368.295,372.574,I'm not sure why we... why it's called standing.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,436.599,438.05,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,438.05,454.491,"Well, why aren't you and he arguing on the merits of a constitutional matter, whether this statute is or is not unconstitutional because of the possibility that it could be badly applied in a free speech area that isn't this one?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,454.491,455.272,Well--
2002.02-371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,455.272,456.522,Why isn't that the merits?
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,457.843,464.916,"--Well, Your Honor, there are a number of problems with... with Mr. Hicks' case, one of which is exactly the one you described."
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.456,493.916,"Mr. Hurd, we don't normally decide whether a statute is constitutional in the abstract, do we?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,507.559,509.106,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.638,522.751,"And that's why it's... it's a question of third-party standing whether you can say I was unconstitutionally convicted because if you applied this statute to somebody else, he would be unconstitutionally convicted."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,522.751,525.571,"--It... that is certainly our argument, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.791,573.338,I didn't think it was limited to those people.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,576.463,581.684,"Your Honor, that is... that is not exactly the... what the policy says."
2002.02-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.088,584.725,"Well, what does the policy ban?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,584.725,586.341,--The policy is--
2002.02-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.341,587.802,"It doesn't just ban drug dealers, does it?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,587.802,594.085,"--No, Your Honor, but in terms of... of the legitimate sweep, if we tried to contrast the legitimate sweep of the policy--"
2002.02-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,594.085,599.97,"Well, I... let's say it's legitimate to keep all the drug dealers and all the armed robbers out, but... but how many other people does it keep out?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,601.239,606.301,"--Well, Your Honor, we believe that the risk that any legitimate speaker will be chilled is... is very small."
2002.02-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,619.647,621.932,But doesn't the no trespassing sign apply to everybody?
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,624.449,633.513,"Your Honor, it... it does not apply to... just to ne'er-do-wells, and the problem is how do you know until you actually catch them in the act of dealing drugs?"
2002.02-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.513,639.8,"Well, it applies to... it does not apply to someone who is coming to see someone in the housing development, as I understand it."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,639.8,640.602,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.079,678.855,"Which, as far as the text of the ordinance is concerned, legitimate business could include pamphleting."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,678.855,680.471,"It... it certainly could, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.471,682.074,As far as the text is concerned.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,682.074,682.914,Absolutely.
2002.02-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.523,690.671,If... if we agree--
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.671,699.54,"--It wasn't the interpretation by one of the administrators that leafleting was not ipso facto legitimate businessing, or pamphleting or whatever."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,701.34,706.388,"Your Honor, we would characterize that not so much as an interpretation of the written policy as an addendum--"
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.388,707.337,An addendum.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,707.337,721.098,"--an addendum to it which requires the demonstration of legitimate purpose, which is discussed in the policy, which would require that demonstration be made to the housing manager to show that the leafleting is legitimate."
2002.02-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,721.883,730.579,"Suppose... and suppose I... the... the Court were to agree with you that the speech analysis, particularly the overbreadth analysis here, was wrong."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,762.134,766.876,"--Your Honor, he certainly has this... this due process right to wander issue preserved."
2002.02-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,779.983,784.267,"And in the context of that, to say that the ordinance is vague for other reasons."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,784.267,786.895,--That would be a substantive due process challenge there.
2002.02-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,813.478,814.005,Mr. Hurd--
2002.02-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,814.005,817.255,"--Mr. Hurd, could we go back just to Justice Stevens' question for a minute?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,874.456,875.805,"No, Your Honor, it's not."
2002.02-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,875.805,876.721,--who is not a resident.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,890.048,890.788,"No, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,895.072,896.535,"No, but is that what this says?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,903.278,904.941,"--No, Your Honor, I do not believe that's the case."
2002.02-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,912.713,915.269,"Well, but before we get to that, it says, no trespassing."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,921.772,925.686,"--Your Honor, in the context of a private apartment complex, it would not mean that."
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.661,943.697,"Is it the signs that are under challenge here, or is it the ordinance?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,943.697,945.265,It is... it is not the signs.
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.265,948.372,It... it may well be that the ordinance is constitutional but the signs aren't.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,948.372,949.809,It is... it is the policy--
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.809,950.062,That's possible.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,950.062,953.886,"--It is the policy that is... that is challenged, not... not the signs."
2002.02-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,953.886,958.354,But are you taking the position that the policy and the signs are different in their content?
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,958.354,960.424,"We're taking the position they must be read together, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,960.424,963.381,"If you read them separately, are they different?"
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,963.381,981.309,"A... a person might be able to read the sign in isolation and believe that they had to get some permission to come in advance, but the people who come to the... to this housing complex and do so legitimately typically receive invitations from the residents."
2002.02-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,984.426,991.655,"Mr. Hurd, that's a curiosity about this case, the fact background of it that perhaps you can clarify."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1008.058,1009.533,"Your Honor, two... two points on that."
2002.02-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1020.3,1021.834,And we don't know why.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1021.834,1026.567,"--Well, the... the record suggests on page 60 that there may have been some domestic violence in the background."
2002.02-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1080.608,1085.089,It's not disputed that his... that they live in the project.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1085.089,1091.819,"They do, and had he not engaged in misconduct, the situation never would have arisen."
2002.02-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.311,1094.285,Maybe they want him out too.
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1095.522,1096.86,"--We... we do not, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1181.555,1183.294,"Thank you, Mr. Hurd."
2002.02-371,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1185.048,1185.331,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1185.643,1187.069,"Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you."
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1187.069,1191.917,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1255.224,1270.581,"Mr. Dreeben, assume... I know it's not quite clear, but assume for the moment that Virginia had clearly... Virginia Supreme Court clearly said we're going to allow standing as a matter of State law, but... even though it wouldn't be allowed as a matter of Federal law, and the case then came to us in that posture."
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1273.487,1278.452,"--I'm not sure that this Court would, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.67,1305.184,No.
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1320.51,1327.583,"--Well, the question there would be whether the State was sufficiently aggrieved so as to have standing under the principles announced--"
2002.02-371,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1327.583,1331.101,Some of our loyalty oath cases... I forget if it was Adler or Doremus.
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1342.493,1356.862,"--Well, the most relevant case is probably the Asarco decision in which the Court concluded that once the State court binds the State officials to a particular ruling, that there may be the requisite case or controversy to allow this Court to decide--"
2002.02-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1356.862,1357.41,There's... there's also--
2002.02-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.41,1358.658,--The same party can have standing to appeal.
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1358.658,1359.666,--That's right.
2002.02-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.313,1369.686,"There's also a question, isn't there, Mr. Dreeben, of whether this overbreadth doctrine is essentially a part of the First Amendment or a part of the standing doctrine?"
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1369.686,1372.338,"--Well, it has two aspects, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.786,1414.354,"But it clearly relates to the doctrine of standing, doesn't it, which doctrine says that you normally do not have standing to raise the objections of other people?"
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1422.1,1422.914,That's correct.
2002.02-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.514,1425.673,And overbreadth changes that.
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1429.55,1441.317,"--Well, I think overbreadth is... is an application of a more general principle that this Court has adopted on... in various circumstances to allow a party who's before the Court and who is aggrieved to raise the rights of others."
2002.02-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1471.881,1483.349,"But the irony of what you're saying is that the Virginia... Virginia Supreme Court might undertake that cost, invalidate a Virginia statute on Federal grounds that we think are wrong and we couldn't do anything about it."
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1483.349,1497.178,That is probably true unless the Court applies the Asarco principle to allow an aggrieved State official to bring the case here because its own supreme court has interfered with the implementation of Federal law--
2002.02-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1497.178,1498.516,"See, but that's... that's the problem."
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1568.842,1583.59,"--I think the answer to this paradox is that the State court can adopt much broader principles of law with respect to standing than this Court would impose, and it can administer them even when it's adjudicating Federal light... rights."
2002.02-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1592.956,1594.312,"Well, fine, let them challenge it."
2002.02-371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1594.312,1594.576,Okay.
2002.02-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1594.968,1603.456,"--But if you're right, no matter how much they challenge it, the simple fact is, if you're right, it doesn't violate the Federal Constitution to convict this person."
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1603.456,1604.778,That's true.
2002.02-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1604.778,1606.811,So what's raising it going to get him?
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1606.811,1612.2,"Well, that... that is an adjudication of the... of the overbreadth challenge on the merits."
2002.02-371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1626.118,1641.237,"Okay, but you're... I think you're saying that... that under Asarco, they can challenge the substantiality point, but they wouldn't necessarily be able to challenge the standing point which gets this particular defendant in a position to raise the issue in the first place."
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1641.705,1657.313,"It's not exactly right, Justice Souter, because I think this is an area analogous to the Court's rules in criminal cases under Michigan v. Long where the Court has to decide, does this opinion rest on a question of Federal law or does it rest on a question of State law?"
2002.02-371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1671.66,1678.916,We certainly... that certainly applies when you're talking about substantive law whether it... it would be an extension of that to apply it to standing.
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1678.916,1693.282,"I think it would only be a modest extension because in this case the court did not separately analyze the questions of standing as such from whether respondent could bring an overbreadth challenge, and the question wasn't posed with a--"
2002.02-371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1693.282,1696.294,Why... why isn't that a question of standing by definition?
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1696.294,1699.017,--It... what it--
2002.02-371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1699.017,1703.312,"Overbreadth is an exception to standing, and... and so why is it anything but a standing issue?"
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1708.833,1709.96,"--Let me... let me explain it this way, Justice Souter."
2002.02-371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1764.258,1769.067,"--But that would... that would basically be applying something like Michigan v. Long rather than Asarco, right?"
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1769.067,1778.726,"In this case, it certainly would because the State court hasn't relied on a clearly insufficient case or controversy in order to adjudicate Federal rights."
2002.02-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1794.478,1798.925,"If we follow that course, we wouldn't get to the substantive overbreadth, right?"
2002.02-371,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1799.678,1801.735,"That... that is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.02-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1802.624,1803.687,"--Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2002.02-371,2,40978,steven_d_benjamin,,1806.651,1812.861,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.49,1869.605,Are you suggesting that these streets were still as if they belonged to the City of Richmond after they were deeded to the housing authority?
2002.02-371,2,40978,steven_d_benjamin,,1869.605,1870.565,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.565,1871.282,Why is that?
2002.02-371,2,40978,steven_d_benjamin,,1871.282,1872.34,They were still public.
2002.02-371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1875.915,1881.599,"Why... you know, clearly the city intended that they no longer be public streets."
2002.02-371,2,40978,steven_d_benjamin,,1883.826,1896.95,"--Your Honor, for the same reason when Congress ruled... or... or passed a law saying that the sidewalks around this building were no longer to be used, for the same reason."
2002.02-371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.5,1907.098,That wasn't a law making those private sidewalks.
2002.02-371,2,40978,steven_d_benjamin,,1915.319,1917.124,"Yes, they are, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.124,1917.44,They are.
2002.02-371,2,40978,steven_d_benjamin,,1917.44,1918.343,"Yes, sir."
2002.02-371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.343,1922.025,You can't exclude the public from... from marching right up to the Governor's front door?
2002.02-371,2,40978,steven_d_benjamin,,1922.025,1924.87,You can exclude the public from the gate.
2002.02-371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.87,1925.904,There's a gate.
2002.02-371,2,40978,steven_d_benjamin,,1932.147,1933.802,"That is not a public street, Your Honor."
2002.02-371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1933.802,1934.973,"Of course, it's not a public street."
2002.02-371,3,45023,william_h_hurd,,3562.066,3563.035,"Thank you, Your Honor."
