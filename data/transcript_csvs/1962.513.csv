1962.513,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,10.511,"Number 513, Willie Norvell, Petitioner, versus Illinois."
1962.513,0,43347,thomas_p_sullivan,,28.605,33.495,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Honorable Members of the Supreme Court."
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1474.771,1477.848,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.513,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1603.68,1604.788,Before we get to that Mr. Wines.
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1604.788,1605.362,"Yes, sir."
1962.513,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1605.362,1614.404,"Was there any, any representation to the court in 1941 that he was an indigent?"
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1617.394,1618.169,Yes.
1962.513,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1638.25,1650.259,"It'd be -- and as I understood from Mr. Sullivan, the Illinois law at that time did give the trial judge the discretion to grant a free transcript if he --"
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1650.259,1652.903,I think that is true.
1962.513,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1652.903,1655.361,Yes.
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1655.361,1663.63,"Now, he, as I say, made no effort in 1941."
1962.513,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1984.553,1994.64,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,1994.64,2004.839,"That's right, but as of the present time barring some such anomalous cases raises a different question."
1962.513,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2025.858,2028.056,May I ask you one more question?
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2035.971,2036.75,Yes.
1962.513,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2036.75,2039.502,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2039.502,2040.242,Yes.
1962.513,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2040.242,2041.461,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2041.461,2042.54,Yes.
1962.513,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2042.54,2043.901,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2043.901,2044.429,Yes.
1962.513,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2044.429,2046.109,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2046.109,2047.644,Yes.
1962.513,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2047.644,2054.42,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2054.42,2058.11,I never know of one that was granted but I never know one that was applied for.
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.884,2092.884,Mr. Wines.
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2092.884,2094.902,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.902,2112.048,"It seems to me that -- that if in this case, the transcript to the reporter's notes had been available when they were requested in 1957, 1958, whenever it was."
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2144.604,2148.684,Is Your Honor through with the question?
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.684,2165.499,"You are apparently relying in this case upon the -- upon the failure of the petitioner to request from the judge a transcript back in the time of his trial, aren't you?"
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2165.499,2194.846,"Well, so far I'm narrating the facts, but to answer Your Honors first question as I understand it, the Supreme Court of Illinois promulgated Rule 65-1 which gave convicted persons transcripts even though they hadn't requested and the time to request them -- request them would otherwise have expired."
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.717,2205.902,"Constitutionally, you are saying that failure to request at an earlier time when the opportunity was available."
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2209.402,2224.731,I say that that would be an adequate answer showing -- absent some showing that he was prevented from requesting it which wouldn't necessarily mean that coercion by guards might be mental infirmity or something of this sort.
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2224.731,2248.877,"So that if Illinois wanted its part of its rules say that we will grant these transcripts, delayed -- this delayed request for transcripts in cases where the petitioner has asked for and was refused a transcript at an earlier dates, Illinois could constitutionally do that."
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2249.897,2255.11,"That would be my contention, yes."
1962.513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2255.11,2262.089,"But I gather, Mr. Wines, under 65-1, transcript where there exist have been provided."
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2262.089,2262.579,"Yes, and there --"
1962.513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2262.579,2266.504,Even though no claims and no request had been made --
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2266.504,2267.121,"Oh, Yes."
1962.513,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2634.047,2649.357,"I see in these defendants to petitioner's brief, a case called a Monroe case that a sentence was imposed in the year 1936 and the Griffin case was in what?"
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2650.239,2651.9,1956.
1962.513,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2651.9,2655.598,And the Illinois Court reversed and remanded in 1958?
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2655.598,2657.607,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.513,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2657.607,2660.511,How do you explain that case?
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2661.988,2667.31,"Well, the court reporter didn't die, there was a transcript available."
1962.513,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2667.31,2668.339,There was one case.
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2668.339,2671.186,"In the Monroe case, there was a transcript."
1962.513,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2680.459,2684.68,So your point is not what you just said that the 15 years delay is --
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2684.68,2689.591,15 years delay plus intervening impossibility.
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.13,2718.11,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2718.11,2718.903,What?
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2718.903,2756.4,If you do have this case (Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2756.4,2770.236,I say that as a matter of constitutional law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
1962.513,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2870.684,2874.611,"Of course, it wasn't the law when Griffin was convicted."
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2874.611,2875.56,I think it was.
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.206,2944.118,"Mr. Wines, would you say that the (Inaudible) to a defendant who were a -- commit the same crime (Inaudible) either one of them is requesting (Inaudible) Would you say, this person has a --"
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2944.118,2945.024,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.024,2951.657,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2951.657,2952.914,I say --
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.914,2954.481,All he have to say.
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2954.481,2955.997,A little more than that.
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.764,3009.051,There's no suggestion that indicates that anyone (Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3009.051,3010.062,That's right.
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.062,3016.897,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3016.897,3025.942,There -- the evidence on that is there's not only no evidence that they can be done but there's pretty conclusive evidence that it cannot be done.
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3029.71,3032.937,This also proves the state could be (Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3032.937,3036.312,-- which also proves that the State can't be tried.
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3099.97,3112.963,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3112.963,3114.668,Yes.
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3114.668,3119.883,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3119.883,3135.24,"My answer is that if he has waived an unreasonable length of time, he should, that a convicted person shouldn't be able to bet his own life expectancy against that of the court reporter in effect."
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.24,3140.67,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3140.67,3141.797,"No, I wouldn't."
1962.513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3273.885,3274.529,Mr. Wines --
1962.513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3274.529,3274.89,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3274.89,3277.583,Excuse me.
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3277.583,3280.687,"It certainly would, it certainly would."
1962.513,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3283.321,3284.9,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3284.9,3286.185,I beg Your Honor's for --
1962.513,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3286.185,3290.209,What happens in Chicago particularly in Chicago?
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3290.209,3296.775,"Oh, I wouldn't want to comment on that for fear I might offend our group libel statute that Your Honors --"

1962.513,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3298.13,3299.346,Mr. Wines --
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3299.346,3300.945,Thank you.
1962.513,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3300.945,3305.002,On arguing this wholly as a matter of due process which you say means reasonableness.
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3305.002,3306.238,And equal protection.
1962.513,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3306.238,3307.373,"Well, the equal protection."
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3310.484,3310.866,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.513,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3310.866,3311.668,(Voice Overlap)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3311.668,3317.284,I think it was made better by Mr. Justice Harlan's single question that was by my half hour.
1962.513,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3366.768,3373.269,Are you speaking to one who thinks that if anything denied his equal protection of the law at least one?
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3373.269,3374.505,"I beg, Your Honor."
1962.513,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3374.505,3386.029,"I said at least one of those whom you're addressing think if there's anything denied, it was equal protection of the laws are due process only so far as it forbids discrimination provided in the equal protection?"
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3386.029,3387.338,"Well, I understand that."
1962.513,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3402.683,3405.304,(Inaudible)
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3405.304,3407.654,I wish Your Honor would.
1962.513,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3407.654,3442.551,"Let us assume a hypothetical (Inaudible), at that time there was no decision of this Court to furnish a transcript or a free transcript or whatsoever, the decision of this Court -- the decision the other way had been entitled to counsel on the appeal towards a capital case."
1962.513,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3459.046,3460.003,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.513,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3532.241,3533.764,Mr. Sullivan.
1962.513,2,43347,thomas_p_sullivan,,3533.764,3537.964,Your Honor.
1962.513,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3597.382,3611.711,(Inaudible)
1962.513,2,43347,thomas_p_sullivan,,3611.711,3622.227,"Your Honor, I say as did Mr. Wines, that if the transcript cannot be prepared, there's no point in having an order directing that it'd be prepared."
