1998.97-9217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.139,"We'll hear argument next in No. 97-9217, Manuel DeJesus Peguero v. United States."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,21.26,24.315,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1998.97-9217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,54.613,56.182,You... you state these three reasons.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,65.099,69.724,--This Court has never dealt with a structural error regarding access to an appeal.
1998.97-9217,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,128.545,143.201,"Is... is it true that... that if you are right, the same thing would be said for the rule 11 warnings in the plea colloquy, that... that failure to give any one of them or to give one of them accurately would also be structural error with the same result?"
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,143.201,145.514,"No, for a very important reason."
1998.97-9217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,180.641,188.626,"Well, it may or may not, and... and with other structural errors, you can't tell whether it does or not."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,196.617,209.248,"--We know from the record as a finding of fact from the district court judge, and the defense attorney testified that he discussed the appellate rights with the defendant and that the defendant agreed not to go on with an appeal and to, instead, cooperate."
1998.97-9217,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,218.082,219.075,Why do we need to know?
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,225.612,231.251,--We have no indication from the record what his response would have been if the judge had told him.
1998.97-9217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,285.121,306.669,"Well, Mr. Siegel, if your position is correct, that it is a structural error if... if the defendant were not advised by the judge of the right to appeal but subsequently perfected an appeal, he'd still be entitled to relief under your theory because there's been a structural error I guess."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,306.669,308.711,"Well, I would say that in that case there--"
1998.97-9217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.711,313.191,That's the consequence of labeling it as you would have us label it.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,313.191,319.59,--There would be no... the rule wouldn't apply where the defendant had actually filed his appeal.
1998.97-9217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,329.045,336.475,How about... is there ever a plea agreement in which a defendant agrees to give up any right to appeal?
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,336.475,337.134,"--Yes, Your Honor, and--"
1998.97-9217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,337.134,339.569,And suppose that were the case.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,344.853,345.513,"--Well, no."
1998.97-9217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,386.73,397.997,"But as soon as you start getting exceptions, it seems to me you're strongly cutting against your argument, this is so-called structural error, that it's much like any other kind of error that you evaluate for harmlessness."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,397.997,406.642,"Well, I would have to disagree with that, going back to the fundamental point that you never know what the defendant would have said if he had been told by the judge."
1998.97-9217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.823,429.659,"If... if we applied that test to all harmless error determinations, that is to say, you can only say there is harmless area... error when you know... I mean, you never know for 100 percent certainty."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,439.236,446.273,"Well, Your Honor, we don't dispute the general applicability of the harmless error rule or that there are no broad exceptions to it."
1998.97-9217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.721,460.784,"I just think it's unrealistic to say he knew about this right to appeal, but if the judge told him what he already knew, there might have been a different outcome."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,460.784,461.61,--The--
1998.97-9217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.61,463.756,"I mean, I can't say no."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,467.926,481.672,"--Well, in this case, Your Honor, we submit that the structure of the rule shows that it is likely because this is a rule where the people who put together the rule, which was approved by this Court, specifically created a structure where the defendant could spontaneously request it on the record."
1998.97-9217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.672,487.533,The rule is there so that we don't have to inquire into whether he knew about it all the time.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,487.533,488.442,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-9217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.442,498.679,"We may have to in some exceptional case such as this, but 99 percent of the cases are taken out of that situation by the fact that on the record the judge asked him and he says no."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,509.824,519.361,"Because the right to appeal is so important and because you can never really know what would have happened if the structure or the rule had been followed, I would say, yes, in this unusual circumstance, just--"
1998.97-9217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,519.361,520.477,"Mr. Siegel, can we back up for a bit?"
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,520.477,521.303,--Yes.
1998.97-9217,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.774,523.903,Is it clear that defendant knew?
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,532.448,540.333,"The district court made the finding in... favor of the Government, that the defendant was warned of his right to appeal."
1998.97-9217,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.333,542.291,That was by crediting the attorney.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,542.291,543.139,That was by crediting the attorney.
1998.97-9217,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,554.451,567.182,"But why do we have to go beyond the fact that there is a... there's a second claim here, and the second claim was ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to take the appeal that the defendant requested him to take."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,576.083,582.249,"--Well, the district court made a factual finding that there was a discussion between the defendant and his attorney--"
1998.97-9217,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,582.249,582.908,Why do we need a finding?
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,592.263,596.145,--The whole purpose of a per se rule which has been adopted--
1998.97-9217,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,596.145,598.374,"Well, let's leave per se rules aside for a minute."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,613.811,625.988,"--Because no matter what was stated by the petitioner, there is always the possibility that if the defendant had been properly warned by the judge, as contemplated by the rule, that he would have--"
1998.97-9217,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,625.988,627.724,"No, but that's... you're answering a different question."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,642.295,644.707,"--It is a fact established for the record, Your Honor, yes."
1998.97-9217,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,644.707,645.267,Okay.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,645.267,645.889,Yes.
1998.97-9217,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,646.632,652.204,"Well, if you... you have already recognized that there would be some exceptions."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,674.7,687.703,"--Well, there's no question about the 4-year delay, but under cases that will be arising under the current law, there is now a 1-year limitations period under the AEDPA, Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act."
1998.97-9217,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,779.18,781.122,What... what was the alleged error here?
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,787.892,788.552,That is correct.
1998.97-9217,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,793.176,797.347,"Yes, but... but the object of it would be to get a new sentencing and a--"
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,797.347,799.409,The object of it would be to get a new appeal.
1998.97-9217,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,801.927,803.763,--It's an appeal from the sentence.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,803.763,807.765,"--It's an appeal from the judgment, both the sentence and the judgment of conviction."
1998.97-9217,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,807.765,809.523,I thought he entered a guilty plea.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,809.523,810.432,"That is true, Your Honor."
1998.97-9217,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,815.883,823.064,"So... so, are we just discussing this in the abstract, or did this defendant have something appealable?"
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,824.428,831.98,I think that Mr. Peguero has a good direct appeal claim regarding the conduct of the guilty plea colloquy under rule 11.
1998.97-9217,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,831.98,833.838,"But he didn't raise that at any point, did he?"
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,844.945,857.781,"That's true, but on direct appeal, the defendant will always have an opportunity to argue in the court of appeals, one, that the guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered or, number two, that there was a violation of rule 11."
1998.97-9217,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,857.781,858.319,Sure.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,858.319,859.184,Now--
1998.97-9217,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,859.184,863.559,"Sure, and... and... but whether he could have done that or not, he hasn't done it."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,868.76,872.437,"--To respond to your question, there's one point where I agree with the Government."
1998.97-9217,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,872.437,876.069,"Is... is that correct, that... that the only two claims that he's raised are those?"
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,876.069,883.621,The only claim that is active now in the 2255 petition is the failure of the judge to inform the defendant of his appellate rights.
1998.97-9217,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,883.621,888.701,And the only two claims that were ever raised were... were this one and the ineffective assistance claim.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,889.277,891.151,"Yes, in the 2255 petition."
1998.97-9217,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,914.201,923.489,"If this were a... an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure, well, then how could Congress cut it off at a year?"
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,923.489,924.398,Excuse me?
1998.97-9217,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,924.398,935.478,"I mean, how could Congress limit the time to raise it if it were... if this were something... if the omission to tell him about this were inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure?"
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,935.478,936.947,I understand the question.
1998.97-9217,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,936.947,938.888,How could Congress cut it off at a year?
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,938.888,944.089,"The Congress is not cutting off the defendant's right to raise it, but it is regulating the way in which the defendant--"
1998.97-9217,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,944.089,944.461,"No, no."
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,946.03,946.69,--That is correct.
1998.97-9217,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,946.69,947.311,All right.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,952.8,957.464,It... it is a little beyond.
1998.97-9217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.414,1019.319,But the one flaw in this... I'm just... think it through with you a minute.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1028.878,1030.076,--That is correct.
1998.97-9217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1053.937,1055.135,Refresh my recollection.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1057.114,1071.398,"--In 1984, when they passed the sentencing guidelines, they by statute amended rule 32(a) to insert a requirement that the district court judge must also inform the defendant that he has a right to appeal from the sentence because prior to 19--"
1998.97-9217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.398,1077.548,But... but then what was the preexisting law that they presumably adopted if they first put it in in 1984?
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1077.919,1081.346,"--Well, the question was... Your Honor has posed to me a question and says--"
1998.97-9217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.346,1081.634,--Yes.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1081.634,1084.772,"--well, the statute doesn't say anything about a per se rule."
1998.97-9217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.835,1088.488,It doesn't say anything about a per se remedy.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1089.436,1089.808,--Okay.
1998.97-9217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1091.665,1092.22,Right.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1092.22,1110.324,"However, if you want to try to find some indication of what Congress might have been thinking, if you're inclined to look for the... the background of what was in the law at that time, in 1984, you'll see that all of the appellate court cases dealing with this issue before 1984 adopted the per se rule--"
1998.97-9217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.324,1113.213,But I thought Congress changed the rule in 1984.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1113.213,1127.952,"--They added to the rule to require not only a... an advising of the defendant after trial of his right to appeal from the conviction, but also requiring now under the guidelines that defendants be specifically told that they had the right to appeal from the sentence."
1998.97-9217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1129.15,1129.604,Yes.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1139.841,1154.041,"These are... these are cases arising after the 1966 amendment to the guideline which first said in all cases where the defendant has gone to trial, the district court judge must warn the defendant on the record that he has a right to an appeal."
1998.97-9217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.041,1154.596,--Right.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1154.596,1158.295,"These cases... this is nothing new, which is what has... what has happened in this case."
1998.97-9217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.333,1168.076,That's what I was going to ask.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1168.985,1169.374,--Yes.
1998.97-9217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.374,1173.36,Timmreck would have changed it as to the colloquy at the rule 11 stage.
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1173.36,1175.096,Some were before but some were after.
1998.97-9217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1185.703,1190.244,Were those... were those cases in which the defendant knew of his right by advice from counsel?
1998.97-9217,0,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,1190.244,1192.929,"Some of those cases indicate the defendant did, yes."
1998.97-9217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1240.483,1242.091,"Thank you, Mr. Siegel."
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1244.032,1261.948,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under rule 32, the district court should have informed petitioner at sentencing that he had a right to appeal, but petitioner knew he had a right to appeal and so he was not prejudiced by the district court's failure to tell him what he independently knew."
1998.97-9217,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1274.375,1277.94,"In other words, he's got to negate the possibility of harmless error?"
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1280.358,1282.01,"Yes, in the context of--"
1998.97-9217,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1282.01,1287.582,"Now, why... why is the burden on him here, whereas the burden, I take it, is on the Government if there's a rule 11 failure?"
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1287.582,1290.76,"--No, Justice Souter."
1998.97-9217,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1306.697,1308.471,Is... is that true under 11(h)?
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1308.471,1329.481,"11(h) is a provision which relates to direct appeal, and in circumstances when a defendant is noting a direct appeal from his... the adjudication of guilt and ensuing sentence on the ground that there was a deviation from the requirements of rule 11, the burden is on the Government to show the harmlessness of the error."
1998.97-9217,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1346.86,1347.769,"Well, it's a different standard, yes."
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1347.769,1348.057,--Yes.
1998.97-9217,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1373.57,1381.122,"And that has been, in effect, uniformly accepted as... as the... the basis to interpret 11(h)?"
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1381.122,1382.32,--Yes.
1998.97-9217,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1407.129,1422.444,How would that work of showing prejudice where the defendant makes a credible case that he didn't find out that he had a right to appeal until after... how many days does he have?
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1422.444,1424.014,--He has 10 days.
1998.97-9217,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1424.014,1424.523,10 days?
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1447.996,1450.513,Two responses.
1998.97-9217,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1460.339,1460.877,No.
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1462.857,1493.238,"--In a 2255 proceeding, if the... the defendant alleged that he was unaware of his right to appeal because the judge failed to comply with the requirements of rule 32 and because the defense attorney failed to provide that information as well, and that allegation was not factually disputed by the Government or it was taken up at a hearing and determined adversely to the Government or in favor of the defendant, our position is that a defendant would be entitled to relief--"
1998.97-9217,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1493.238,1499.925,He would be and he wouldn't have to show that he had a probable chance of prevailing on the appeal.
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1499.925,1500.463,--No.
1998.97-9217,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1517.924,1527.872,"So, this case would have come out the other way appropriately in your view if the defendant in fact did not know within the 10 days that he had a right to appeal."
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1527.872,1542.294,I should add the qualification derived from this Court's decision in Timmreck that in some cases there might be a question as to whether defendant would have wanted to or would otherwise have been able to appeal.
1998.97-9217,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1567.996,1581.288,"Mr. McLeese, what if rule 32 amendment had not been adopted and there were nothing in the rule telling the judge that he had to inform the defendant of his right to appeal?"
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1597.142,1614.975,"--The way those cases typically played out and the way they would continue to play out with respect to... the way they typically played out was for a defendant to raise the claim in the form of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim where the defendant would say... wouldn't be able to rely on rule 32, but would say, I was convicted."
1998.97-9217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1629.547,1631.154,"Mr. McLeese, I don't think that's right."
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1659.678,1662.733,--I think this case is distinguishable from Rodriquez.
1998.97-9217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1678.504,1686.428,"Except for the fact Justice Harlan said that there should be an inquiry into prejudice, and the court did not do that."
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1688.74,1695.344,--I think the debate between the majority and Justice Harlan in Rodriquez was not about whether there should be an inquiry into prejudice.
1998.97-9217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1710.455,1711.048,They said--
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1711.048,1713.527,"What they said was, he has been effectively denied his right to appeal."
1998.97-9217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.527,1714.003,--Correct.
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1714.003,1721.516,"And it reached that conclusion based not solely on the rule 32 violation, but on two other features of the case that supported a conclusion of prejudice."
1998.97-9217,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1793.137,1798.505,Did he know he had the right to have the clerk file the notice for him?
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1810.144,1818.111,"Rule 32 says that if a request of that kind is made by the defendant, the clerk needs to enter the notice of appeal."
1998.97-9217,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1827.621,1837.446,"Do you know what the practice is for district judges when they warn the defendant about the appeal rights, say, and they want the clerk to file the notice?"
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1837.446,1846.158,"My... my trial practice is a few years out of date, but I never heard a district court communicate that information, and my understanding is that it is not communicated."
1998.97-9217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.557,1915.383,"Of course, Mr. McLeese--"
1998.97-9217,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1915.383,1920.834,"--I suppose the inference was that when it comes from the judge, this... this defendant is reluctant to antagonize a judge."
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1935.24,1939.16,--And I don't think that was the principal purpose of the rule.
1998.97-9217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.649,1974.743,I don't think he's making that as a... as a factual claim here.
1998.97-9217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1974.993,1975.486,--No.
1998.97-9217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.486,1982.052,I think that's one of the grounds on which he says you should have a categorical rule because this is one of the things that might happen.
1998.97-9217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.659,1984.197,Yes.
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2022.63,2031.668,--And all of that is true in the rule 11 context that the Court addressed in Timmreck where there later on may well need to be collateral litigation--
1998.97-9217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2031.668,2032.123,Right.
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2032.123,2043.474,--in which the defense attorney is going to be testifying about his recollection about what he told the defendant about the nature of the charges or the possible sentence.
1998.97-9217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2055.074,2061.556,"Well, except there is this one difference, that in the rule 11 context, you set aside a guilty plea, which means you then open the matter up for trial."
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2075.303,2084.879,"I think there is a difference of degree, but this Court's application of the fundamental defect of miscarriage of justice standard has never been calibrated in that way."
1998.97-9217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.199,2095.57,"The odd thing about it is the courts of appeals so uniformly come out... not uniform, but most of them seem to come out the other way, which is puzzling given the... the clarity of the Timmreck opinion."
1998.97-9217,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2095.57,2124.465,"--I... I think that the... the weight of authority is not as disproportionate as petitioner would suggest, but I think the principal explanation for that is that the case law in this area evolved before much of this Court's collateral relief jurisprudence, and it... there is not a single court of appeals that has applied a rule of per se collateral relief when it considered the applicability of Timmreck."
1998.97-9217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.006,2139.326,"Thank you, Mr. McLeese."
1998.97-9217,2,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,2142.177,2143.375,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-9217,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2143.375,2144.572,You have 5 minutes.
1998.97-9217,2,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,2144.572,2147.007,Thank you.
1998.97-9217,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2217.39,2222.88,Do you agree with your opponent that none of the courts that adopted it distinguished Timmreck or discussed Timmreck?
1998.97-9217,2,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,2222.88,2223.623,--It is true.
1998.97-9217,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2354.564,2355.102,"May I ask, before you do that--"
1998.97-9217,2,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,2355.102,2355.473,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-9217,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2355.473,2360.137,--about the... the practice that... that you have experienced.
1998.97-9217,2,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,2374.066,2381.313,"I haven't... I don't know whether judges tend to be sensitive when I'm around, but I doubt it."
1998.97-9217,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2399.146,2401.83,Yes.
1998.97-9217,2,21528,daniel_i_siegel,,2401.83,2402.368,Okay.
1998.97-9217,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2490.706,2492.525,"Thank you, Mr. Siegel."
