1973.73-797,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,62.748,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-797, Miami Herald Publishing Co against Tornillo."
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,71.671,74.808,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-797,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,188.724,201.822,"I gather even on the face of it, it might be read as applicable only to assailing a person running for a nomination who’s already in office."
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,203.818,214.365,"I think the statute actually is broader because the definition of candidate includes a person who qualifies, a person who is already in all --"
1973.73-797,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,214.365,218.826,"In this case has your court, Florida Supreme Court given it --"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,218.826,227.424,"Yes, the Florida Supreme Court in interpreting this statute in this case, said that it applied to editorials and other articles."
1973.73-797,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,227.424,229.983,Was Mr. Tornillo an office holder or --
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,229.983,235.581,"No, he was a candidate for an office in State Legislature."
1973.73-797,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,517.566,539.229,"Mr. Paul, whether or not the appellee has abandoned the claim, if nonetheless when we will have to decide I suppose, do you read the Florida Supreme Court’s opinion as conferring any civil right upon Tornillo when the case goes back to the Circuit Court of Dade County and his right to civilly proceed against your client?"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,539.229,551.581,"Yes, I think the Florida Supreme Court said that there was no injunction remedy under the statute, but they did imply, despite the fact that it was a criminal statute, a right for civil damages."
1973.73-797,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,551.581,558.642,"Well you cite in your brief to pages 16 and 17 of the appendix, the Florida Supreme Court opinion."
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,565.071,584.017,Yes I think that the Florida Supreme Court in that opinion specifically said that the fact that this was a criminal statute did not mean a civil right could not be implied in that decision.
1973.73-797,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,593.122,600.02,"Well, don’t take up your time on it."
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,600.02,616.855,"It's page 40, I believe in the appendix, that particular statement, 39 or 40."
1973.73-797,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,616.855,618.814,Bottom line of page 40 there.
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,620.096,628.853,"Criminal penalty can easily be severed and deleted and still leave a complete legislative expression establishing a civil right to damage, that is at the bottom of page40."
1973.73-797,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,628.853,636.99,"That however doesn’t answer the jurisdictional question, that is the question of finality?"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,636.99,651.912,"No, I -- the Court of course has to examine that question, I think though that the issue in this case, is the constitutionality on its face of the Florida statute and that issue has been fully litigated in the Florida courts."
1973.73-797,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.098,666.509,"You mean the paper -- if the statute is constitutional, the paper concede liability?"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,666.509,668.362,"No, the paper does not concede --"
1973.73-797,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.362,671.903,Well that’s not the issue then?
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,671.903,680.022,The remaining issues would be issues solely of Florida law as to the remedy and as to the amount or damage.
1973.73-797,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,680.022,682.858,"Where, you mean where?"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,682.858,684.513,That possibility is --
1973.73-797,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.513,687.072,That you may never have to face the question?
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,687.072,704.481,"I think though under the principles lay down by this Court in Mills versus Alabama, this constitutional question is now ripe for decision and threatens basic First amendment rights, the decision of the Florida Supreme Court holding the statute constitution --"
1973.73-797,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.481,709.353,And this constitutional issue has been finally settled in the Florida Court?
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,709.353,726.538,Finally settled in the Florida courts and Florida election scheduled within a few months and this statute would seriously inhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights in the decision of the Florida Supreme Court would deter the exercise of those rights.
1973.73-797,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,736.58,745.855,"Am I wrong in recollecting that in Mills against Alabama, the newspaper conceded that it had no other defenses?"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,745.855,746.125,That is correct.
1973.73-797,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,746.125,755.003,"And here, you just told my brother White that you do have defenses based upon Florida law, and as he suggested you might win and that would be the end of the case."
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,757.384,773.398,"Except that the decision of the Florida Supreme Court from point of view of inhibiting the exercise of First Amendment rights in Florida would still stand, even if the non-constitutional issues should provide success for the Miami Herald in this case."
1973.73-797,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,773.398,783.261,"But you would have won this case and this Court is here just to decide cases or controversies, that’s the extent of our power under Article III?"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,783.261,784.06,The --
1973.73-797,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.06,794.081,"Well how would you be inhibited when you haven’t printed anything yet that you did want to and you are not about to, I suppose?"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,794.081,807.709,"The Florida Supreme Court has held the statute constitutional and of course the Herald would, in the absence of the reversal by this Court, would have to abide by the constitutional ruling of the highest court in its State."
1973.73-797,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,852.824,861.432,"Well, I noticed in your reply brief that you also rely on North Dakota Pharmacy Board --"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,861.432,861.768,Yes.
1973.73-797,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,861.768,862.181,-- against Snyder --
1973.73-797,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,862.181,868.012,"Where we decided the constitutional question, not withstanding there were state laws?"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,868.012,870.736,"Correct, I think --"
1973.73-797,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,870.736,874.487,That one was not a First Amendment case?
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,874.487,876.484,"No, it was not a First Amendment case."
1973.73-797,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,897.896,900.216,"So if you win the case, it wouldn’t come back."
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,903.041,910.352,"This case wouldn’t, but another case raising the same issue would come back because the Florida Supreme Court’s decision would still stand."
1973.73-797,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,922.573,928.204,"Before the North Dakota case, do you think you might have some serious troubles on jurisdiction here?"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,928.204,928.742,"Yes, I think we might --"
1973.73-797,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,928.742,933.801,"You think -- you rest on that very firmly, I notice in your reply brief?"
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,933.801,936.547,Yes.
1973.73-797,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1144.628,1150.818,What would happen if they publish editorial against all of the candidates in one political party?
1973.73-797,0,21368,daniel_p_s_paul,,1152.218,1158.161,"Under the Florida statute, each of the candidates would have an answer."
1973.73-797,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1379.441,1386.16,Very well.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1388.78,1391.398,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-797,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1416.437,1419.009,Does he pronounce his name Tornillo rather than Torneo.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1419.009,1419.487,Tornillo.
1973.73-797,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.487,1419.706,Tornillo.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1419.706,1422.003,Mr. Justice Rehnquist Tornillo.
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1591.058,1607.791,"Or they put it in another way, a person who cannot reply to an editorial by merely becoming candidate automatically gets that right?"
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1607.791,1609.515,"That’s right, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1623.557,1641.862,"So, if an editorial is written against Joe Dokes (ph) calling him anything and really condemning him to high heaven and Joe Dokes says well I know how to fix him, I'll become a candidate."
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1641.862,1642.049,But --
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1642.049,1643.299,Will this statute --
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1643.299,1643.649,The media still have --
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1643.649,1650.061,"-- apply to him even if a man does that deliberately, this statute covers him [Voice Overlap]"
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1650.061,1671.059,"Not quite Mr. Justice Marshall because the media will still have the upper hand because if they have attacked him prior to the time he became a candidate and then he becomes a candidate, they still will be able to deny him a forum under the statute as long as they don’t editorial attack -- as long as they do not editorially attack him."
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1671.059,1674.584,Joe -- well let me put in another way.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1683.136,1683.933,And is attacked.
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1683.933,1691.0,"But if he becomes -- well, after that if he hadn't become a candidate he could still be attacked, couldn’t he?"
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1691.0,1692.209,"Yes he could be, I understand --"
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1692.209,1696.8,So to insulate him from attack he becomes a candidate.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1696.8,1697.987,"Yes, but my point is --"
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1697.987,1700.194,This statute would cover him.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1700.194,1704.848,I don’t believe that the statute goes quite that far Mr. Justice Marshall.
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1713.368,1715.983,(Inaudible)
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1715.983,1719.222,He is insulated from not being able to respond.
1973.73-797,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1977.6,1988.05,"Nothing in this court of Union in New York Times had suggested that one person would ever like to comment, there is somebody else’s printing press and make his expression that way."
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,1988.05,1991.38,Mr. Justice Rehnquist let me answer your question this way.
1973.73-797,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2108.204,2143.79,What if Mr. Tornillo in the course of his campaign had announced after this editorial attack that on the next Friday night he was going to take care of the Miami Herald and had announcements throughout the week and advertising to build up an audience on that conflict and that on Wednesday the Miami Herald said they wanted equal time and would like to have one of their editors or someone present to answer.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2153.549,2157.82,He would not Mr. Chief Justice because Florida --
1973.73-797,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2157.82,2158.816,The statute does not apply at all?
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2158.816,2168.918,The statute does not apply him and may I just speak a little further to your point because I think it’s again a fundamental point in this case.
1973.73-797,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2230.363,2234.409,Then one step further on my question I had only a preliminary.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2256.657,2263.687,"No, Mr. Chief Justice I do not believe you would for this reason."
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2399.589,2407.707,But you can just attack to destruction anybody in Florida except a candidate?
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2407.707,2412.731,"That is true, Your Honor and it is a situation I regret but it is a fact."
1973.73-797,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2590.067,2591.488,Mr. Barron?
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2591.488,2592.991,"Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1973.73-797,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2592.991,2597.411,Your eloquence prompts me just to ask one question.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2609.007,2614.633,"Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun I hope that is not so."
1973.73-797,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2761.071,2766.29,Well of course the only entity that the First Amendment is directed against is the Government.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2771.627,2775.959,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that would be true absence the statute."
1973.73-797,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2790.986,2798.34,"That's not what my question is address to, but what you’re saying is in effect that the real chilling here comes from the Miami Herald?"
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2798.34,2799.134,That is correct.
1973.73-797,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2799.134,2806.16,"Well, there is nothing in the constitution that prevents that private person from chilling anybody’s First Amendment right?"
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2806.16,2819.96,"But I would suggest Mr. Justice Rehnquist that since this Court has held time without number that the First Amendment is not absolute, that a state statute that imposes some duties on the Miami Herald changes that situation."
1973.73-797,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2819.96,2827.511,"Then you come down to the question of whether a state statute can impose, goes back to your [Voice Overlap] or it can impose a duty?"
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2827.511,2830.089,"Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice that is the question."
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2865.641,2878.159,What’s the difference between the state saying you shall publish “A” and the state say you shall not publish “A” in the First Amendment?
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2878.159,2882.092,Mr. Justice Marshall I believe there is a great difference.
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2916.728,2918.683,Wait a minute.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2921.866,2922.651,That’s right because they can tell --
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2922.651,2925.986,"Well, if Miami Herald liked it and then they would have publish it?"
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2925.986,2927.302,That is correct but what I mean by that --
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2927.302,2928.447,Let’s start all over again.
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2928.447,2929.149,I am sorry.
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2942.24,2945.422,And then publish what they don’t want to publish?
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2945.422,2946.418,That is correct if the statute --
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2946.418,2949.583,That is not governmental control?
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2949.583,2964.27,It is seems I would suggest that it is not governmental control of a degree that is any where like many of the statute that restrict the press that we called to your attention.
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2964.27,2965.712,None like this one?
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2965.712,2980.479,"Well, you take if a statute says that a newspaper cannot mention the name of a rape victim in the paper that of course is something they cannot say."
1973.73-797,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2981.51,2984.32,Have they ever decided that the --
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,2984.32,2999.897,"This Court has a case before it, now is Cox against Cohn Broadcasting which raise that very question and there again you have just as in this case Mr. Justice Marshall you have really competing constitutional claims because you see the --"
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.897,3018.686,"But of course the state says that every newspaper must publish any material that can be classified as the debate by any politician who offers it, would that be constitutional?"
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,3018.686,3020.754,I would have great doubt about the constitutionality.
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3020.754,3023.695,That sure would build up the debates you’ve been talking about?
1973.73-797,1,29320,jerome_a_barron,,3023.695,3027.252,"No because the – no, Mr. Justice Marshall I don’t believe it would because --"
1973.73-797,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3027.252,3028.827,You don’t believe it would?
