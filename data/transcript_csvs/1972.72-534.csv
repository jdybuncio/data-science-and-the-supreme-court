1972.72-534,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,71.419,We'll hear arguments next in 72-534.
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,81.867,84.236,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,676.798,681.654,Does Keppler I apply if they had pooled all of their resources?
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,681.654,682.383,Sorry
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,682.383,688.077,The Keppler case you just mentioned if those two ladies pool all of their economic sources?
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,688.077,689.614,They would be ineligible because then.
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,689.614,690.934,They would still be ineligible?
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,690.934,699.386,They would then be one economic unit and thereafter not to separate households living together but one household and therefore unrelated.
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,699.386,701.447,Would they be eligible?
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,701.447,702.509,No.
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,702.509,704.365,So what’s the difference?
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,704.365,705.42,The difference is that --
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,705.42,711.911,"I mean, it was the difference of the fact that they are -- they didn’t pool their resources, and if they had pooled then they would still be ineligible?"
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,711.911,715.381,But if they didn’t pooled their resource they would be eligible.
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,715.381,716.62,They would be eligible?
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,716.62,723.986,Yes because the statute requires Mr. Justice is that the group of persons live as an economic unit.
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,723.986,727.236,"Am I right, there is two people?"
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,727.236,730.22,"No they children, Mrs Keppler has two children."
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,730.22,733.101,Well would the other one be the one that doesn't have the children.
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,736.814,743.766,Well an individual can comprise a household under the Act.
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,760.816,764.388,"But the individual is not in this case, isn’t it?"
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,766.615,768.301,We are talking about both groups and individuals.
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,771.3,774.645,"Well, would Mrs. Keppler be qualified as an individual?"
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,774.645,781.929,"But she has two children, she would be qualified as a household if she shared only living, only housing expenses."
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,789.808,792.051,Is the other woman eligible?
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,792.051,803.011,"That would depend on what her income was and I think she is on welfare, if she is then she would be eligible too, but they would be eligible as separate households not as one household."
1972.72-534,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,803.011,807.568,"And the difference being what, dollars and cents wise?"
1972.72-534,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,807.568,809.678,What's the – what --
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,809.678,818.977,The difference would be simply zero federal contribution to food purchasing power as opposed to whatever the food purchasing power would be?
1972.72-534,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,818.977,825.742,"Are you going to get to telling us why it's rationale now to make them all ineligible if they pool, the living expenses?"
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,825.742,826.143,Yes.
1972.72-534,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,826.143,827.192,Alright.
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,829.312,841.833,"That's right, I have wanted to give an accurate definition of what class people of were affected by this and it's not accurate to say that simply because two unrelated people are living together they are disqualified from receiving food stamps."
1972.72-534,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1077.07,1077.964,45 of what now --
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1077.964,1079.879,45 of the brown Appendix.
1972.72-534,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1079.879,1084.809,Appendix.
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1084.809,1091.844,He says counties are carefully considering the increased cost of administration very carefully.
1972.72-534,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1108.244,1109.024,California.
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1109.024,1110.358,That's California.
1972.72-534,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1238.352,1243.289,You -- I want to try and understand you.
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1259.127,1259.705,That's right.
1972.72-534,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1259.705,1278.848,"And secondly it also has the ingredient of saving administrative expense because of the transitory nature of so many of these not related household and thirdly to prevent fraud which is really part of one and two, isn’t it?"
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1278.848,1288.219,"Yes, it is because, of course if unrelated groups are eligible and the fact that they are getting food stamps is not an abuse of the program."
1972.72-534,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1299.208,1300.417,"But that's it, (Inaudible)."
1972.72-534,0,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1300.417,1308.517,"Yes, that's it, that's it."
1972.72-534,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1308.517,1310.785,Mr Pollack?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1310.785,1314.009,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1972.72-534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1359.326,1379.525,"Now in Dandridge it's argued Mr. Pollack that, I think it was Dandridge there was an interference with very important right of privacy, that is size of the family in the sense that the regulation discouraged large families because of the limitation?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1379.525,1385.346,At the very most Your Honor I think in that case it only had incidental effect with relation to that.
1972.72-534,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1524.83,1530.732,How far has that repealed the whole problem for that purpose?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1530.732,1534.204,I doubt it very much Your Honor because it did not seem to be a very pressing concern --
1972.72-534,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1534.204,1538.018,You might say that I suppose?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1538.018,1541.403,Your Honor it seems to me that this was not a very substantial concern.
1972.72-534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1549.712,1560.749,"Now that, unless I misunderstand you that cuts against the argument you have been making for about the last three minutes, that this was the only purpose of the provision?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1560.749,1565.589,That is correct that is the only purpose that we can glean from the sparse legislative history.
1972.72-534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1585.567,1621.599,"Well before you get on to that, let's accept your composition that this was aimed at hippie communes, but let's assume that it had then described in terms that unstable establishments, that is like Waldorf Historia Hotel (ph) in the sense that there are people coming and going everyday are extraordinarily difficult to keep track of and would lend themselves to a great deal of false registration and fraud, would you then be making the same argument?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1621.599,1631.692,Your Honor this provision is substantially different and let me explain why and I think in order to understand why it's important to examine the decision Knowles v. Butz.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1711.799,1718.497,"Once again how is that a hippie, you put at commune can meet those three standard?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1718.497,1724.903,Well Your Honor a hippie commune if it wants to -- assume you have a commune of 20 --
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1724.903,1728.727,Well my question is can they meet those three standards?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1728.727,1730.003,Yes they can.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1730.003,1731.461,Then what is wrong with them?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1737.888,1746.239,"What I am saying Your Honor is even though the provision was directed at Hippie communes, the provision in fact does not harm them."
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.998,1783.546,How far is she joined together?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1783.546,1788.513,"She has joined together for all purposes, for economic purposes, for living arrangements."
1972.72-534,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.312,1805.618,"Well, isn't your argument right now though an argument where no more the factor the regulation or the statute might be unconstitutional as applied in some cases?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1805.618,1808.566,"No, Your Honor the provision, the provision in it's --"
1972.72-534,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.566,1820.344,"Well as applied to the communes, I thought you suggested to my Brother Marshall that there was nothing unconstitutional about it's application to them."
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1820.344,1822.907,If they can fractionate their households that is correct.
1972.72-534,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.907,1826.669,"Well, then if the regulation is not invalid on its face?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1826.669,1827.917,Your Honor on its --
1972.72-534,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.917,1831.319,And might you say it is with respect to the poorest of the poor?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1831.319,1834.191,Yes that is correct.
1972.72-534,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.628,1853.526,"To say something is unconstitutional on it is face, if you are dealing with the rational bases standard of equal protection analysis, does that have any support in our cases?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1853.526,1854.076,I am not sure I --
1972.72-534,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.076,1870.223,Well to say something is unconstitutional as applied versus unconstitutional on its face suggests some notion of over breadth I take it and I would think that would have no application unless you get into the compelling state interest or base it on some sort of the First Amendment principle?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1870.223,1876.63,Your Honor what I am saying is the provision can only really operate against poorest of the poor.
1972.72-534,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.509,1928.72,But isn't one of your arguments that the legislative motive here invalidates the thing because they were out to get the hippies communes?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1928.72,1931.989,I have two arguments Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1972.72-534,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1937.843,1939.697,Even though the purpose failed?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1939.697,1962.87,"That is correct the purpose nonetheless is impermissible, but even if you said the purposes was permissible, the purposes is not reasonably related to by this provision because what occurs in this situation as the California welfare director said and if I might, I would you refer you to page 43 of the appendix."
1972.72-534,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2068.793,2081.409,"But is it not the test under the rational basis requirement whether any reasonable person could have enacted the kind of the statute that Congress did, not whether a Congress' purposes is actually carried by the statute?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2081.409,2087.0,"Well, Your Honor I cannot find a permissible purpose that is rationally related to by this provision."
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2134.53,2140.7,"I still am with my Brother Rehnquist, now you are going one step further."
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2143.52,2144.894,Correct.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2144.894,2149.172,"And they didn't harm the hippie, where does that leave you?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2149.172,2150.109,It leaves you only --
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2150.109,2154.664,"On your purpose argument, if there is an argument?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2154.664,2156.078,Well Your Honor what I am --
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2156.078,2159.868,Well do you agree that they did not accomplish their purpose?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2159.868,2161.593,That is correct.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2161.593,2164.597,Well now why do you keep the arguing the purpose?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2164.597,2171.563,Well Your Honor I am trying to find some purpose to which provision is rationally related to and quite frankly I cannot find one.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.84,2179.749,Why not hypothesize without to hippies?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2181.924,2199.891,"Yes Your Honor it seems to me it is very clear that is persons who are not voluntary poor, it is the persons who are not hippies, they are the ones who are harmed by this provision and they are harmed irrationally, merely because they live with someone else to whom they are unrelated."
1972.72-534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2241.776,2254.605,But now you are suggesting on active Congress falls because all of the evils that Congress wanted to guard against cannot be reached?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2254.605,2255.629,They are not reached by this provision in any rational --
1972.72-534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2255.629,2257.708,"Well, does that make it a fall?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2257.708,2260.075,Yes Your Honor because it is not rationally related --
1972.72-534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2260.075,2274.459,"Then what happens at criminal code, the criminal codes don't have 100% or anywhere near 100% effectiveness if we can believe the studies and do you mean there is no rational basis for Congress to enact criminal statutes?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2274.459,2276.418,"No I am not saying that it all, Your Honor."
1972.72-534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.508,2315.553,"Well, you are not arguing a Fourteenth Amendment case, are you?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2315.553,2316.161,No I am not.
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2460.35,2474.213,"What kind of proof does applicant household have to make to show it's eligibility for a receipt of Food Stamps, just a verified --"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2474.213,2475.171,There is an application.
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2475.171,2476.289,With affidavits?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2476.289,2477.185,There is an application.
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2480.767,2481.852,What is that verification process?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2481.852,2488.295,"Well, in essence if someone says I have got X income, one has to prove that income."
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2500.765,2503.397,How is income defined do you know?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2508.456,2509.454,Yes it does.
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2509.454,2511.794,Because that is not income under the Federal income --
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2511.794,2517.482,"Yes, that is included as income or welfare is included as income, social security benefits are income."
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2522.226,2529.224,"So income for this purpose is a broad area, more broadly defined than income as defined in the Internal Revenue Code?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2529.224,2529.739,That is correct.
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2529.739,2536.95,"And there is a – you have to swear to the, in making the application, to the fact --"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2536.95,2544.151,That's correct and if you swore falsely then you are certainly can be penal – yes.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2586.333,2589.16,Don't we have to have 20 kitchens?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2589.16,2589.655,No.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2589.655,2591.328,Under the regulations?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2591.328,2592.509,"No, Your Honor."
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2632.694,2639.205,I am talking about -- I thought you said that 20 groups want to be considered as 20 separate groups?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2639.205,2639.866,Yes.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2639.866,2644.728,"In order to do that meet the regulation, now they have to have 20 separate kitchens?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2644.728,2647.205,"The answer to that is No, they do not."
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2647.205,2648.773,What they have one kitchen?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2648.773,2650.673,They could have one kitchen.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2658.185,2659.848,And they wouldn't have a kitchen?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2659.848,2666.429,"If they had even one kitchen, as long as they live as 20 separate economic units."
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2666.429,2668.353,What is your separate economic units?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2668.353,2669.904,"Well, in other words in other words they don't purchase --"
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2669.904,2671.074,Is it only room?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2671.074,2672.578,They don't purchase food in common.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2676.946,2679.997,Well I don't see why the poor people can't do that?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2679.997,2694.421,"Well, it seems to me Your Honor that if someone has no income whatsoever, but one has a meager income that someone like, like Mrs. Moreno has, she is not going to be able to live on her separate income."
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2708.136,2712.379,It seem to me for local relief to local home relief is not good enough.
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2712.379,2716.731,"Your Honor, the problem is that in many states you cannot get relief."
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2720.009,2731.877,"I know enough about that, but I don't think that the stamp program wasn't take up the lack of some stupid senator that hasn't got sense enough to give enough home relief, was it?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2731.877,2733.897,The Food Stamp program was intended to provide --
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2733.897,2735.222,Supplementary.
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2735.222,2739.701,No it was intended to provide people with all the their very nutritional needs.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2739.701,2740.355,All?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2740.355,2741.303,That's correct.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2742.513,2746.406,You won't make them pay 71 bucks if they were to give them all?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2746.406,2758.386,"Because what you are actually paying, you are paying your normal expenditures for food under the program and your coupon allotment that you receive is supposed to provide you with nutritional adequacy."
1972.72-534,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2776.059,2787.151,"Mr. Pollack, you described three separate things that should be done to qualify as a separate economic unit."
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2792.953,2803.126,"No Your Honor, it stems first from the statute to itself 2012(e) and Knowles actually interprets that statute."
1972.72-534,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2803.126,2812.633,You say that it id half-a-dozen of us lived in the same house that all we have to do is buy our food separately?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2812.633,2813.595,That's correct.
1972.72-534,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2813.595,2815.456,Okay and anybody do that?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2815.456,2816.61,Can anyone do that?
1972.72-534,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2816.61,2830.594,"If that's the only precondition to being a separate economic unit, why wouldn't each member of the group just go to the supermarket separately and independently?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2830.594,2855.666,"Well, Your honor -- because if you take a look as an example at Mrs. Moreno, she just cannot get nutritional adequacy if she used just her money. She only has, even if she doesn't spend a single penny on clothing, not a single penny on household supplies, not a single penny on so many different necessaries, even if she doesn't make expenditures for those purposes she only has 33 cents per day for food."
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.2,2902.782,"But my brother Powell's question to you was that if she bought separately, even though she is now living with the other woman, under the Knowles decision she would be eligible for Food Stamps."
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2913.047,2913.504,Your Honor --
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2913.504,2921.364,"Grant you that the 33 cents a day is a poverty level or below it, but Food Stamps aren't going to remedy that."
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2932.32,2941.001,"If she purchased her food, if she had -- if she didn't pool her resources with the Sanchez family that's correct, then she could get Food Stamps."
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2941.001,2941.656,Right.
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2941.656,2945.401,"However, in order to survive she has pooled her resources."
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2947.042,2951.06,She could still have a single kitchen as you told us?
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2951.06,2952.097,Yes.
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2952.097,2963.503,"And they could have a one roof over their heads, be in one dwelling place and but she could become eligible for Food Stamps simply by doing her food shopping separately, isn't that what the Knowles decision says?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2963.503,2965.849,The Knowles decision says it is correct.
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2968.142,2971.334,"Then you back enough indicia of another separate economic unit, isn't that correct?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2971.334,2972.576,"That is one of the indicia, yes."
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2972.576,2976.773,"And that alone is enough is it not under the Knowles case, any one of these three you told us?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2976.773,2977.673,That's correct.
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2977.673,2979.891,"So did she could do that, she can get the Food Stamps, can't she?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2981.849,2983.273,"Yes, that's correct."
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2985.351,3006.467,"Well now -- now of course she can't do very much with 33 cents a day, pooling or not pooling but if – why is she worse off if she gets Food Stamps by doing her shopping separately and the other member of the household do her shopping separately and together they all have what you claim they should have as a household?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,3006.467,3014.11,"Well Your Honor, there are other needs that people have other than food as well and as a result she has got health needs, she has got --"
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3014.11,3017.467,"She will have all the needs with or without Food Stamps, will she not?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,3017.467,3018.661,Yes she has.
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3026.574,3045.069,"I still not understand why if she is eligible for Food Stamps by the simple expedient of going to the market by herself and her fellow member of the household, the other woman can also go to the market by herself and they could aggregate those two Food Stamps?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,3045.069,3047.451,Well they can't aggregate those food stamps because --
1972.72-534,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3047.451,3048.98,"They can have a common kitchen, you told us that?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,3048.98,3052.296,"Yes they can have a common kitchen, but they can't purchase food in common."
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3052.296,3060.794,"But if they get, if on the oasis and they could pool it all together and get the food stamps how much will she get in Food Stamp?"
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,3060.794,3064.358,She would get $36 in Food Stamps per month.
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3064.358,3069.785,Well do you live any better on 33 cents than you do on a $1 a day.
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,3069.785,3071.257,"Yes you do Your Honor, clearly you do."
1972.72-534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3071.257,3077.646,You have tried some time --
1972.72-534,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,3077.646,3081.414,My time is up.
1972.72-534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3081.414,3084.983,Mr. Randolph do you have anything further?
1972.72-534,2,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,3084.983,3088.42,I have nothing further.
1972.72-534,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3088.42,3089.018,Thank you Gentleman.
