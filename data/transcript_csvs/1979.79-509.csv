1979.79-509,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.27,We will hear arguments first this morning in Exxon Corporation v. Wisconsin Department of Revenue.
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,23.587,27.211,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.915,409.042,"Except if it weren't unitary, it would be rather relevant, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,409.042,418.154,"If the taxpayer wasn't unitary, you wouldn't meet the condition precedent and you wouldn't even get to the analysis of extraterritorial taxation."
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,418.154,423.6,"Why wouldn't you if the state tried to tax it, why, they would tell them it couldn't."
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,423.6,426.632,"Well, we would be here as we are now, Mr. Justice White --"
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.632,429.697,Saying they were taxing out of state income?
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,429.697,435.75,We would be saying that you were reaching outside the state to tax extraterritorial income.
1979.79-509,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,494.843,503.878,"Just as a matter of curiosity, in your separate accounting how did you allocate the costs of your central office to operations in Wisconsin?"
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,503.878,509.259,"There are two types of separate accounting in the record, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.181,583.677,"I am sure Mr. Justice Blackmun, as I am, is waiting for your answer to his question about the central office overhead."
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,583.677,586.184,"I am trying to get to that, but I wanted to give you the background of the facts to answer the question."
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.184,589.024,We understand that part of it.
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,589.024,601.528,"The finding of fact that the accounting for the functional departments could be determined from the taxpayer's books and records also was not appealed, not challenged on appeal."
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.93,659.064,"Would you suggest that wherever a company claims that it can do this, that it is also claiming that it shouldn't be treated as a unitary business?"
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,659.064,673.142,"Perhaps not in every case, but certainly where a factual record is made that demonstrates conclusively that the income being taxed by a state is extraterritorial, then whether or not the taxpayer is unitary --"
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.142,676.115,"Well, that part of its business isn't part of the unit then?"
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,676.115,677.361,That would be our argument.
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,677.361,683.785,So you would say here that the only unitary business there was in Wisconsin was the marketing then?
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,683.785,689.221,"That is what the trial court determined and we are well satisfied with that decision, Mr. Justice White."
1979.79-509,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.221,691.873,But the Supreme Court of Wisconsin didn't agree with you on that point?
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,691.873,695.587,The Supreme Court of Wisconsin didn't agree with us on much of anything and --
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.587,698.557,What do you think a unitary business finding means?
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,714.211,724.288,"Well, the position of the appellee would be -- and perhaps the Wisconsin Supreme Court -- would be that you lock-step yourself into and if you have any activities in the state, then your total --"
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.288,741.519,"But in your books and in talking about unitary businesses and allocation formulas, doesn't unitary mean that it is so unitary that it is appropriate to apply an allocation formula?"
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,741.519,749.836,"To be very honest, Mr. Justice White, I can't say that I know what unitary means because it is used in so many inconsistent ways."
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.309,762.574,"But the way it is used in this case, you would think it automatically precludes your attempt to separately account."
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,762.574,783.487,"That is the position of the appellee, as I understand it, and our position is that that is -- that unitary is a superfluous concept and that you must look to the underlying constitutional principles of both due process and the commerce clause to determine whether a particular activity can be apportioned."
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,838.665,864.832,"What of companies who are conglomerates, even if they are not separately organized as corporations, say they have ten divisions, each division is engaged in an absolutely separate business, one in making clothes and something else, running theatres, another manufacturing trucks, another division which runs banks, do they treat each one of them as unitary businesses or do they --"
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,864.832,884.046,"Well, I can't speak for corporations generally, Your Honor, but my perception and my understanding is that each of those, if the proof is proper, can be identified as separate unitary businesses and only those businesses who have material activities in the state of Wisconsin could be apportioned."
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.83,887.531,And you are saying that your company should be treated that way?
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,887.531,889.122,I am saying that one of our --
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,889.122,890.53,"You are separate enough, anyway?"
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,890.53,897.828,-- due process arguments is that each functional department can be treated as a separate unitary business.
1979.79-509,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,915.964,921.607,How many states in the country does Exxon do business in at the present time?
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,921.607,924.384,"My belief is all of them, Your Honor."
1979.79-509,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,924.384,937.511,"I suppose if every state in the union had the same apportionment as Wisconsin, you might be taxed more than 100 percent?"
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,937.511,946.901,"Well, not if every state had identical definitions and identical formulas, but clearly that is not the case."
1979.79-509,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,961.012,962.862,I see.
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,967.522,1001.692,"I guess if every state apportioned in an identical manner, you wouldn't have the argument perhaps under due process, but you would still have the argument that if the situs state where the oil well is located had the power to tax all of the income from that oil well, and other states in addition were apportioning that income from the oil well, that you would still have a commerce clause argument because of the burden of multiple taxation."
1979.79-509,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1014.429,1019.954,Does this record show oppressive multiple taxation?
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,1019.954,1022.542,"My position is that it does, Your Honor."
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.48,1060.558,"Well, I am asking does the record show actual multiple taxation, so that you are being doubly taxed?"
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,1060.558,1066.853,The record does not show the actuality of multiple taxation in actual numbers.
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.437,1106.859,Does the record tell us wether Texas uses a three-factor formula or just taxes separately as you would have Wisconsin do?
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,1106.859,1110.512,"I do not believe, Your Honor, that that is in the record."
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.512,1111.46,Could I ask one other question.
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,1123.72,1124.958,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-509,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.958,1135.456,"Is the theory of that exclusion that those sales were not part of the unitary business or alternatively that even if they were part of the unitary business, they should not be treated as part of the taxable income?"
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,1135.456,1145.32,"Wisconsin has a statute, part of this statute in issue that says the income from any farm, mine or quarry shall be allocable and not apportionable."
1979.79-509,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1195.557,1208.769,May I ask whether the asset factors and the payroll factors that contributed to the generation of the sales to third parties at situs were included in the denominator of the formula?
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,1208.769,1228.784,"My understanding is that they were not, although they were excluded by something the record calls a barrel formula which is an extremely complex and an arbitrary method of dividing the apportionable property from the non-apportionable property and the apportionable payroll from the non-apportionable payroll."
1979.79-509,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1255.552,1260.059,"As I understand, there is no real issue on the fairness of the formula if it is appropriate to apply the formula."
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,1260.059,1265.415,"Well, there was an issue below and in fact part of that issue was remanded, but that is not before the Court."
1979.79-509,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1449.494,1463.515,"Mr. Ragatz, could I ask you one other question, a factual question. Lately we have heard a lot about windfall profits that oil companies may have earned or may be earning as a result of increase in the value of oil."
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,1472.184,1484.742,"Well, the years in issue here were 1965 through 1968, so I am not aware of any windfall profits and certainly there is nothing in the record that would indicate anything like that."
1979.79-509,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1589.204,1603.748,"Well, you are suggesting the other side shouldn't say a word because you are saying that they may not say that this so-called income that is admittedly earned outside the state, none of it was earned in Wisconsin and yet they are taxing it."
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,1603.748,1610.654,"They are taxing it, Your Honor, and they have not even challenged on appeal the determination of that income."
1979.79-509,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1626.01,1634.815,"Of course, I suppose they could say that this is unitary business and the way to find out where income is earned is to apply the state formula."
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,1634.815,1647.567,But the unitary approach is just a rationalization then for the state to tax extraterritorial income and it doesn't get at the root constitutional issues and those issues are whether there is a rational relationship --
1979.79-509,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1647.567,1652.606,And your approach is just a way to say the formula is inaccurate?
1979.79-509,0,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,1652.606,1658.393,"The formula as applied here results in the taxation of extraterritorial income, yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-509,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.075,1662.361,Very well.
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,1667.228,1671.171,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1818.062,1829.47,"Mr. Wilcox, do you believe that Wisconsin could constitutionally adopt a system that your colleague has suggested that you must follow?"
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,1829.47,1832.062,Do you mean could we adopt a system where we tax --
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.062,1858.68,Could you say all the companies like Exxon who are capable of doing it are supposed to divide up their so-called unitary business and do a cost accounting job and figure out the income from their various divisions and if there is income from outside the state we just won't take it?
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,1858.68,1885.582,"Well, that is interesting, if the states took that approach -- and I assume that some will, because they find it advantageous -- that could result if the corporation has a net loss under that reasoning, some states could say well, you may have had a total loss nationwide, but you don't have a loss here, you've got income here because exploration and production or whatever it might be, refining, produces income, what we would have is we --"
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.582,1896.257,Does any state that you know of allow this type of accounting and tax returning that your colleague suggests?
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,1896.257,1899.088,I think some states may have tried separate accounting themselves.
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1914.591,1933.219,"Suppose if the exploration and development division or what they argue is a separate division is the most profitable of the three, is it not likely that the state of Texas might prefer using Exxon's approach and tax on that basis?"
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,1933.219,1940.206,"If that is where all their income is, I think it is in other states, but I don't believe those states generally do tax it."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.906,1961.297,"Because I suppose just looking at the state statute, you couldn't really tell what that state would regard as a unitary business and conceivably they could say, well, a unitary business down in Texas is exploration and development, just as Exxon argues here -- and I suppose Exxon down there would take the position you are taking up here."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,1961.297,1961.971,That is possible.
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1961.971,1968.868,And that certainly raises the possibility of an inconsistent result at least.
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,1968.868,1974.308,I think one of the basic points I would like to make is that Wisconsin does have a three-factor formula.
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.768,2062.339,Don't you first have to determine what the unitary business includes?
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2068.976,2073.053,"Well, I think that is part of appellant's argument."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.053,2074.087,"Well, don't you?"
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2074.087,2085.628,"I think you do have to determine what is included in a unitary business, and I guess in one of the briefs filed by one of the amicus has indicated that Exxon is not a unitary business in this area."
1979.79-509,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2102.295,2111.484,"Well, that may be so but I guess in this case it is just by the accident of legal entity and ownership that you can treat it altogether."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2143.076,2146.498,"Not Wisconsin, not under Wisconsin law."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.051,2185.734,"I suppose you treat it as a unitary business even if there is a holding company and it has three separate subsidiaries, one production, one refining and one marketing, you would treat it as --"
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2185.734,2191.436,Wisconsin would not treat as a unitary business if there is more than one corporate structure.
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.436,2191.717,I see.
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2191.717,2194.092,"In other words, we stay within the corporate structure."
1979.79-509,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2198.578,2202.66,And Wisconsin didn't force this choice upon Exxon?
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2202.66,2213.248,"We didn't force them to incorporate as they did, no."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.555,2334.078,Are you connected with the interstate Multistate Tax Commission?
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2334.078,2336.302,We are not a member of the Multistate Tax Commission.
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.302,2337.742,Were you ever?
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2337.742,2341.704,"Not to my knowledge, but I can't answer that for sure."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.704,2356.616,And do you know whether there is any pending effort in Congress to address establishing some uniform system in taxing interstate businesses around the country?
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2356.616,2360.822,"Well, I'm not aware that there is anything present."
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2369.492,2398.566,"Mr. Wilcox, before you sit down, is there anything in the Wisconsin statute that would prevent Wisconsin -- let me give you a -- assume for a second that the marketing division was the really profitable one within the company, that their accounting showed that, and it might therefore be in Wisconsin's interests to treat the marketing operation as a separate unitary business, as I think the Department of Revenue did at one stage of this proceeding."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2408.002,2409.729,I don't think the statute prevents that.
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2418.347,2422.309,Didn't the taxing authority treat marketing separate in this case?
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2422.309,2426.406,What initially happened is Exxon filed tax returns on the basis of --
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.406,2429.955,"They said just Wisconsin, and then the first round didn't they just expand the --"
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2429.955,2431.571,"Oh, you mean the Tax Appeals Commission."
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.571,2431.95,Yes.
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2431.95,2432.238,Okay.
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.523,2435.957,I'm sorry.
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2436.644,2442.601,"Initially, yes, they did divide up Exxon into essentially three unitary businesses."
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.601,2449.607,"Isn't it fairly reasonable to assume that had that been the most profitable division of the company, that that might have stuck?"
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2449.607,2451.46,You are saying that we might not have appealed?
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.46,2451.823,Yes.
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2451.823,2453.199,I think that might be true.
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2456.119,2469.405,And isn't it equally possible that -- I'm just thinking of the possibilities of multiple taxation -- that down in Texas they might regard the exploration and development as the separate unitary business?
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2472.612,2488.629,"No, Mr. Justice Stevens, I am not here to suggest that all states, any more than all corporations, act consistently when they see that another approach would be more advantageous from a financial position."
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2502.15,2509.778,"I would make the suggestion that Mr. Justice White did, that perhaps the best answer to this problem would be to get Congress into the act."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2509.778,2516.265,"Well, I would hope that we would not have to wait for that, frankly."
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.8,2540.825,"But the uniformity that you describe is uniformity in the prevailing practices to use three-factor formulas, but is there uniformity in how you go about defining unitary businesses, which is perhaps equally important but I'm not sure there is the same degree of uniformity on that problem, is there?"
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2540.825,2548.071,"Well, again I haven't dealt too in depth on whether Exxon is a unitary business, I think the record does support it."
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.794,2574.936,"Your argument, as I understand it, is that once you define the unitary business then it is just a question of applying the formula to find out what portion is reasonable attributable to the state."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2574.936,2578.296,"Essentially, yes, but I think it has to be properly applied."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.08,2692.716,"Suppose just parallel to Exxon there is another operation going on from Texas to refining to Wisconsin by three separate corporations all independently owned, but they had exactly the same flow, and it was just that the market allocated where the income, who was going to earn the income."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2719.321,2721.198,"Not under the Wisconsin statute, we can't and --"
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.198,2722.552,Well --
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2722.552,2725.222,"There is at least a sale there, I believe, Your Honor."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2725.222,2725.444,"Oh, yes."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2725.444,2726.82,"But you do have separate corporations, you have --"
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.82,2750.29,"You have separate sales, you have -- but it turns out, when you compare that Exxon has made exactly internally, that one company has made exactly the same allocation of profits to its refining, to its exploration and to its marketing as these separate companies end up doing, just at arm's length."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2750.29,2752.082,"Well, they said they have."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.353,2756.945,"Well, let's assume they have, let's assume it is absolutely identical."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2773.369,2790.855,"I guess I wouldn't use the term nonsense, but I would answer yes, I do believe it better allocates income because of the judgments -- and I think they may be reasonable business judgments -- but what you have, just take the other side of the coin, let's assume that, okay, by separate accounting this is possible."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2806.146,2813.934,But the same guy inevitably in this kind of a setup is setting both the selling price and the buying price.
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2817.937,2834.702,"Well, they said it is based upon Pratt's Oil Gram and they claim there is no negotiation, but I just -- in the oil industry, to suggest that this type of price is one that tax authorities have to accept, I just can't conceive of how it would work."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.702,2836.515,Let me just pursue that for a second.
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2855.612,2856.953,"Well, I think --"
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2856.953,2859.997,But you said nevertheless you still had the right to treat it as a unitary business.
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2859.997,2867.159,"I think the statements about what we conceded, right from the beginning those figures were objected to as irrelevant."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.389,2914.353,"Well, General Wilcox, let me put the question this way."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2954.544,2960.4,"No, I think you've analyzed the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision essentially correct."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2967.826,2971.454,"If you think the accounting is material, we ought to send it back for some findings of fact."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,2992.333,2993.047,Okay.
1979.79-509,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.685,3045.216,"Well, it is also really relevant to the question of whether it is proper to treat as a unitary the question business because the whole reason for the unitary business is to solve the problem of how much is fair to attribute to Wisconsin in some big business, we don't know how much business was done here, and so you develop the unitary business concept and say we don't know, we will use a formula and that will give us a rough estimate."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,3071.272,3090.171,"Again, integrity in accounting, I'm not challenging it for the business purpose but I am for tax purposes and I think you have -- that is the question, and I think if the unitary concept has meaning then you don't have separate accounting to start over again and break apart what you've put together."
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.182,3130.374,"It sounds though, with your colloquy with Justice Stevens, that you accept the fact that Exxon's figures with respect to its three departments are precisely the same figures that they would be if they were three independently owned corporations."
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,3145.274,3150.361,I don't believe I accept their figures would be the same if they were three independent corporations.
1979.79-509,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3150.579,3163.45,"Well, the Wisconsin Supreme Court accepted the integrity of the figures, didn't they?"
1979.79-509,1,26335,gerald_s_wilcox,,3163.45,3170.953,"But I don't think that follows that they said they would be the same if they were three independent corporations, because I don't believe they would."
1979.79-509,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3194.85,3195.423,Very well.
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3197.379,3198.918,I believe I have a minute or two left.
1979.79-509,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3198.918,3203.161,You have two minutes left.
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3203.161,3218.268,"Perhaps I can shed a little further light in response to some of the questions that Mr. Wilcox had, but first I would point out that as I understand Mr. Wilcox's argument, he still really hasn't reached the constitutional principles."
1979.79-509,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3280.093,3296.118,"Mr. Ragatz, didn't you say earlier that if the 44 states which applied the three-factor formula all taxed Wisconsin income of Exxon, like Wisconsin does, there would be no multiple taxation?"
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3296.118,3298.894,"I do not believe that was my answer, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.79-509,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3319.624,3325.252,But is unexercised power a constitutional defect?
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3325.252,3337.102,"The long line of cases that establish the multiple taxation doctrine have established that it is the risk or burden of multiple taxation, not the actuality of multiple taxation."
1979.79-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3341.04,3356.449,"But the Justice asked you if all the states operated exactly like Wisconsin and applied their formula which would be just like Wisconsin to Exxon, just like Wisconsin had, there would not be double taxation."
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3356.449,3360.237,If the states did not --
1979.79-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.237,3363.059,"They have a formula and that is all they do, they apply their formula."
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3363.059,3373.826,"Oh, mathematically, you could probably come out with 100 percent of the income but I don't believe that reaches the commerce clause question or the situs income question for the producing states have the right to tax it."
1979.79-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3375.174,3391.481,"They have the right to tax it, but you are just saying if in the producing state they have an extraction tax, just a gross tax on extraction, would you say that is the kind of a situs tax you are talking about?"
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3391.481,3397.645,"If it is taxing the same activity that Wisconsin is trying to tax, then it --"
1979.79-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.645,3402.669,"Well, it is a gross tax, it is a gross production tax."
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3402.669,3403.515,But if that --
1979.79-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3403.515,3404.858,It isn't a net income tax.
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3404.858,3414.566,"If that gross production is sitused in that state and then for Wisconsin to use that gross production in computing its formula, you end up with an overlap."
1979.79-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.763,3429.243,"Well, on that basis the same thing if the producing state just has property taxes."
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3429.243,3435.896,The property tax I don't believe is analogous to the situation here at issue.
1979.79-509,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3435.896,3438.323,I know you have to say that.
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3438.323,3446.244,"And here we are dealing with Wisconsin's statute that specifically allocates the income from a farm, mine or quarry to situs."
1979.79-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3446.244,3453.725,"Mr. Ragatz, do you contend that it is constitutionally impermissible for Wisconsin to treat this as a unitary business?"
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3453.725,3461.958,I contend that it is constitutionally impermissible for Wisconsin to put on blinders and say that if this is a unitary business everything from there on can be apportioned.
1979.79-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3461.958,3463.39,I understand that.
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3470.793,3480.135,Not if a second step in the analysis is required and that is to determine whether there is a rational relationship between the income --
1979.79-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3480.135,3481.566,Your answer then is no?
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3481.566,3482.313,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3486.079,3496.649,But you would say yes it is if they treat at as a unitary business for purposes of applying their formula?
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3496.649,3497.962,I'm not sure I understand your question.
1979.79-509,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3497.962,3512.585,"Well, you say that Wisconsin says it is unitary and therefore our formula applies, and if that is what calling a unitary business necessarily entails, it is unconstitutional to treat it as a unitary business."
1979.79-509,2,43242,thomas_g_ragatz,,3512.585,3532.123,"The application of the Wisconsin statute we contend is unconstitutional and we further contend that if the proof of extraterritorial taxation that is contained in the record here is not sufficient, then I respectfully submit that perhaps such proof is judicially impossible."
1979.79-509,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3532.123,3532.751,"Thank you, gentleman."
