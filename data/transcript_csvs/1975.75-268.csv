1975.75-268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,59.894,We will hear arguments next in Radzanower against Touche and Ross.
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,62.689,63.273,Thank you sir.
1975.75-268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,198.875,221.841,"Mr. Sands, you say in one instance and you are talking of course about the 34 Act, but 15 U.S.C. 77 V, the 33 Act, and the Interstate Land Sales Regulation, there are certainly are other Acts giving general venue for specific courses of action, which would be effective by a decision in this case, are there not?"
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,221.841,227.8,"Your Honor, we of course, are concerned with a 34 Act and a 33 Act, which were overlaid as well."
1975.75-268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,308.508,315.267,"I thought that there were no National Banks until 1863, before that it was the Bank of the United States?"
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,315.267,376.843,"Your Honor, my understanding is that there were national chattered banks prior to 1863, but the 1863 legislation, which then found itself amended in 1864 was an all encompassing scheme for the institution and the using the broad scale operation of national banks, but the first bank we find out in the brief of the SEC as amicus in their footnote --"
1975.75-268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,376.843,381.707,"Well, the point may not be important to your argument, but I did not mean to have you spend a real good time on it."
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,381.707,404.603,"My recollection is not precise as to the thing in the SEC's amicus brief, but it is in the footnote that the First Bank was called Bank of the United States and then we had a lapse of its charter some ten years or so later and then later another bank was set-up to administer the fiscal policy of the United States called the First Bank of the United States or First National Bank of United States."
1975.75-268,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,494.707,504.103,Mr. Sands is there anything in the legislative history that shows that Congress actually considered national banks at the time of the enactment of the Securities Acts?
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,504.103,508.887,"Mr. Justice Blackmun I say yes, emphatically yes."
1975.75-268,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,537.716,540.664,"Direct my question, however, to the venue provisions?"
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,540.664,541.801,Yes sir.
1975.75-268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1249.993,1269.269,"What is you say is, just before you proceed if I may interrupt you, it has been your submission up to now that these two statues can co-exist without -- can compatibly and continually co-exist."
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1271.015,1273.335,That is my strongest argument.
1975.75-268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1283.503,1330.168,"If one only looked only at the text of the venue provision of the National Bank Act, the 1864 Act, your argument will have a very great deal of (Inaudible) I think, because it simple provides that actions and proceedings against any banking association maybe be brought, but we have Langdeau case and the Michigan case, which construed that language in that statute to say that this is exclusive, it is not permissive, that it is exclusive and I do not really follow you when you said that these two venue statutes can co-exist."
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1342.918,1343.44,I cannot --
1975.75-268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1343.44,1347.728,"You obviously disagree, because you say they can both co-exist?"
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1347.728,1355.551,I do not fully agree with my very learned brother at the SEC and I have told him that.
1975.75-268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1372.215,1375.931,"No, but they did construe the venue provision of the National Bank Act."
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1375.931,1381.719,"Yes sir, but they construed vis-Ã -vis a State Act."
1975.75-268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1438.455,1443.828,There is no question to the fact that Congress could have amended the National Bank Act venue provision.
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1455.982,1460.661,"Explicit it did not, implicit we believe they did."
1975.75-268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1464.253,1464.77,"No, go on."
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1464.77,1480.759,"Implicit we believe they did for the precise reason that the 34 Act was an all encompassing method of operations with regard to security, something quite new in this nation."
1975.75-268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1541.554,1544.626,Why did you abandon your waiver argument?
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1544.626,1545.817,I have not sir.
1975.75-268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.817,1546.927,I thought maybe you have?
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1546.927,1548.851,"No sir, I have not."
1975.75-268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.087,1572.58,"I notice you did not cite the Nearble case 308 U.S. where this Court held that there had been a waiver by a corporate defendant of a right to be sued under the statute, by filing of a consent to service of process, not too different from that in our case?"
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1572.58,1577.118,"No sir, we did not cite that case."
1975.75-268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.075,1591.778,"You did not -- you have not raised the waiver issue in your petition for certiorari, right?"
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1591.778,1593.006,We did sir.
1975.75-268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.312,1610.147,Do you think your question presented -- subsumes the waiver issue?
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1626.161,1626.475,Yes sir.
1975.75-268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.475,1627.815,Does that include waiver?
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1627.815,1630.434,No sir.
1975.75-268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.434,1632.817,What is the end of the waiver question?
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1632.817,1647.502,"No, the two questions, which I did present in our brief, I include the second as a waiver and I have said sir without a question that the waiver is the weakest of the two arguments."
1975.75-268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.502,1652.276,"We did not add certiorari on that question, because it was not presented?"
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1652.276,1660.438,I am perfectly content Your Honor to hold firm on the question of both statutes living together or in the alternative.
1975.75-268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.438,1664.136,Your argument is is quite error somehow?
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1664.136,1667.125,"No, I do not sir."
1975.75-268,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1667.125,1671.791,"(Inaudible) the waiver not in the question presented, but you talked about it elsewhere --"
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1671.791,1672.617,In the body sir.
1975.75-268,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1672.617,1679.295,You gave much greater emphasis to it in the District Court than you have here in your brief?
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1679.295,1685.74,"Your Honor, Mr. Gatley (ph) who argued in the District Court and in the Circuit Court was met with the dilemma."
1975.75-268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1849.169,1852.566,(Inaudible) counsel.
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1852.566,1856.139,I am sorry sir.
1975.75-268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1858.202,1860.341,(Inaudible)
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1860.341,1861.265,Thank you.
1975.75-268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1883.528,1884.733,Is that in your brief?
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1884.733,1885.883,No sir.
1975.75-268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1885.883,1888.523,"Go on, finish it."
1975.75-268,0,28686,ira_jay_sands,,1888.523,1894.043,It can easily set the matter to rest by new congressional explicit language.
1975.75-268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1895.427,1898.903,Mr. Gates.
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,1898.903,1902.935,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1975.75-268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2151.394,2153.63,Was Nearble (ph) argued to the District Court?
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,2153.63,2160.018,It was not your Honor; it was not cited in any of the briefs.
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.704,2251.809,Are you implying that that question is not properly here either?
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,2251.809,2253.121,"Well, yes I am Your Honor."
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.121,2257.072,"Well, you made this very argument in your opposition for the petition for Certiorari."
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,2257.072,2258.134,That is correct.
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.134,2261.884,And we granted the petition with that single question in it?
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,2261.884,2266.519,I am well aware that this Court has the right to --
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2266.519,2270.652,"(Voice Overlap) we nevertheless, we had this very argument --"
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,2270.652,2286.592,"I understand that Justice White that you have that, but I suggest that on this record and I say with no disrespect, that Certiorari was improperly granted."
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.745,2311.804,If you have any doubt how the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit would have decided the issue that is now stated that was stated in the petition for Certiorari?
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,2311.804,2339.158,"None whatsoever as I read the opinion of Chief Judge Henry Friendly in Bruns against Nordeman, followed by the decision of Clyde (ph) against Power (ph), I can see no possibility that Second taking it for a review and as a matter a fact, the Ninth Circuit both in 1970 and 1972 had precisely this issue --"
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.158,2353.512,Are you suggesting we ought to send this case -- to dismiss for petition for cert as improperly granted or vacated and remand so that the Second Circuit may tell us what the answer to this question is in the Second Circuit?
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,2353.512,2366.337,"I think it would presumptuous Mr. Justice White for me to tell you what this Court ought to do and I would therefore refrain from responding, but let me answer it this way."
1975.75-268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2534.818,2537.104,We will resume there at 1 o' clock. Mr. Gates.
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,2537.104,2539.928,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.75-268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2539.928,2544.511,Mr. Gates you may pick up where you left off.
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,2544.511,2548.646,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1975.75-268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.663,2628.324,But did he not go on and say that they were foreclosed in that Circuit by an earlier decision too?
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,2628.324,2630.714,That is not my recollection --
1975.75-268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2630.714,2632.839,I think that were two points that he made.
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,2632.839,2637.816,I will stand corrected if I am in error.
1975.75-268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3077.804,3094.139,"Mr. Gates would it had been sufficient in your view, dealing with the repeal intent, if somebody had got up on the floor of Congress and said that the 34 Act venue provision is broad and we mean it to apply just in its literal language?"
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3094.139,3108.254,"It would have been very considerable assistance Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if we had found something like that, but we have found nothing of that in nature to indicate that there was any real consideration given to this particular issue."
1975.75-268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3124.907,3136.497,"But, if it would have been sufficient instead of get on the floor and say that why is not even more impressive that they used broad, general language in the statute itself?"
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3136.497,3159.751,"Well, I suppose one can make that argument, I do not happen to subscribe to it, based upon the decisions which have emanated from this Court, but certainly, conceptually one can make that argument and I would be lacking in candor if I did not acknowledge it."
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3559.049,3568.539,Has there been some case in this Court construing the word located in Section 94?
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3568.539,3574.085,"There is Mr. Justice White, but I am frank to tell you the name of it escapes me."
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3574.085,3579.852,Do you think it is actually been decided here that located means the place of its incorporation?
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3579.852,3580.568,"No, Your Honor."
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3580.568,3582.232,What does it means then?
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3582.232,3594.031,"I understand that located equates itself to what I would term what might be the principal place of business, if you talk about it in terms of general corporate law."
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3615.787,3623.71,"But, it says that the or in any state county or municipal court in the county or city in which the said association is located?"
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3623.71,3642.139,"That is correct Mr. Justice White, but as I interpret the statute, as I have understood from the decisions from this and other courts, the word locate relates itself to actions, which are brought in state courts and that is where the bank must be located."
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3648.264,3652.342,What if this action has been brought under state law in a state court?
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3652.342,3659.37,"Well, then under you Honorâs decision in Langdeau I do not think we have any problem.[Laughter]"
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3659.37,3665.819,"Well, I know, but that case did not focus on location, did it?"
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3665.819,3680.554,"Well, there were 145 defendants in that action of which two were national banks and in an opinion written by Your Honor you said that they had to be go to another (Voice Overlap)."
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3680.554,3691.045,"The big issue in Langdeau is whether it was exclusive, whether that venue provision was -- whether the word may must --"
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3691.045,3691.955,That is quite true.
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3691.955,3697.939,"And, it did not really go to the question what the meaning of located was?"
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3697.939,3699.755,That is also correct.
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3699.755,3702.904,"Well, so again I ask you, do you know of any cases that construes it?"
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3702.904,3704.575,I have to tell you I do not.
1975.75-268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3704.575,3704.873,"Okay, thank you."
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3704.873,3708.203,"Thank you, Mr. Justice White."
1975.75-268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3708.203,3709.456,(Inaudible)
1975.75-268,1,41392,samuel_e_gates,,3709.456,3714.223,"It has -- I am sorry Your Honor, thank you very much."
1975.75-268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3714.223,3715.107,Thank you gentlemen.
