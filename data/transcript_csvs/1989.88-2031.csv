1989.88-2031,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.138,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-2031, United States against Marsha B. Kokinda."
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,10.138,35.065,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.618,121.683,"Now, Mr. Roberts, will you tell us' exactly what this regulation covers?"
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,129.791,131.38,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.72,138.616,Would it permit handing out a leaflet that said we hope you'll contribute to our cause?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,138.616,142.799,--The Postal Service has construed the regulation to allow that.
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.749,145.269,Is what?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,145.269,150.324,--speech or conduct that solicits an immediate donation of charity on the premises.
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.324,151.674,A collection on the spot.
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,151.674,152.645,On the spot.
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.658,174.952,Do you think it's more bothersome than the leafletting?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,177.323,185.447,"I... I think it is, Your Honor, and I think it follows from common sense, as Justice Blackmun noted in his separate opinion in the Heffron case."
1989.88-2031,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,242.846,247.291,"Mr. Roberts, what about asking a passerby to sign a petition?"
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,247.291,249.491,That is not prohibited.
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,292.02,295.142,What were these problems?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,295.142,302.769,"The problems were congestion at postal entryways, the distraction of the postmasters and their clerks from their duties."
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,314.047,337.844,"Are these problems that could be addressed by time, place and manner requirements, by making the location of such a booth or a table more out of the way and prohibiting it on peak... at peak hours or peak days or something of that sort?"
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,337.844,342.538,The Service expressly considered that alternative in 1978.
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,402.455,432.636,"Well, Mr. Roberts, I would assume that if the post offices are permitting petition gathering, signature gathering, that some of those could be conducted in a very aggressive manner, and very likely the Post Office is willing to have some kind of restrictions or regulations that it's willing to enforce to make sure that patrons aren't subjected to abusive tactics."
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,432.636,448.697,"Well, it is true that, as I indicated in response to Justice Stevens' question, that petition gathering can have many of the same problems as... as solicitation; but given the Postal Service's experience, it wasn't creating serious problems."
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.967,456.884,"Does it have no reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on the picketing and the leafletting and the petition gathering?"
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,456.884,465.381,"--There is a prohibition on creating... I think it's creating a disturbance, hindering, blocking the entryway."
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,468.732,475.226,Could that sort of restriction not be applied to this type of activity?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,475.226,481.04,It could be applied to the activity if it fell within the restriction.
1989.88-2031,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,532.928,538.291,"Mr. Roberts, this is based on a regulation, isn't it?"
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,538.291,539.043,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-2031,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,539.043,547.016,Is there any significance in not... that it is a regulation rather than a statute?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,547.016,551.311,"I think not, Your Honor."
1989.88-2031,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,571.857,576.972,"You don't cite the... the authority under which the regulations are issued, do you?"
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,576.972,579.724,I believe we do.
1989.88-2031,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,671.075,673.408,Are many postal facilities like this one?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,676.821,685.426,"Well, the Bowie Post Office facility is the pattern that's used by the Service in suburban settings."
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,737.134,745.181,"Well, Mr. Roberts, is it clear that public forum analysis even applies here?"
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,758.562,764.669,"--Your Honor, the Court has applied forum access to areas in which the public was given general access."
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,788.955,794.13,Do you think it's a satisfactory sort of analysis?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,798.935,799.766,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2031,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,799.766,811.894,"There's been a lot of criticism of it, and there certainly is... are suggestions in some of the briefs in this case that we should get off that tack and onto something else in these cases."
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,811.894,812.305,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2031,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,877.911,883.995,Do you... do you think the government's position would be the same or would have been the same had this been a Red Cross solicitation?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,883.995,885.517,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1989.88-2031,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,896.046,904.922,"Well, it may... maybe it would apply, but you started off by mentioning Mr. LaRouche, and--"
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,904.922,907.714,"--Well, I don't--"
1989.88-2031,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,907.714,908.615,--I wondered.
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,908.615,914.128,"--I don't... I did not, actually, I don't think, mention who the respondents were."
1989.88-2031,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,914.128,915.27,You mentioned there were 50 complaints.
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,917.904,921.016,I... I can't say that there would be.
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,969.418,982.989,"Well, let's... let's assume that... that the Service, the Postal Service would have authority to forbid all of this kind of communications that you now permit."
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,982.989,983.67,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.67,997.149,Does that... can't you still hold this particular regulation invalid under the First Amendment even if you have that broader authority?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1009.288,1016.724,The burden under the nonpublic forum is to show that the regulation is a reasonable one.
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.724,1017.676,How do you show that?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1017.676,1033.165,"The Postal Service when it adopted this ban on solicitation, it noted in the Federal Register announcement it was expressly allowing these other activities, leafletting and picketing, and it explained what the difference was between solicitation and those other forms of activities."
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.168,1059.854,"Well, you... you had a... you had a chance to convince the lower courts of this, I suppose?"
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1059.854,1068.072,"And we've been successful in the, as I've indicated, Third, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh Circuits, and we persuaded Judge Widener below."
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.072,1071.003,But not the majority?
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1071.003,1073.955,But not... not the two judges in the majority.
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1073.955,1080.15,Who thought that... that... that this was just really just a minor bother for you.
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1080.15,1093.269,"Well, their analysis, first of all, was that this... the concrete apron, the access walkway, was a public forum, and once they reached that conclusion, of course, that's a much heavier burden for the Postal Service to carry."
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.232,1151.071,"Yes, but let's... let's just assume that the... that the court below was wrong in saying that this was a... that this sidewalk was a public forum, a general public forum like all other sidewalks."
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1158.195,1164.939,"Well, if it is a nonpublic forum, the Service need only show that its regulation is viewpoint neutral--"
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.939,1165.43,Yes.
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1165.43,1167.202,"--which it clearly is, and a reasonable one."
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.202,1167.353,Yes.
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1172.628,1178.602,"To show that it's reasonable, the first thing they have to do, I suppose, is show why solicitation is different from these other activities."
1989.88-2031,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.333,1209.106,"Mr. Roberts, didn't they allow solicitation inside the Post Office at that time?"
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1209.106,1211.289,Both... both inside and outside.
1989.88-2031,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1211.289,1216.492,"And wasn't that the problem of deciding whether to let the Red Cross... you know, you had your content discrimination then."
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1222.196,1230.324,"It's certainly true that the most serious problem was within the postal lobbies, but the regulation is not limited in that respect."
1989.88-2031,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.346,1243.032,"Which one might argue that perhaps it's overbroad for that reason, that it responds more broadly than the problem that it's addressed to."
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1243.032,1247.533,I don't think there's any functional significance... difference.
1989.88-2031,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.533,1250.565,"Well, is there a history of a problem outside the Post Office?"
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1250.565,1254.509,It's not referred to in the Federal Register notice.
1989.88-2031,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.488,1297.733,My memory is that lines are usually a little more... they fill up the lobby pretty often.
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1302.358,1309.632,"--It depends on the configuration of the lobby; and, of course, I suppose that solicitation would be off to a side away from the lines."
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1318.777,1325.221,"Well, yes, but you... but the regulation cover... would cover solicitation anywhere on that sidewalk."
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1325.221,1326.523,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2031,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1326.523,1329.615,And/or anywhere else--
1989.88-2031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1329.615,1330.556,In the parking lot.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1785.017,1789.819,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.938,1850.073,So do you disagree with... with the test that this regulation is valid if it's reasonable?
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1850.073,1851.505,I think that--
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.505,1857.678,And is it your... you just agree with the Fourth Circuit that it's unreasonable; is that it?
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1857.678,1875.519,"--Well, we agree with the Fourth Circuit in this context, Justice White, and that is, that this activity took place on a traditional public forum, and the reason set forth by the Postal Service for enforcing this prohibition did not reach the level of, in this particular case, compelling interest."
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.893,1884.885,I take it... I take it that you would... you would say the lobby of the Post Office is a traditional public forum?
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1884.885,1887.387,"--No, I would not say it was a traditional public forum."
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.968,1889.971,"Well, didn't the Fourth Circuit say it was?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1889.971,1891.14,"--No, they did not, Your Honor."
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.14,1891.731,What did they say?
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1891.731,1907.302,"The Fourth Circuit determined that the regulation, as applied to the sidewalk, now called an apron, is in fact a traditional public forum, and that the prohibition was not narrowly tailored, not that it was not justified by compelling interest."
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.302,1911.696,Would you say the regulation is valid inside the... inside the lobby?
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1911.696,1913.199,A complete prohibition?
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.199,1913.61,"No, no."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1915.282,1918.985,"I think that a line could be drawn; however, I don't think that it would be--"
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1918.985,1919.555,"Well, answer the question."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1919.555,1921.918,"--I think, yes, a complete ban on--"
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1921.918,1923.157,"No, no."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1923.518,1924.209,--On the solicitation--
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.209,1924.559,Yes.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1924.559,1926.332,--inside the lobby can be justified--
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.332,1928.633,Even though the other things are permitted?
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1928.633,1929.093,"--Well, that's--"
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.093,1930.863,That's what I want to know.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1930.863,1931.104,--Yes.
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.749,1939.08,"Well, that isn't... that isn't our case."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1941.184,1943.604,I think that... I think a blind can be drawn at that point--
1989.88-2031,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.604,1958.905,"--Suppose... suppose the people involved here who were arrested had been soliciting inside the post office, inside the building, and this case then came up to the Fourth Circuit, and it was decided the same way."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1961.747,1961.997,--No.
1989.88-2031,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2015.72,2021.166,"Well, just before you... you get on to that, let's assume that we rejected your argument on vagueness."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2029.071,2040.571,"--Yes, I would... I would... we would argue that even inside the lobby it would be of course content based, that is, the words being uttered by the particular individuals, the defendants in the lower court, and, of course, the respondents here."
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2049.235,2057.603,"Well, but on the other hand, it applies equally to the Girl Scouts and the Salvation Army and your client."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2057.603,2060.655,"It's... it's... in effect, it is a--"
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2060.655,2067.348,It... it is directed toward the asking for money on the premises.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2067.348,2068.259,--That's the way--
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2068.259,2071.201,So it's hard to say that's content based.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2071.201,2090.965,"--We would take it one step further, Your Honor, and that is the compelling interest test would still have to apply here because a particular type of expression, as Justice White said in the Grace case, has been eliminated from this particular forum, and that is, there does have to be a line drawn if you will where the activities should not take place."
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2094.306,2097.911,"Well, are you saying that the regulation is not content neutral?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2097.911,2105.126,I think it's... it's content neutral in... to the extent that it is being applied across the board.
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.464,2144.737,"But your... but your vaguest point, that's your vagueness point."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2165.735,2169.665,"--Yes, that is, and that is our position, and that is what one would have to look at."
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2214.568,2234.082,"Well, now Mr. Sekulow, do you... do you take the position that the government could not simply say that on postal premises we will have no activity of any kind by anybody unless it's addressed to post office business?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2234.082,2235.324,I think the--
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2235.324,2240.85,There won't be leafletting; there won't be picketing; there won't be soliciting; there won't be anything.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2244.571,2245.021,--Yes.
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2252.938,2257.711,"Well, if they can do that, why can't they do something less than that?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2257.711,2265.858,"--Because the Postal Service as now operating in the Bowie, Maryland Post Office, Justice O'Connor, is allowing a vast array of activities."
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2275.935,2291.954,"Yes, but if... if once you accept the fact that the Post Office could exclude every use other than the postal use, it seems to me that you have to accept the fact that they could permit some lesser restriction."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2291.954,2298.509,"--What I was referring to, Justice O'Connor, was the function as to how the Post Office operates."
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.859,2330.762,"It's a public thoroughfare only from the parking lot to the post office, isn't it?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2330.762,2330.992,Yes--
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2330.992,2332.604,Access to the post office.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2338.899,2347.186,"--Well, it's a public thoroughfare, Chief Justice, no different than any other municipal sidewalk; and that is that it's to a public thoroughfare for people to move to get to a location."
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2348.406,2351.598,Other sidewalks get people between locations.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2368.003,2369.075,--Yes--
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.075,2370.567,And it's the same thing with this sidewalk.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2372.269,2373.71,"--Oh, yes, but the post office--"
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2373.71,2375.763,It becomes a public thoroughfare because the public walks on it.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2376.871,2378.814,"--Oh, I think that's absolutely part of the... the analysis."
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2378.814,2382.797,Then my house is a public thoroughfare because members of the public come up to my door all the time.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2382.797,2386.5,"Your house, Justice Scalia, I assume is privately owned, and you have that right to exclude."
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2386.5,2386.92,"Well, this is privately owned, too."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2391.144,2392.777,The government has a right to exclude.
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2434.78,2446.119,"You mean so long as the government allows the public access to a government building, it has to show a compelling reason why there shouldn't be speech in the building?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2446.119,2448.059,"Not in the building, Your Honor."
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2451.391,2454.035,"Well, the post office is open to the general public, too."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2459.851,2476.442,"--The Postal Service themselves, in adopting the regulation prohibiting the solicitation of funds, specifically addressed itself to the problems that are associated inside the lobbies, the cramped areas, and that is a compatibility factor."
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2487.16,2492.873,"So you... you say the compelling interest standards governs inside the post office, but it's been met here?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2492.873,2511.406,"I think that argument could be made that in fact the public... that a compelling interest keeping solicitation outside of the busy areas of the postal office inside, yes, could be met, but that would not apply to the outside areas open to the general public for any purpose or for no purpose at all, for postal-related business or nonpostal related."
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2517.102,2520.104,"But it would just be a question of what the... what the walk was used for, then."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2529.991,2531.944,"Oh, even then, Chief Justice, I don't think it could be banned."
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2539.15,2546.145,"Why... why wouldn't you say the same thing about the inside of the post office, then, that all you could have would be a time, place and manner regulation?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2546.145,2551.629,"--Perhaps a booth rule would suffice inside the post office on a first come, first served basis."
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2563.838,2565.71,"Well, the operation of the post office, not the forum."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2565.71,2566.552,"--Yes, excuse me, the post office."
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2653.383,2666.572,"Is the post office not allowed to make that sort of an ad hoc decision if things are very bad inside that post office, they might not be quite as bad outside but were bad enough to regulate?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2666.572,2672.529,"--I think they could, and if they could justify the prohibition outside and meet the compelling interest test, then--"
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2672.529,2674.933,Why... why do you need to meet the compelling interest test?
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2674.933,2680.846,"--Because a particular type of speech, Chief Justice, has been eliminated from a public forum, and that--"
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.846,2686.6,"Well, what... are you... I don't understand why you say this is a public forum."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2698.679,2702.0,--We believe this case is distinguishable from Greer and from Adderley.
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.602,2731.814,"Well, that certainly wasn't the reasoning of the Court in Adderley."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2739.98,2748.457,"--And that was because of the security concerns of the jail, and it was speech taking place, Chief Justice, in areas that were not open to the general public."
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2766.319,2776.945,You said a moment ago in response to Justice O'Connor's question the post office could ban all of these things and say we're just running post office business here and all of you get out.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2776.945,2783.07,"Oh, they could ban it if in fact they operated as this quasi-military enclave, but they do not, Chief Justice."
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2783.07,2786.883,"Well, but I take it it would be permissible for them to do so, in your view?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2786.883,2795.27,"They would have to show the constitutional requirement being met, that the Postal Service was so important to national interest, as the military was, to justify it."
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2809.539,2809.679,How about us?
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2819.036,2823.2,--I think the compatibility factor that would justify a prohibition of that.
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.734,2841.934,Eminently so.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2847.18,2860.089,"--Well, I think if it was... I think it would be incompatible in the sense of the judicial decorum and the courtroom decorum that takes place in the chambers and inside of this courtroom, but that is not the case where you've got general public access unlimited for any business at all."
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2882.719,2883.9,"The sidewalk right under the window, too?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2887.824,2888.054,That's correct.
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.054,2893.57,--quite close to the building in addition to the sidewalk next to the street that you use to get from this building to other buildings.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2896.051,2899.504,"I think, yes, you would, but for this condition."
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2900.255,2904.569,Don't you think we have a case dealing with the plaza area?
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2909.121,2910.093,--In Grace--
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2910.093,2911.435,--and decided against you?
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2911.435,2922.444,"--In Grace, the... the Court did indicate that the plaza... it was not... I don't think it was a complete decision on that point... was maybe not open to the forum like the sidewalks, but I think--"
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2922.444,2923.283,Precisely.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2935.772,2937.144,--And in Grace--
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2937.144,2939.144,Aren't they welcome to come and do that?
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2939.144,2939.284,"--Yes, they are."
1989.88-2031,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2939.454,2939.824,Yes.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2948.759,2960.577,"On the plaza level, I think the argument can be made that you draw the line there and don't have to, but there's a distinction between this Court's physical setup, if you will, and that of the post office, and here's the point."
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2984.448,2984.515,Right.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3006.642,3010.145,"I... I wouldn't think so, Justice Scalia, in this context, again."
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.706,3067.764,"xxx would you make the same argument that the... the apron... I agree, that's a loaded word... the sidewalk, the private sidewalk around the bank... the bank has a parking lot, and it's set back."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3073.837,3074.278,Absolutely not.
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.478,3088.662,"Oh, but... but we're talking about whether a sidewalk is a sidewalk."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3095.347,3104.784,"I would be arguing that in that particular case it is not governmentally owned, although I wouldn't be arguing that if I was up here on that case, obviously, but if it's not governmentally owned."
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.7,3112.4,It is not a difference for this argument.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3136.786,3139.859,"--It's a... it's a privately owned piece of sidewalk, if you will."
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3165.837,3175.625,"Now... now under your argument, I suppose, the post office would also have to permit panhandlers on the premises; is that right?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3175.625,3187.442,"--I think yes, that that activity, the district court in New York recently addressed that and said that that was a protected form of speech, again, though, subject to time, place and manner restrictions."
1989.88-2031,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3197.49,3211.38,"Do you think you can narrowly tailor time, place and manner... manner restrictions to all post offices in the United States with one regulation, or are you advocating that we have to have an office-by-office regulation?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3211.38,3223.919,"--I think that there are, from what we understand, two basic designs to post offices, and some exist immediately adjacent to municipal sidewalks, which, of course, the government concedes would be protected speech, and others that are set back."
1989.88-2031,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.154,3237.728,"Can I ask you, you can you could... that your argument applies to panhandling."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3244.273,3244.963,"--Well, I don't--"
1989.88-2031,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.963,3249.517,"In other words, is commercial speech covered by your theory?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3249.517,3252.589,"--I don't think necessarily commercial speech would be, and the Court--"
1989.88-2031,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3252.589,3255.582,"Do you think panhandling is commercial speech, or is it like your speech?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3255.582,3259.425,"--The court in New York, the district court, said it was in fact charity."
1989.88-2031,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3281.872,3283.514,"On that theory, every thief is Robin Hood."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3283.514,3286.406,"Well, I... that's correct, Chief... Justice Scalia."
1989.88-2031,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3286.406,3287.928,"Let me ask one other question, if I may."
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3287.928,3288.108,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2031,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3288.108,3297.263,"If we focus on access to the building, I know... I realize you're making a facial attack on the regulation, but you really think you have a right to put a table up in front of the door?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3297.263,3300.305,"Well, we had... we had the right in this... in this sense."
1989.88-2031,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3300.305,3303.108,Because you think the regulation is invalid.
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3303.108,3311.224,"Yes, but... but clearly I think a booth rule, as Justice O'Connor alluded to, would be constitutionally sufficient, which could eliminate the table and any potential blocking problems."
1989.88-2031,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3369.151,3371.312,"Well, you don't think they could put up a table on the municipal sidewalk, do you?"
1989.88-2031,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3371.312,3376.445,There are regulations in some municipalities that prohibit tables because of the obstruction.
1989.88-2031,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3401.935,3404.298,"Thank you, Mr. Sekulow."
1989.88-2031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3406.572,3408.021,"Thank you, Your Honor."
