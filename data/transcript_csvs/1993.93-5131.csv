1993.93-5131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.448,"We'll hear argument now in No. 93-5131, Paul Palalaua Tuilaepa v. California and Proctor against California."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,53.089,53.807,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.834,214.321,"But, Mr. Gillingham, how could the vagueness of one of those factors produce any more random decisions than not giving the jury any factors at all and just saying having found one of the necessary conditions for imposing the death penalty, which California says is prior to the... to this stage of the case, just telling the jury once you've found guilt with one of these statutory factors that enable the imposition of the death penalty, it's up to you to propose the death penalty or not."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,221.661,222.911,"On the contrary, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.911,224.658,You think it's more random.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,224.658,225.361,On the contrary.
1993.93-5131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.361,229.626,"The vague factor is more random than saying do what you like, we won't tell you any factors at all."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,229.626,242.261,"Your Honor is referring basically to Georgia, in the sense of the jury is allowed, after the aggravating circumstance is found, to rely on their own common understanding, deliberations, discussions."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,259.865,274.389,"But isn't there a significant difference between the use that California makes of the factors and the use that we have... the uses that we have been concerned with in past cases when we have said that in weighing States, the vagueness of the factors infects the weighing process."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,336.863,345.955,"And it's exactly what was argued in Stringer, Your Honor, and that is not the distinguishing point because if that were the case, basically Stringer would have overruled Zant."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,351.514,365.134,"No, but the point in Stringer was... there was no problem at the... by the use of an aggravate... of a vague aggravator at the narrowing stage because you had a nongrave... nonvague aggravator, that's all."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,399.979,413.474,"They are distinguishing without a difference, Your Honor, in this... in some ways, but in other ways, to use Justice Kennedy's description in Stringer, it's worse in the penalty phase determination, it's absolutely worse."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,438.854,449.005,"In other words, we identify a subject matter which it is relevant for them to consider, and that is exactly the same thing that the jury in a State like Georgia, which does not go through a formal weighing process, can do."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,475.964,477.042,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,490.239,500.626,"Well, wouldn't it be more precise to say that if they are going to identify certain subject matters which ought to be considered at the weighing stage, they at least ought to be relevant subject matters."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,515.214,516.947,"--They are not irrelevant in themselves, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,522.866,529.832,"But, it's... with respect, isn't this... isn't the instruction to the jury basically, consider this subject matter."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,529.832,542.625,"--But to weigh factors... what we have to keep in mind, Your Honor, is the difference between the evidence, the data base, and the fact that these factors are a lens through which the jury is told to look at this evidence."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,543.608,546.388,"Well, I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,555.009,558.492,--What happens is it's obviously aggravating in these cases.
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,560.492,561.928,"Well, it may be, it may not be."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,585.529,585.826,--Your Honor--
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,585.826,590.074,All the State is doing is saying consider this for what it's worth.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,590.074,597.617,"--Your Honor, factor (k) tells the jury to consider the mitigating or extenuating circumstances of the crime."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,597.617,597.929,Uh-hum.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,597.929,605.832,"If there's going to be any mitigation element to the factors in California, it's going to be in factor (k), which is the fifth factor in our case, in Tuilaepa."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,605.832,606.379,Uh-hum.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,606.379,608.644,That's where the entrance of mitigation is.
1993.93-5131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,628.262,636.805,"So you agree that California could have dispensed entirely with the list of factors, since it narrows it in a different way."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,636.805,638.008,Absolutely.
1993.93-5131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,638.008,640.508,You have... I want to be clear on that point.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,652.113,653.004,"I'm not, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,656.579,656.798,Yes.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,660.311,660.983,Absolutely.
1993.93-5131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,660.983,661.904,Okay.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,661.904,668.949,"And, in fact, many of those factors are actually taken to the penalty phase in many of the weighing States and called aggravating circumstances in the weighing phase."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,668.949,670.34,Which was the case in Stringer.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,670.34,688.925,"But the point is one of them was vague, Your Honor, and what we're saying is under Maynard and Godfrey where there was an additional... additional description and effort to define, quote, the circumstances of the crime, that is heinous, atrocious, this Court said well, wait a second, that could apply to any court... any case, that could apply to every single murder."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,688.925,702.529,"Yeah, and what was wrong with it is that it gave the illusion that you were stating a proposition about that case which was capable of being shown to be true or false, and because of the vagueness of the statement that really wasn't true."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,739.483,741.496,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,787.245,802.395,"Well, they had... it's clear that they had to weigh the subjects which the so-called factors referred to, no question about that, but isn't it true that the factors were different from the kinds of factors which are expressed in just propositions of fact like it was cruel?"
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,802.395,809.034,"--I think not, Your Honor, other than to the extent that they're much more vague and illusory."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,809.034,817.296,"They're much more vague in the sense that they, generally speaking at least, do not state propositions which the jury has to find in order to address those subjects."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,817.296,818.326,I don't understand.
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,818.998,822.762,"Well, if the... if the... let's take the age factor."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,834.225,835.022,Yes.
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,835.022,839.536,It doesn't tell you whether that age should be regarded as mitigating or as aggravating.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,892.874,908.274,"Practically speaking, what happens in the court is that each and every one of those factors are aggravating or argued aggravating, as you've seen in the amicus briefs, I'm sure."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,909.227,911.444,And argued mitigating too.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,928.079,929.829,--And I have made that argument.
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,957.535,958.222,Which is (k)?
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,958.222,966.516,"(K) is the one at the end, Your Honor, the last one in my case also, that has any other circumstance that could extenuate the crime--"
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,966.516,967.079,I see.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,967.079,973.076,"--And now added through common law with the other background record, et cetera, to satisfy Lockett."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,973.076,981.276,"So you're saying if they consider the subjects of everything up to (k) as a practical matter, they're going to be considering aggravating factors."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,981.276,981.542,Absolutely.
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,981.542,982.011,All right.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1001.298,1003.33,California--
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1003.33,1005.094,Do they single anything out?
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1005.094,1007.921,"--The ""they"", the reference of ""they""."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1007.921,1010.513,"Yeah, in the list of factors--"
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1010.513,1010.732,Yes.
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1010.732,1014.466,"--If the jury really considers all of those factors, (a) through (j)."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1014.466,1014.7,Yes.
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1014.7,1020.464,Will it have considered pretty much the universe of possibly aggravating factors?
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1020.464,1027.585,"Well, if I understand your question correctly, in California they are limited, the jury is limited to the statutory factors."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1027.585,1028.178,"That's right, yeah."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1028.178,1028.521,Okay.
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1028.521,1036.659,"But if it considers all of them, will it pretty much have canvassed the possible scope of relevant aggravating factors?"
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1036.659,1037.58,It absolutely will.
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1037.58,1037.893,Okay.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1037.893,1044.876,"And as you'll see in the next argument, even when there's no evidence of some, we'll have those used as aggravators in California, but that's not my case."
1993.93-5131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.876,1066.927,"Mr. Gillingham, your comment about age being only an aggravating factor, or at least not being a good mitigating factor, certainly would contradict a couple of our cases where we've said that... like Edmunds, where the court has said that the jury has to be permitted to consider age as a mitigating factor in the sense of youth."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1066.927,1073.019,"And, indeed, in every State, I think perhaps other than California, it's indicated and described as a mitigating factor."
1993.93-5131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1074.566,1089.217,"Well, but certainly... nothing prevents you, as I gather you say you've done unsuccessfully... from arguing to the jury that a person of say 19 years old or 18 years old should be considered in mitigation."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1089.217,1098.821,"But what I'm saying, Your Honor, it's one thing for me to argue it... and I must say it is an uphill battle in each and every case, given the fact that when you get there you have a first-degree murder with a special circumstance."
1993.93-5131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1115.096,1120.375,"But if says that, in effect, everything else is special too, then, in effect, nothing is special."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1131.605,1138.228,"--Well, we... of course, we address them, I do on behalf of Tuilaepa, one by one."
1993.93-5131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1141.977,1165.764,"Mr. Gillingham, suppose the way it read was the jury may consider the following aggravating circumstances, (a) through (j), and then, in addition, the jury may consider (k), whatever mitigating circumstances it considers relevant, would that be constitutional?"
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1165.764,1169.153,"--Well, I'd need to know what the factors were."
1993.93-5131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.153,1172.494,"The same ones, the same ones, (a) through (j), just what you have now."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1172.494,1175.447,"That would not cure of vagueness of (a), for example."
1993.93-5131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.628,1196.266,"But it would cure that vagueness, as you've said, simply to not say anything at all."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1196.266,1196.828,"Well, I'm not sure--"
1993.93-5131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.828,1197.938,Not list any factors at all.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1197.938,1199.545,--I'm not sure we're talking about the same vagueness.
1993.93-5131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.451,1207.544,Whatever vagueness you think infects (a) through (j).
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1207.544,1209.058,All right.
1993.93-5131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.589,1212.183,That's all right.
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1213.166,1213.776,Okay.
1993.93-5131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.244,1216.087,"Well, go ahead and reserve."
1993.93-5131,0,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,1216.087,1216.681,Thank you.
1993.93-5131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1216.681,1218.977,"Thank you, Mr. Gillingham."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1221.851,1233.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1387.533,1406.962,"But, Ms. Lascher, if you take three statutory schemes, Texas, Georgia, California, and assume that you do not prevail on this case and that all of them are constitutional in their broad outline and in the specifics that you challenge here."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1416.927,1424.549,"--Your Honor, I believe I would... it would depend on the specific case, but I think I would choose--"
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1424.549,1425.08,"Your case, Proctor."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1425.08,1426.236,"--All right, the Proctor case."
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1482.995,1490.569,"So of the three systems that I asked you about, you prefer the system which gives the least guidance to the jury from the court."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1490.569,1501.736,"Under the... I prefer that to a system which gives vague guidance to the jury, which gives illusory guidance to the jury, which gives really misguidance rather than simply nonguidance, yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1501.736,1502.58,All right--
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1522.337,1529.694,"Well, Your Honor, that's, in effect, what the California jury instructions do, just as--"
1993.93-5131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1529.694,1533.162,"Well, I thought maybe... in fact, I'm assuming something that you did not, yourself, argue."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1572.145,1576.925,"--I think the key to the answer, Your Honor, is the phrase ""the weighing process""."
1993.93-5131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1584.578,1586.094,"Well, but that's what Georgia does."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1586.094,1586.952,If you say consider--
1993.93-5131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1586.952,1592.84,"Georgia says you're supposed to weigh all... in effect, all the evidence that you deem to be relevant."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1606.397,1622.672,"--Well, actually, I disagree somewhat because what Georgia does is it says you shall weigh these subject matters, but it doesn't say the thing that California says, which is if you find that aggravating outweigh mitigating, that you shall impose the death penalty."
1993.93-5131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1623.875,1627.811,"Well, isn't that the only rational way they could possibly behave?"
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1636.542,1650.708,"--No, I think the jury can decide in Georgia for whatever reason, because it is exercising this negotiating function, this conscience function, not to impose the death penalty because at the end of the process there's no consequence attached to the weighing."
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.793,1675.199,This is the same jury that--
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1675.199,1680.102,--Where California goes astray is in guiding the jury to that result.
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.312,1743.562,--But I thought your point was the jury has too much guidance.
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1743.562,1744.326,--The jury has--
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1744.326,1746.513,Now you're saying it doesn't have enough.
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1746.513,1749.575,"--It's an unfortunate combination of both, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1763.976,1768.191,I thought you liked the Georgia system because the Georgia system jury is free to do what it wants.
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1768.191,1778.486,"--Oh, but the difference is in Georgia the free jury has no false confidence that it's the law directing them to a particular result by following a formula."
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1792.307,1799.259,"We can be comfortable with the decision we make because we've talked about things that have a rational bearing on guilt, whereas--"
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1799.259,1799.431,"--Well, you know, here's--"
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1799.431,1804.774,"--Where in Georgia we have kind of a Quaker prayer meeting, everybody's quiet, and they just raise their hand and vote for death."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1807.538,1808.054,--Could happen.
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1808.054,1815.441,"You're making really quite an amazing argument, based on our precedents, that the jury should have no guidance."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1817.893,1818.83,"Well let me... oh, no."
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1818.83,1821.343,--Of about 15 years of cases from this Court.
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1821.343,1829.388,"I don't know if I should say thank you for saying I'm making an amazing argument, but let's go back to... let's go all the way back to Furman and see what we're trying to do here."
1993.93-5131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1835.041,1836.463,May I interrupt you.
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1850.848,1857.549,"For purposes of this case, Your Honor, we both assume that the special circumstances perform the narrowing function."
1993.93-5131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.503,1860.892,Are there any murders that aren't covered by the special circumstances?
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1860.892,1866.436,"--Well, there are 29 categories of murders covered by the special circumstances, that California voters--"
1993.93-5131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1866.436,1872.167,And you think that... you're assuming that adequately narrows the universe so you get into the next step.
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1872.167,1873.76,--I'm not assuming it.
1993.93-5131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1876.884,1882.96,"Let me ask, when you answered that question, that you are not challenging whether there's a sufficient--"
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1886.193,1886.849,"That's right, not--"
1993.93-5131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.849,1888.348,And you're not either.
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1888.348,1889.536,--I'm not challenging it either.
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1889.536,1891.972,And did you challenge it at any stage in the proceedings?
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1891.972,1897.377,"I don't think we did in this case, Your Honor, but I would have to refresh my recollection on that."
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1897.377,1901.875,"Well, then, I think it's fair to say that you assume that it's sufficient, constitutionally sufficient."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,1901.875,1902.234,No.
1993.93-5131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2004.52,2010.096,"Do you believe the argument that you just made is true, for example, with respect to the way age is treated under the California scheme?"
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2036.835,2058.342,"Well, I think we have two perfect cases to illustrate that, Your Honor, because Mr. Proctor was 20 and Mr. Tuilaepa was 21 at the times of their respective crime, and in the Proctor case the jury was... the prosecutor stipulated that age was mitigating, and in the Tuilaepa case the prosecutor argued it was aggravating, and their prior records were not that dissimilar."
1993.93-5131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2058.342,2060.591,"Well, my question, though, I think stands."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2076.319,2084.253,"Because... I think... actually, I think the State does need to take a position, even on age, but certainly on some other factors such as accomplice status."
1993.93-5131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2084.253,2086.83,"Well, and that may be... I don't mean to cut you off from that."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2105.292,2107.932,You can't say it in an abstract fashion.
1993.93-5131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.974,2130.017,"Well, how is the... how is it argued as an aggravating factor against the defendant, Ms. Lascher, the age?"
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2130.017,2131.735,--He's old enough to know better.
1993.93-5131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2131.735,2137.733,"Well, but I mean, would that... would the prosecutor highlight that fact if the defendant were, say, 17?"
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2137.733,2141.293,"I... prosecutors do argue that and highlight that, yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.293,2148.931,"And do defense attorneys argue contra, that it's... that's a sufficiently tender age or young age to be mitigating."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2148.931,2150.056,"Yes, they try."
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2192.883,2197.724,"But, what should our legal training tell us about whether age should be mitigating or aggravating?"
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2197.724,2202.769,"I don't know what it should tell us, but I know that we're capable of being told because we do it."
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2208.939,2216.779,"Well, your proposition is that the State must commit itself as to every listed factor as to whether it's aggravating or mitigating."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2217.763,2218.232,--It is.
1993.93-5131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2218.232,2220.23,And I want to know what you... what we should do with age.
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2220.23,2228.228,"Well, if I were passing the law, I would probably choose arbitrarily an age, as the legislature would, and it might be 25 or 30, I don't it would be 17 or 18."
1993.93-5131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2235.13,2237.568,But what about 60 or say 65?
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2237.568,2243.16,"I think that if I answer that question I'll just be in trouble, no matter how I answer it."
1993.93-5131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2243.924,2247.735,Not with me.
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2252.141,2258.653,"Let me return briefly to the subject of circumstances of the crime, because I think it capsulizes--"
1993.93-5131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2258.653,2263.338,"There's one question I would like to ask you before you proceed there, going back to the question about the special circumstances."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2273.631,2275.13,--I don't know.
1993.93-5131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2292.576,2296.606,"And, even so, you haven't challenged that as not being sufficiently narrowing."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2296.606,2299.996,"Not for purposes of being here today, Your Honor, no."
1993.93-5131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.804,2312.725,Are you suggesting some other lawyer may have another habeas petition later on down the line who'll make that challenge?
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2312.725,2313.411,"--I hope so, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.411,2315.239,You hope so.
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2318.207,2321.628,I think it would be a great argument to make.
1993.93-5131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.689,2326.688,"Well, why didn't you, why didn't you make the argument?"
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2328.984,2334.934,--The nature of this case and the strategy of presenting it to the California Supreme Court.
1993.93-5131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.799,2367.296,"Well, not if you haven't raised it at all, but I must confess I'm puzzled as to why no one has--"
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2367.296,2368.452,--It is actually--
1993.93-5131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2368.452,2375.651,"--Especially if it makes... as you say, 90 percent of the murders are covered by your so-called, quote, special circumstances, they're not very special."
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2375.651,2385.444,"--It is actually raised in Mr. Gillingham's brief, I believe, at least noted in his brief and in the amicus curiae brief of the California Appellate Project, the breadth of those special circumstances."
1993.93-5131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.395,2398.112,"Well, a second question: is California's death penalty statute vague as written and applied and under violation of Stringer?"
1993.93-5131,1,45355,wendy_cole_lascher,,2398.112,2400.814,"I think... I think it is, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2484.374,2487.826,"Thank you, Ms. Lascher."
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2490.012,2495.136,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.114,2635.548,"General Prahl, perhaps I shouldn't take your time with this, but I do want you... at the end of the guilt phase these become death-eligible if any one of the circumstances have been found."
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2635.548,2636.031,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.031,2641.919,"Am I... do I read correctly circumstance 3, that if he's found guilty of two second degree murder offenses, he's death eligible?"
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2641.919,2645.543,"No, Your Honor, that would not be correct."
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2701.489,2709.737,"The third circumstance is the defendant has... oh, has in this proceeding been convicted of one... of more than one offense of murder in the first or second degree."
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2714.078,2716.764,"--Oh, a multiple murder in the same proceeding, yes, Your Honor, that's a multiple murder."
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.764,2717.561,"--Two second degree, I see, I get it."
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2717.561,2719.467,That's a multiple murder.
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.825,2726.526,But it had... two second degree murders in the same proceeding would make him death-eligible.
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2726.526,2727.558,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2778.833,2781.066,"And how many do you have on death row, Mr. Prahl?"
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2781.066,2787.204,"--Right now we have a little over 400, I believe, in total."
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2793.718,2807.805,"Yes, but is it not true... just, again, I realize that you didn't want to spend your time on this, but is it not true that there could be murder cases which if the prosecutor elected to allege in the indictment a special circumstance, that are not actually tried as capital cases?"
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2807.805,2808.68,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2808.68,2810.71,I'm not making myself clear.
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2818.177,2819.175,"Oh, certainly, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2828.531,2828.75,Right.
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2828.75,2835.217,"--As to whether or not he has basically the horses to pull the wagon, and if they're not there he's not going to charge it."
1993.93-5131,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2909.015,2921.729,"So, given that explanation, could California add to one of the factors for the jury to consider at the sentencing phase whether or not the murder was heinous, atrocious, and cruel?"
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2921.729,2929.271,"California, in fact, has heinous, atrocious, and cruel within its statutory scheme."
1993.93-5131,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2939.549,2943.141,But my question is could it be added at the sentencing phase?
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2943.141,2944.813,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2960.792,2970.522,"Well, suppose California just added this phrase to the considerations that the jury has in front of it when it is in the sentencing phase?"
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2970.522,2977.3,--It wouldn't... it wouldn't be consistent with California's statutory scheme.
1993.93-5131,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2977.3,2979.503,But I'm... why not... why is that?
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,2979.503,2990.732,"Because California does not have, as Justice Souter pointed out, what are called propositional circumstances or propositional sentencing factors."
1993.93-5131,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3001.026,3002.261,"Well, California... go ahead, please."
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3002.261,3016.395,"--Mr. Gillingham indicated, for example, that in practice all of the factors except the last one, factor (k), the extenuating evidence, character, background material, are in fact aggravating."
1993.93-5131,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3149.888,3161.461,"Well, Mr. Prahl, some of them, the thrust are clear, The presence or absence of a prior felony conviction; the presence of a felony conviction can't be considered in any way, shape, or form mitigating, can it?"
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3161.461,3167.772,"--No, Your Honor, but certainly the absence of... and that was, in fact, the case in the Proctor situation."
1993.93-5131,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3170.74,3171.161,Uh-hum.
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3171.161,3177.158,"That factor, I believe, was acknowledged... well, in Proctor, I'm sorry, he did have a prior felony conviction."
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3252.628,3255.47,Are you saying all these factors are... as a matter of State law must be mitigating?
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3255.47,3255.908,"No, Your Honor."
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.969,3262.561,"Oh, I'm sorry, just the youth and the circumstances... not the circumstances of the crime."
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3262.561,3266.808,"--Oh, no, Your Honor, the circumstances of the crime can be either mitigating or aggravating."
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3266.808,3267.543,I see.
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3267.543,3269.448,As can factor (b) or (c).
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.494,3276.461,So it's only age that you're saying can... must be mitigating.
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3279.46,3280.273,--I'll see if I can go through these.
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3284.145,3284.395,Right.
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3284.395,3285.817,And the jury is specifically told that.
1993.93-5131,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3323.052,3326.91,I'm afraid I'm not quite I understand.
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3348.136,3368.424,"--Under the California Supreme Court's decision in People v. Davenport, the California Supreme Court has decided... as a matter of State law, not based on any Federal constitutional interpretation, but just as a matter of supervision over the State's statute... that those factors would only be mitigating."
1993.93-5131,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3408.22,3410.267,How does this work in practice?
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3420.059,3422.871,"No, whether the victim was a participant, Your Honor."

1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3426.025,3437.723,"He... that factor... yes, Your Honor, the prosecutor... and that would... and the defense counsel would... if there were an argument along those lines, defense counsel would object and the jury... or the judge would instruct the jury accordingly."
1993.93-5131,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3502.715,3512.148,"Mr. Prahl, going back to factor (e) for a moment... I take it these are supposed to state things that might be expected to occur in more than one case."
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3522.941,3535.529,"Oh, that's probably a situation where there's some type of drug deal where there's two or more people involved in some sort of criminal activity and something goes wrong."
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3775.342,3781.37,Any... are you aware of any death case in which the defendant has argued that the circumstances you just described were mitigating?
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3789.54,3793.146,--The defendant in the... that was the argument in Proctor.
1993.93-5131,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3798.833,3803.096,"Well, I understand that, but then he also affirmatively argued that that scenario is mitigating?"
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3803.096,3803.971,No.
1993.93-5131,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3888.264,3889.967,You'd say that's mitigating?
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3889.967,3890.499,"--Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1993.93-5131,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3890.499,3891.544,You'd say that's mitigating evidence.
1993.93-5131,2,45887,william_george_prahl,,3891.544,3907.086,"Well, I think you can attempt to characterize it... it's fair to characterize that as an attempt to lessen the aggravating impact of it and to draw it more to the mitigating side of the question."

1993.93-5131,3,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,4348.688,4355.982,"Justice Scalia, you smiled when there was a reference to the possibility of there being a mitigator, and indeed I've seen juries almost do the same thing."
1993.93-5131,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4469.811,4478.635,That's just sort of saying that you can argue against the existing of a mitigating factor and always make it sound like an aggravating factor.
1993.93-5131,3,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,4478.635,4479.025,Your Honor--
1993.93-5131,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4479.025,4483.258,"I mean, are you going to say this defendant is too young to appreciate this crime."

1993.93-5131,3,27132,howard_w_gillingham,,4498.41,4498.628,--I didn't.
