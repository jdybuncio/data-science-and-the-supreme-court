1956.60,0,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,12.623,14.965,May it please the Court.
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,1927.261,1931.189,May it please the Court.
1956.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2339.468,2339.803,Mr. Horsley --
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2339.803,2340.175,"Yes, sir."
1956.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2340.175,2351.911,"-- I understood from Mr. Miller that that the trustee made no inquiry as to where these funds came from as he would pay them in, is that correct or did I misunderstand?"
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2351.985,2354.766,That is not quite -- that is not quite correct Your Honor.
1956.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2354.766,2355.479,"Well, I missed (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2355.479,2371.674,The record shows that he was told different stories by the bankrupt about corporations and about Christmas tree deals and oil operations and -- and said these monies were coming form legitimate business operation.
1956.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2373.393,2378.748,But the trustee made no inquiry and just took whatever story.
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2378.748,2379.174,"Well,"
1956.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2379.174,2380.513,-- Knetzer gave him and --
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2380.513,2396.098,"As far as the record is concerned on that, they tried to ask the trustee about what his connection were with the FBI in his conversations and all the things that he did because after all, we were all cooperating in this concealment bank."
1956.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2411.538,2415.687,"Do you -- do you -- well, I'm -- I was getting back."
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2417.063,2425.847,"Now, I would like to point out that the -- this man, Jaffke -- and I would like to just get the sequence of the events."
1956.60,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2631.89,2637.203,"Was it -- why the 7000 judgment, based on those documents or is it (Inaudible)"
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2637.203,2637.906,"No, Your Honor."
1956.60,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2640.356,2640.968,In -- on this?
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2640.968,2641.691,-- in this record --
1956.60,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2641.691,2642.605,Yes.
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2642.605,2643.549,-- to the trustee.
1956.60,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2643.549,2644.617,That's right.
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2644.617,2648.754,"Now, we have set up a chart in our brief."
1956.60,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2648.754,2657.747,What -- what is the total amount that was paid by the bankrupt to the trustee in order to clear his -- himself on the (Inaudible)
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2657.747,2665.875,"Up to the time of his death, a $170,000 out of the $250, 000."
1956.60,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2665.875,2667.11,"He paid $170, 000, yes."
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2667.11,2668.215,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.60,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2668.215,2678.131,And does record show clearly for -- is there any other evidence that he -- a part of that money was the money from the petitioner here?
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2678.131,2678.818,There is not one --
1956.60,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2678.818,2680.88,Except -- except the affidavit?
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2680.88,2683.32,"No, sir, There's not."
1956.60,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2683.32,2683.561,Did he --
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2683.561,2683.605,Now --
1956.60,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2683.605,2684.649,-- testify?
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2684.649,2684.93,Sir?
1956.60,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2684.93,2687.36,Did he testify that he paid the money?
1956.60,1,25526,g_w_horsley,,2687.36,2708.282,"Generally -- well, Jaffke testified he paid the money to Knetzer but he testified he did not know what Knetzer did with the money and how much of it went into this Court with the operation but he admitted there was a lot of activity, telephone calls and attorneys working on it and trips to Washington and FHA deals and all of that and he said he didn't know where the man --"
1956.60,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2708.282,2709.095,45.08
1956.60,2,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2716.205,2717.25,That's right.
1956.60,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2717.25,2726.493,And there's testimony that the bankrupt has paid a greater amount during the period with -- to get the money from Jaffke to -- of that to the trustee.
1956.60,2,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,2726.493,2727.501,"That is not correct, Your Honor."
1956.60,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2727.501,2728.613,That's not right.
1956.60,3,25526,g_w_horsley,,2728.613,2740.787,"If you will look on -- on our brief on page 41 and 42, you will find there we've set up a chart, taken only from the record in this case."
1956.60,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3067.328,3072.982,(Inaudible)
1956.60,3,25526,g_w_horsley,,3083.757,3085.314,"No, sir, Your Honor, it wouldn't."
1956.60,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3085.314,3086.422,I mean that is your position.
1956.60,3,25526,g_w_horsley,,3086.422,3087.226,That's my position.
1956.60,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3087.226,3091.798,But it doesn't reach the question that that is what the Court of Appeals said.
1956.60,3,25526,g_w_horsley,,3091.798,3093.294,I'm coming to that just one moment.
1956.60,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3093.294,3094.67,All right.
1956.60,3,25526,g_w_horsley,,3094.67,3105.432,"Well, our -- on the facts, my -- and my time won't permit me to go more into them but my brief has in my -- I think very, fully covered in the brief."
1956.60,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3157.827,3160.353,"Well, why is -- I don't follow that."
1956.60,4,27551,herbert_j_miller_jr,,3169.421,3186.889,"Well, the cases that we've pointed out to say that if there, the appellee has agreed in any way by the ruling of the trial court that he cannot urge matters on the Court of Appeals that would enlarge his rights."
1956.60,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3186.889,3190.032,But isn't -- he's saying you can't say that.
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3190.032,3191.341,"Well, he's compromising"
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3191.341,3191.723,Pardon me?
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3191.723,3192.761,He's compromising.
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3198.217,3200.637,"Well, but that's what the 53.20 court gave him --"
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3200.637,3201.119,That's correct.
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3201.119,3203.197,-- and he has tried to sustain.
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3203.197,3203.895,That's correct.
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3203.895,3212.198,"On a -- on a consideration other than that on which the District Court sustained it, but in the record."
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3215.816,3220.279,It is an equity that's why he must have clean hands when he comes in to this equitable court.
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3220.279,3222.036,That's a -- that's a different story.
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3222.036,3222.498,"Yes, sir."
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3222.498,3224.165,That's a very different story.
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3245.845,3245.939,Well --
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3245.939,3258.612,"And, if they're right that it was excluded or they're right that it should be considered in order to determine on the merits whether it should be -- whether it had force, that was denied."
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3258.612,3259.345,Well --
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3259.345,3259.747,That's this problem --
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3259.747,3260.062,-- of course --
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3260.062,3260.886,-- we have to get over.
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3260.886,3263.842,I -- I think on this matter of cross-appeal that we put --
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3263.842,3264.127,Arriving --
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3264.127,3270.181,"-- too much emphasis on it because the affidavit definitely is not admissible, under the Illinois law."
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3270.181,3273.155,Then you say this Court too is a court of equity in this case --
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3273.155,3273.597,It is.
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3273.597,3275.197,"-- and therefore, we have a right to look at it and see --"
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3275.197,3275.92,I think so.
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3275.92,3276.583,-- whether the --
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3276.583,3276.959,I think so.
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3276.959,3280.367,-- whether the striking in -- in the District Court was not enough.
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3280.367,3291.158,I might add the trial court was a sick man and this judgment was entered up about six months or so after the case was heard and then he later died.
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3295.634,3296.11,But the Court of Appeals --
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3296.11,3296.506,-- deceased.
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3296.506,3298.669,-- is a healthy court.
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3298.669,3301.032,"Well, I wouldn't dare to say otherwise."
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3318.907,3321.843,Why do you say the justice -- question (Inaudible)
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3321.843,3321.967,Sir?
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3321.967,3335.514,"Is this -- the question -- that's the point since (Inaudible) namely, is admissibility to be determined according to Illinois law or according to federal -- federal common law evidentiary rules?"
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3335.514,3335.558,Which to be determined --
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3335.558,3338.63,Or won't -- only the same -- only the same the same people --
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3338.63,3349.479,"It has to be determined under the law which will allow the admissibility under the federal rule, and the federal law on this, the case law."
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3349.479,3351.441,There's a federal rule on it --
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3351.441,3352.399,"No, Your Honor, there is no federal rule."
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3352.399,3356.76,"No, I mean there are rules as federal -- Federal Rules of Civil Procedure cover this problem?"
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3356.76,3357.865,It merely says.
1956.60,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3357.865,3358.632,What does it say?
1956.60,5,25526,g_w_horsley,,3358.632,3365.118,It merely says that that law favoring admissibility will be adopted.
