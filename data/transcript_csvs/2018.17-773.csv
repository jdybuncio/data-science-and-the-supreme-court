2018.17-773,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.16,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-773, Culbertson versus Berryhill. Mr. Ortiz."
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,7.16,47.48,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case turns on the meaning of two words in Section 406(b), ""such representation."" Do they refer to work done only before the court, the only representation discussed in Section 406(b) itself, or do they also include work done before the agency, which is subject to a separate award mechanism in Section 406(a)? In this case, Your Honors, the statute's text, its structure, its purposes, and its history all confirm that Section 406(b)'s cap applies only to work done in court. First, the text: Section 406(b) references explicitly and only work done in the court."
2018.17-773,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,115.0,151.48,"Can I ask you a question about the -- the cap? You're saying there's a cap in (b) and that applies to court services, not to services before the agency. But is there a -- a cap on the amount that can be taken from the plaintiff's recovery? That is, let's say that we -- we agree with you that the (b) cap is for court only."
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,167.36,168.96,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,191.48,194.52,I do have a question about that.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,221.84,222.4,"No, Your Honor --"
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,222.4,224.4,The retained amount.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,233.0,270.92,"Well, Your Honor, first, I want to correct what may be a misconception. It is not the case that when the 25 percent authorization cap is used up, that attorneys, if they want to recover fees beyond that, would -- beyond the amount withheld, would actually have to go against the claimant directly. In any case, when there is an EAJA award, as there are in over 40 percent of these cases, and the EAJA award is equal to or exceeds the 406(a) award, the attorney can actually get the money from the amount that the agency is still withholding."
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,270.92,274.88,I understood here there was some EAJA money that you could have received.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,274.88,275.16,Yeah.
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,275.64,277.8,But I'm talking about the extreme possibility --
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,277.8,277.8,Yeah.
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,278.52,285.0,"-- where there's a small EAJA award, but you get 50 percent of the recovery."
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,290.96,292.6,"Not in most cases, Your Honor."
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,294.44,296.4,I'm not asking about most cases.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,299.36,300.72,"Well, there would be an --"
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,300.72,301.04,When --
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,301.04,305.76,"There would be an exception, Your Honor, if I were representing Bill Gates, say."
2018.17-773,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,310.44,347.64,"But most of the claimants are, of course -- do not have much money, and the statute, as Justice Ginsburg says, puts a 25 percent cap on what -- on how it's going to -- the pool, I guess, is the -- from which it's going to be paid by the agency. Doesn't that suggest that Congress thought that there would be an aggregate cap because, A, there is the pool cap, and then, as Justice Sotomayor says, we don't expect lawyers to go after claimants who, by definition, often can't work and often don't have much money?"
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,347.64,356.96,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh, the pool cap is a matter -- is a creature of agency work, not actually an artifact of what Congress has done."
2018.17-773,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,378.2,390.36,"The -- the answer -- the answer is, am I right, that, look, for what -- in an EAJA case, where you collect the money from the government, the lawyer gets money from -- he takes the fee out of that, is that right?"
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,390.36,395.64,The -- the attorney has to effectively return the lesser of the EAJA fee or the 406(b) --
2018.17-773,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,395.64,395.96,Okay.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,422.36,422.64,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-773,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,422.64,423.2,All right.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,438.2,440.28,The lawyer can be authorized for 50 percent.
2018.17-773,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,440.28,440.72,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,440.72,441.28,That's possible.
2018.17-773,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,441.28,447.64,"Look, the lawyer can be authorized -- I mean, I'm not trying to -- I'm just trying to find -- get the thing straight in my mind."
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,447.64,448.32,"Yes, it's possible."
2018.17-773,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,448.32,450.6,No EAJA fee of a greater amount.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,460.52,461.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-773,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,461.08,467.68,"And your argument against that is that's like the null set, unless Gates happens to be on welfare, which I think he isn't."
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,467.68,468.12,Yes.
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,484.24,489.36,I have a question that bothers me greatly about this whole litigation.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,513.92,515.88,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,521.92,523.32,That's not true consent.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,536.44,539.2,I don't believe that that was done in this case.
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,539.2,555.52,I -- I am troubled by these fee disputes because I want -- often wonder if clients are being adequately represented once the dispute moves from the main case and into how much you're entitled to.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,555.52,563.16,"But, in this case, Your Honor, not only was Ms. Wood informed of what was happening, but she had consented to it."
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,563.16,566.12,Not without being told of the potential conflict.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,566.12,569.52,I don't know in-depth how much it was explained to her.
2018.17-773,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,569.52,585.28,"Practically -- practically, where would you -- you can't get money out of the Social Security benefits, if -- if they've been exhausted under -- under (b) for the court work."
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,598.16,611.32,"Your Honor, if there are no EAJA fees in the picture, which would increase the size, effectively increase the size of the pot, and the claimant can't pay any more money, you would take your lumps and leave."
2018.17-773,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,622.2,644.68,"Well, wouldn't that -- if that's the general case, then what are the practical consequences of our agreeing with your position when you can't get more than 25 percent out of the Social Security benefits themselves?"
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,644.68,665.08,"Well, the practical implications of the aggregate cap rule, Your Honor, is that attorneys will be less willing to take on these cases ex-ante because they will understand that in many cases they will not be getting fees for work in court because that pool will have been expanded -- expended."
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,665.08,669.12,How many cases have EAJA awards?
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,669.12,674.68,"In Gisbrecht, Your Honor, the concurrence mentioned that it was 41 percent."
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,682.72,689.6,So in about 40 to 50 percent of the cases there will always be a pot bigger than the 25 percent?
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,689.6,690.32,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,690.84,694.04,"That's what you're fighting for, is that 25 percent that -- that --"
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,694.04,699.64,"Yes, but the aggregate rule does not allow the attorney access to any of that."
2018.17-773,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,702.64,703.16,Does.
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,703.16,708.24,"So even under -- so under the aggregate rule, that extra money under EAJA is simply unavailable to the attorney."
2018.17-773,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,719.56,726.52,"(a)(4), I thought, established a 25 percent cap on the pool, the statute itself."
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,729.56,732.4,"No, (a)(4) is a little bit unclear, Your Honor. (a)(4) talks about the --"
2018.17-773,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,732.4,733.12,"Well, it seems very clear."
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,735.08,736.56,"No, it does say 25 percent."
2018.17-773,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,746.92,755.08,"But that -- that pool established under (a)(4) is the only pool, that Justice Ginsburg has been referencing, that's the only pool, correct?"
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,755.08,757.16,That is the only pool. The agency doesn't --
2018.17-773,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,757.16,761.6,"That's capped, the pool is capped by statute at 25 percent?"
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,761.6,762.36,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-773,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,774.12,779.84,The regulations interpreting that do cap the pool then at 25 percent as well?
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,779.84,780.92,They do.
2018.17-773,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,840.52,846.6,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-773,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,846.6,848.56,Thank you.
2018.17-773,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,848.56,850.16,Mr. Yang.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,850.16,862.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is one and only one operative provision in this case, and it's Section 406(b)(1)(A)."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,964.92,966.36,"A different argument, but --"
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,966.36,975.04,"Different argument, but while we're on (a)(4) I thought I'd touch upon it. The second provision is in (b)(1). That's on page 8a."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1020.08,1020.68,Right.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1020.68,1021.12,-- total.
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1021.12,1021.36,Right.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1027.12,1030.4,"Well, it's an -- an interpretation of the permissive part of the statute."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1030.4,1034.6,"Right, that's what I mean by saying it's not -- maybe it's not mandated by the statute, is your point."
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1034.6,1085.04,"So it's not -- so -- but when Congress was enacting these provisions and any cap that might exist, Congress understood that it was authorizing the agency to withhold more than 25 percent with the operation of these two. There's another point to be made that I think we haven't focused on, is that we've only been talking about attorney fees because this case involves an attorney, but Congress has authorized non-attorneys to represent agency -- clients before the agency, and in subsection (e) of 406, specifically directs the agency to extend the fee payment provisions, the direct payment provisions that we're talking about in (a)(4), to non-attorneys. But in doing so, Congress in (e)(2) -- unfortunately, we didn't reproduce this in our brief, but it's in (e)(2) -- set forth prerequisites for these non-attorney representatives to be eligible for this direct payment."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1132.52,1138.6,But we're told by the amicus brief of the disability attorneys that that almost never happens.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1138.6,1139.64,Almost never happens -- which --
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1139.64,1142.2,That they try to get the money directly from the client.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1144.84,1151.44,That -- that cannot be correct for the set of non-attorney representatives that are not eligible for direct payment under (a)(4).
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1151.44,1151.72,Right.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1151.72,1157.16,"The only way they can get their money is from the client. Also, if you look at the criminal prohibitions in --"
2018.17-773,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1157.16,1162.24,"Counsel, how often are those people family members or -- or --"
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1162.24,1175.4,"That I -- I don't know, but I do know that there are -- the criteria that Congress has specified under (e)(2) does not contemplate that we're talking familial relationships."
2018.17-773,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1175.4,1176.64,All right.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1205.64,1207.96,It's not above the 25 percent.
2018.17-773,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1215.76,1216.04,Right.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1216.04,1224.4,"-- 25 percent of past-due benefits, it recovers as an overpayment of past-due benefits from the -- from -- from the future stream."
2018.17-773,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1244.84,1253.12,"To the -- to the poor recipient, it doesn't really sound like they were responsible for your failure to withhold."
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1258.92,1266.6,"Well, I don't think that -- first of all, no one has questioned the government's authority where the government has already paid the money that should not have been repaid."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1323.04,1325.6,You -- you obviously have a good textual argument.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1354.92,1357.0,I don't think that's entirely true.
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1357.04,1358.76,You still have a strong textual argument.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1358.84,1361.28,"No, no, I -- I think we win on the text regardless of the policy."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1361.28,1361.76,Right.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1363.24,1369.16,"But -- but the -- I think on the policy, there are going to be cases where you're going to get greater than 25 percent."
2018.17-773,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1398.2,1426.96,"But I think the import of Justice Kavanaugh's question is that in the usual case in which there are proceedings both at the Commission and at a district court, and there are two 25 percent caps, it -- it's -- it's not the government's position that in that usual case where lawyers can say, well, I won here and I won there, that both of them are entitled to 25 percent fees or that both of them should get 25 percent fees."
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1426.96,1432.0,"In a normal case where you've got a substantial amount of past-due benefits, we think that's not the case."
2018.17-773,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1446.4,1446.6,What --
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1446.6,1447.52,For a disability complaint --
2018.17-773,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1447.52,1457.76,"I don't -- I think, you know, what strikes me as -- as, you know, troublesome about this, and then you could add a court of appeals proceeding to it and the possibility of 75 percent fees."
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1464.08,1466.36,"Well, I guess there's two points."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1550.76,1556.36,"Well, what's your definition of ""smaller"" versus ""more substantial"" that you used in response to Justice Kagan's question?"
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1556.36,1561.4,"Well, I -- I think it will depend on the amount of time and litigation spent on the case, but what is --"
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1561.4,1564.52,The money's coming right out of the claimant's pocket.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1564.52,1566.12,It's coming out of the past-due benefits.
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1567.08,1567.8,Right.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1567.8,1572.92,"And so for -- in this case, you know, in this case, I think we would have -- it falls somewhere in the middle."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1581.84,1582.08,Right.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1582.08,1582.96,"-- of about $35,000."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1582.96,1593.08,"It comes right out of the claimant's pocket, and it -- and it's unusual to have a 50 percent chunk out of a claimant's -- out of a party's pocket."
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1593.08,1598.36,"That -- that is true for many tort cases, although I don't believe it's unheard of."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1600.4,1602.24,"Yeah, I said unusual, yeah."
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1602.24,1606.84,"Yeah, and in a lot of these cases, you must understand these are all generally taken on contingency."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1612.52,1617.2,"Well, it's low stakes for the attorney, but it's high stakes for the claimant."
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1617.2,1623.44,"That is true, but, again, there are two countervailing interests that Congress was trying to address here."
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1637.28,1648.0,"That's -- that's where -- I'm sorry to belabor this, but that's where the amicus briefs of the disabled -- disability attorneys comes in because they say they usually agree not to take more than 25 percent."
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1654.92,1657.12,"Well, I think attorneys -- the fee --"
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1657.12,1658.12,-- where there's not a cap.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1658.12,1665.08,"-- the typical fee agreement that exists caps out at 25 percent of past-due benefits, both for the agency and for the --"
2018.17-773,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1665.08,1665.4,Exactly.
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1667.96,1673.88,"Well, there are different fee agreements, both for the agency at 25 and for the court at 25."
2018.17-773,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1700.8,1715.56,"So, if I understand what you're saying to us, Mr. Yang, there have been -- one could respond to some of these qualms about a 50 percent fee by saying don't worry, it will never happen. But you're specifically not saying that."
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1727.16,1728.52,It -- it -- it may well happen.
2018.17-773,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1757.4,1759.44,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-773,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1759.44,1759.88,Thank you.
2018.17-773,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1759.88,1760.56,Ms. Weil.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,1760.56,1801.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 406 is not a model of clarity. It's a piecemeal statute that was enacted over a series of amendments over a course of 50 years. But the best interpretation of its provisions, one that the agency has adopted and -- and argued in favor of in the courts for half a century, up until April of this year, is that it imposes a 25 percent aggregate cap on agency and court fees. There are three primary reasons why this is the best interpretation of the statute. First, it is the most plausible reading."
2018.17-773,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1905.64,1939.36,"Counsel, on that on the incentive structure point, I -- I -- I can surely understand the impulse, and I feel that the 25 percent's quite a lot, even if past-due benefits, I know future benefits are untouched, and that's a sympathetic position. But couldn't a rational Congress also think that there are some extraordinary cases that are hard and in order to incentivize attorneys more might be appropriate, in order -- I mean, if you overregulate, you create scarcity, right? And if you overregulate the availability of attorneys, nobody's going to take the case."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,1939.36,1939.8,That is the --
2018.17-773,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1939.8,1968.84,"And so, here, isn't it at least conceivable that a rational Congress might think there would be an odd case where you need above 25 percent, up to 50, but we're going to put in special checks, a reasonableness inquiry at the administrative level and a reasonableness inquiry at the district court, all of which is subject to further review, I'm sure. So why -- why -- why is that an irrational scheme to provide incentive structures so that people do have representation and that there isn't artificial scarcity?"
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,1968.84,1972.8,"See, it's not an irrational scheme to say they would have done it some other way."
2018.17-773,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1975.36,1975.6,Okay.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,1977.72,1977.92,Well --
2018.17-773,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1977.92,1980.2,-- but as a matter of policy you admit it's a draw?
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,1980.2,1989.36,"-- as a matter of policy, there's never been any showing by anyone that there's a disincentive to taking cases because of a cumulative 25 percent."
2018.17-773,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1989.36,1994.36,You admit a reasonable Congress could worry about that scenario?
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,1994.36,1999.68,This Congress did worry about the scenario of their getting more than 25 percent.
2018.17-773,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2011.88,2040.12,"The only -- the only -- does this example, an example of where they might get more, they work very hard, long hours, and they get the client, disabled, and as a result of that, the client gets $5,000, but the client also gets up to as long as he lives, and that's all future. So the client eventually will get half a million dollars."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2059.68,2059.92,"Well, Your --"
2018.17-773,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.92,2072.64,"Okay? Now -- but have I -- have I -- see, I'm using that as an example in my mind as an example of where, well, this could be justified. Now do I have it right? That's what I'm not certain about."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2072.64,2073.76,"Well, if you look at the way the --"
2018.17-773,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.76,2074.88,Is my example right?
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2074.88,2078.64,"Well, your example probably isn't going to come out that there's four months."
2018.17-773,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2096.64,2098.84,"It all adds up to $50,000 because of the accumulation --"
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2098.84,2099.16,So it could add up.
2018.17-773,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2099.16,2110.0,"-- so now we get $12,500 and he would like $12,000 more because he had to go to court, and that took another two years, and, besides, the client will not get $50,000."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2114.2,2117.6,"But what you have to take into account, Your Honor, is the fact that --"
2018.17-773,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2117.6,2119.44,I just need -- I need to know first and foremost --
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2119.44,2120.4,Right.
2018.17-773,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.4,2127.24,"-- is -- is -- is what I say -- this is a tough statute for me -- I mean, is -- is this -- have I got the example right?"
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2127.24,2134.48,"Well, the example's right in terms of, if you go before the agency and you -- you lose, you have to go to court. That's what happens in all of these cases."
2018.17-773,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2134.48,2146.48,"But, counsel, I think what Justice Breyer's getting at, and I think it's a premise of my question too, is, isn't it fair to say that in a -- in a significant number of cases that future benefits are larger than past benefits?"
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2146.48,2152.36,"They're -- yes, future benefits are, but I disagree with the concept that you won't be hounded."
2018.17-773,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2166.36,2167.44,Can't go after --
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2167.44,2169.8,Cannot go after future benefits.
2018.17-773,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2169.96,2170.72,But can't -- can't --
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2170.72,2171.84,These are past-due benefits.
2018.17-773,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.84,2173.84,"I -- see, that's what I was worried about."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2187.04,2190.04,He got the client -- who knows what's going to go.
2018.17-773,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2192.0,2193.0,"No, I know, I know."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2193.0,2195.32,He did what he did for him then.
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2195.68,2206.4,"Well, I think maybe we should just be practical, okay? Let's assume that there's 25 percent of the judgment that wasn't paid out."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2212.68,2213.44,If there were --
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2213.44,2216.44,"He can't go after the future benefits, correct?"
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2216.44,2223.16,"I don't believe that's necessarily true, because the future benefits cannot be gone after, but these are past-due benefits."
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2223.32,2224.76,So let's -- let's stop there.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2236.28,2236.48,Right.
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2284.76,2292.36,I -- I -- I think that may be wrong on your part because the agency is only authorized to withhold 25 percent.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2292.36,2292.84,Right.
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2292.84,2297.96,So I don't think you can claim that they wrongfully didn't withhold an additional 25 percent.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2298.56,2302.88,That's because the agency's framework is set up for a 25 percent aggregate cap.
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2303.4,2305.56,But that's legislatively imposed.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2305.56,2306.12,Correct.
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2306.12,2324.64,"I -- I -- I take your point that there could be garnishment on the past-due amounts, is what you're saying. I'm presuming also that that attorney could withhold documents from the client, could do anything else a lawyer does when they're not paid, correct?"
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2324.64,2325.04,Right.
2018.17-773,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2332.68,2339.84,"Well, but your -- your friend on the other side says that this just doesn't happen, that these lawyers do not go after the recipients."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2353.36,2358.28,"Well, and the -- well, they're asking now to be able to be paid more than 25 percent for a purpose."
2018.17-773,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2381.96,2390.32,"But, Ms. Weil, I take -- I take the point, and, indeed, Mr. Yang suggested, that this happens and that it was meant to happen."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2396.28,2396.4,Well --
2018.17-773,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2396.4,2397.28,Where does it come from?
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2397.28,2417.68,"-- let's discuss that because both the Petitioner and the Claimant have said that the two words -- it's -- there -- there are two words in this entire statute that just make their position correct and that say that you get up to 50 percent of benefits, and those two words are ""such representation"" in section (b). And I suggest to Your Honors that actually --"
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2417.68,2421.44,There's -- there's such representation before the court --
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2421.44,2421.8,Yes.
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2421.8,2424.96,"-- in (b), and before -- in (a), before the commissioner?"
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2424.96,2434.96,"Well, their argument really has been pointing to the (b) language of ""such representation"" before the court, and they claim that that shows that you can get up to 50 percent of the past-due benefits."
2018.17-773,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2495.52,2498.36,I guess I -- I don't quite get the argument.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2503.68,2504.04,Right.
2018.17-773,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2504.04,2516.28,"And then you're saying that there's some kind of implicit exclusion as to another 25 percent, or however much it is, for agency representation."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2517.92,2519.48,I'm not actually arguing exclusion.
2018.17-773,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2547.4,2554.12,But the statute is set up so that there are very specific sections governing agency proceedings and court proceedings.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2567.76,2568.6,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-773,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2643.56,2657.48,"It -- it makes sense that they split them, but -- but you're not suggesting that there's any place in the statute that you can point to and say: Look, that provision is the provision where Congress indicates that it makes sense that they split them."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2657.48,2659.64,You -- I -- I really have two arguments on that.
2018.17-773,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2807.04,2823.16,"Congress used the phrase ""in the aggregate"" in one place that they rely on as well as part of the textual argument, which is the title -- the subchapter, the 2 and the 16 benefits they use ""in the aggregate"" there and don't use it here. Do you have a --"
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2823.16,2826.2,That is unfortunate.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2829.6,2832.4,"If it had been more clear, we certainly wouldn't have been here."
2018.17-773,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2832.68,2837.16,It sounds like you're saying they didn't -- Congress didn't think through --
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2837.16,2837.64,Well --
2018.17-773,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2837.64,2841.92,-- in its language the exact situation on the ground.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2845.28,2850.6,"What you do with that is, well, you say, why did that happen? Because this is a piecemeal statute."
2018.17-773,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2887.12,2898.52,"I mean, it seems -- to support your point, it seems almost absurd that Congress would have wanted litigation or actions by disability attorneys against disability claimants."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2898.52,2899.68,Congress would not want --
2018.17-773,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2899.68,2899.88,That --
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2899.88,2900.48,-- any of this.
2018.17-773,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2900.48,2906.04,"-- that said, the ""in the aggregate"" is missing and the text is a problem, as -- as you acknowledge."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2906.04,2916.24,But it might be possible that they didn't think they needed it because of the way they put forth all these statutes and the way they kept putting in the 25 percent cap and the way the agency had read it.
2018.17-773,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2916.6,2919.72,What about the language -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2919.72,2925.96,"From the -- from the very beginning, they had had the 25 percent withholding and 25 percent cap."
2018.17-773,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2925.96,2947.6,"What -- what about the language that Mr. Yang referred to in (a)(4)? This is the language about payment in an amount equal to so much of the maximum fee as doesn't exceed 25 percent of past-due benefits, which suggests that the maximum fee could be more than 25 percent."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,2947.6,3003.96,"I actually think that that language came from a 1990 conference report. And trying to understand what all this is, you have to read all this legislative history. And part of the legislative history was there was a discussion going on in the 1990 Senate conference report when they were discussing the fact that the way the system was set up, you would determine past-due benefits. First, you would, if you got -- if you had a disability and SSI claim, you had to determine past-due benefits by first backing out, reducing it by the amount of the SSI before you determined the attorney fee. And the reason they were doing that is they were saying that the person ended up really not needing the SSI, they were made effectively poor by the fact that we weren't paying them the disability originally. So when we're -- going to determine attorneys' fees, we're going to reduce the amount of the past-due benefit pool to be paid from."
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3053.76,3074.28,"Ms. Weil, I believe it helps you, doesn't it, that the probability of there being an award over 25 percent of the past-due amounts is when no past-due amounts are awarded, correct? Because an attorney can receive a reasonable fee."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,3074.28,3077.6,"Correct, in a overpayment or a termination case?"
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3077.6,3078.44,Exactly.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,3084.0,3087.2,"Well, there -- yeah, there won't be any past-due benefits."
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3087.2,3088.12,Exactly.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,3097.0,3098.48,Calculated?
2018.17-773,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3098.48,3112.84,"Because the government's making much of this, that Congress contemplated it, and I thought your brief said they contemplated it only in the two circumstances of where there's no past-due amounts."
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,3112.84,3114.0,"Well, that's correct."
2018.17-773,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3166.6,3177.28,But isn't that exactly the hardest cases where you maybe are most in need of good legal services and lawyers might be least likely to participate?
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,3177.28,3186.16,"Well, that's the fortunate thing about (a), the 25 percent does satisfy the attorneys and, (b), the EAJA award can be in excess of that."
2018.17-773,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3188.76,3195.04,"But you would agree with the premise that -- that these are the cases, these are the hardest cases where attorneys are most useful perhaps?"
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,3195.04,3197.12,"Well, I think they're necessary to go into court."
2018.17-773,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3197.12,3197.2,Yeah.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,3197.2,3199.84,"I don't know necessarily the hardest cases, but definitely --"
2018.17-773,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3199.84,3200.8,They've lost below.
2018.17-773,2,63055,amy_l_weil,,3200.8,3201.6,And that's the only --
2018.17-773,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3201.6,3202.72,They've lost below.
