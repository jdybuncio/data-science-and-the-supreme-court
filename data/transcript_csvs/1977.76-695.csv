1977.76-695,0,36892,marvin_e_wright,,20.711,24.151,Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1977.76-695,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,211.377,228.613,"If the University provided for automatic dismissal or termination on failure for two successive years to maintain an average of 70, let us say, will they need a hearing if developed that for two years the average was 60?"
1977.76-695,0,36892,marvin_e_wright,,228.613,245.033,"No Your Honor, I did not believe that it would, any more than in the case at Bar because it boils to a question of the academic evaluation being placed upon the professors of the institution."
1977.76-695,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,254.335,266.928,"In other words you are saying that, when the judgment is subjective by a committee, it is not any different from, on a mathematical evaluation."
1977.76-695,0,36892,marvin_e_wright,,266.928,291.881,"Well, that is correct Your Honor because the subjective evaluation of the professors, the institution University of Missouri of Kansas City, a numerical figure is not placed upon a student's performance, but obviously in placing a sixty on the student performance, the subjective judgment of the professor is what leads to that conclusion."
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,1746.509,1750.139,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1977.76-695,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.788,1860.02,What about her patient relationship?
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,1860.02,1863.27,That is just what I was going to address.
1977.76-695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.863,1866.652,That is one of the elements in the medical education.
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,1866.652,1867.123,Yes.
1977.76-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1965.887,1976.804,"Mr. Benson, assuming that a medical school or any other school said that in order to graduate you must have a passing grade in every subject that you take."
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,1979.046,1979.446,No.
1977.76-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1981.719,1985.191,"Well, if they had that at this school, do they?"
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,1985.191,1985.946,"No, they did not."
1977.76-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1991.757,1994.738,"If they did not have to them, but did they say they had to pass?"
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,1994.738,2009.611,"No, the stipulation I believe is on page 25 is that policies and regulations of the medical school do not state the requirements for graduation in terms of the successful completion of any number, that should be over percentage of courses."
1977.76-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2017.404,2019.52,What is the basis of graduation?
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,2019.52,2020.393,"Well, that is --"
1977.76-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2020.393,2021.615,You see what my trouble--
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,2021.615,2039.307,"That is an excellent question and that this something that this student having gone through two years of this medical school having up until May 1st of 1973 having received a satisfactory grade and the only grades that you get at this medical school are satisfactory, unsatisfactory or no credit, having gotten the highest grade that she could receive."
1977.76-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2039.307,2045.424,"Well, I assume here to say if they did require passing in every subject you would not be here?"
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,2045.424,2047.646,"Well, I am-- no that is not quite right because --"
1977.76-695,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2047.646,2050.031,"Well, if you are going to, you are to going to upset a lot of schools in this country."
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,2050.031,2078.377,"Well, our allegation is that when a professional graduate school, where the student is in the school with an aim towards a, clearly a particular field and that school slams the door in the face of that student's being able to get into that professional field that, that is a foreclosure of -- full range of employment opportunities which this court has in the past in similar circumstances and should in this case require a due process hearing."
1977.76-695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.377,2116.155,"Mr. Benson, you say that the graduation for kicking somebody out in effect of a professional graduate school, forecloses employment opportunities but surely that forecloses fewer professional opportunities than being flunked out of college, being flunked out of college forecloses fewer that have been flunked out of high school, it seems to me that, if we were to adopt your question, your proposition, we would be left with a proposition that there is a due process hearing for â€“ a flunking anyone out of any public educational institute."
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,2116.155,2130.862,"Well, I believe that, that would be correct and I do not believe that is-- should be in a impediment to adopting such a ruling because in Goss V. Lopez, this Court has required due process hearings for clearly disciplinary reasons."
1977.76-695,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2213.016,2217.523,"What about the probation, only six months after she entered the school?"
1977.76-695,1,15537,arthur_a_benson_ii,,2217.523,2218.903,Yes.
1977.76-695,2,36892,marvin_e_wright,,3608.368,3612.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
