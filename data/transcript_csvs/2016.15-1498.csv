2016.15-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.465,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-1498, Lynch v. Dimaya. Mr. Kneedler."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,7.465,28.975,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals held that the definition of crime of violence in 18 U.S.C 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague on its face, relying on this Court's decision in Johnson, holding the residual clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act unconstitutionally vague. That was wrong for two reasons."
2016.15-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,70.235,88.71,"But, Mr. Kneedler, didn't the government argue in -- when Johnson was before us, that if the ACCA residual clause was invalid, then 16(b) would be vulnerable because it was subject to the same central objection."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,90.98,97.96,"Well, the -- the United States was responding to the argument that -- that was made in Johnson, which was broader than the Court's ultimate rationale."
2016.15-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,136.68,157.91,"I thought the Johnson, two features at issue were the fact that we were asking courts to imagine what the ordinary crime was, and there was no way to even think about what that was. Your adversary points out, with burglary, if the ordinary crime is during the day, there's one level of risk."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,185.865,202.75,Because I -- I -- there are several very important distinctions between this case and Johnson with -- with respect to that. The -- the ACCA residual clause spoke in terms of a serious potential risk that serious injury to another person might -- might result.
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,252.61,265.055,"Well, may I ask, Mr. Kneedler, because this aspect of your brief was confusing to me because sometimes you're talking about temporal, and sometimes you're talking about functional. And I want to know what you think the real limitation is."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,269.9,270.305,Right.
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,270.305,275.73,And you say that that would fall outside of Section 16.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,275.73,276.39,Right.
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,276.39,282.825,"And the question is why? Temporally, you know, you're possessing a shotgun when you shoot somebody."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,296.445,300.75,"Well, the -- well, first of all, in ACCA that was part of the confusion."
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,303.55,304.2,"Yes, exactly."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,304.2,304.55,But -- but --
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,304.55,308.32,So why are you so sure that there would not be the confusion under Section 16?
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,308.32,311.2,"Well, I think, again, because of Leocal."
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,338.2,339.62,"Well, that's absolutely true."
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,368.26,370.04,Or at least I'm trying to find out --
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,370.04,371.32,-- what you think separates the two.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,371.32,371.46,Yes.
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,397.54,397.71,You know --
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,397.71,397.89,-- crime.
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,397.89,400.33,"-- I -- I was very struck by that language, too."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,436.655,441.8,"Well, it's by its nature of the offense, which would incorporate its elements."
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,470.145,474.34,But why isn't also possession of a shotgun a classic example of that?
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,474.34,489.475,"Well, let me explain, if I may. Burglary is -- is descended from the common law, and its rationale is precisely because of the risk that the -- that the burglar will encounter someone in the course of committing the burglary."
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,508.21,509.74,And -- and give me a contrast.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,519.62,525.36,"Well, I mean, one that did not fall under the -- the ACCA --"
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,525.36,525.58,No.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,532.97,535.06,Begay -- Begay is a good example there.
2016.15-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,593.26,599.61,I think that you're quite right that that was one of the arguments in Johnson that they said make the statute confusing.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,608.6,609.28,Right.
2016.15-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,609.28,610.43,But you're -- you're correct.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,612.33,628.515,"And I -- and I think the -- I think the problem was not examples per se, but -- but the fact that they were conflicting examples that I think the court came to conclude embedded an arbitrariness into the ACCA residual clause in all its applications."
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,637.86,645.925,"So, Mr. Kneedler, it's absolutely right that the court in Johnson said that those examples compounded the problem."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,679.99,680.2,The --
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,680.2,683.215,Because that is still the same under this statute.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,683.215,685.46,"Well, I think it's not the same."
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,729.32,740.25,So can I give you another example just to test how this test works? You say you look to the elements of the -- the offense to see if they give rise to a risk of injury.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,741.07,741.45,Yes.
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,741.45,741.875,Okay.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,764.9,779.88,"Vehicular flight from a police officer after being ordered to stop is, again, if you think by its nature, what -- what was the legislature envisioning when it enacted that? And I think, again, it's parallel to burglary."
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,788.81,795.7,"So that would fall on -- on the included side? Because I -- I had thought that your brief said something different, but maybe I misread it."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,795.7,798.85,"Well, it may depend on the elements of the particular State statute."
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,829.42,848.87,"And go back to possession of a shotgun, because I'm running over in my mind my memory of the Johnson oral argument where basically the SG's office made exactly this argument about possession of a shotgun, how the elements of that offense are understood to give rise to a significant level of risk."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,848.87,867.6,"Well, I think the concern, one of the concerns mentioned in -- in Johnson was what if the shotgun might be used way down the road remotely from that -- from any -- remote in time from any moment in time when the -- when the person was arrested possessing the shotgun."
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,867.6,875.64,"Presumably, the person is possessing the shotgun when the person kills somebody, so it's -- temporally, I don't think that that argument works."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,875.64,875.93,No.
2016.15-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,888.21,901.305,I remember the government arguing in Johnson that most people who are found with sawed-off shotguns are committing crimes. Why isn't that a substantial risk of force being used?
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,901.305,902.22,Well --
2016.15-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,902.22,919.08,"If statistically -- if statistically -- and I don't remember the statistics now, but they were very clear then that a huge amount -- number of the crimes of possession of a shotgun were -- led to criminal activity."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,919.08,926.69,"Well, I think it is the -- is the use of force necessary for the crime of possession of the shotgun."
2016.15-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,928.29,935.09,"Well, the use of force is not necessary for the use of -- for burglary if you walk in and there's nobody there."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,936.28,936.42,No.
2016.15-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,943.15,946.26,So we're now going back to gut instinct.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,946.26,946.5,No.
2016.15-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,974.72,983.885,"Before your white light goes on, could you address your first argument that the vagueness standard is different here than in -- than in Johnson?"
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,983.885,984.43,Yes.
2016.15-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,984.43,999.925,"I might say, Jordan v. deGeorge, a case from some years ago, is a little more persuasive than I had thought for the Respondent -- for the Respondent here."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1006.185,1009.73,"Well, I think there are a number of things to be said about deGeorge."
2016.15-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1017.46,1017.55,Yes.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1017.55,1023.75,And so the question of -- of how it would apply in that setting wasn't addressed. Also --
2016.15-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1023.75,1026.555,Something has to be briefed before we say it's the law?
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1026.555,1035.43,"Well, the Court often -- if the Court has what might be referred to as a drive-by ruling, I wouldn't say it was drive-by."
2016.15-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1078.62,1088.89,That observation was at a time before the draconian effects of removal and deportation came into effect.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1118.475,1121.76,But what -- what's at stake can't be viewed just from that perspective.
2016.15-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1132.28,1142.035,And there is always the fail safe that the Attorney General in his or her discretion can deny -- can deny anyone the right to stay here.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1153.2,1156.725,"Well, if I can address several pieces of that."
2016.15-1498,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1185.14,1202.305,"If the Court -- if the Court were to hold that 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague in criminal cases, what would the impact -- in criminal cases involving the application of the categorical approach, what would the -- what would the implications of that be?"
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1202.305,1224.605,"Well, as we cite in our brief, there are a number of places in Title 18 where the definition of crime of violence is used, either by express reference to 16(b) or by use of the same formulation like in 924C where the same formulation is -- is used."
2016.15-1498,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1224.605,1227.345,What would be some of the most important examples?
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1227.345,1230.895,"Well, that would be -- that would be one."
2016.15-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1244.34,1256.48,Doesn't that -- doesn't that suggest that the argument that the civil standards apply rather than the criminal one loses some of its force for precisely that reason?
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1256.48,1256.9,No.
2016.15-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1285.99,1298.43,"But I thought the point the Chief Justice is underscoring is that if we go -- if we base the decision on the fact that -- that this is civil, then you have to come back here for other cases under --"
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1298.43,1299.05,No.
2016.15-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1318.51,1327.695,"What do you think of the idea suggested in Justice Alito's opinion that the word ""offense"" like the word ""crime"" both those words are ambiguous."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1374.765,1378.52,"Well, we -- we have not argued that because this Court --"
2016.15-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1378.52,1379.68,I think you argued it.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1382.09,1387.085,But this Court's decision in Leocal said the categorical approach applies.
2016.15-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1397.19,1398.24,You'd have to have it argued.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1417.97,1423.525,There obviously would be advantages in the sense that the statute would be -- would be preserved.
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1452.85,1472.16,"Could -- could I ask, just in thinking through your argument, it would help me to get a few examples. So could you give me three examples, let's say, if there are in -- if there are those -- that many, where we struggled under ACCA, but where the answer is clear under 16(b), so that I understand what it -- what kind of distinction you're drawing."
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1472.16,1472.54,Right.
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1517.845,1521.27,Anything else? Because this is really important for me.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1521.27,1521.33,Yeah.
2016.15-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1521.53,1523.595,I'm trying to figure out what our differences are.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1523.595,1523.93,Yes.
2016.15-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1578.53,1587.945,The immigration judge also found that the -- these burglaries qualified as crimes of moral turpitude.
2016.15-1498,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1596.935,1599.4,I think in some circumstances it may.
2016.15-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1610.56,1616.315,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenkranz."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1616.315,1635.705,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As Justice Sotomayor points out, there were two critical factors that this Court pointed to in Johnson that, quote, ""conspired to make the ACCA residual clause unconstitutional."" Everyone agrees that they are both present here."
2016.15-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1665.415,1674.25,"There was something that -- that isn't here, Mr. Rosenkranz, and that is a long history of struggling and failing to come up with an interpretation."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1710.6,1715.26,"Well, Justice Kagan, let me -- let me give two answers."
2016.15-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1832.465,1849.765,"But what of the argument that 16(b) is more precise? For one thing, it is limited to in the course of commission of the offense, and that the offender must be the one who uses the force."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1867.48,1877.98,"Your Honor, let me start with the -- with in-the-course-of, which took a -- a lot of Mr. Kneedler's argument time. Two things -- well, three things to say about it."
2016.15-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1889.24,1896.18,"I think it -- wasn't the word during the ""commission"" of? Is it -- in the course of or during the commission of?"
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1896.18,1897.39,In -- in --
2016.15-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1897.39,1899.11,In 16(b).
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1899.11,1942.86,"In 16(b), the phrase that the government is speaking of is ""in the course of committing the offense."" And so, just to -- to continue that first answer, courts have held that inchoate offenses of the sort that -- that Justice Kagan was asking about, or possession offenses, do create the risk, and appropriately so, because -- or let's take another example that -- that consumed a lot of time today: Burglary. Justice Kagan's question about burglary. Notably, that is why in Leocal this Court held that burglary did -- was sort of the classic example of a 16(b) violent crime."
2016.15-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2000.97,2008.28,"Well, of course -- of course, courts and legislatures always have to imagine consequences when they are classifying crimes."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2019.415,2053.52,"Yes, of course, Your Honor. And if this were just to the question that Justice Alito asked Mr. Kneedler about ramifications, if this is -- if this were just about importing 16(b) into the definitions of various crimes, there's no vagueness problem, because as this Court said in Johnson -- and it addressed exactly that question in Johnson, it's a totally different inquiry when -- when you are applying the stated elements to an actual concrete example that is there before the Court."
2016.15-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2053.52,2077.03,"Mr. Rosenkranz, could I ask you this: Suppose Congress enacted a statute that said any person who commits a crime of moral turpitude in the District of Columbia or with -- within the special or maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States shall be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, would that be unconstitutionally vague?"
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2077.03,2081.965,"Your Honor, it would certainly be problematic."
2016.15-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2104.09,2109.24,"But that seems to me -- I mean, I'm surprised by -- somewhat surprised by your answer."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2132.89,2138.08,"Well, yes, Justice Alito. And -- and that's -- so that is the distinction."
2016.15-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2153.97,2168.74,"But, I mean, unless you're willing to say that the criminal statute that I hypothesized would satisfy vagueness standards, I -- I don't see how you can say that the same vagueness standard applies in criminal cases and deportation cases."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2168.74,2174.55,"Your Honor, the same vagueness standard does apply in -- in the two contexts, but --"
2016.15-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2174.55,2186.9,"So why does crime -- then the statute making a crime of saying anyone who commits a crime of moral turpitude sentenced to 20 -- up to 20 years, that would be -- that would satisfy vagueness for a criminal statute?"
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2186.9,2198.4,"In a criminal statute, it would not, because there is no history of agency interpretations to which courts must defer. But let me just back up for a moment."
2016.15-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2198.4,2201.275,What -- is DUI a crime of moral turpitude?
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2201.275,2202.81,I -- I have no idea.
2016.15-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2202.81,2206.245,How about failure to file an income tax return?
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2206.245,2212.19,"I mean, I don't know what the agency interpretations of moral turpitude --"
2016.15-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2212.19,2214.33,How about unlawful entry into the United States?
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2214.33,2215.94,I think not.
2016.15-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2254.835,2271.57,"Johnson talked a lot about the confusion caused by the predicate offenses that were -- were listed; in fact, in colorful terms explained why those compounded the vagueness in the residual clause."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2274.015,2275.42,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2329.23,2333.22,"Well, but the statute as a whole might be because you can look at it and say, well, there's one of the examples."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2346.645,2347.18,Right.
2016.15-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2347.18,2348.92,"Basically, what the Court held in Johnson."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2348.92,2349.02,So --
2016.15-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2349.02,2359.72,"So the fact that, yes, it's clear when you get to the specific thing that's named, but that, as the Court explained, it makes it much more confusing -- confusing when you get to the residual clause."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2359.72,2373.235,"So -- so I think the -- the easiest way to look at this, I would say, is if that -- if that had been the pivotal factor in Johnson -- so Johnson says there are two factors that conspired."
2016.15-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.95,2432.545,I -- I see that.
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2507.25,2507.62,Well --
2016.15-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2507.62,2516.44,"So I'm not -- I'm not -- do you see where I'm floating on this? I -- I see your point, it's quite similar, but I quite worry about the implications."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2516.44,2531.4,"Well, Your Honor, so let's -- so let's talk about the immigration that's in -- excuse me -- the implications that is in the immigration context to begin with. In the immigration context, to the extent that Your Honor -- that you are quoting, Justice Breyer, from --"
2016.15-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2531.4,2534.32,I was quoting Cordoza.
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2536.98,2550.43,"I confuse you all the time with him. So to the extent that we're focusing on language that appears in the immigration statutes, that language has been interpreted."
2016.15-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2618.02,2621.64,"Mr. Rosenkranz, I guess I would have thought that your answer would have been different."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2651.86,2654.3,"Thank you, Your Honor. Yes. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2654.3,2655.53,What she said.
2016.15-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2655.53,2661.52,"I mean, if that's your answer, it totally ignores that this is not a criminal case."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2711.89,2734.72,"Well, so, Justice Alito, this Court in Hoffman said that it's a sliding scale. But in Jordan, when it came to deportation, which this Court has described as the gravest sort of consequence which directly implicates liberty interests, this Court said it's at the same level as --"
2016.15-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2734.72,2734.78,No.
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2777.84,2780.22,"Well, Your Honor, let me say, again, two things."
2016.15-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2802.77,2820.58,"Well, would you say the same thing if it didn't -- if this statute did not incorporate a definition that is also used in criminal statutes and simply had the same standard in a purely immigration statute? So no reference to a -- a definition that also applies in criminal cases."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2820.58,2822.92,I would have a different argument.
2016.15-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2867.98,2869.93,I don't think that makes the slightest bit of sense.
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2892.92,2895.78,"Your Honor, you just recited the facts of A.B. Small."
2016.15-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3003.77,3009.02,"What do you do with Leocal? I mean, one thing is clear."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3015.28,3026.48,"Well, two things to say about that statement in Leocal, which was obviously -- I mean this Court -- Leocal burglary was not before this Court."
2016.15-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3045.73,3049.845,"That's why this case didn't work under 16(a) and the elements, right?"
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3049.845,3055.62,"That's correct, Your Honor. And then you bring me to another point that's really important."
2016.15-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3101.51,3103.595,He says burglary is that.
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3103.595,3105.065,Burglary can't be that.
2016.15-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3122.12,3131.695,"If I understood what he was saying, and I won't try to put words in his mouth, but it was something along the lines that, yes, it's true that the elements of burglary do not have the use of force."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3153.98,3155.68,"So, Your Honor, I can't do any better."
2016.15-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3162.33,3178.06,"What is the principle of law that led to A.B. Small? No one thinks statutory words in the civil context, ""unjust or unreasonable rates,"" whether enforced by courts against railroads, or whether enforced by an agency, is unconstitutional."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3192.2,3225.715,"Your Honor, the principle of law that A.B. Small stands for that I was arguing specifically, is the principle of law that when a court strikes a statute that Congress has made the decision to impose civil and criminal consequences to, that statute is gone and you don't start preserving the civil consequences to it, because Congress made the decision and we just follow Congress's direction. I do want to close with one last point, which is about the practical consequences of this ruling."
2016.15-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3310.33,3317.055,"Well, what's coming here? The -- you said that the lower courts are all confused, and there are splits developing."
2016.15-1498,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3317.96,3321.33,Sykes redux is headed to this Court.
2016.15-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3366.88,3370.47,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler, three minutes."
2016.15-1498,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3370.47,3385.73,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, we explained in our opening brief and reply brief that there is simply not the disarray that there was with respect to the ACCA residual clause. This Court has considered one case in the 30 years --"
2016.15-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3385.73,3400.495,"That's if you concentrate on us, but I did read those portions of Respondent's brief and the amici brief, and it does seem like we are going to have a redux Sykes and a redux James and a redux many of the issues."
2016.15-1498,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3400.495,3408.895,"As -- as we -- as we explain in our brief, the -- the conflicts that -- that we address there can be explained by the differences in the state statutes."
2016.15-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3446.21,3446.58,There were some --
2016.15-1498,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3446.58,3447.29,-- in the offense.
2016.15-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3447.29,3462.205,"There were some who argued in the drunken driving test that the minute you get behind the car, you -- drunk, you're using a lethal weapon, a car, to inflict injury on others."
2016.15-1498,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3462.205,3463.11,But the -- the Court --
2016.15-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3463.11,3469.515,"Didn't win here, but that argument was still being made in the courts below and some courts below bought it."
2016.15-1498,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3469.515,3478.255,"Right, but -- but the -- but the important point is this Court clarified it in -- in Leocal to say that you -- it's an act -- it's a category of active violent crimes."
2016.15-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3573.32,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
