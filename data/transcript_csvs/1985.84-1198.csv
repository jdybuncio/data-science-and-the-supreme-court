1985.84-1198,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,67.977,"Mr. Sherrod, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,67.977,71.096,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1198,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,379.393,386.083,"But on these facts, don't we have to cut back on Pearce somewhat if this judgment is to be reversed?"
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,386.083,389.368,"--I think you do, sir, yes."
1985.84-1198,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,437.516,442.77,Did not Pearce leave open the possibility of an increased sentence based on new information?
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,442.77,443.303,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1198,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,475.724,481.395,"Of course, in Pearce, Justice Stewart spoke of events happening after."
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,481.395,482.645,"--Yes, sir."
1985.84-1198,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,482.645,488.115,"These events, I suppose you concede, all took place before?"
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,488.115,516.634,"Every one of the facts that would justify an increase in sentence did in fact occur prior to the first trial, but I think what's important in this case, and the information that contains in Wasman, and where we need further definition and a little guidance, is whether or not the increase in the word from ""conduct"" to ""events"" that was established in Wasman indicates that it's events that come to light at the second trial."
1985.84-1198,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,574.155,577.459,"Then, you think that North Carolinia against Pearce went too far?"
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,577.459,577.959,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1198,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,577.959,578.808,In its holding?
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,578.808,582.51,"Yes, sir, and I believe for two reasons, and we have alleged three."
1985.84-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,589.949,592.301,"May I interrupt you just there for a moment, please, with a question."
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,592.301,593.234,"--Yes, sir."
1985.84-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.234,607.994,"If there were no new information brought out at the second trial, the only thing that was different was the defendant said, well, this time I'll have the judge fix the sentence, would the judge then in your view have been free to impose a higher sentence?"
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,607.994,609.594,"Under our argument, yes, sir."
1985.84-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.58,638.963,"What if the judge just said,"
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,647.453,656.309,"Yes, sir, and I think you can see from the outcome, that was our position because we did not ask the judge and the judge on its own motion did not file the findings of fact."
1985.84-1198,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,666.432,680.942,"Is it your view that reading Pearce and Wasman together, the sentencing judge may take into account intervening information which was not available at the time?"
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,680.942,684.561,"Reading your interpretation, yes, sir."
1985.84-1198,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,710.628,718.882,"But you do have to disapprove or not follow certain dicta in Pearce to reach the result you want, don't you?"
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,718.882,722.353,"Yes, certain dicta of Pearce, yes, sir."
1985.84-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,846.584,847.55,May I interrupt there?
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,867.58,876.686,"It is, Your Honor, and the reason my argument should stand is because, first of all, to modify or to adopt North Carolina versus Pearce has a chilling effect."
1985.84-1198,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1068.561,1070.846,May I ask you this question before you sit down.
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,1070.846,1071.446,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1198,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1071.446,1078.517,Does the record show why the new evidence was not discovered and used at the first trial?
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,1078.517,1081.702,I don't believe the record does.
1985.84-1198,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1084.504,1087.206,"Well, if it's not in the record I suppose you'd better not--"
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,1087.206,1087.606,"--No, sir, it was not."
1985.84-1198,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1087.606,1089.975,--The other ground was remorse.
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,1093.444,1097.414,"No remorse, yes, sir, and I don't think that distinction is really that critical because--"
1985.84-1198,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1097.414,1102.55,I am not too sure it is a ground for increasing somebody's sentence.
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,1102.55,1105.3,"--Sir, I don't think that fact just in and of itself should be--"
1985.84-1198,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1105.3,1107.368,The judge did use it for that purpose.
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,1107.368,1119.176,"--She did use that, now I'm saying this, I think under the circumstances that perhaps would be a valid reason for the Court to assess the punishment the first time but not to increase it."
1985.84-1198,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1119.176,1125.495,"So, since she didn't have the right to do it the first time, all she had to do was grant a new trial?"
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,1125.495,1132.416,"I don't follow that question, sir."
1985.84-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.616,1142.255,I wonder if this is... would it have been permissible for the trial judge to grant a new trial because she was convinced the sentence was wholly inadequate?
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,1142.255,1142.655,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.655,1145.591,And if she really thought that they ought to try it over and impose a proper sentence?
1985.84-1198,0,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,1145.591,1146.793,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1198,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1190.085,1192.302,Mr. Blackburn.
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1192.302,1194.687,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1313.014,1317.799,Is there a separate sentencing hearing when you have a sentence by a jury in Texas?
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1317.799,1319.168,"--Yes, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1327.172,1332.891,And what you are talking about now is the sort of evidence that is allowed to go before the jury in the sentencing hearing?
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1332.891,1335.177,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1198,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1450.117,1459.039,What would be your position if a different judge had tried the second case and entered the same sentence as was imposed here?
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1459.039,1461.857,"I don't think that would make a difference under the facts of this case, Your Honor."
1985.84-1198,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1469.963,1475.084,Wouldn't the vindictiveness of a brand-new judge come into the picture?
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1475.084,1481.821,"--Judge, I'm basing my analysis on the approach created by the cases construing North Carolina versus Pearce."
1985.84-1198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1493.212,1498.247,"But the court didn't... in Pearce didn't even mention in its opinion the fact that there was a different judge, did it?"
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1498.247,1500.899,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1985.84-1198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1509.488,1512.59,"In the courts' opinions in those cases, was that noted?"
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1512.59,1515.976,"I believe it was, in Hardwick versus Doolittle, but I'm not certain about that, Your Honor."
1985.84-1198,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1515.976,1516.744,Mr. Blackburn.
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1516.744,1517.961,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1198,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1517.961,1526.698,Would your position be the same if the defendant had elected again to be tried by... again to be sentenced by a jury?
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1526.698,1527.283,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1198,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1539.824,1543.492,--to prove that each juror had no knowledge of the prior sentence?
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1543.492,1546.611,"I think that would be the burden of the defendant in that particular case, Your Honor."
1985.84-1198,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1546.611,1555.067,"But if the results of the first trial were reported in the press, that would be a rather difficult burden to carry, wouldn't it?"
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1555.067,1555.45,That's true.
1985.84-1198,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1557.502,1558.852,"Even if one juror said,"
1985.84-1198,1,29192,jeff_blackburn,,1567.958,1569.427,"No, Justice Powell."
1985.84-1198,2,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,2014.56,2016.495,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1198,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.676,2071.212,"Well, you say ""the other thing""."
1985.84-1198,2,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,2082.934,2090.757,"Well, when it was denied, of course, the court on its own motion granted discretionary review to consider whether the court had the--"
1985.84-1198,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.757,2091.673,Performance?
1985.84-1198,2,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,2091.673,2092.89,"--Yes, performance."
1985.84-1198,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.731,2113.186,"So, the court of criminal appeals never wrote any opinion in the case except the one about saying that the court of appeals didn't have the power to reform the sentence?"
1985.84-1198,2,40545,randall_l_sherrod,,2113.186,2119.174,"Yes, sir, and that was because they granted discretionary review on the court's own motion only to that limited effect."
1985.84-1198,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2147.025,2147.642,"Thank you, gentlemen."
