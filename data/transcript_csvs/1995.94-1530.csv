1995.94-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,1.492,"Mr. Cundra, are you ready?"
1995.94-1530,0,41143,steven_d_cundra,,10.828,15.031,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,87.188,90.241,May I ask a preliminary question?
1995.94-1530,0,41143,steven_d_cundra,,99.626,115.367,"The statute that would grant the right of review would be 158(d), I believe, of title 28, which grants review from final orders or decisions of the district court sitting as an appellate court over bankruptcy matters."
1995.94-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,115.367,116.858,And is this a final order?
1995.94-1530,0,41143,steven_d_cundra,,116.858,134.048,"I think it is a final order in the context of this Court's holding in the Cohen case, that it is a... under the collateral order doctrine, it finally determines a disputed issue between the parties, it's an important issue that doesn't go to the merits of the controversy, and would be unreviewable on appeal."
1995.94-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,134.048,137.551,But your theory is it's a collateral order under Cohen?
1995.94-1530,0,41143,steven_d_cundra,,137.861,138.971,"Yes, Justice."
1995.94-1530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,138.971,151.179,--And you have... you're relying on the Third Circuit Pacor case for that preliminary... for how you characterize this as a Cohen v. Beneficial--
1995.94-1530,0,41143,steven_d_cundra,,151.179,152.911,"Yes, Justice."
1995.94-1530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,157.994,187.964,"--Can you explain to me what sense it would make to say that, in general, removal is not reviewable at all, then we know Congress wanted to take into account a different... to make the remand larger rather than smaller, and then to say... and for that larger, no review but for what was always understood never to be reviewable, suddenly in the bankruptcy context it's reviewable?"
1995.94-1530,0,41143,steven_d_cundra,,190.965,193.628,One has to consider the context.
1995.94-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,345.165,345.425,May I interrupt you just there?
1995.94-1530,0,41143,steven_d_cundra,,351.418,353.861,Under 1447 a decision not to remand--
1995.94-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,353.861,357.482,"It's not prohibited, but is that a collateral order, a decision not to remand?"
1995.94-1530,0,41143,steven_d_cundra,,357.482,362.056,"--A decision not to remand would not be a collateral order, it would be reviewable at the end of the case."
1995.94-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,362.056,364.909,"Oh, but not immediately reviewable."
1995.94-1530,0,41143,steven_d_cundra,,364.909,365.67,Not immediately reviewable.
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,1735.586,1739.56,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.08,1833.732,"What would you do with 1447 if a whole case isn't removed, but just a particular claim?"
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,1837.035,1845.51,"--I believe 1447 does apply in that case, Your Honor, depending upon the basis of the remand order."
1995.94-1530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1857.669,1868.496,So your position is that the two statutes cover the entire universe of possible remand orders.
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,1868.496,1881.726,"I think... Justice Kennedy, I believe that 1447 covers all jurisdictional remands and all remands on a defect in the procedure of the removal."
1995.94-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.699,1884.908,To State court.
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,1884.908,1886.511,"--Correct, Your Honor, and that's--"
1995.94-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.511,1887.713,Which is a major limitation.
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,1887.713,1889.843,--And that's... but that is what we have in this case.
1995.94-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.704,1895.138,"I understand that, but in response to Justice Kennedy you have to acknowledge that there's a big hole."
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,1898.031,1901.633,"--I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.633,1903.103,So the whole of the universe is not covered.
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,1906.375,1911.958,1447 does talk about removal of cases.
1995.94-1530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1911.958,1918.183,You use the term civil action in 1446--
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,1918.183,1918.343,Civil action.
1995.94-1530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.343,1920.033,"--so it is entire cases, yes."
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,1920.033,1924.457,"And any case removed from a State court, the district court may issue all necessary orders, et cetera."
1995.94-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.312,2022.5,What do you do with a remand that is not on an equitable ground as you interpret what equitable ground means... it's on a jurisdictional ground... but the remand is not to a State court?
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2022.5,2025.703,I think--
1995.94-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2025.703,2026.284,What is that governed by?
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2026.284,2051.829,"--I think under that situation, Your Honor, you need to look to the legislative history that has developed since 1887 where this... and then interpretations of this Court of remand orders generally that provide that those types of orders are not reviewable for the reasons of judicial economy and the fact that parties should not be litigating over where to litigate."
1995.94-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.48,2053.741,"You say it's not covered by this statute, however."
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2053.741,2055.271,"--I don't believe that it is, Your Honor."
1995.94-1530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2055.271,2056.753,"So then it's Thermtron, is that right?"
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2056.753,2058.274,"I believe so, whether or not--"
1995.94-1530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.274,2071.003,"So anything that's not... I mean, in a nonbankruptcy case, outside the jurisdictional and defect in removal proceeding area, Thermtron, and so the answer would be the same."
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2071.003,2076.688,"--Well, 1447 provides for remands on jurisdictional bases."
1995.94-1530,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2082.83,2085.504,"Oh, but just a State court, so that brings us back."
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2090.379,2105.269,"--I think that that may be correct, Your Honor, but again in this case this is a removal from a State court, and also a remand to a State court, and I believe you do tie back into 1447 on that basis in this particular case."
1995.94-1530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2105.269,2120.53,"How frequent are removals from... of the Federal district court, that's even strange language, because every other place where there is transportation within the Federal system it's called transfer and not removal."
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2120.53,2138.91,"That's correct, Your Honor, and although the petitioner does point out an example in their brief, frankly, in my 10 years of practice I have never seen a case that has been removed from another Federal court to a bankruptcy court."
1995.94-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2138.91,2143.894,You will acknowledge that this is not a tightly drawn statutory scheme.
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2143.894,2190.487,"I... particularly the 1452 sections, subsection (a) and subsection (b) of 1452, and I think the reason for that again, Your Honor, is that Congress had the whole legislative history of 1447 and what led up to that and the act of 1887 and 100 years of the statute and the history behind that and the interpretations of this Court before it when it enacted the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, which put in place I believe it was 1478 at that time, which became 1452, and I believe that's the reason why there is no further delineation."
1995.94-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.757,2241.14,"And you assert that we have inherent authority to preclude not just immediate review, but to preclude all review of the decision to remand in cases that fall between these two statutes."
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2266.36,2280.751,"Well, I believe the code sections say, Your Honor, that in order... remanding or deciding not to remand is not reviewable by the court of appeals or by the United States Supreme Court by appeal or otherwise."
1995.94-1530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2280.751,2281.822,--Ever.
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2281.822,2282.653,I'd say the answer's yes.
1995.94-1530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2284.214,2284.514,Ever.
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2289.8,2289.95,Well--
1995.94-1530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2289.95,2305.991,"Suppose you remand a case to State court, you couldn't at the end of the line come back and argue to the U.S. Supreme Court, well, there was a misconstruction of the remand statute so we should not have had to suffer the State court judgment."
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2305.991,2321.943,"--I believe in the situation that Your Honor just indicated I think the answer's yes, that is not reviewable, although as Mr. Cundra indicated, the question of jurisdiction itself could be reviewed if the case is retained by the Federal court at the end of--"
1995.94-1530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2321.943,2322.564,"Yes, if it's retained--"
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2322.564,2323.014,--that litigation.
1995.94-1530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2323.014,2325.876,--because subject matter jurisdiction is always reviewable.
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2325.876,2326.026,Correct.
1995.94-1530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2333.58,2335.923,"But once you remand it to the State court, that's it."
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2339.756,2347.352,"Correct, and that's the intention of the statute, is to get on with the litigation, and that's the whole point of why we're here."
1995.94-1530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2663.471,2680.643,"Do I understand your view on 1452 to be it's essentially supplemental, it applies to the extent that it applies, and to the extent that there's any hole, you still have the basic removal remand scheme?"
1995.94-1530,1,33674,john_c_weisensell,,2680.643,2681.812,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1530,2,41143,steven_d_cundra,,3318.317,3320.989,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
1995.94-1530,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3355.355,3356.815,--at the end of the final judgment.
1995.94-1530,2,41143,steven_d_cundra,,3356.815,3357.346,--I'm sorry?
1995.94-1530,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3357.346,3360.418,Why wouldn't it be reviewable when they get a final judgment?
1995.94-1530,2,41143,steven_d_cundra,,3360.418,3369.304,It says a decision not to remand under 1452 never be reviewed by appeal or otherwise at any time.
1995.94-1530,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3371.677,3374.77,It even mentions the Supreme Court of the United States explicitly.
1995.94-1530,2,41143,steven_d_cundra,,3374.77,3375.297,--Yes.
1995.94-1530,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3375.297,3383.474,"I mean, but the obvious... I mean, I don't know if that means that when it's part of the final judgment you wouldn't look to see if the court was without jurisdiction."
1995.94-1530,2,41143,steven_d_cundra,,3390.938,3396.741,"That would be the result, because that's the only statute that makes unreviewable a decision not to remand."
1995.94-1530,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3403.095,3416.627,"But if it was really a case of subject matter jurisdiction, the Constitution would trump any such statute, right, because Article III says what Congress can tell the Federal court they can do."
1995.94-1530,2,41143,steven_d_cundra,,3416.627,3417.488,One would hope.
1995.94-1530,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3417.488,3425.194,So subject matter jurisdiction is always reviewable because of the limitation on... the constitutional limitation on the court's authority.
1995.94-1530,2,41143,steven_d_cundra,,3425.194,3432.23,"Which then, reading it in would make it unconstitutional, the statute to be read as including jurisdiction would render it unconstitutional."
1995.94-1530,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3455.755,3457.658,"Mr. Cundra, I think we have your position."
