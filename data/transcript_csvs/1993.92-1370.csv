1993.92-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.772,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92,1370, BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation."
1993.92-1370,0,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,51.615,54.967,"Mr. Chief Justice, Justices, may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1370,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1201.072,1207.658,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1370,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1266.264,1291.331,"Well, Mr. Mann, I think, you know, it's pretty easy to conclude that reasonably equivalent value means something other than market value, but does it also mean, we accept as a per se rule that a foreclosure sale yields reasonably equivalent value, or is it a case... is it open to a case-by-case inquiry, or is it only a presumption?"
1993.92-1370,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1295.699,1319.565,"Yes, they are, Justice O'Connor, and I think the way to go about it is to try and ascertain why Congress would have chosen the particular words that they used and then look at them through the lens that the Court has used for evaluating other similar problems the Court has faced under the Bankruptcy Code where you could interpret language in a way that would disrupt systems that the States have carefully put together for dealing with difficult policy questions."
1993.92-1370,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1384.024,1388.059,"Well, what if it had been a private sale and not a foreclosure sale."
1993.92-1370,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1388.059,1388.842,The--
1993.92-1370,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1388.842,1390.428,How would your rule play out there?
1993.92-1370,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1390.428,1395.915,"--The rule that we seek rests on several features that are really unique, I think, to real property foreclosure sales."
1993.92-1370,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1397.948,1406.62,"In other words, to help me out, you would not make the same argument as applied to a voluntary sale?"
1993.92-1370,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1406.62,1413.043,--I think that the... I'm... that's right.
1993.92-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1440.341,1443.543,"Well, but there's another important feature, too, and in most States there's a redemption period."
1993.92-1370,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1443.543,1449.347,"--I think it's... I'm less willing to sort of agree with that type of a generalization, because redemption--"
1993.92-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.347,1450.13,"Well, there is in California."
1993.92-1370,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1450.13,1452.965,"--There is in California, but it ends at the date of the foreclosure sale."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2340.64,2348.196,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1370,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2367.527,2374.68,"Well, excuse me, Mr. Sment, I think we're here today to interpret the Federal bankruptcy statute and determine what that language means."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2374.68,2388.19,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor, and in order to do that we need to focus on the key term, reasonably, and I think on focusing on that term, as the counsel for the petitioner admits, we have to look at the circumstances in the sale."
1993.92-1370,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2394.594,2400.415,"Well then, why do you need a per se rule if you want to look at the circumstances of the sale?"
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2400.415,2417.44,"--The per se rule does look at most of the circumstances of the sale, and I think that's something that the petitioner seems to overlook, that in order to reach the conclusive presumption that the Ninth Circuit allows, we do have to look at the circumstances in a number of factors at the sale, with one exception."
1993.92-1370,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2417.44,2419.959,But the circumstance you look at is whether it was conducted in accordance with State law.
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2419.959,2423.946,"No, we look to see if it was noncollusive, which doesn't necessarily mean State law--"
1993.92-1370,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2423.946,2426.898,"Well, two circumstances: 1) was it noncollusive, 2) did they comply with State law?"
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2426.898,2427.665,--And the third one--
1993.92-1370,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2427.665,2428.665,"That's the end of the ball game, isn't it?"
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2428.665,2431.367,"--Well, but in looking in that, Your Honor, the third one is, was it a fraudulent sale?"
1993.92-1370,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.367,2433.302,"Well, that's the same as noncollusive, really."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2439.906,2445.277,"In order to look at that, Your Honors, we have to look at the parties involved, we have to look at the facts and circumstances--"
1993.92-1370,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.277,2448.812,"--The lender puts the property in for the mortgage indebtedness, is what normally happens."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2451.264,2453.049,"--That isn't what happened here, Your Honor, and keep--"
1993.92-1370,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.049,2453.865,"--Well, 11,000 plus dollars."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2453.865,2471.011,"--Well, keep in mind here, Your Honor, under California law and under most foreclosure laws, 1 bid over the credit price for the loan is sufficient to buy the property, and there's no investor that would necessarily spend more than the 1 if he didn't have to, so the implication from the 11,000--"
1993.92-1370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2471.011,2472.577,No one would spend 1 if he could get it for nothing.
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2476.646,2480.248,"--Well, I don't think the foreclosure laws deal with stealing, Justice Souter, and I would be--"
1993.92-1370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2480.248,2513.469,"No, but the trouble, it seems to me, with your argument is that if the phrase in question, reasonably equivalent value, means nothing more than you say it does and imposes no more of a duty than you say it imposes, it would have been infinitely simpler for Congress simply to say that a bona fide sale conducted in accordance with the requirements of State statutory or common law will be conclusively presumed to realize a fair or sufficient value, and it would avoid all of the interpretive problems that we've got."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2521.373,2528.479,"--But Your Honor, doesn't the term, reasonably, suggest that the Court has to conduct its evaluation under the circumstances it faces?"
1993.92-1370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2528.479,2544.238,"I think it does, and it certainly precludes the... it seems to me, the application of a... in effect a per se rule that once there is a noncollusive, nonfraudulent sale in accordance with state statutory requirements, that's the end of the issue."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2544.238,2553.844,"I disagree in part, Justice Souter, and only because I think in the analysis for determining the reasonable equivalent value, the Court has to consider the State law."
1993.92-1370,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2557.629,2574.924,"But there's one Bankruptcy Code and there's a variety of State laws, and some are more protective, some have... require more in the way of advertising... do some require an appraisal before there's a sale, and some don't."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2596.806,2601.491,--And it's the very fact of that variety that precludes an application of the Bundles decision.
1993.92-1370,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2638.283,2647.972,"Well, because satisfying the requirements of State law and noncollusive, those are independently taken care of by the act without regard to 548(a)(2), what does 548(a)(2) do?"
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2647.972,2649.939,"I disagree in part, Your Honor."
1993.92-1370,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2671.118,2672.352,I understand that argument.
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2688.73,2699.753,"Section 548 is not limited to foreclosure sales, so if we had a nonjudicial... or a nonforeclosure sale sale, the Court would have to look at all of those circumstances under section 548."
1993.92-1370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2776.955,2785.692,"Why isn't the better rule, even under your own argument, simply that there is no conclusive presumption, but that in California... and I don't know whether this is true or not."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2812.092,2815.83,"--Your Honor, I think in a State where there is a law, you do need that presumption."
1993.92-1370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2816.746,2820.198,"Well, we've got to interpret the statute for the whole country, not just for California."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2820.198,2824.233,"--I understand, Your Honor, but we also have to interpret it based on the facts that are before us, and the stats--"
1993.92-1370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2824.233,2828.352,"No, but you're not asking it to be interpreted based on the facts that are before us."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2847.146,2854.4,"--If that's the case, Your Honor, where you would win without the presumption, isn't that a basis for applying the presumption?"
1993.92-1370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2856.835,2859.537,Not if we're going to have... not if we're going to have one rule for 50 States.
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2859.537,2861.823,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, if we have one rule--"
1993.92-1370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2861.823,2866.275,"I mean, the statute doesn't mean something different in California from what it means in Vermont."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2866.275,2880.3,"--But if it means that under your law you've satisfied all the tests in our State to determine whether you've done what the statutes require, you've obtained the value that you can, you've protected all of these parties, isn't that a basis--"
1993.92-1370,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2880.3,2892.342,"Well, you... you make very easy to answer when you say you've obtained the value that you can, and some State laws require you to obtain... or to do everything reasonably possible to obtain that value."
1993.92-1370,2,36730,michael_r_sment,,2908.72,2910.904,"--I was trying to respond to your question, Justice."
1993.92-1370,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2911.439,2913.222,"Thank you, Mr. Sment."
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,2916.391,2918.91,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice:"
1993.92-1370,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2934.269,2938.739,"But you're not really doing that, because you come before us and say, well, two-thirds is close enough."
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,2944.243,2946.679,"I don't think it is, Your Honor."
1993.92-1370,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.679,2950.131,"--But you're saying 70... well, you're saying 70 percent is close--"
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,2950.131,2952.499,"I said I would settle for 70 percent, because we would win under that."
1993.92-1370,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.966,2961.953,"--I'm not sure, either, and the logic of what you're arguing is that it should be 100 percent, and that makes it a lot more difficult."
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,2961.953,2965.754,"--No, it... no, reasonably equivalent can't mean 100 percent of equivalent value."
1993.92-1370,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.837,2968.17,Reasonably close to 100 percent.
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,2968.17,2983.93,"Yes, I think that's right, Your Honor, and what that means is difficult, and it leaves open for the Court a lot of discretion on the facts, but there shouldn't be a conclusive presumption that they throw us out of Court on a motion for summary judgment or a motion for a dismissal for failure to state a cause of action at all."
1993.92-1370,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.633,3143.713,"Mr. Woolsey, suppose you have someone who's on the verge of bankruptcy and, realizing that, has a going-out-of-business sale, sells all the stuff in the store not at 70 percent but at 20 percent of what it's really worth."
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,3148.248,3150.181,"--Your Honor, that comes down the wholesale question."
1993.92-1370,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3155.652,3162.156,"It's sort of a distressed basis, and he only gets... you know, he says 20 percent is the only thing that will clear it, so he asks 20 percent."
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,3162.156,3172.196,"Well, he... at least it's a voluntary sale and it's not taken from him, and he makes the decision that it's best to sell it, and he can sell it at a wholesale price."
1993.92-1370,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.445,3262.772,"Don't you think Congress had some obligation to be clearer about that point if it expects us to set aside the foreclosure laws of 50 States, which until now have been assumed to transfer good title, and in the future they won't?"
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,3265.789,3273.943,"--Well, Congress... of course, the Court would find it... the clearer the language of Congress, the easier the job for the Court, and the more consistent throughout the country--"
1993.92-1370,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3273.943,3277.228,"I'm just asking, where do you think the burden of clarity in this case ought to be?"
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,3283.548,3288.833,"--Where it's unclear, of course the Court can take into account extraneous things other than the face of the statute to try to interpret them."
1993.92-1370,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3301.491,3302.691,It doesn't mean anything at all.
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,3306.71,3308.594,"Well, I think it does."
1993.92-1370,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3319.433,3329.558,It could mean something different in the bankruptcy context than it means... and I think Mr. Mann was talking about the application of 548(a)(2) outside the bankruptcy context.
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,3329.558,3332.51,"Well, there may be a difference."
1993.92-1370,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3333.076,3335.878,Outside the foreclosure.
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,3337.562,3338.663,"--Oh, yes."
1993.92-1370,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3338.663,3344.9,"So that in answer my question, what good does this section do, he said that there are sales other than foreclosure sales, I believe."
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,3344.9,3366.397,"Well, I think that it applies to foreclosures as well as other transactions, yes, and what would it do if it doesn't apply to foreclosure, it could apply to other transactions, that's clear, but here we have, in 101, the Congress specifically saying the foreclosure of an equity of redemption is a transfer, so it seems to me that we've got to say that foreclosures can be reviewed by the Court."
1993.92-1370,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3366.397,3378.205,"And if under State law a bid simply for the amount of the debt is always going to be conclusively deemed to be sufficient, the equity of redemption is always going to be worth zero, right?"
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,3378.205,3378.871,That is correct.
1993.92-1370,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3380.121,3381.823,Presumably Congress didn't mean that.
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,3381.823,3382.689,I don't think so.
1993.92-1370,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3385.625,3388.66,"Thank you, Mr. Woolsey."
1993.92-1370,3,40781,roy_b_woolsey,,3388.66,3388.91,Thank you.
1993.92-1370,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3388.91,3389.693,The case is submitted.
