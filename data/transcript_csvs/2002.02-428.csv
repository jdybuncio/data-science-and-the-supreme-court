2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,53.716,59.8,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,90.659,92.281,Of the same what?
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,92.281,93.196,TV show.
2002.02-428,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.218,126.135,Can we go back to your statement?
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,156.179,170.479,"Taking the lower courts in ascending order, on page 53a of the cert petition, the language is that the court finds that defendant's failure to identify the television series and the book is misleading to the public."
2002.02-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.729,208.052,This is a failure... this is a failure to attribute case then?
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,208.052,209.08,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
2002.02-428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,211.615,216.714,"But may I just point out on 3a, it... the quote... you left out the first clause I think."
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,223.285,223.533,"--Oh, yes."
2002.02-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.039,274.531,"Counsel, would... would the new Dastar video qualify as a derivative work that would deserve copyright protection on its own?"
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,274.531,275.43,"--Yes, yes."
2002.02-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.616,277.234,And is that issue being litigated?
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,277.234,278.417,"--No, it isn't."
2002.02-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.417,278.636,No.
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,279.36,299.892,"Our... our most sweeping statutory point is, while not necessary for this opinion certainly... this case, certainly would dispose of it, that the current version of the governing statute, Lanham Act 43(a)(1)(A), does not recognize reverse passing off at all."
2002.02-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,320.933,322.487,Only what kind of passing?
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,322.487,323.9,Forward passing off.
2002.02-428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,323.9,326.149,What is forward passing off?
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,327.54,330.955,"It's not football, Your Honor."
2002.02-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,350.586,353.667,Is it some kind of affirmative misrepresentation?
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,353.667,355.4,In forward passing off?
2002.02-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.4,356.044,Mm-hmm.
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,356.044,358.264,I... I--
2002.02-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.264,365.662,To... to get some kind of liability under the Lanham Act under a reverse passing off theory.
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,365.662,371.53,--If I may first distinguish reverse passing off and then come back to Your Honor's question.
2002.02-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,371.53,372.103,Yes.
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,372.103,386.639,"Reverse passing off, in contrast, is where Brand X for some reason... the commercial motivation is often hard to discern... gets a legitimate Rolex, removes the Rolex name and puts the Brand X name on it."
2002.02-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.861,399.345,"Well, it's... it's related to this."
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,407.18,407.749,--Yes.
2002.02-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.749,423.627,And do you say there is no such thing at all or do you acknowledge that there could be some Lanham Act violation if there were some kind of affirmative misrepresentation?
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,423.627,424.368,Both.
2002.02-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,432.702,438.653,"Indeed, the Solicitor General would urge that we... we not take the broader view."
2002.02-428,0,20897,david_a_gerber,,439.004,443.487,"I don't believe so, from the Solicitor General's brief."
2002.02-428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.001,444.147,Okay.
2002.02-428,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,968.818,982.738,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.171,1025.453,Excuse me.
2002.02-428,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1066.616,1082.282,"--We... we would take that position, Justice Scalia, and I think that... that would be consistent with the way this Court has consistently interpreted the term origin, if you look at the Wal-Mart case, the Qualitex case, and going back to the concurring decisions in the Two Pesos, which is to refer to the source of production or manufacture."
2002.02-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.282,1084.951,Production not in the Hollywood sense of production.
2002.02-428,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1084.951,1086.599,"Absolutely, and--"
2002.02-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.599,1089.849,Production in the sense of I made this... this physical article.
2002.02-428,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1089.849,1091.902,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1102.895,1105.935,"That's what this was, in the public domain, was it not?"
2002.02-428,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1105.935,1107.379,--That's correct.
2002.02-428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1108.242,1115.215,Do you think that this Dastar product could have been copyrightable as a derivative work on its own?
2002.02-428,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1115.215,1121.813,--We do think that it could be copyrightable as a derivative work to the extent that it's not subject to copyright protection.
2002.02-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.708,1201.042,"Now, is there... is there no... I understand you're saying I say I produced this, all it means is I produced this physical object."
2002.02-428,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1224.836,1225.623,Well--
2002.02-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.623,1227.161,Is there no remedy for that?
2002.02-428,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1248.198,1248.926,--Two responses.
2002.02-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.272,1309.335,There isn't any general Federal anti-lying law--
2002.02-428,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1309.335,1310.101,Well--
2002.02-428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.101,1311.349,--that you could these people--
2002.02-428,2,20721,dale_m_cendali,,1629.592,1630.37,Italians.
2002.02-428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.444,1721.99,But the... the issue is whether the Lanham Act creates a cause of action with respect to that particular unhappiness.
2002.02-428,3,20897,david_a_gerber,,3437.05,3439.096,I have two short points.
2002.02-428,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3490.608,3497.759,And you... you would stand by that for forward--
2002.02-428,3,20897,david_a_gerber,,3497.759,3498.825,Absolutely.
2002.02-428,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3498.825,3499.473,--causes of action--
2002.02-428,3,20897,david_a_gerber,,3499.473,3499.698,Yes.
2002.02-428,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3499.698,3501.821,--as well as... as well as reverse.
2002.02-428,3,20897,david_a_gerber,,3501.821,3502.074,Yes.
2002.02-428,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3502.074,3520.5,"So that if I sold a cassette that I physically manufactured and I advertised it as being Carmen Jones, the original MGM production, and in fact it was The Capitol Steps, there wouldn't be any... there wouldn't be any Lanham Act cause of action."
2002.02-428,3,20897,david_a_gerber,,3520.5,3523.805,I think that is forward passing off.
2002.02-428,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3524.308,3524.851,That's what I'm saying.
2002.02-428,3,20897,david_a_gerber,,3534.731,3534.904,"--Oh, excuse me."
2002.02-428,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3535.179,3537.19,"I mean, he who says A must say B, right?"
2002.02-428,3,20897,david_a_gerber,,3537.19,3543.572,"The... the answer under the specific, myopic section we're looking at that it is correct."
2002.02-428,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3645.085,3660.935,"Well, if you have a minute, would you address Ms. Cendali's argument that there is significance when a product has intellectual content and there is duplication because then the confusion may very well, indeed, redound to the... to the original... to the originator of the product?"
2002.02-428,3,20897,david_a_gerber,,3667.373,3671.287,--I'm not sure I... I'm recalling the example completely.
2002.02-428,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3676.526,3676.708,No.
2002.02-428,3,20897,david_a_gerber,,3694.835,3699.068,--I'm not sure I will buy into that consequence.
2002.02-428,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3731.391,3732.495,"Thank you, Mr. Gerber."
