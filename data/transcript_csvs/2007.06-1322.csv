2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-1322, Federal Express Corporation v. Holowecki."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,10.572,26.315,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress clearly set out a statutory scheme in which timely notice and the opportunity for conciliation are required before an age discrimination private suit may be brought."
2007.06-1322,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,53.801,57.303,"Well, EEOC Form 5 is labelled ""Charge""."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,68.494,77.6,"We think the better rule is that it would not be a charge until notice is given, because that's the only rule that is faithful to the statute, that notice is required."
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,98.597,100.616,"Well, why don't we do exactly that here?"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,147.679,153.398,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, to begin with, the plaintiff never requested that the court do that."
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,171.212,175.597,But you said the same complaint could be filed at the end of the conciliation.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,212.722,226.196,"Well, Congress believed that notice and a chance to conciliate without a lawsuit was the proper way for this to be done, and there is a difference in efforts to conciliate before and after a lawsuit is filed."
2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,227.062,228.898,"Well, I think... I think you're right about that."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,259.932,262.118,--I think it could be dismissed without prejudice.
2007.06-1322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,282.131,289.653,"Why... why should the... the filing fee penalty, in effect, go to the plaintiff when it wasn't the plaintiff's fault?"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,289.653,297.824,"--Well, you know, I would submit that perhaps it is the plaintiff's fault when the plaintiff does not do everything a plaintiff can to be sure that a charge is filed."
2007.06-1322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,306.361,318.87,"May I interrupt you to this extent: As I understand it, if... your position, if the plaintiff had filed on Form 5 and the EEOC had done nothing and the plaintiff then brought suit, you'd be making the same argument."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,318.87,322.355,"That is true, and equitable tolling is available."
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.355,323.722,I don't understand that.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,357.746,358.479,"Well, Justice... sorry."
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.479,361.547,"I mean, it just doesn't track."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,361.547,370.603,"Justice Scalia, I understand your hesitancy to accept our definition of ""charge"" as including notice, but the other view--"
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.603,373.805,So give me another one that will enable me to rule in your favor?
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,373.805,390.434,"--It is... it is just as true and the results are just the same if you look at the statute as a whole and you uphold the sense of the statute and you understand that the requirement before bringing a suit, whether or not notice is part of the definition of ""charge""."
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.728,409.997,All right.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,420.436,421.536,I don't know if it always is.
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,439.517,441.082,After she had a lawyer.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,475.19,481.193,"Well, I think that the, the practice has been so inconsistent and that's part of the problem."
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.588,500.771,But that's not the question.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,523.169,524.62,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.463,542.582,"Well, it has to be signed."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,542.582,546.05,"--Well, this... right."
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,555.989,559.374,"Well, she filled out hers after she was already in court and had a lawyer."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,586.341,593.864,"It... the form does say, the form that she filled out, the intake questionnaire, does say that someone will talk with you after you fill this out."
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.601,602.47,"It said it wasn't a charge, didn't it?"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,603.737,604.47,"Yes, it did."
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.842,614.56,Precharge counseling.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,614.56,619.396,--and for determination whether we have jurisdiction over potential charges.
2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,621.014,626.168,Do we know... perhaps this is a question your friend on the other side will be able to answer better than you.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,640.678,642.462,"--We do not know, or I do not know."
2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,680.452,682.754,I agree completely with everything you said.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,689.225,690.708,The plaintiff does not lose.
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,703.451,726.45,"What happens... what happens if... in this case it's not a problem, but I can imagine it would be in many cases... if you have a 300-day or a 180-day problem, you withdraw the complaint, and then you're out there and the clock keeps ticking, and you get past the 300 days and you are totally out."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,742.06,742.493,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,757.92,762.306,Do you think Ms. Kennedy is entitled to equitable tolling in this case?
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,762.306,770.729,"Ms. Kennedy didn't need equitable tolling, because in this case she caught the situation before the time ran and she filed a charge."
2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,791.659,795.711,"I guess she, reasonably or otherwise, thought there already was a lawsuit."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,795.711,798.58,"--Well, not after the lawsuit was dismissed, Your Honor."
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,808.002,810.087,Wasn't she appealing?
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,810.087,810.554,Pardon me?
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,810.554,812.056,Wasn't she appealing the dismissal?
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,812.056,814.656,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,822.295,829.132,"Did you undertake conciliation efforts after her formal, her filing of the Form 5 charge?"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,829.132,832.72,"--We were in a lawsuit, Your Honor, and so that sort of changes everything."
2007.06-1322,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,863.119,875.943,"If the employee files an intake questionnaire but not a Form 5, would you say that there would be equitable tolling, or would you say that the employee wouldn't be entitled to equitable tolling because the employee didn't file the right form?"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,875.943,889.353,"I think that unless she was relying on the EEOC, and there have been cases like that in which the EEOC says, the field agent says, that's all you need to do, this is a charge and notice is going to issue."
2007.06-1322,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,910.231,920.855,"I don't see much difference between the substance of these two forms, other than the fact that the Form 5, I think, requires a listing of the number of employees that the employer has."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,924.357,929.261,"There is very little difference, you're exactly right, in the information requested."
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,986.348,991.002,"Well, I don't understand that, because EEOC is a responsible agency."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1021.335,1022.52,--But that is the problem.
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1066.882,1081.992,"What about the new form, the EEOC's new form... I suppose responsive to this case and others like it... that says if you don't file any other administrative complaint, we'll count the intake questionnaire as the charge?"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1081.992,1091.848,"Well, that's... that's an interesting form because that means it you come in the day after the act of discrimination, that form is filled out; it is neither a complaint nor a charge."
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1106.424,1112.344,"If the EEOC treats it as a charge, then the EEOC is obliged to give notice."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1112.344,1123.402,"But they won't know if it's a charge until the entire time runs, to know if it's the only timely filed document, because it says it's only a charge if you don't file anything else on time."
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.269,1128.706,Where... where does it say if you don't file it's only--
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1128.706,1132.241,If it's the only timely document filed--
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1132.241,1132.675,--Yes.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1132.675,1136.277,"--means that no other document within the time period, which is 300 days."
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1136.277,1137.26,That's the new form.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1137.26,1137.479,In deferral stage.
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1144.216,1149.168,And where in the form that--
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1149.168,1149.736,I'm sorry.
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1152.321,1159.475,"--The new form does say that, that if no other paper is filed, this can be treated as a charge?"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1159.475,1166.146,"This will be a charge, if no other timely allegation of discrimination is... is filed."
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.146,1177.954,"Doesn't that eliminate the whole purpose of the... of the preliminary document, to weed out those charges that relate to employment in France?"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1177.954,1178.52,It does.
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.472,1181.356,It will... it will be a charge even if it's in France?
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1181.356,1182.358,Right.
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.915,1195.365,I think that's right.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1202.837,1203.204,--Exactly.
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1203.204,1205.137,"Which is very nice for the EEOC, but not--"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1205.137,1210.758,"Which can only happen at the end of a long period of time, which means that the notice will not be prompt."
2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1210.758,1223.751,"Counsel, the Government relied in its brief very heavily on the Chevron case, saying we should defer to the agency's regulations, and on the Auer case, saying we defer to the agency to tell us what its regulations mean."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1229.405,1237.741,"Well, the... the regulations are certainly entitled to deference, and taken as a whole, the regulations, just as the statutes, require notice."
2007.06-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1262.292,1269.28,"But if they do that why can't... and you don't... if they don't give you the notice, well, then you can complain, they didn't give us the notice."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1269.28,1269.663,Well--
2007.06-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1269.663,1272.648,"But if you're not hurt by it, what difference does it make?"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1272.648,1276.016,"--Well, I agree if we get the notice, we cannot complain."
2007.06-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1276.016,1279.837,"And if you don't get it, you can't complain, if you actually knew about it."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1279.837,1280.303,I... I--
2007.06-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1280.303,1283.455,"If you didn't know about it, then... then you have a complaint."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1283.455,1284.705,"--Justice Breyer, I agree."
2007.06-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1297.063,1301.751,"Well... well, then you'd have the complaint if you didn't, et cetera, but so what?"
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.11,1317.76,--Intake questionnaire.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1317.76,1317.962,Intake questionnaire.
2007.06-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1317.962,1318.845,Yes.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1324.449,1327.984,"If they treat it as a charge and give notice, I have no problem."
2007.06-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.984,1330.52,"And if they don't, you complain about that."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1330.52,1334.488,"Well, where do you... the problem is that there no place to complain."
2007.06-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1338.44,1340.642,"You complain just as you're doing now, in court."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1355.818,1356.468,--Exactly.
2007.06-1322,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1357.535,1358.052,"Well, all right."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1359.354,1363.905,Well it's... it's the situation where you are hurt that's the problem.
2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1371.911,1380.183,"And you're only... when you say you're hurt, the only prejudice that you rely on is the fact that you didn't have an opportunity to go through prelitigation conciliation."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1380.183,1382.219,--We didn't have prompt notice.
2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1383.585,1388.723,"But... but my point is, you're not alleging prejudice from the lack of prompt notice."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1394.11,1394.727,"--Well, we don't--"
2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1394.727,1399.079,Your only prejudice is the lack of conciliation period.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1399.079,1415.106,"--Well, I don't think that's the only prejudice, and this is what somewhat speculatory because it did not happen; but generally if you have prompt notice, particularly without a lawsuit, you can investigate; and if you don't have prompt notice, sometimes you have destroyed documents in the regular course of your business that are helpful to you."
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1424.562,1426.248,Do we know whether that's true in this case?
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1426.248,1427.614,--Do I believe that's true in this case?
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1427.614,1462.004,"Do we know whether... I mean the difference... what you are suggesting would be perfectly fine is once the charge was filed, and this is a lawsuit, and then you would investigate or whatever, but you would be under exactly the same disadvantage if the time lapse has meant that employees have left, that you have... you have removed evidence as old and disposable."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1475.829,1476.764,That is true.
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.94,1494.442,Excuse me.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1530.315,1532.867,"--And I agree, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.988,1568.456,"Well, as a practical matter, you can't conciliate after suit anyway."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1571.225,1571.642,Right.
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1571.642,1572.242,--on the other side.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1572.242,1573.042,That's absolutely right.
2007.06-1322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1590.437,1591.639,How is it... how is it new?
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1595.341,1602.995,"--Well, in the court of appeals, as the test had been administered by other courts which required evidence--"
2007.06-1322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1602.995,1605.447,"Well, didn't... didn't your brief say that was the appropriate test?"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1605.447,1611.017,"--Because in that court we were bound by precedent and that was the test, but we said--"
2007.06-1322,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1611.017,1615.854,"Well, you... I know you're bound by precedent, but if you think it's wrong, you can say it's wrong."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1619.056,1626.777,"--Well, we... the manifest intent test that we talked about was the one the courts have used, which is the situation we were talking about, where equitable tolling should occur."
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1646.94,1647.808,"Well, what is your test?"
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1649.625,1650.342,When notice--
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1650.342,1652.46,And don't tell me when notice is given.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1652.46,1652.86,"--Yes, sir."
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.546,1654.596,My goodness.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1657.581,1659.264,Well... I'm not... and that's what I'm saying--
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.264,1659.866,It's just not true.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1659.866,1663.485,--But... but notice is required for the suit.
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.139,1671.591,"Yes, only because I'm sane."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1672.924,1675.293,--A point well taken.
2007.06-1322,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1694.42,1705.345,"If she had the obligation to give notice, you would have a much stronger argument, but the statute places that burden on the EEOC, not on the lay complainant."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1705.345,1709.612,"The burden is on the EEOC, and that is why there's equitable tolling."
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.666,1717.368,But there can't be equitable tolling unless she has really filed a charge.
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1723.522,1723.989,A charge--
2007.06-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.989,1728.426,"You're only going to give her equitable tolling if in fact she's, she's filed a charge."
2007.06-1322,0,19452,connie_l_lensing,,1735.314,1736.366,--No.
2007.06-1322,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1753.208,1754.077,"Thank you, Ms. Lensing."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,1757.029,1764.266,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to make two points initially."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.855,1882.426,Is this after the real charge was filed or what everybody concedes--
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,1882.426,1882.809,Form 5.
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.809,1884.792,--The charge form.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,1884.792,1889.58,"The charge Form 5 was file on... well, she signed it on the 30th."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.102,1899.536,But suit was pending at that time.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,1901.654,1902.654,"Well, I used Fed Ex--"
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.654,1903.84,That's pretty risky.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,1903.84,1907.875,--I used Fed Ex for a record because I can use their tracking.
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.634,1924.853,Answer my question.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,1927.038,1927.421,"--Yes, sir."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.871,1929.388,Yes.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,1929.388,1938.66,"All right, let me address your question, if I may."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.802,1979.235,Wait.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,1983.273,1983.773,Yes.
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.773,1987.908,That's the only number of mistakes they have made; is that what you're saying?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,1987.908,1988.275,No.
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.663,2000.734,"I'm astounded if that's the only number of mistakes they made, from 19--"
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2000.734,2001.134,"--No, no."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.634,2005.436,"--Oh, with respect to Fed Ex."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2005.436,2006.554,And it's age claims.
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.554,2007.804,Oh.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2007.804,2017.946,"That date is... I had to ask for it, but it is public, and I checked again yesterday with counsel for the EEOC, which I'm also representing here today."
2007.06-1322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2017.946,2020.762,But are you telling us stuff that's not in the record at all?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2022.631,2037.74,"Well, it's relevant because this is a complaint that was dismissed before any evidence was taken, and therefore any set of facts that's alleged in the complaint is assumed to be true for purposes of its trial B motion."
2007.06-1322,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2054.534,2056.135,What is the point of these statistics?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2059.054,2060.005,Yes.
2007.06-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2063.891,2069.879,But I thought conciliation was an important policy of the EEOC.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2069.879,2075.697,"--EEOC does very little within 2 months, Your Honor, of anything, of receipt of the charge."
2007.06-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2075.697,2078.484,"But you want us to write an opinion saying, we're not concerned with conciliation?"
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2079.067,2079.5,No.
2007.06-1322,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2114.407,2118.811,"--What if the person fills out an intake form, checks the box that says"
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2121.263,2131.035,"I think that's a question that's not presented here, and I think that's a question that is best... best left to EEOC."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.18,2151.063,What's... what's wrong with this?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2203.897,2204.381,--Right.
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.381,2219.257,"Now, if the EEOC chooses to give notice, then I guess you could say one that's close to the boundary line becomes a charge retroactively, and there is... there is no harm done."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2247.576,2250.278,"Your Honor, I differ on this."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.743,2277.095,"Whatever it was, this thing says it's a precharge document."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2277.095,2282.416,"--Your Honor, it says... if you look at the two part form, it's very small writing."
2007.06-1322,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2299.878,2302.58,This is where... you're reading from where?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2302.58,2303.78,--It's two... I'm sorry.
2007.06-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2345.757,2346.959,--Is that in the record?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2346.959,2347.426,No.
2007.06-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2389.069,2396.874,"Mr. Rose, I'm having trouble figuring out... she not only filed this intake questionnaire; she also filed a lengthy affidavit."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2396.874,2397.558,"--Yes, sir."
2007.06-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2397.558,2399.124,Where did all this stuff come from?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2399.124,2402.343,She had friends who had filed charges before.
2007.06-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2407.43,2411.082,Did these friends file charges on intake questionnaires?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2411.082,2413.484,--They had all filled out intake questionnaires.
2007.06-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2415.603,2416.77,On Form 5.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2416.77,2417.372,Yes.
2007.06-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2439.7,2444.318,Do you know why she signed the intake questionnaire on two different dates?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2444.318,2445.152,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2510.861,2513.478,You were representing her at that point?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2513.478,2522.434,"By February, I... I don't think we had the retainer, but I had talked to her, and I... and she signed the retainer either in late January or early February."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2522.434,2525.12,Why do you think... why do you think they must have lost it?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2528.072,2528.455,Yes.
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2548.234,2553.371,"Even if they treat it as a charge, they don't docket it?"
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2553.371,2560.709,"I don't know when they docketed the form, the Form 5, that she filed."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2566.177,2570.748,"I really think the problem here is the EEOC, rather than anybody else."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2570.748,2572.517,"I think that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2572.517,2588.292,"It does, indeed, have this form which says... which says that its purpose... information provided on this form will be used by Commission employees to determine the existence of the facts relevant to a decision as to whether the Commission has jurisdiction and to provide such precharge filing counseling, blah, blah, blah."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2593.346,2593.963,Exactly.
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.963,2600.0,"And if the filer is not interested in keeping any of it confidential, I wouldn't even read the Privacy Act."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2600.0,2601.334,"Well, she probably didn't, Your Honor."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2601.334,2603.119,"Well, what kind of an agency is this?"
2007.06-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2605.154,2608.106,Suppose they made a mistake here.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2608.106,2608.84,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2007.06-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2608.84,2615.444,"What I think Miss Lensing, one of her more basic points is this: There is a statute."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2630.119,2630.586,Sure.
2007.06-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2630.586,2635.34,"Now, I replied to that, well, okay, they complain about the lack of notice."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2668.494,2669.111,Right.
2007.06-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2669.111,2673.132,But they must make mistakes in their history when they file charges and didn't give notice.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2697.331,2698.114,"Oh, it's--"
2007.06-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2698.114,2701.633,What does the law say happens when they don't give notice?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2701.633,2708.721,--I think the law says that it could be a defense but it's an affirmative defense and it's not--
2007.06-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2708.721,2709.788,"Well, it wouldn't be a defense."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2714.992,2715.392,--Right.
2007.06-1322,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2715.392,2718.177,--You'd have to work out some kind of equitable tolling or something.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2722.146,2725.648,"Well, I'd say the law is, Your Honor, what the regulation says."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.748,2751.815,Where does that appear?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2751.815,2758.569,"It's in all the, it's in the joint appendix, Your Honor."
2007.06-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2760.019,2762.521,351?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2762.521,2764.539,That sounds right.
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.536,2796.677,"In its very definition of a ""charge"", it says a charge shall be in writing and shall name the prospective respondent and shall generally... shall generally allege the discriminatory acts."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2798.41,2798.86,Yes.
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.86,2801.396,It doesn't say that anything that contains that is a charge.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2801.396,2801.998,"Oh, I think it does."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.998,2804.498,I could write out something that contains all three of those things.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2805.866,2808.318,"Well, let me... let me refer you to the next page, then, Your Honor, which is--"
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2808.318,2808.702,All right.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2810.352,2812.786,--which is (a) and (b).
2007.06-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2840.373,2841.906,I like my cite better.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2857.898,2859.2,"I like that one, too, Your Honor."
2007.06-1322,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2862.286,2868.94,"But if an employee files something like that and says I don't consent to notification of the employer, can that be a charge?"
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2868.94,2892.822,"I think that it... it really depends whether the employee has put on top of it... I think you need... I think there is a... we take the position that if it meets the definition of 1626.3, or the other parts of 1626, it is a charge."
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2892.822,2896.273,"Well, then, all intake questionnaires are a charge, because they all contain that."
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2916.837,2917.539,"Well, I think--"
2007.06-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.539,2919.889,--set forth in 26.3.
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2919.889,2933.149,"--I think the last question was whether if... if she checked the other box, it would be; and I think that there is no consistency on what EEOC has done in that situation."
2007.06-1322,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2933.149,2946.725,"Well, there may be none, but if the... if the employee indicates by the box checked that the employee does not want the company to know that the employee is making whatever this is, this statement--"
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2946.725,2947.958,Right.
2007.06-1322,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2947.958,2954.396,--how can it be regarded as a charge against the employer which sets in effect a litigation process?
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2954.396,2964.937,"Well, I think that's why the better reading probably, as Your Honor suggests, is that it's not a charge if that's all the form is, and she checks only--"
2007.06-1322,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2964.937,2972.358,"But you're okay because on that criterion your... your client said, yes, you can tell them?"
2007.06-1322,1,21404,david_l_rose,,2972.358,2973.21,--Absolutely.
2007.06-1322,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2973.21,2974.41,Okay.
2007.06-1322,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2974.41,2975.61,"--Thank you, Mr. Rose."
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2986.283,2988.735,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2007.06-1322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2988.735,3011.835,"Mr. Heytens, let me tell you going in that my... my main concern in this case, however the decision comes out, is to do something that will require the EEOC to get its act in order, because this is nonsense: These regulations that are contradicted by forms; this failure to give notice, but it's okay because it's a charge anyway."
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3027.344,3036.45,"--The agency absolutely agrees with that, Your Honor, and the agency has taken a number of concrete steps, some of which we illustrate in our brief, to deal with what in reality is a very serious problem."
2007.06-1322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.435,3090.018,Excuse me.
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3090.018,3090.601,Sure.
2007.06-1322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3090.601,3097.089,"That's within 10 days of the charge, but that assumes, it seems to me, what's to be proven."
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3098.356,3098.756,That's correct.
2007.06-1322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3098.756,3104.01,"If... if the prefiling, the intake thing, is not a charge, there is no problem."
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3104.01,3106.193,"That's correct, as well, Justice Scalia, and it's important that--"
2007.06-1322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.193,3111.68,Can you not make that not a charge by saying in bold letters on the top: This is not a charge.
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3113.866,3125.839,"--Two responses to that, Justice Scalia: First of all I think it's important to understand that, from our perspective, the test is an objective intent test that looks to the intent of the employee, not the intent of the EEOC in promulgating a form."
2007.06-1322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3126.856,3135.962,Why do the courts have to struggle with this when the agency could put in bold letters at the top: This is a charge or this is not a charge?
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3142.099,3151.507,"--The fundamental source of the problem, Justice Scalia, is, as this Court has recognized, the vast majority of people who initiate EEOC proceedings are lay people who aren't familiar with the statute."
2007.06-1322,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3167.166,3176.456,And the practical problem: I want to know where do I read what the definition of a EEOC rules.
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3205.208,3206.059,"--Certainly, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1322,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3212.212,3215.147,"We use the word there ""manifest intent""?"
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3215.147,3217.849,"--The word ""manifest intent"" is not set forth expressly there."
2007.06-1322,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3217.849,3218.216,Ah.
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3251.939,3261.212,"Just as a point of clarification, Justice Breyer, the three requirements that I believe you just referred to are in 1626.6, which is the provision of the regulations labeled ""Form of Charges""."
2007.06-1322,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3267.016,3268.649,"No, I just want to read it somewhere."
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3268.649,3269.082,--Sure.
2007.06-1322,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3269.082,3276.405,"So that if I were not here having you in front of me, as many people don't have you in front of them, where I would go to read just what you said."
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3276.405,3281.792,"Four places, Justice Breyer: First of all, you could go to the final rule as it was promulgated in 1983."
2007.06-1322,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3316.632,3319.667,Is a complaint different from an intake questionnaire?
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3319.667,3320.984,"--In our view, yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1322,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3342.364,3349.02,Why should we defer to an agency regulation when people in the agency hardly ever follow it?
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3349.02,3353.405,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think it's not fair to say that people in the agency very rarely follow it."
2007.06-1322,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3354.505,3359.14,"Well, you didn't... in this case you didn't treat it as a charge, because you didn't give notice."
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3359.14,3363.611,"--It's true that in this case the document was not docketed as a charge, and that's true; we know that."
2007.06-1322,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3372.467,3373.783,But you said there were going to be four places.
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3374.917,3375.401,Yes.
2007.06-1322,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3375.401,3377.568,One is 48 Fed. Reg. 148?
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3377.568,3380.653,"48 Federal Register 138, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1322,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3380.653,3381.072,138.
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3381.922,3382.538,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3382.538,3383.804,Where is that in CFR?
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3383.804,3385.756,It is not codified in the CFR.
2007.06-1322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3385.756,3386.623,"Oh, okay."
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3386.623,3390.708,The second place it is in section 2.2 (b) of the compliance manual.
2007.06-1322,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3416.859,3421.746,Do we give Chevron deference to things like your internal compliance manual and these other memos?
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3421.746,3425.715,"--We certainly do not assert, Mr. Chief Justice, that the compliance manual gets Chevron deference."
2007.06-1322,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3442.243,3442.793,Under the--
2007.06-1322,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3442.793,3451.865,"Mr. Heytens, is it true that the Form 5 for somebody who's not represented by counsel is usually done by EEOC itself?"
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3452.815,3456.419,"In situations where the Form 5 is filled out in the office, Justice Ginsburg, yes, that's correct."
2007.06-1322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3465.023,3474.379,"Mr. Heytens, what's your solution for the situation where the EEOC treats it as a charge, but doesn't give notice, which is what has happened here?"
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3475.779,3478.664,"In situations where the employer does not receive notice, Justice Scalia?"
2007.06-1322,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3478.664,3479.297,That's right.
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3479.297,3488.888,"The first thing we think... at that point, Justice Scalia, I think that task is to try to recreate as well as possible the situation that should have existed, and the Commission agrees notice should have been given."
2007.06-1322,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3543.956,3545.225,"Well, that's on the notice point."
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3555.597,3556.783,The precise words manifest?
2007.06-1322,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3556.783,3557.249,No.
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3558.216,3558.699,"Well, then--"
2007.06-1322,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3558.699,3559.918,Therefore... I'm--
2007.06-1322,2,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3559.918,3568.322,"--Well, but I would say, Justice Breyer, the word intend is in fact in the 1983 final rule; it says where the person ""does not intend to file""... I apologize, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3584.633,3592.187,"Just to get one thing perfectly clear in my mind, does that mean if the intake questionnaire is checked not consent, that would not be a charge?"
