1973.72-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.63,"Mr. Todd, I think you may proceed whenever you’re ready."
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,6.63,10.544,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,176.971,183.845,"What was the situation between 1927, the date of its founding and 1942, was it the --"
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,183.845,184.379,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,184.379,186.795,-- the date of the letter?
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,186.795,192.946,We are sure they had tax exempt status from the founding but we have not been able to trace that out.
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,219.976,230.119,When did this practice of issuing letters such as these begin in the department that they're not authorize or re -- recognized by any statutes that I know of?
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,230.119,233.99,"They -- the exact time when it begun, I do not know."
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,241.04,241.488,Yes.
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,241.488,267.503,"And -- but when the advance letters or assurance of deductibility was instituted, I cannot say it has been a practice for many, many years certainly since 1942. And when an organization receives such a letter, it is entitled to be listed in the cumulative index of such organization."
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,267.503,270.693,"Now even before it receives such a letter, that’s just as you’ve suggested it."
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,290.139,293.969,I think that’s true and I think it did receive such treatment.
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,293.969,303.751,That is and the -- and that its benefactors also had their gifts deductible from their ordinary income for tax purposes prior to 1942.
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,303.751,305.646,"I think that’s true, yes sir."
1973.72-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,305.646,313.038,I take it you would agree that the practice of issuing the letter is beneficial to the recipients of these contributions.
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,313.038,314.094,No question about it.
1973.72-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,319.708,325.835,What it clears is the importance; I suppose is that it clears the air and removes any doubt from the part of donors.
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,325.835,327.486,That’s exactly (Voice Overlap)
1973.72-1470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,327.486,336.135,"I hope the donor will ask his lawyer, are they -- will this be deductible and it’s a very simple matter for the lawyer to find out now, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,336.135,361.653,"That’s very true and while the individual donors don’t perhaps check it too much, certainly foundations do because if they make one contribution to an unauthorized or non-exempt organization, there deductibility would be withdrawn or probably would be withdrawn so it’s a vital importance to the foundations and such organizations as that."
1973.72-1470,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,379.139,384.332,"It’s not your letter, it’s the listing of the letter in this list, am I right?"
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,384.332,384.977,That’s correct sir.
1973.72-1470,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,384.977,387.491,And you can get on the list without the letter?
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,387.491,388.057,"Oh, yes."
1973.72-1470,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,391.588,392.193,But its --
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,392.193,392.552,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1470,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,392.552,396.086,And its -- if you're on the list and that is of some benefit?
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,396.086,396.483,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.277,422.736,"This whole practice however is extracurricular, extra-statutory, is it not?"
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,422.736,424.456,"I think that’s correct, yes sir."
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.456,441.142,"And is a -- as far as the law goes, a donation is deductible from a donors of taxable income if the donee meets certain statutory requirements period, that drives us of any letters or any list."
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,441.142,442.783,"That’s correct, sir."
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,443.622,451.721,"Now, what if there’d been no letter in this case, would you be entitled to go into a court and ask for an injunction, if you have a letter issued to you?"
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,451.721,453.054,If there had been no letter.
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,459.093,459.685,Why not?
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,462.757,463.005,Well --
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.005,473.363,"You say, being on the list is the essential qualification for you to maintain a viable existence as Bob Jones University."
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,473.363,474.382,That’s correct.
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,481.908,482.269,Alright.
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,507.863,508.08,Well --
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,508.08,512.77,"Because if not you'd be in the same shape you are now, you wouldn’t be on the list."
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,512.77,524.183,"If we ask for a mandatory injunction, the defense of sovereign immunity might apply which it doesn’t in this case because we ask for no affirmative relief against any Office of the United States."
1973.72-1470,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,540.757,548.858,"Mr. Todd, as a matter of curiosity, does Bob Jones University still have its exempt status, has its ruling ever been withdrawn?"
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,548.858,549.154,"No, sir."
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,550.599,552.807,Despite the lower courts order?
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,552.807,553.732,"That’s right, sir."
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,566.275,568.657,Not because it’s a stay outstanding or just hasn’t?
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,568.657,569.066,No sir.
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,574.936,579.891,"But the service simply hasn’t withdrawn your exemption, is that it?"
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,579.891,581.017,I think that’s right.
1973.72-1470,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,582.136,591.17,"Now, do you think your status is in jeopardy in the interim so that donors are not assured of their deductions?"
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,591.17,614.002,"Well, our deductions, our contributions, it fallen off some, I would not say that they have dried up but as long as we have that assurance of the advance assurance as they have not dried up and we have not suffered the irreparable harm that we would have suffered had not the District Court originally granted the injunction."
1973.72-1470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,614.002,618.541,Does the advance assurance a regulation by the Commissioner?
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,618.541,621.198,It’s a practice by the Commissioner.
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,626.764,634.322,"So you're certainly in this good position as you would be if there had been no -- never had been in that letter, aren't you?"
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,638.529,640.873,"We are on the so-called list, yes sir."
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.785,645.721,"No, apparently not."
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,674.758,675.917,"That’s correct sir, it is."
1973.72-1470,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,675.917,684.464,And the -- so that the -- any people who were thinking about giving money to you know they're going to have a fight on their hands.
1973.72-1470,0,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,684.464,692.778,"That -- that’s correct and while as I say, as I've said a few minutes ago, the individual donors, of small individual donors, I don’t think that would make a lot of difference."
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1663.822,1665.997,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.997,1669.609,"Is there any real -- any real difference in the issues on these two cases, Mr. Crampton?"
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1669.609,1684.405,"No, I think that the fundamental procedure issue is the same and I think that the -- this case perhaps even -- more strongly emphasizes the need for the application of the injunction --"
1973.72-1470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.405,1686.652,"This involves (c) (4), 501 (c) (3)?"
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1686.652,1689.093,"No, (c) (4) is not in this case."
1973.72-1470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1689.238,1690.803,Or in the other one either?
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1690.803,1691.516,"Oh, yes."
1973.72-1470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.743,1700.175,I see.
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1700.175,1704.482,And the questions whether to exempt under 501 (c) (3) --
1973.72-1470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.482,1711.811,"Well, both have grants so their -- the exemption on those -- these organizations isn’t exempt under either your claim is."
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1711.811,1723.516,"That’s our position, that’s the position the Commissioner probably would take, I say it, there were certain administrative seps -- steps that were still to be explored but the injunction stopped all that."
1973.72-1470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.516,1724.58,Yes.
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1724.58,1725.845,But a --
1973.72-1470,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1725.845,1731.688,"But was this institution, the Commissioner would probably hold was itself taxable --"
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1731.688,1732.131,That’s right.
1973.72-1470,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1732.131,1735.491,"-- on its own, that income, unlike the previous case?"
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1735.491,1736.374,Right.
1973.72-1470,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1801.671,1802.813,Mr. Crampton?
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1802.813,1804.465,Yes.
1973.72-1470,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1804.465,1808.504,"When did this letter business start, do you know?"
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1808.504,1809.334,[Laughter] I’m not sure either.
1973.72-1470,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1809.334,1810.021,(Voice Overlap)
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1810.021,1811.986,"(Voice Overlap) We’re looking at it on the -- you first asked this question, there --"
1973.72-1470,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1811.986,1813.355,Did you find that?
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1813.355,1830.185,"No, I didn’t find it but I did find that there is a -- we have cited in the briefs and a historical review of this ruling process, its in one of the New York University Institute, tax institutes and an article that was prepared by former Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Mortimer Caplin."
1973.72-1470,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1830.185,1830.724,Right.
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1830.724,1833.555,"And I don’t have that with me, but I think that will answer that."
1973.72-1470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1838.639,1843.773,Do you still have the one year waiting period for a new non-profit corporation?
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1843.773,1847.006,I thought -- I believe that was changed by a statute awhile back.
1973.72-1470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.368,1859.732,This is true but you still don’t go on the list for a year as I recall.
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1861.518,1862.325,That used to be the case.
1973.72-1470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.381,1917.393,"That’s why it hasn’t in fact been withdrawn, is that it?"
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1917.393,1918.172,That’s right.
1973.72-1470,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1932.112,1934.39,"Excuse me, I didn’t mean to interrupt."
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1934.39,1935.336,I’m through.
1973.72-1470,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1935.336,1942.854,"You say, as the Commissioner attempt to do anything, he would be -- run the risk of being in contempt of court, you know that’s a little bit broad."
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1942.854,1946.242,"Well, I mean anything in the contrary to the injunction order."
1973.72-1470,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1946.242,1947.631,"Well, what is the injunction?"
1973.72-1470,1,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1963.471,1973.138,"Oh, not for our previous year because they’d been on the list and under that list, any donor could look to that list and that’s his license so to speak to make a contribution."
1973.72-1470,2,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,2246.39,2258.386,"I don’t believe there's any question but what the IRS can apply the laws of deductibility retroactively, they don’t have to do it but I believe they have the authority to do it."
1973.72-1470,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2270.098,2271.827,Certainly.
1973.72-1470,2,33268,j_d_todd_jr,,2271.827,2282.206,"-- field that even if Williams Packing is the law, even if it applies to exempt organizations that we come within Williams Packing."
