1956.370,0,40927,stephen_ailes,,29.401,30.247,"Yes, sir, it is."
1956.370,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,30.247,39.67,"Mr. Ailes, you may proceed."
1956.370,0,40927,stephen_ailes,,39.67,42.798,May it please the Court.
1956.370,1,36363,milford_j_meyer,,1620.588,1622.882,May it please the Court.
1956.370,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1829.981,1834.2,But isn't the construction of the proviso before it?
1956.370,1,36363,milford_j_meyer,,1834.2,1839.611,"The construction of the proviso was the only question below, yes, sir."
1956.370,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1839.611,1844.673,Doesn't that raise a proper size of a question or a real question of statutory questions?
1956.370,1,36363,milford_j_meyer,,1844.673,1851.044,"I think not, sir, because there -- there has never been any question about it in this Court."
1956.370,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1851.743,1852.627,That's a different thing.
1956.370,1,36363,milford_j_meyer,,1855.74,1862.391,"Yes, sir, and -- and it was represented in the petition for certiorari that there was a conflict."
1956.370,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1862.391,1862.734,Well I --
1956.370,1,36363,milford_j_meyer,,1862.734,1863.006,And I -- I --
1956.370,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1863.006,1864.728,-- (Voice Overlap) seems to think so too.
1956.370,1,36363,milford_j_meyer,,1864.728,1877.784,"I -- I firmly believe that -- that Your Honors felt upon reading the petition that there might have been some conflict, but I think as Your Honors review the case, you'll find that there is absolutely no conflict."
1956.370,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1877.784,1883.334,But that -- that's on -- you're now passing judgment on the merits --
1956.370,1,36363,milford_j_meyer,,1883.334,1883.606,Of the --
1956.370,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1883.606,1891.316,-- rather than suggesting that it was a frivolous question which the summary isn't rather appeared to be serious.
1956.370,1,36363,milford_j_meyer,,1891.316,1893.578,"I -- I don't think so, sir."
1956.370,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1964.762,1971.05,What is the narrower question?Can you tell us that on Monday?
