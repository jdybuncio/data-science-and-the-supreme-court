2004.04-6432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.781,We'll hear argument now in Aurelio Gonzalez v. James Crosby.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,35.72,38.764,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-6432,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,143.153,148.352,At that point when the court makes that examination under your rule and it comes to point six--
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,148.352,149.137,Yes.
2004.04-6432,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,149.137,153.26,--does it refer at any point or in any circumstance to AEDPA?
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,153.26,159.35,It does not but... but point six has been cabined by jurisprudence.
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.769,223.355,"Well, if we were to make clear that 60(b) is widely available, even category six, don't you think... and as a result the AEDPA restrictions don't apply, don't you think that number would increase rather dramatically?"
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,223.355,224.258,I do not.
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.064,261.034,"Well, there's no language in category six referring to extraordinary circumstances, any other reason justifying relief."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,261.034,266.865,--The Court in the Ackermann decision... there were two early decisions construing 60(b).
2004.04-6432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,282.245,283.736,But it's still very vague.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,283.736,285.442,It is but it isn't.
2004.04-6432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,298.716,308.064,"All that is true, but I think that the court below and the other parties say... almost everybody is on your side."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,361.915,362.644,"--Well, I would--"
2004.04-6432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,362.644,363.669,--about how best to do that?
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,363.669,367.732,--I would prefer to rely upon the Court's principles in this regard.
2004.04-6432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,367.732,368.539,"No, but that's--"
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,368.539,371.734,Rhines... Rhines v. Weber is of good help here.
2004.04-6432,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,421.294,421.827,It's pretty flabby.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,421.827,422.431,--one procedurally defaulted.
2004.04-6432,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,422.431,423.137,It's pretty flabby.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,426.619,429.854,"Well, it is... it is the terminology used in Rhines."
2004.04-6432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,447.755,462.524,"But this is going to be taken up by some 800 district judges and a couple hundred appellate judges, and they're the ones who have the final say in most of these cases just because we decide so few."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,462.524,465.178,And I think that's why this test works.
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,467.267,470.58,"Well, aren't we dealing here with a time bar issue?"
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,470.58,471.986,We are.
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.986,482.261,"I mean, there... there was not a determination below, but an extraordinary amount of time expired before the application was made."
2004.04-6432,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,495.299,496.157,I was going to ask the same question.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,502.346,506.212,It really isn't as pedestrian as it may have seemed.
2004.04-6432,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,531.94,537.325,Why... why did Florida deny relief in... in the post-conviction?
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,546.129,548.763,"Well, it wasn't a 2-year statute of limitations, Your Honor."
2004.04-6432,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.986,614.653,"Are you saying that counsel... what... what he alleges counsel told him was, in fact, accurate at the time counsel said it, that somebody who got a 99-year sentence wouldn't have to serve more than 13 years?"
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,614.653,624.437,"To be clear... and... and I want to be clear about his allegation is... because he does not speak English... that the interpreter told him this, and this was not during a plea colloquy."
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.993,637.505,But has that been determined--
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,637.505,638.21,No.
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,638.21,638.83,--by some court?
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,640.186,640.653,Correct.
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,640.653,641.29,--pure and simple--
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,641.29,641.824,Correct.
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,641.824,642.608,--yet to be determined.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,642.608,643.823,And it's never been.
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,643.823,656.369,"And so we have to know how the time bar element folds in here, and in an ordinary civil case, a time bar would be an adjudication on the merits."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,665.458,668.683,It is because that's the way the Court has treated it.
2004.04-6432,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,670.359,672.894,But you're... you're saying it is extraordinary.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,672.894,675.513,--In a different sense I'm saying it.
2004.04-6432,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,711.918,712.074,Okay.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,783.165,783.997,That's right.
2004.04-6432,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,783.997,797.685,"And finally, you have an extraordinary situation here because you have a later determination in Artuz which declared the law not as a change in the law, but as what the law presumably meant from day one."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,802.644,803.306,"Yes, sir."
2004.04-6432,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,803.306,804.695,Then why don't you make that argument?
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,804.695,814.929,"I do make that argument, and to the extent... and... and I make that argument, but that argument was rejected in the court below which addressed it with a completely different approach."
2004.04-6432,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,819.932,822.675,Can you go back to the district court before the Eleventh Circuit?
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,834.866,835.294,Correct.
2004.04-6432,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,835.294,845.62,"In the Federal court, what is the ground on which relief was denied and how would Artuz affect that decision?"
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,845.62,859.167,"In the Federal court, the district judge said that the tolling provision would not apply here because it was the district court's determination that it was untimely when filed in the State court."
2004.04-6432,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,861.886,866.318,"No, but your... your immediate concern is how do I get into a Federal court."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,902.603,903.875,And it is not clear.
2004.04-6432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,932.913,935.906,--You... you had a question.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,939.751,940.266,Yes.
2004.04-6432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,940.266,941.836,And the first was good cause.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,945.938,948.555,No indication of dilatory tactics by the plaintiff.
2004.04-6432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,948.555,948.979,Thank you.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,948.979,961.404,"And this is very helpful I think because it gives those three rules, which the Court has given us in Rhines, helped us and helped the district court to sort out the things that shouldn't be stopping or reopening proceedings."
2004.04-6432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.404,964.334,May... may I ask you a question that may be a little bit collateral?
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,974.131,978.607,"Well, I actually argued and I do believe that it shouldn't require a COA."
2004.04-6432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.702,1052.837,"Well, we're not talking about ordinary appellate review."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1059.38,1059.855,--Correct.
2004.04-6432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.855,1063.462,So that wasn't quite as strange as you make it sound.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1063.462,1066.805,"It is for this reason, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.04-6432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.258,1113.37,"Well, but maybe that's what Congress wanted."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1113.37,1116.108,I don't think Congress did intend that.
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1116.936,1119.895,But why isn't that always the case if it's time-barred?
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1119.895,1124.089,--If it is time--
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1124.089,1128.298,"If it's time-barred, you never have your chance to have the merits argued."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1128.298,1136.527,"--Well, that's one of the ways in which a case could be dismissed procedurally, but it's not time-barred if the court rules it was erroneously."
2004.04-6432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1140.216,1143.337,Do we bring this all to a halt?
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1150.484,1160.791,One of the nice things about rule 60(b) is it really is a disciplined approach to a court examining its own mistakes.
2004.04-6432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1232.983,1238.886,"Well, now, the Federal Government has a different proposed rule than yours."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1242.248,1243.195,I will.
2004.04-6432,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1328.118,1338.282,What about the... you... you said 60(b) fits this like a glove because it's the district court correcting its own errors.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1367.569,1382.361,"I think it's very important to realize that both rule 81 of the Federal Rules of Federal Procedure and rule 11 of the rules of habeas procedure, which the State would have us use as a constraint, really are the first things that tell us that there's supposed to be a functional approach."
2004.04-6432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1391.656,1395.736,"But the... the Government, by the way, seems a broader rule than yours."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1409.86,1414.637,New legal... this is the part that I think we have to look both at 60(b) and the statute.
2004.04-6432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1426.587,1426.733,That's what I said.
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1431.001,1432.814,"Well, I think that they're--"
2004.04-6432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1432.814,1440.516,"I mean, it's even... but I want to know why... why... there's some reason you don't like the Government, and... and... other than fact that they must hurt you in some way."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1441.954,1444.234,"--Well, I don't think it does, but they do."
2004.04-6432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1447.187,1447.639,--make us--
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1447.639,1450.79,"They make an argument that under their test, my client should not prevail."
2004.04-6432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1453.452,1457.697,"--And under their test too, you say it's applying the same rule of... it's not a new claim."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1463.343,1474.285,I think the heart of the Government's position is it requires a much more radical departure from general procedure than a simple change of law.
2004.04-6432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1539.766,1541.269,"Very well, Mr. Rashkind."
2004.04-6432,0,38251,paul_m_rashkind,,1541.269,1541.501,Thank you.
2004.04-6432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1541.501,1543.412,"Mr. Kise, we'll hear from you."
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1543.412,1552.701,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1586.369,1589.686,Isn't that an exaggeration of how 60(b) works in practice?
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1607.256,1611.595,"Well, respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, I... I would disagree with that in this sense."
2004.04-6432,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.089,1626.291,"But have we seen it in the... there are other circuits who do adopt that rule, aren't there?"
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1627.822,1636.429,"--We have not yet, but I would submit to Your Honor that that is because there is still this uncertainty because this case is here before this Court, and... and because this has not yet been approved."
2004.04-6432,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1643.533,1644.548,"Well, that depends--"
2004.04-6432,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1644.548,1647.247,"Well, I had the same comment or the same reaction as Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1661.796,1667.051,"--Well, in... in the ordinary civil context, that's perhaps correct, Your Honor, but... but this isn't the ordinary civil context."
2004.04-6432,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1692.825,1693.331,--Okay.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1731.899,1743.221,"--Well, Your Honor, again, there... there has to be some finality to the process, and... and here what the petitioner got was at the time a perceptively correct view of the law."
2004.04-6432,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1743.221,1747.029,He got what Artuz said was an erroneous view of the statute of limitations.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1747.029,1751.307,2 years after the district judge made his ruling in this particular case.
2004.04-6432,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1757.831,1773.895,"And do you... do you think that there is... that there is this... this sort of tidal wave of... of erroneous statute of limitations determinations that, if Artuz is applied, will suddenly be coming 5, 10, and 20 years into Federal court?"
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1780.577,1791.144,"--Well, Your Honor, it's not exaggerated when you look at it from the standpoint that... that Congress intended us to be in court one time to defend this judgment in Federal court."
2004.04-6432,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1793.217,1796.179,You... you were there for the purpose of getting him booted out.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1798.52,1805.1,"--Well, he received a... a final disposition on the non-technical procedural basis which was the applicable law at the time."
2004.04-6432,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1807.409,1809.286,"Well, it was not the applicable law at the time."
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1811.822,1817.698,"--Well, Your Honor, then that would, respectfully, eviscerate any... any notion of... of the statute of limitations--"
2004.04-6432,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1817.698,1817.875,No.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1825.678,1828.842,"--But based on that, Your Honor, then there would be no statute of limitations."
2004.04-6432,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1838.636,1844.852,If there had been an Artuz violation and not every statute of limitations determination implicates Artuz.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1844.852,1845.806,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-6432,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1870.471,1874.704,"Well, what... what Congress was principally concerned with... Congress was concerned with two things."
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1913.268,1920.199,--But I would... I would respectfully disagree with Your Honor's premise that... that he... he's not seeking to revisit an adjudicated petition.
2004.04-6432,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1922.942,1923.126,Sure.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1925.825,1933.808,"--And we would submit that it is second and successive because it's seeking to revisit that adjudication, an adjudication that was had on a non technical procedural basis."
2004.04-6432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1933.808,1934.388,So that's the--
2004.04-6432,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1934.388,1936.767,"You may... you may be right, but that's what district courts are there for."
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1936.767,1940.569,But... but the Congress intended to take that discretion away from the district courts.
2004.04-6432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1967.484,1968.934,--That's also true of (b)(3).
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1968.934,1970.103,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
2004.04-6432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1970.103,1972.841,And not even the Eleventh Circuit said (b)(3).
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1983.874,1991.084,"--Well, I... I think we're talking about which 60(b)(3) motions... or 60(b) motions do escape the strictures of AEDPA."
2004.04-6432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1991.084,1993.869,And you're prepared to defend the... the Eleventh Circuit.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,1993.869,1995.365,"I... I am, Your Honor."
2004.04-6432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1995.365,2000.189,"Correct, though you're alone on that because even the Government doesn't and nor does the Criminal Justice."
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2017.508,2026.322,"Well, I would... I would say why fraud... to answer your question, Your Honor, why fraud... let me back up first to the premise that... that our position and the Government's position are not far apart."
2004.04-6432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2033.155,2037.0,"Well, under I guess the Government, you can bring everything under 60(b)."
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2071.091,2072.286,--Perhaps I--
2004.04-6432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2072.286,2072.779,You explain.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2076.953,2082.703,"--Well, and I don't want to pretend to speak for the United States because... because that... that might cause me to misspeak."
2004.04-6432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2109.498,2112.509,--So is that also true if his own witness has committed the fraud?
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2112.509,2121.372,"Well, I... I would... our fraud exception that... that we... we are delineating here is material, intentional conduct that subverts the process."
2004.04-6432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2122.635,2122.901,Yes.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2122.901,2138.134,"It needs to be someone in a position to subvert the process for... for a purpose like the Government or the court if you... if... a judge that's been bribed in the unusual example of that, or... or the... the subornation of perjury in the Hazel sense."
2004.04-6432,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2143.274,2149.583,"What about a claim that a witness perjured himself, a witness for the government, during trial?"
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2149.583,2159.266,"--Well, a witness for... a... a claim that a witness for the government perjured himself during the trial would certainly implicate material, intentional conduct designed to subvert the process."
2004.04-6432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2172.276,2182.592,"And all I'm saying is exactly whatever criteria is met, but it happens to be his own witness, and sometimes your own witnesses do have their little games, you know, with prisoners, and so it's the same thing."
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2182.592,2183.139,--Well--
2004.04-6432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2183.139,2184.015,Does that not count too?
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2184.015,2190.105,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that would leave so much room for mischief, it would not be possible to contain the potential for... for appeals."
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2212.19,2215.549,"Mr. Kise, this may be important."
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2230.775,2231.719,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2246.861,2247.168,--But it's not... not clear from--
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2247.168,2249.146,"--to the end result here, but... but that... that's our position."
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2249.146,2259.595,--That's not what the... this is... the... the form of dismissal in the Florida Supreme Court doesn't tell us that.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2268.972,2279.305,"Your Honor may be referring to the second 3.850 dismissal, and that second 3.850 didn't meet the requirements of the successive rule."
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2281.428,2283.359,The first one was on the statute of limitations?
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2283.359,2293.007,"--Yes, Your Honor, and then the second one was also on the statute of limitations in addition to the fact that it did not meet the requirements of... of the successive rule because it was essentially the same claim raised again."
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2295.347,2305.96,"Do we have that anyplace in... in the papers before us, the first... the first dismissal in the Florida... in the Florida trial court?"
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2305.96,2308.998,"I'm not sure exactly where it is in the appendix, Your Honor."
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2315.523,2316.391,But you said--
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2316.391,2319.819,"It is... it is in the Eleventh Circuit opinion, I believe, Your Honor."
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2319.819,2323.343,--that it was based on the Florida 2-year statute of limitations.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2323.343,2325.449,Yes.
2004.04-6432,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.933,2401.37,But is it correct that they address the same subject matter?
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2409.075,2418.268,"--Well, I... I would respectfully disagree with Your Honor because 2244(b)(1) does deal with the... the revisiting of the Federal habeas petition."
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2535.537,2540.245,Didn't Congress rule... rule out 60(b) in... in death cases?
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2540.245,2543.032,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2544.823,2545.469,"Yes, yes."
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2545.469,2546.167,--in... in capital cases.
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2546.167,2546.525,Yes.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2546.525,2548.829,I don't know... under the statute?
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2548.829,2550.559,Yes.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2552.063,2553.016,I'm not certain.
2004.04-6432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2559.888,2563.572,--I thought there was a special provision for capital cases.
2004.04-6432,1,19379,christopher_m_kise,,2563.572,2566.075,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2004.04-6432,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2707.503,2708.493,"Thank you, Mr. Kise."
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2710.129,2718.725,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-6432,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2725.773,2728.258,"On page 24, I read the or wrong."
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2728.258,2728.858,Okay.
2004.04-6432,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2728.858,2731.162,It's... you meant the things on both sides of the or.
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2731.162,2732.04,It's very--
2004.04-6432,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2732.04,2734.824,"And I was thinking the first side you'd allow, the second side you wouldn't."
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2740.067,2740.642,--All right.
2004.04-6432,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2741.209,2741.783,My question would be why.
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2741.783,2742.238,--Yes.
2004.04-6432,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2766.653,2767.597,Would you say that again?
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2767.597,2780.292,--A rule 60(b) motion that seeks to set aside a final judgment denying Federal habeas relief on the grounds that it was incorrectly decided is a second or successive petition under AEDPA.
2004.04-6432,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.257,2793.646,Is that a statement of when it's not available?
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2797.101,2797.48,--It--
2004.04-6432,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2797.48,2800.968,It is not available in the circumstance you described.
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2801.392,2801.735,--That's right.
2004.04-6432,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2802.357,2804.075,"Now, would you state... tell us when it is available?"
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2804.075,2804.603,--Okay.
2004.04-6432,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2871.252,2874.14,"But now you're into... I mean, you can use a tone of voice."
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2904.929,2915.103,"I am saying a lot more than that, and that is, first of all, because the vast majority of things that are covered by 60(b) do not qualify as tantamount to fraud or a biased judge."
2004.04-6432,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2931.291,2933.188,Where... where do you disagree with Judge Carnes?
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2933.188,2934.365,With Judge?
2004.04-6432,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2934.365,2937.92,With... with the majority of... in... in the Eleventh Circuit.
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2937.92,2964.829,"If that opinion is read... and I think fairly it has to be... as saying only fraud and not errors of similar magnitude like a biased judge or some other complete breakdown so that our system doesn't recognize that to be a judgment... it's not what Congress thought it was giving you... then that would be... I can't tell you there's cases where this happens, but that... but the... the rationale for including fraud would exclude... include some other similar errors of magnitude."
2004.04-6432,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2965.525,2969.648,"Now, how do you apply it in this case, the Artuz problem?"
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2969.648,2979.261,"--In... in this case, the Artuz problem is only an argument, and I... we're not even accepting that it's accurate, but only an argument that the court made a mistake of law."
2004.04-6432,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2998.798,3005.952,"Well, suppose Artuz had been decided and it was in the mail and the judge forgot to open his advance sheets that day."
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3016.088,3018.581,--If he does it within 10 days under rule--
2004.04-6432,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3018.581,3019.839,"Well, it's 10 days and a half."
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3019.839,3020.396,--10--
2004.04-6432,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3028.127,3030.032,And the reason that it's happened is because all the lawyers were hit by four trolleys.
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3057.928,3061.888,"Justice Breyer, the problem is... and... and Justice Souter, you referenced this."
2004.04-6432,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3094.915,3095.652,"Well, maybe--"
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3095.652,3096.535,And the... and the--
2004.04-6432,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3096.535,3105.29,"--maybe the district court shouldn't have done that, but whatever... whatever was wrong there, it was merely a classic application of... of review of a statute of limitations point."
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3161.207,3162.942,"--Justice Souter, there's two answers to that."
2004.04-6432,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3260.584,3272.559,Did the Federal court make a mistake of... of law if the... if the Florida court dismissed under the Florida 2-year statute of limitations?
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3272.559,3276.292,Did... did the Florida make a mistake of what--
2004.04-6432,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3276.292,3276.988,"No, no."
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3279.868,3280.089,--No.
2004.04-6432,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3287.702,3288.675,"--It's sub judice, before us now."
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3288.675,3288.911,--Right.
2004.04-6432,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3288.911,3299.631,"But do you agree with Mr. Kise that the first dismissal in the Florida court, the first denial was on the Florida 2-year statute of limitations?"
2004.04-6432,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3299.631,3307.463,"My... the order from the court, my understanding, simply denied it on the grounds of legal insufficiency, and it didn't give a further explanation."
2004.04-6432,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3314.124,3314.674,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
