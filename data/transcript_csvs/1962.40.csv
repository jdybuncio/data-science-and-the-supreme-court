1962.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,52.292,54.124,Your motion is granted.
1962.40,0,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,54.124,60.166,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1962.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,60.166,67.977,Mr. Starrett.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,67.977,70.593,May it please the Court.
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,301.752,302.47,Mr. Starrett.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,302.47,302.49,Yes sir.
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,302.49,326.462,"Because these facts are rather involved as well as the statutes, I wonder if it wouldn't be well for you, if it wouldn't disturb your argument to state the facts of the case to us; the relationship of these two companies, the facts upon which the -- examine what the Commission acted."
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,330.818,335.926,Very well.
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,349.342,350.074,I beg your pardon.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,350.074,359.013,We had always thought that the findings of facts in the case by the Commission sustained the substantial evidence for the basic factual reference.
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,386.818,400.586,"Well, are you going to state the facts, not just the other findings but are you going to state the facts, the relationship between the companies and how they were constituted and so forth?"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,400.586,401.502,Yes sir.
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,402.957,406.677,Yes.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,406.677,428.125,"The Nelson Company, L. Nelson & Sons Transportation Company originated first as a partnership of a woman, Mrs. Linnea Nelson and two of her sons and was later incorporated, other sons and members of the family came into the business."
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,515.778,519.515,Brothers and sister?
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,519.515,532.417,With -- there were -- Charles Chilberg is a half brother of the -- of these two.
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,652.849,655.645,Did you challenge the finding?
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,655.645,658.198,"We do not challenge the finding, Mr. Chief Justice."
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,754.952,757.524,"Mr. Starrett, tell me, am I right --"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,757.524,757.943,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,757.943,777.601,"-- that the only thing we have is whether the three-judge court should properly have dismissed the complaint which is I get to challenged only the order of June 9, 1959 which ordered Nelson to invest himself of the stock interest in Gilbertville?"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,777.601,784.419,"The complaint attacked a number of orders, Mr. Justice, although at the District --"
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,784.419,794.773,"One -- one two and three but didn't order three, didn't order three merely have the effect of reinstating after an interim stage and so forth?"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,802.867,807.543,"The order of divestiture is one of the factors, Mr. Justice."
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,807.543,808.419,Yes.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,808.419,815.143,The order of June 9 which I read is the only relevant order as far as substance is concerned.
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,842.095,844.312,And Gilb -- was that Gilbertville -- yes.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,844.312,846.951,That Kenneth Nelson sold the stock at Gilbertville Company.
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,846.951,850.638,"Now, what is it that you want from us?"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,850.638,857.571,"We want, may it please the Court, a reversal of the District Court's judgment."
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,866.596,869.739,"That is the divestiture, it's in error on the divestiture."
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,871.801,873.272,Denial of the application.
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,873.272,876.71,And it's in error in finding use of violation of 5 (4).
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,876.71,878.593,"That's right, Mr. Justice."
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,878.593,881.173,"Now, what's -- is there a fourth thing now?"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,881.173,881.689,No.
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,881.689,882.954,Just those three.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,882.954,888.421,The violation of 5 (4) and that the violation was continuing which are really very close.
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,888.421,891.805,"Now, I get it."
1962.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,891.805,907.123,"Do you also contend that even assuming that violation of 5 (4), the Commission gave that absolute effect in denying the application and that that also was there."
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,907.123,907.974,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1962.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,917.383,920.561,Has found to be the product of the now (Inaudible) and innocence --
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,920.561,921.234,Yes.
1962.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,921.234,922.383,-- usefulness and so on.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,922.383,925.599,Then the denial of the merger application was error.
1962.40,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1306.023,1323.938,Are you saying that the findings of the Commission that the Commission did make are not supported by the evidence or are you saying that the findings that were not made that were essential typically made in accordance to it?
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1323.938,1329.773,"Mr. Justice, that's -- this was a narrative statement of facts, if I may answer it this way."
1962.40,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1334.465,1337.104,What is your legal point that sets out the idea?
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1337.104,1349.677,My legal are point phrased in terms of a question presented is that the findings of the Commission were not supported by substantial evidence in these specific respects.
1962.40,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1349.677,1355.489,The security question upon reading the evidence as though there was substantial evidence to support it.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1355.489,1356.536,On this one --
1962.40,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1356.536,1357.271,On this phase.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1357.271,1364.299,"This one phase, yes Mr. Justice."
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1428.787,1435.759,"Now, all of these, I gather, addressed to the 5 -- violation of 5 (4), is it?"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1435.759,1436.201,"Yes, it is, Mr. Justice."
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1436.201,1438.379,That you've been talking about so far.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1438.379,1445.87,"Yes, but it is relevant, I would submit, to the other factors and that they all tend to pyramid."
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1445.87,1457.459,"I agree but are you now addressing yourself directly to the finding of a violation of 5 (4) on your argument that was not sufficient evidence to sustain that finding of violation, is that it?"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1457.459,1457.964,"Yes, I am."
1962.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1457.964,1461.284,That's what I thought.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1461.284,1470.103,There are comments that the companies were leveling on settlement with each other but they're not based on any complete accounting of the companies.
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1598.645,1603.269,"He did find specifically, did he, that there was a violation of 5 (4)?"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1603.269,1611.553,"He found specifically that there was, on all the facts, a borderline violation of Section 5 (4)."
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1611.553,1613.47,"It was a violation, he said."
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1613.47,1620.081,"Yes, this was his finding, a borderline violation at some time which can't be determined."
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1661.633,1665.148,Where is his finding of the violation?
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1665.148,1666.462,His finding of the violation?
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1666.462,1671.979,Yes.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1671.979,1709.071,"Record 64, I believe it starts -- well, the discussion starts earlier then in the second paragraph beginning on record 64."
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1816.887,1829.14,"Before you get to that, did I understand you to say that the examiner found that Nelson was Kenneth's only client --"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1829.14,1830.817,The --
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1830.817,1834.979,-- or did you say that it did not find that he was the only --?
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1834.979,1839.968,"I said, Mr. Chief Justice, that there's no evidence that it was his only client."
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1853.474,1858.431,Or the examiner.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,1871.636,1873.344,"He does say it, yes."
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2224.067,2234.002,"We'll recess now, Mr. Starrett."
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2234.002,2234.729,If the Court please.
1962.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2324.703,2329.041,"Now Mr. Starrett, did the Commission do what you claim it did in this respect?"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2332.784,2335.699,I'm aware of that Mr. Justice.
1962.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2341.909,2342.247,I find that to.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2342.247,2354.992,I'd refer the Court to page 23 -- 22 and 23 of the record which is the relevant language of the Commission.
1962.40,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2489.579,2491.366,What were the principles involved?
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2491.366,2498.431,This is the one where the principles -- that as a principle stockholders of Nelson acquired the Byrnes routes.
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2498.431,2507.892,"Mr. Starrett, assuming that (Inaudible) that there was a violation of 5 (4)."
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2507.892,2509.869,Yes sir.
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2509.869,2523.089,(Inaudible)
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2523.089,2527.489,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not sure that a sanction is necessarily required as such."
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2527.489,2529.922,It's not required but is permissible.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2529.922,2531.01,"Is permissible, yes."
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2531.01,2531.725,An order.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2531.725,2536.798,"An order to terminate the violation, assuming that the merger authority were not granted."
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2547.077,2578.012,"You say there is no industrial transactions, no (Inaudible)"
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2578.012,2590.011,"If the Court please, there's never been a rule of law that relatives can't own -- there's never been a rule of law and I don't understand that there is now that relatives can't own trucking companies."
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2590.011,2593.096,(Inaudible)
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2593.096,2593.731,Very well.
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2593.731,2600.475,I say you have to (Inaudible) the fact of that law violation --
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2600.475,2600.705,I agree.
1962.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2600.705,2608.325,-- or assume this Court does agree that there is a violation.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2616.283,2634.661,"The Commission certainly has power in an appropriate case to order as far as divestiture, but what it has power to order is such action as is necessary to prevent continuance of the violation."
1962.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.656,2680.848,(Inaudible)
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2680.848,2682.471,"We do, Mr. Justice."
1962.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.471,2697.912,And (Inaudible)
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2697.912,2698.723,Yes.
1962.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.303,2723.103,Do you think the (Inaudible)
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2723.103,2725.71,In it of itself regardless of willfulness?
1962.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2725.71,2726.697,Yes.
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2726.697,2727.583,No.
1962.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.353,2730.454,(Inaudible)
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2730.454,2736.438,"If it is willful, it certainly reflects on the fitness of the applicants and the appellants don't question it."
1962.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.438,2737.683,(Inaudible)
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2737.683,2740.541,-- which bears on the public interest indeed.
1962.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.716,2745.03,And there is no showing of any knowing of violation?
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2745.03,2749.859,There is no showing of a knowing violation of Section 5 (4) here.
1962.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.193,2783.348,(Inaudible)
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2783.348,2797.951,By the Commission was the conclusive presumption of Section 5 (5) and I'm using the Commission's language based on the definition of affiliation in Section 5 (4) -- Section 5 (6).
1962.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.111,2826.239,Assuming that they have both violated that (Inaudible)
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2826.239,2833.368,"It would be meaningful and particularly the contrary, we submit, is quite meaningful."

1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2843.158,2854.064,"On the -- well, on the merger, it is -- if it is not willful, it does not bear unfitness."
1962.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.017,2895.154,(Inaudible)
1962.40,1,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,2895.154,2897.084,There's no evidence that it was failing.
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,3198.269,3201.034,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.40,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3604.254,3610.226,"Mr. Kestenbaum, Gilbertville is a very small company, isn't it?"
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,3610.226,3611.22,They --
1962.40,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3611.22,3613.139,That motor carriers is still today.
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,3613.139,3618.107,"Well, Gilbertville certainly was very small company which began operating under this arrangement."
1962.40,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3629.187,3635.726,Can you tell us how many employees?
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,3635.726,3641.167,"At the time of the hearing, sir?"
1962.40,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3723.317,3740.076,Absent this evidence of operation to (Inaudible) the Government finds that the merger would be in the public interest.
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,3740.076,3748.642,"The examiner found that the merger would be consistent with the public interest then I think had not been in violation, it's fair to say that the merger would have been approved, yes sir."
1962.40,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3748.642,3755.488,"The violation, therefore, was the key aspect of this case with the same point that whether there's a public interest."
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,3755.488,3756.757,Yes sir.
1962.40,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3756.757,3765.468,"Now, the examiner found that the violation was unknowing and not very serious to paraphrase this remark."
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,3770.753,3782.639,"Well, the Commission -- the Commission's one reference on this point, sir, is the reference to the awareness that Nelson's -- principals of the two companies had the regulatory requirements of the law."
1962.40,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3844.556,3860.723,"What the examiner's findings to which I had reference appear on page 72 and the top page of 73 of the record and I wondered what, if anything, the Commission had to say as to those findings."
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,3860.723,3876.372,The Commission -- the Commission at page 23 of the record is quoting Division 4 and it states that it should be emphasized that Nelson and Gilbertville's principals are not new to transportation or to Section 5 proceedings.
1962.40,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3876.372,3877.538,"And where is it, page 23?"
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,3877.538,3883.722,Page 23 in the quotation from Division 4 about halfway down the page.
1962.40,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3883.722,3886.105,(Inaudible)
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,3886.105,3908.374,"Yes and Division 4 where I discuss this point at pages 92 and 93 of the record, go into that in somewhat greater detail, the experience of the parties in the trucking industry and their experience in the acting pursuant to the regulatory requirements of Section 5."
1962.40,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3949.427,3954.824,"Well, there's nothing -- there's nothing narrowly wrong in trying to enlarge your company, isn't it?"
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,3956.5,3958.738,"No, there certainly is not, sir."
1962.40,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4070.758,4077.772,"The Commission did have, however, putting aside those evidences that are acquired during the lawful control."
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4088.104,4109.912,"Well, other than the conclusory statement on page 23, the Commission cites the finding of Division 4 and that it says that it has carefully considered the evidence in the pleadings and it finds no basis to support a finding that the transaction for which authority is sought would be consistent with the public interest under all the circumstances."
1962.40,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4109.912,4117.133,It doesn't have to bring back where the Commission really found that there was a violation of law that ought not to be condoned?
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4117.133,4133.749,"It certainly involves that finding sir, but on the other hand, it's clear from the Commission's opinion in this case and in other cases which have dealt with these questions from the Central of Georgia case which the Commission cites here the leading authority on the point that a violation can be overridden."
1962.40,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4146.703,4158.354,"Is it your theory, therefore, that this finding that you just quoted was applied here by the Commission in public interest and regardless of the violation that was concerned?"
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4158.354,4159.34,Yes sir.
1962.40,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4159.34,4160.943,Do you believe that is this?
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4160.943,4161.724,Yes sir.
1962.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4249.732,4261.446,(Inaudible)
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4261.446,4262.218,"Well, I --"
1962.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4262.218,4263.303,Would you go that far?
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4263.303,4264.816,I would go that far.
1962.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4276.368,4281.497,(Inaudible)
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4281.497,4282.534,"That's right, sir."
1962.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4282.534,4290.648,(Inaudible)
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4290.648,4291.011,I'm sorry.
1962.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4292.775,4307.641,(Inaudible)
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4307.641,4309.722,"Alright, that's a difficult -- that's a difficult question to --"
1962.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4309.722,4314.466,(Inaudible)
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4314.466,4317.138,"Well, I'm sorry."
1962.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4346.19,4374.199,(Inaudible)
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4374.199,4375.365,"Well, Mr. Justice, I'm sorry."
1962.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4400.197,4406.23,"Well, (Inaudible) indicates that the application of merger was filed."
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4406.23,4407.606,Yes sir.
1962.40,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4407.606,4417.137,How can you say what the Commission would have done on a hypothetical instead of circumstances?
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4417.137,4423.795,"Well, that is why I was not trying to -- I was trying to avoid answering that question because I did not wish -- I did not wish to --"
1962.40,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4423.795,4430.281,I thought pretty freely the evidence though.
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4439.703,4440.593,"And that's correct sir, yes."
1962.40,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4440.593,4441.485,Isn't that right?
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4441.485,4443.268,Yes sir.
1962.40,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4443.419,4464.297,"Your position is that given the findings of the Commission that there has been a 5 (4) violation, the Commission could permissibly conclude that it was not in the public interest to permit a merger between two companies that had been under an illegal relationship, that's in this case, isn't it?"
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4464.297,4465.057,Yes sir.
1962.40,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4465.057,4466.519,"That's all there is, isn't it?"
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4466.519,4468.017,That's correct sir.
1962.40,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4502.297,4504.615,That's why -- why the Commission is before it.
1962.40,2,34671,lionel_kestenbaum,,4504.615,4505.287,Yes sir.
1962.40,3,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,6197.572,6199.407,If the Court please.
1962.40,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6574.716,6582.705,Are there any complaint filed under the statutes here before you went to court for the application for approval of the merger?
1962.40,3,35134,loyd_m_starrett,,6582.705,6585.213,"They were not, Mr. Justice."
1962.40,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6598.039,6612.661,Very well.
