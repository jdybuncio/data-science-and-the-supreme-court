1985.85-93,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.686,We will hear arguments first this morning in Bazemore against Friday.
1985.85-93,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,11.138,22.913,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to address in my argument this morning three of the issues raised in this case, but first I would like to articulate briefly our position with respect to each."
1985.85-93,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,724.192,747.214,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to address my comments first to the second issue in our petition, the statistical evidence problem, and I would like to begin by responding to the questions that Justice Rehnquist and Justice White asked of my colleague regarding the nature of the issue before the Court."
1985.85-93,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.552,805.065,There is still the question of what inference should be drawn from the facts.
1985.85-93,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,805.065,810.875,"--As I read the Court of Appeals' opinion, unless all measurable variables are included--"
1985.85-93,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,810.875,819.013,"Nevertheless, nevertheless, that is a question of what conclusion may be drawn from the facts that were before the Court."
1985.85-93,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,819.013,826.932,--But a rule of law that a certain inference is impermissible is a rule of law even though it concerns the drawing of inference.
1985.85-93,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,881.347,891.546,"Mr. Schnapper, why isn't this case really more to be judged in the light of Akins versus Postal Service, rather than McDonnell-Douglas, since all the proof was in?"
1985.85-93,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,899.606,908.539,"Well, it is our position that the District Court's view as to what a plaintiff had to do was wrong as a matter of law."
1985.85-93,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,957.536,960.533,"Well, his finding on that score may have been clearly erroneous."
1985.85-93,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,974.793,990.991,"Well, the burden set out in McDonnell-Douglas, when a defendant comes forth and tries to rebut statistical evidence, is that it has to offer evidence which it believed would constitute a non-racial explanation."
1985.85-93,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,995.317,996.956,"Let me ask you again, Mr. Schnapper."
1985.85-93,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1014.09,1022.649,"--Well, we don't think that what the defendant did in this case met the minimal standards that McDonnell-Douglas sets."
1985.85-93,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1023.492,1027.648,"The ultimate issue is whether or not there was discrimination, isn't it?"
1985.85-93,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1027.648,1031.427,"--That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-93,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.47,1048.733,But you are not talking about prima facie cases any more when you go to the finder of fact and the finder of fact makes a determination.
1985.85-93,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1056.652,1067.584,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I don't think one can read this record as one in which the District Court saw evidence on the other side and then waited and made a judgment on the merits."
1985.85-93,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1134.869,1141.289,Did the court in effect grant a directed verdict for the defendant?
1985.85-93,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1150.489,1153.034,I think it was close to that.
1985.85-93,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1174.588,1175.572,"Well, they said it was insufficient."
1985.85-93,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1181.818,1191.972,"Justice O'Connor, the District Court held that statistical evidence which fails to include unmeasurable variables is insufficient as a matter of law to prove discrimination."
1985.85-93,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1390.828,1406.088,I take it you and the Solicitor General do not agree on what factors have to be brought in by a plaintiff to meet the statistical evidence burden that you say exists.
1985.85-93,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1406.088,1410.18,There is a difference between our views and that of the solicitor.
1985.85-93,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1523.633,1534.348,Mr. Manning.
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,1534.348,1564.976,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this morning I feel like I am watching my own autopsy, because as the lawyer who tried the case, working 14 hours a day, day and night, weekends, and being in that courtroom, I am not hearing the same case that we tried in 1981 and 1982."
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.36,1840.728,"Mr. Manning, I thought from reading the Court of Appeals opinion and the District Court that these salary disparities the court said could have originated from one of two sources."
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,1845.037,1845.443,Quartile.
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1845.443,1846.381,--The quartile.
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,1859.095,1861.859,That is what the Court of Appeals said.
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1861.859,1862.374,Yes.
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,1862.374,1863.999,The Court of Appeals went on.
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.999,1884.381,"And let me just ask you, suppose the Court of Appeals said that it was just irrelevant if these disparities were just continuations of intentional discrimination that occurred before 1965."
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,1884.694,1891.503,The Court of Appeals said that they could not... that was not a present violation.
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.503,1892.987,And do you agree with that?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,1892.987,1896.767,I would agree with that.
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.767,1914.745,"Or do you agree with... do you think... the United States says that if after 1965 the disparities were discontinued, they just went right on as disparities, they originated before the Act, but they were continued afterwards."
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,1919.008,1924.88,"In theory, Justice White, we would have to agree with that, but that--"
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.88,1927.114,"Well, the Court of Appeals didn't agree with that."
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,1927.114,1929.363,"--No, they did not agree with that."
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.363,1940.984,"And it seems to me they seem to say that these disparities might in part be attributable to that, but even if it was, that is just too bad."
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,1940.984,1946.341,"Well, let me address the facts in answer to your question, because I am glad you asked it."
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1956.431,1957.164,All right.
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,1957.164,1965.475,"I prepared and we prepared in our brief, taking just the point that you mentioned, the question goes back to the facts."
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.89,2060.731,Did the judge find that there never had been any intentional discrimination?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2064.558,2070.696,"--He found that before '65 there was a de jure, a segregated system, and we can't--"
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.696,2071.493,Do you agree with that?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2071.493,2072.492,--That is the way it was.
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.57,2075.038,All right.
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2086.97,2090.547,"--I disagree, because what you--"
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.547,2094.53,"Well, the day before the Act there was intentional discrimination, and the day after there wasn't?"
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2094.53,2097.029,"--Well, I disagree."
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.456,2127.642,"Well, it sounds to me like you are making an argument there never was intentional discrimination."
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2127.642,2129.658,"--I am not making that argument that there wasn't, because--"
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.658,2129.939,I think you--
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2129.939,2133.078,--before '65 it was a two-way system.
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.186,2134.108,--Thank you.
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2134.108,2149.696,But the next point that I would make in connection with that and in answer to that as to whether that continued in salaries or not is to look at the chart which we attached to the appendix to our brief.
1985.85-93,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2248.203,2252.061,Did the District Court... did the Court of Appeals accept this finding of the District Court?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2262.682,2266.306,I didn't write the opinion.
1985.85-93,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2721.922,2733.246,"Mr. Manning, since 1965, have there been any single race clubs formed in racially mixed communities?"
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2734.371,2736.465,The record does show that.
1985.85-93,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2736.465,2738.416,And your comment on that is?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2738.416,2746.304,"My comment on that is that they are formed in racially mixed communities, one race in North Carolina."
1985.85-93,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2774.778,2780.572,"Do they encourage the joinder of persons of the opposite case, the other race, any other race?"
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2780.572,2783.899,"Yes, that is what the policy of the extension service is."
1985.85-93,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2788.162,2789.006,With no effect?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2789.006,2790.879,"Well, there is an effect."
1985.85-93,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2839.86,2842.781,I missed those last words.
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2842.781,2848.841,"Has grown, has gotten, instead of... in other words, I am arguing negative evidence."
1985.85-93,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2862.945,2863.257,Does the evidence--
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2863.257,2863.757,"Yes, ma'am."
1985.85-93,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2863.757,2872.082,--show us how many of the clubs have mixed races in them and how many do not?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2872.082,2872.394,Yes.
1985.85-93,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2872.394,2874.174,And where is that?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2874.174,2875.034,Page 178.
1985.85-93,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2875.034,2877.407,178?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2877.407,2878.5,Of the joint appendix.
1985.85-93,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2885.076,2894.916,"Well, 178 tells us the number of single racial clubs in mixed communities."
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2902.554,2908.255,"There are, and I cannot in the joint appendix... it is in the record."
1985.85-93,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2908.661,2912.019,This is what I have been trying to get you to say for the last five minutes.
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2912.019,2912.222,"--Yes, sir."
1985.85-93,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2925.263,2928.903,And it is in the joint appendix some place?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2928.903,2932.728,--It is in the joint appendix at Page 134.
1985.85-93,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2964.013,2977.289,"So as of... if I am reading it correctly, as of 1977 56 percent of the <four H@l> [= 4H] units in mixed communities were in fact integrated?"
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2977.289,2978.195,--Yes.
1985.85-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.195,2983.646,And it had gone up from 39 percent.
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,2983.646,2985.817,Yes.
1985.85-93,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3033.25,3037.468,Was evidence put in about an effort being made--
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3037.468,3037.859,Yes.
1985.85-93,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3037.859,3043.777,--on the part of the Extension Service to attract integrated units?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3043.777,3057.256,"The effort... there is a lot of evidence that is put in on that issue, and it is hotly... that was, to be frank with you, it was a hotly... how we accomplished it, and what the plaintiffs wanted us to do was the thrust of this."
1985.85-93,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3100.91,3105.065,"Mr. Manning, what is the relationship between the State of North Carolina and the 4H Clubs?"
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3105.065,3133.428,"--Justice Powell, the relationship is that the 4H Clubs are voluntary organizations that have an Extension Service agent who is a 4H agent, who would furnish them materials, who will train their volunteer Leaders, who will give them pamphlets and programs on how to do something, and then the volunteer and the boys and girls in the program will take the ball and run with it."
1985.85-93,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3133.428,3135.303,Does the state finance it in any way?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3135.303,3139.519,The state finances the 4H agents.
1985.85-93,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3139.519,3140.816,"Yes, but in any other way?"
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3140.816,3144.939,But it is my understanding they don't finance the clubs other than they would get materials.
1985.85-93,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3156.155,3159.247,Are people free to organize clubs themselves?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3159.247,3161.76,"--Yes, they are, and they always have been."
1985.85-93,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3161.76,3166.399,Are most of them organized without inspiration or leadership or direction from the state?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3166.399,3175.755,"Yes, they are organized by volunteers who want to help the children and who are trained by the Extension Service workers in how to effectuate the program."
1985.85-93,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3175.755,3183.892,"Aren't the extension workers required to supervising, to organizing, and do everything they can to help them?"
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3183.892,3184.532,"No, sir."
1985.85-93,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3185.361,3186.703,What are they there for?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3186.703,3192.295,"--Well, there are not enough extension workers... well, my answer to the question is this way, Justice Marshall."
1985.85-93,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3196.575,3201.557,"The number that they have, don't they spend full time on the 4H Clubs?"
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3201.557,3207.632,Those that are in a county which is big enough to afford a full-time 4H agent.
1985.85-93,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3235.81,3240.572,"How many counties had the full-time, approximately?"
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3240.572,3254.988,"I would say now the big ones probably at least 80 of the 100 counties would have the full-time, and I am not speaking from any real knowledge, just from knowledge of the case."
1985.85-93,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3254.988,3257.019,Are you saying it is not a state function?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3257.019,3268.795,"It is not... the 4H program is under the auspices of the Extension Service, but it is a voluntary program which is not regulated."
1985.85-93,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3268.795,3270.061,Like the white primary?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3270.061,3273.512,It is not like the white primary at all.
1985.85-93,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3273.512,3278.291,Is any child or young person compelled to go to these programs?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3278.291,3278.573,No.
1985.85-93,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3278.573,3279.791,All voluntary?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3279.791,3281.04,All volunteer.
1985.85-93,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3281.04,3285.304,Are there any other teachers except the agents provided by the state?
1985.85-93,2,27628,howard_e_manning_jr,,3285.304,3295.894,"No, the agent is provided by the state, and he trains the volunteers, or would come in and give a program to the club, but he doesn't run the clubs."
