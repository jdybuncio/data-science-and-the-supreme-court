1994.93-1677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.539,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-1677, the Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Jefferson Lines, Inc. Mr. Johnston."
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,11.539,13.724,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1677,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,75.981,94.462,"Mr. Johnston, does Oklahoma tax the sale in Oklahoma of bus tickets for transportation that is not at all conducted in the State of Oklahoma, that neither begins nor ends in the State of Oklahoma?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,94.462,94.778,Under--
1994.93-1677,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.778,96.212,The ticket is purchased there--
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,96.212,97.078,"--Yes, ma'am."
1994.93-1677,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,97.078,99.764,--for transportation outside the State.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,101.597,106.131,"Your Honor, I believe it would if the sale occurs in Oklahoma under the statute."
1994.93-1677,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.131,106.864,"Yes, that's what I asked."
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,106.864,107.198,Yes.
1994.93-1677,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.198,111.035,"Assume the sale occurs there, but none of the transportation."
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,111.035,112.985,"Yes, Your Honor, it would."
1994.93-1677,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.272,122.26,"Are any such sales at issue in this case, do you know?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,122.26,124.226,"They are not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1994.93-1677,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.529,165.687,"The stipulation seems inconsistent with something stated in the bankruptcy court opinion, and I just didn't know which one to think was the correct one."
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,165.687,177.061,I... my memory of the opinion was that it did recognize that Jefferson sold other types of interstate trips in the State of Oklahoma.
1994.93-1677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.29,409.226,"Mr. Johnston, one more background fact."
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,432.47,447.582,"--I... it's incorrect under the law, Your Honor, and you're speaking of the Greyhound case, which is an almost identical case which is currently pending in the Fifth Circuit."
1994.93-1677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,469.262,480.136,"Does the tax reach, as the bankruptcy judges seem to think, transportation sold in other States, but that occurs at least in part in Oklahoma?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,480.136,481.953,"--No, Your Honor, it does not."
1994.93-1677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,508.77,520.226,"So this statement, the statute also allows Oklahoma to tax transportation sold in other States which occurs in Oklahoma, that's just flat wrong, is that your position?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,520.226,524.613,"That's just flat wrong, Your Honor."
1994.93-1677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.419,544.787,May I ask if your tax would cover... forget interstate commerce and transportation for a moment.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,552.541,576.156,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe it would, because my memory of the statute is that it does tax admission to places of amusement, and if the sale were made in Oklahoma, then it would be taxable in Oklahoma, because, as with the Super Bowl ticket or a bus ticket, the way people purchase these services--"
1994.93-1677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,576.156,581.626,"And going back to Justice O'Connor's question, there doesn't have to be any part of the service performed within the State?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,581.626,601.171,"--Not in such circumstances, where you have certainly physical evidence in the form of the ticket, but legal evidence where the service is bought and paid for and at that point the purchaser has the right to the service and the right to do with that service as he will."
1994.93-1677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.584,654.488,"So, then, a travel agency doing business in Oklahoma pays the tax on all the sales it makes regardless of what the tickets are?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,663.058,665.86,If it's in regard to transportation?
1994.93-1677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,665.86,666.296,Yes.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,666.296,667.996,"Yes, sir, under this statute."
1994.93-1677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,673.616,688.125,"Well, exactly what is the provision of the Oklahoma tax, because in answer to that question of Justice Stevens, you said if it applies to transportation, but then certainly a Super Bowl ticket to admit one into the Super Bowl doesn't deal with transportation."
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,692.011,732.238,"As to transportation it is... and that's contained on pages 2 and 3 of the brief for petitioner... in section 1354, title 68 of the Oklahoma statutes is the general levying statute, which levies the sales tax of 4 percent, it is now 4-1/2 percent of the gross receipts or gross proceeds of sale of a) tangible personal property, c) transportation for hire to persons by common carriers... I've omitted the rest of that, but it includes--"
1994.93-1677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.238,736.606,"Well, how would that reach tickets to the Super Bowl?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,736.606,750.55,"--In other sections or subsections, rather, of the sales tax statute, the tax is levied on the sale of admission to amusement... sports and amusement places."
1994.93-1677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,813.356,827.7,"With respect to Central Greyhound, is it your position that if New York had made that tax a tax on the sale of the ticket, then it would have come out the other way?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,827.7,828.652,"I believe it would, Your Honor."
1994.93-1677,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,861.789,864.408,"But as a practical matter, what's the difference?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,871.645,879.167,"It is, Your Honor, but I believe that under all the precedents you have to look at the transaction that is being taxed."
1994.93-1677,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,890.373,892.956,"But there's no separate transaction in Central Greyhound, is it?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,905.963,907.898,I don't believe that that is the only difference.
1994.93-1677,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,910.314,921.622,Is there... was there any other kind of income that went into gross income in Central Greyhound that is... in addition to revenue from the sale of transportation?
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,921.622,924.341,I'm afraid I'm not... I'm not aware that there was.
1994.93-1677,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,925.508,928.625,"Then I'm not... then, like the court below, I'm not sure what the difference is, then."
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,931.125,948.52,"--Because in Central Greyhound we are talking about taxing the bus company on its revenues, its gross receipts in that case, not net revenues, but from the providing of... providing its own income, the generation of income, in that case more than one State."
1994.93-1677,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,948.52,970.785,"Well, is the difference, then, that in the case of the tax here, the bus company is given an authorization to add on the tax up front and state it as a tax when it collects it, as distinct from simply dealing with it as a cost of business and passing it on sub silentio when it figures the price of its ticket?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,970.785,973.904,"In this case the bus company is not only permitted to do that, it is required."
1994.93-1677,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,975.087,978.022,"Well, I realize that, but is that, then, the only distinction between the two?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,987.478,991.448,"I think that's not only correct, Your Honor, but it also is constitutionally significant, because--"
1994.93-1677,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,991.448,992.281,That's the only difference.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,993.181,995.233,"--It is the primary difference, yes, sir."
1994.93-1677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.991,1032.041,I thought Greyhound was a tax on the company?
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1032.041,1033.442,"--Central Greyhound was, yes, sir."
1994.93-1677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.442,1036.144,"And that this is a tax on the purchaser, not on the company?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1036.144,1037.277,"Yes, sir, that is correct."
1994.93-1677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1037.277,1037.929,That's a big difference.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1037.929,1040.779,That is the difference.
1994.93-1677,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1040.779,1042.131,Why does that make a difference?
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1068.129,1080.137,"The difference is, as far as Oklahoma's interest, is that Oklahoma is levying a transaction tax on the purchaser in Oklahoma and not on the bus company."
1994.93-1677,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1085.058,1085.324,All right.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1108.839,1110.025,I would doubt it.
1994.93-1677,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1110.025,1112.325,"The answer's no, I take it."
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1138.275,1152.852,"I think that the difference as it applies to this case, Your Honor, is that in the case of tangible personal property, a sales tax on that, you're taxing the transfer of the title or possession of that personal property."
1994.93-1677,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1152.852,1153.452,In all cases?
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1153.452,1154.735,"The question is, is where does it occur?"
1994.93-1677,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.735,1162.124,"Yes, but why should there be a difference, my point is, between the apples and the haircut and the bus trip?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1172.246,1202.582,"Under that situation, Your Honor, yes, I believe there is, because if the sale of a ticket that represents the right to the bus trip on behalf of the customer, if that sale occurs in Massachusetts, according to your example, then the transaction whereby I purchase and acquire all the rights to the thing that I have purchased, that occurs in Massachusetts, and if Massachusetts has the Oklahoma-type sales tax, then it's taxable there, I submit."
1994.93-1677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.582,1203.717,Why is that different from the apples?
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1213.906,1214.522,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1994.93-1677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.522,1220.076,I thought you told me earlier that a comparable transaction to the apple transaction would be subject to the tax.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1228.665,1229.215,"Your Honor, I think--"
1994.93-1677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.215,1235.702,The right to have the event take place is purchased in your State.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1235.702,1236.535,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.16,1284.433,"You have to make the distinction for personal property because we've held that the State where the contract for sale is made cannot impose a sales tax, haven't we?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1284.433,1285.885,"I believe you have, Your Honor."
1994.93-1677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1287.268,1287.768,Mr. Johnston--
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1287.768,1288.218,--the only--
1994.93-1677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1288.218,1290.97,--That's the only reason for the distinction I can see.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1307.98,1308.396,"--Yes, ma'am."
1994.93-1677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1308.396,1328.309,"So does that stipulation mean that what we have been talking about, a ticket purchased in Oklahoma but for transportation between States other than Oklahoma, that that is something that the statute purports to reach but is not at issue in this case?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1328.309,1329.609,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1329.609,1337.249,So the only sales that are at issue in this case are routes that originate in Oklahoma and terminate some place else?
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1337.249,1340.951,"That is what the stipulation covers, and that's all it covers, Your Honor."
1994.93-1677,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1360.012,1374.088,"What are the case authorities that you can point us to that require this distinction between tangible services and the sale of goods, or intangible services, rather, and the sale of goods?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1374.088,1374.488,"Your Honor, I--"
1994.93-1677,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1374.488,1395.419,"I take it you're sticking with that distinction so that if Oklahoma tries to tax a sale for goods that are shipped and delivered in other States, the shipment outside of Oklahoma, the delivery outside of Oklahoma, the receipt outside of Oklahoma but the sale in Oklahoma, I take it you say that's not taxable?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1395.419,1398.371,"--If Your Honor... if I understand, this would be, for instance--"
1994.93-1677,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1398.371,1398.854,This is--
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1398.854,1399.504,--a sale in Oklahoma--
1994.93-1677,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1399.504,1400.154,--This is the apple.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1400.154,1402.156,--of something that occurred totally outside.
1994.93-1677,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1402.156,1402.439,Yes.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1404.275,1405.441,Yes.
1994.93-1677,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1421.035,1425.438,Even if this service were for the delivery of tangible property?
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1433.258,1436.96,If a sale were... if I ordered the apple to be delivered from one State to another State--
1994.93-1677,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1436.96,1444.63,"You complete the sale in Oklahoma, but the apples are going to be shipped from Washington to California."
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1444.63,1452.534,"--There is a question in my mind whether in that case, although you're assuming the complete... the sale in Oklahoma."
1994.93-1677,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1459.221,1463.508,"Well, why is that different from Justice Stevens' Super Bowl problem?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1463.508,1468.411,"--Because in the Super Bowl problem, as the question was posed, the sale was completed."
1994.93-1677,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1489.159,1492.777,"Well, let's assume the same thing happens with the apple hypothetical."
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1510.405,1523.23,"The cases with which I am familiar do require that there be some sort of delivery, the completion, although the statute requires transfer of either title or possession in the State."
1994.93-1677,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1523.23,1523.496,Okay.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1526.815,1527.784,The McGoldrick--
1994.93-1677,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1527.784,1539.592,"--you can point us to from this Court that require us to make a distinction between services and tangible goods, if that's the distinction you want us to make?"
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1539.592,1566.992,"--The McGoldrick case would be one case, Your Honor, because the agreement was made first, then the coal was mined or released, then it was shipped from a place out of State into New York, and actual physical delivery of the coal to the buying customer was made in New York, so the interstate portion of that delivery the Court found to be basically incidental and not violative of interstate commerce."
1994.93-1677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1630.782,1636.686,What about the Court's stress of the credit mechanism that was present in that case and not in this case?
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1636.686,1671.173,"I believe because of the circumstances or the nature of that transaction, and the statute provided the possibility as the Court noted, although I believe the Court said that there was a very, very slight possibility, but a possibility, that an interstate telephone call could be subject to tax in two States, but only two States, and the Court then, of course, observed that even if there was that slight possibility, then the credit provision would act to take care to avoid any actual multiple taxation."
1994.93-1677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1685.064,1689.432,But it would have... would be able to put a gross receipts tax on the company--
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1689.432,1689.966,It could.
1994.93-1677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.966,1691.551,--for the miles in that State.
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1691.551,1701.073,"It could in that event, Your Honor, as I believe most bus companies are entitled to various taxes, and certainly income taxes."
1994.93-1677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.399,1745.268,"Thank you, Mr. Johnston."
1994.93-1677,0,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1746.685,1747.435,--Thank you.
1994.93-1677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.435,1756.874,"Mr. DeRuyter, we'll hear from you."
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1756.874,1759.826,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.608,1788.012,Would it be the same for an income tax on the revenues derived from interstate transportation?
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1791.88,1806.64,"--This Court has held that income tax must be fairly apportioned and has dealt with a number of apportionment formulae which it requires that income taxes be subjected to, so the answer to that--"
1994.93-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.64,1811.525,"But the income from interstate transportation is not exempt from State taxes, is it?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1811.525,1812.877,"--It is not exempt, no."
1994.93-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1812.877,1821.233,But you're saying that the... that a sales tax cannot be imposed on interstate transportation.
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1821.233,1826.387,I am not saying that a sales tax cannot be imposed on interstate transportation.
1994.93-1677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1837.826,1857.322,"What about a... supposing your bus company has a route from Oklahoma City to Dallas, and the bus fills up in Oklahoma City with gas, enough to take it to Dallas, now can Oklahoma tax the entirety of that purchase of gas even though a lot of it is going to be used for transportation in Texas?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1857.322,1857.922,Yes.
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1884.99,1900.083,"Well, what about a tax on... an excise tax on interstate phone calls made from or to an in-State address?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1900.083,1904.387,That's similar to what... the situation that this Court dealt with in Goldberg.
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.387,1907.422,"Exactly, and what did we hold there?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1907.422,1913.093,"The Court held there, based on the particular, different facts from this one, that--"
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1913.093,1916.711,"Well, didn't we hold that the State could tax those calls?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1916.711,1919.08,--You held that the State could tax that service address.
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1919.08,1920.68,The whole price of the call--
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1920.68,1921.03,That's--
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1921.03,1928.853,--including the portion that covered the out-of-State use of the facilities of the telephone company.
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1928.853,1930.019,--That is correct.
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1930.019,1932.821,"Well, why is this different?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1944.295,1952.549,"The finding of the Court in Goldberg... the answer to your question is yes, this case is different than the Goldberg situation."
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1962.607,1965.642,"Well, that strikes me as being insubstantial."
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,1974.815,1991.942,"--There were parties to that case that argued that... that it was administratively feasible in Goldberg to apportion the tax between the States, but the Court found, as part of its decision, that it was administratively impossible."
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2018.426,2026.163,"Well, how about Justice Stevens' Super Bowl ticket purchase in Oklahoma?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2026.163,2027.865,I believe that--
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2027.865,2029.165,How do you apportion that?
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2029.165,2053.516,"--I believe that that should not be subject to the Oklahoma tax because, assuming that you find that the Super Bowl ticket is a service, a performance, then the place where the service is performed is the place that may... that has the jurisdiction to impose a tax."
1994.93-1677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2084.119,2098.277,"Well, don't those cases suggest that maybe this tax should not have been imposed as a matter of State law, rather than as a matter of Federal constitutional law, if you're relying on the Oklahoma supreme court opinion?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2098.277,2100.295,"We're arguing both, Your Honor."
1994.93-1677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2100.295,2106.299,"But don't we have to assume... or maybe we don't, I don't know... that this tax is properly imposed as a matter of State law?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2119.625,2120.642,I don't believe we have.
1994.93-1677,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2158.85,2185.485,"Mr. DeRuyter, one argument that was made, I think by the tax commission, was that if they were able to tax the customer who is traveling on Oklahoma roads, set up tolls, maybe, along the road, so they taxed all of the miles within Oklahoma, that they'd probably net more than they are now, when they're taxing only the person who purchased the ticket in Oklahoma."
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2207.714,2209.116,"No, we have not shown that."
1994.93-1677,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2270.673,2281.712,"Under your theory, I take it all sales taxes on rent-a-cars have to be apportioned to the extent the rent-a-car's being driven out of State?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2281.712,2301.543,"If the tax... the answer is yes, assuming the tax is imposed on the delivery of the rental itself as opposed to the situation in, I believe it was Itel where they... there was a lease of containers, but they said the tax was imposed on the delivery of possession."
1994.93-1677,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2308.715,2328.193,"And the same if you hire an attorney in one State but all of the services really involve his or her traveling out of State to make a report and a recommendation, if there's a State service tax that has to be apportioned?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2328.193,2329.129,That is correct.
1994.93-1677,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2338.418,2340.768,"How are you coming out on that with the State, pretty well?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2343.52,2344.489,But we are required--
1994.93-1677,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2344.489,2347.341,But you think constitutionally this is required?
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2347.341,2350.091,--Yes.
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2377.776,2383.597,"Well, except for the telephone calls in Goldberg."
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2383.597,2388.668,"Goldberg, as I indicated, administratively impossible."
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2424.507,2434.113,"Well, if you say the taxable event is the sale of the ticket, only one State can impose it, isn't that so?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2440.017,2456.46,"I believe that you do, that by saying that you impose a tax on the sale of the ticket, at bottom what you are saying is that you are imposing a tax on the contract, making of the contract and the making of the payment."
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2471.101,2478.171,"But in this situation, what other State could tax the sale, do you suppose?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2490.979,2494.597,--No other view can tax the act of making the sale.
1994.93-1677,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2494.597,2494.881,Right.
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2494.881,2501.685,"However, I'm... the... this Court has said you must look at the operating incidence of the tax."
1994.93-1677,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2532.306,2539.143,And your apportionment formula that you suggest is mileage traveled in each State?
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2539.143,2545.28,The determination of an apportionment formula is in essence a legislative decision.
1994.93-1677,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2560.872,2561.739,Which is mileage?
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2561.739,2562.805,Which is mileage.
1994.93-1677,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2562.805,2565.491,"Well, suppose that a person transfers."
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2598.359,2605.346,I agree in a theoretical sense that that is a legislative decision.
1994.93-1677,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2606.929,2620.355,"But it's not just a legislative decision if we're asking whether or not the apportionment mechanism is available and feasible, because that's what we need to distinguish the Illinois tax on telephone calls."
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2620.355,2636.365,"--I certainly believe that apportionment on the basis of mileage is not only feasible but judicially sanctioned, and it was referenced as such in the Illinois decision, citing Central Greyhound v. Mealey."
1994.93-1677,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2636.365,2653.744,"Mr. DeRuyter, would you explain why it isn't necessary for New York in the Berwind-White situation to take off something because the coal traveled interstate?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2694.385,2697.254,We argue that our position is consistent.
1994.93-1677,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2735.629,2746.668,"Are you saying that unlike goods, where we let somebody tax the full value, nobody in an interstate sale can tax the full value of the service?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2746.668,2747.437,No.
1994.93-1677,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2759.827,2761.494,I don't follow that.
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2769.1,2775.004,Assuming... Oklahoma and Texas in combination can tax 100 percent of the value of that--
1994.93-1677,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2775.004,2777.956,But New York didn't have to worry about combining with anybody in Berwind-White.
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2796.265,2804.287,"--I go back to what this Court has said in those delivery of goods cases, that the object of the transaction is the delivery of the good."
1994.93-1677,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.287,2813.643,"So you're then making a distinction between, there isn't one place that can tax in full a service that's rendered interstate, unlike goods."
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2813.643,2814.693,I agree with that.
1994.93-1677,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2814.693,2834.989,"Why isn't the object of the transaction in this particular case the right to obtain travel services at some future time, and why isn't that transaction just as complete as the transaction when goods are purchased?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2834.989,2847.98,"Because when a person purchases a ticket, they don't have the full right to the object of that transaction."
1994.93-1677,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2847.98,2848.566,But they do.
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2897.377,2898.494,I don't agree with that.
1994.93-1677,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2940.354,2960.017,"Would you agree, then, that if the bus company were selling the tickets in the first place to travel agents and travel agents were then selling them to the travelers, that at least the transaction as between the bus company and the travel agent would be complete at that point, and that would be fully taxable?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2960.017,2961.467,I don't believe that's the case.
1994.93-1677,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2961.467,2974.961,"Well, that isn't the case here, but if that were the case, would that particular transaction as between the company and the agent, as distinct from the agent and the traveler, even on your theory, be fully taxable without apportionment?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,2974.961,2988.704,"I don't think so, because the travel agent is simply an agent in that situation, either for the passenger or for Jefferson Lines, and it should not make a difference on how the transaction is taxed."
1994.93-1677,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3005.915,3027.346,"This may not be a very legally persuasive argument, but it seems to me that if Oklahoma were right in this case, many, many States would have enacted sales taxes where none now exist on transportation tickets."
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3042.255,3046.973,"I think airline tickets are... Congress has acted in that area, but--"
1994.93-1677,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3046.973,3048.325,"The antihead tax, right?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3050.694,3050.944,--Right.
1994.93-1677,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3051.36,3053.829,But what about other bus companies?
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3060.4,3066.287,Jefferson operates on routes that basically go north and south from the State of Minnesota.
1994.93-1677,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3099.858,3117.636,"I'm not sure I understand the state of the art on this, but if the... or, I start out in Washington, the State of Washington, and I buy a bus ticket and a crate of apples, and I'm going to New York, and I take it if I eat up the apples on the way, all New York can tax is the two remaining ones that are with me in New York."
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3125.675,3125.942,Yes.
1994.93-1677,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3125.942,3126.225,Yes.
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3126.542,3127.642,"Yes, if they were all delivered to New York."
1994.93-1677,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3127.642,3147.019,"Then I take it on services... if that's the state of the law on goods, then I take it on services it would be the same, that New York could tax me on that portion of the bus trip that takes place in New York, but it couldn't tax me on the portion in Iowa any more than... on your theory any more than it could tax me on the apples that I ate as I was going through Iowa."
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3147.019,3147.636,Exactly.
1994.93-1677,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3147.636,3147.953,All right.
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3183.623,3188.658,I can't answer your question without reference to the Goldberg decision.
1994.93-1677,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3230.152,3244.995,"--Why couldn't they simply have said, we allocate it 50-50, one person is curled up inside the telephone in Illinois, another one is curled up in New York, we split it right in half, and each State could--"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3244.995,3245.379,I think--
1994.93-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3245.379,3246.929,--What about the States in between?
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3250.964,3253.933,--Are we talking buses now or telephones?
1994.93-1677,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3253.933,3255.785,Telephones.
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3255.785,3272.727,"If we're talking telephones, the... that's similar to a tax that we cite in our materials, the case out of Florida, and that's exactly what they did, and that might be an appropriate apportionment."
1994.93-1677,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3282.935,3286.72,"And spoke of the problem of, the difficulty of attribution."
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3286.72,3287.32,Exactly.
1994.93-1677,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3287.32,3312.704,"Yes, and it doesn't seem to be a difficult... I mean, it looks as though there's a very simple way that they might apportion, and so the question is, do we follow... do we say, well, if it was tough in the phone case, it's equally tough in this case, and say there can't be an apportionment, or do we say we were wrong about apportionment in the first case, it's easy in each instance, and therefore we see it your way here?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3315.489,3331.599,"I've thought about... I thought about... you know, when I've read Goldberg, my view of that is simply that I don't think the State of Oklahoma argues that apportionment on a mileage basis is difficult, or impossible to do."
1994.93-1677,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3358.832,3363.284,You haven't shown that there's any multiple taxation in fact in this case.
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3374.259,3374.892,You are correct.
1994.93-1677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.307,3406.061,"As long as the tax is imposed on a customer, how could they impose... how could another State, other than the one where the ticket is bought, impose a tax?"
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3407.163,3409.229,--How could another State impose a tax on the customer?
1994.93-1677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3409.229,3410.046,--On the passenger.
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3410.046,3411.065,On the passenger.
1994.93-1677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3412.881,3414.767,How would that work?
1994.93-1677,1,41190,steven_d_deruyter,,3423.755,3430.409,Minnesota would simply audit the tickets purchased outside the State and ask for an allocation on the... assuming mileage--
