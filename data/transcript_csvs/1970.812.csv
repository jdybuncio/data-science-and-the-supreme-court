1970.812,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.966,"We'll now hear arguments in 812, United States against the District Court of Eagle County of Water Division No. 5."
1970.812,0,33744,kiechel,,16.993,20.649,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1421.485,1426.819,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1511.715,1513.995,Have they ever brought one in Colorado?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1513.995,1515.313,"In Colorado, yes sir."
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1599.558,1601.762,How long though was this Mr. Balcomb?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1601.762,1612.884,"The suit was initiated about 1952, I believe and then went to the decree by the stipulation in 1955 and it’s been amended a couple of times since then."
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.131,1658.124,Was that -- that was tantamount to a -- an assertion by them that the Colorado court had jurisdiction?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1658.124,1659.414,"Yes, I believe so."
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.695,1660.097,They have --
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1660.097,1660.632,Recognize --
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.632,1661.39,They removed it?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1661.39,1662.791,-- by removal.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1670.795,1672.753,You said a decree by a stipulation.
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1675.952,1685.336,Yes sir and the United States was given the right and claim the initiation of construction in 1935.
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.336,1693.457,"Mr. Balcomb, may I ask before I learn too much about, I like to pursue it just one question further."
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1717.448,1721.206,You mean something open note notorious or something to that nature Your Honor?
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.521,1748.555,"Yes, but they aren’t using the water for anything at the moment?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1748.555,1755.951,"So, neither is the city and county of Denver Your Honor and they claim water rights that they don not expect to put into operation until year the 2010."
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.951,1761.831,"I’ve never heard of the -- that took some doing, didn’t it?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1761.831,1762.037,They got --
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.037,1764.882,As far as the western slopers were concerned?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1764.882,1766.823,"Well, yes in some respect."
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.823,1768.717,Yes.
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1768.717,1779.454,"There’s nothing -- nothing in the law prohibits the acquisition of a right currently for use so far -- in the far distant future if you can show the need, the eventual need."
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.973,1806.614,But that would just be a matter I suppose to the probably governed by federal law?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1806.614,1809.432,Yes sir.
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.453,1871.425,"Mr. Balcomb, can I ask you another question please."
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1877.417,1878.85,Alright sir.
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.85,1886.142,And the United States then wanted to remove the case to the federal court?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1886.142,1901.232,"There are several decisions in which in some cases, they held the right of removal that was not present, in some they said, the right to removal was exercise is prematurely exercise, but it might come back after a clear federal question arises in the state court."
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.232,1904.439,"Yes, but what if it’s a reserved right that you’re arguing about?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1914.596,1914.705,Oh!
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.099,1941.352,"But on the face -- on the face of the statute, it is a removable issue, isn’t it?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1941.352,1942.847,"On the face of the statute, it is."
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.847,1943.127,Yes.
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1943.127,1949.99,"So if you study the legislative history, you might draw an opposite conclusion, but on the face of the statute is not forbidden, I’ll say that."
1970.812,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1949.99,1956.457,There was removal provision in the Bill at one stage as I read the briefs and that was deleted by Congress?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1956.457,1967.409,"Yes sir and I think in that connection, the Special Assistant Attorney General testifying about it pointed out the difficulties involved for people over far western slope to have to come clear to Denver Colorado."
1970.812,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1967.409,1968.185,Yes.
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1968.185,1971.441,They thought -- then justice thought the removal provision was bad.
1970.812,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1971.441,1972.954,That's what I thought.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1972.954,1989.486,"Mr. Balcomb, what’s your absolutely Government’s submission that the both the adjudication and the administration clauses are qualified by the provision as to appropriative rights?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1989.486,1992.884,It’s speaks of the United States in two categories I believe.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2007.51,2016.082,"What I have reference to though is that -- as I understand the argument, reserved rights are not embraced by the consent statute."
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2038.554,2041.116,Because this does have a possible --
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2041.116,2042.669,Well do you agree with that?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2042.669,2043.817,Do I agree with the Government’s position?
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2043.817,2044.64,Yes.
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2044.64,2046.998,I think that it covers everything is my position Your Honor.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2046.998,2048.998,That it covers reserve rights too?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2048.998,2052.036,That’s correct or by whatever name you might call it.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2052.036,2053.446,And you say it covers everything?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2057.257,2058.422,Both of them.
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2058.422,2061.692,You mean the consent statute covers both of them?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2061.692,2061.815,Yes.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2061.815,2062.53,That’s what I was talking --
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2062.53,2063.221,Yes sir.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2074.746,2083.213,"Yes, but I thought -- I thought the Government’s argument was that the adjudication of rights does not include the adjudication of reserved rights?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2083.213,2083.46,I know --
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2083.46,2096.176,"That is because the clause dealing with the administration of rights, the Government argues is limited to water rights by appropriation under state law?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2096.176,2101.477,"Well then, the first one is meaningless."
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2112.772,2114.188,"Of whatever the right is, is that it?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2114.188,2116.198,Whatever the right might be irrespective --
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2116.198,2118.322,Who braces appropriative over anything else?
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.322,2126.909,What does administration mean in the -- what’s the difference between adjudication and administration of rights?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2126.909,2135.881,"Adjudication as we understand it in the western states is the legal court process through which you go to establish your position on the ladder of rights, your priority --"
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.881,2137.135,To assert your right?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2137.135,2138.101,Yes.
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2151.501,2155.59,"Now This proceeding we have going here is to establish a right, isn’t it?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2155.59,2158.389,"That’s the rights now, yes Your Honor."
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.389,2160.15,Whether there’s a right exist or not?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2160.15,2160.352,That’s correct.
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.352,2161.861,That’s adjudicating?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2161.861,2162.984,That’s right.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2349.814,2351.479,Mr. Balcomb?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2358.564,2359.629,Some modification.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2368.367,2369.499,Yes.
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2370.823,2378.271,"There was first put in it a tabulation of which the Government now talks about, and then that was eliminated."
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2378.271,2379.82,How about the first sentence?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2388.202,2399.194,"Punctuation only was added I believe and that was the subject of the reports, the second report from the Senate committee."
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2461.2,2474.521,"Do you have in the Colorado any priorities other than time of appropriation, if you have any priorities with respect to the type of use?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2474.521,2478.549,"Well, they’re all adjudicated for a purpose as well as time and quantity."
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.549,2486.382,"But assume, there’s a conflict between people for industrial use as against irrigation or as against municipal use?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2486.382,2493.546,"The highest and best use by the Constitution is domestic, the second is agriculture, the third of course is manufacturing industrial."
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2497.846,2499.032,Right.
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2499.032,2499.815,And the --
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.815,2507.739,"Once it’s adjudicated, they own it till somebody condemns it?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2507.739,2508.335,That’s right.
1970.812,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.678,2523.002,Right.
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2523.002,2534.08,"With which I would concur, they can do it."
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2621.375,2623.694,What is the administrative proceeding?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2625.668,2625.999,Yes sir.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2627.935,2629.633,"What is it, like master is he?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2629.633,2633.482,"I would say yes sir, special proceeding, but it’s nonetheless --"
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2633.482,2635.43,"Who makes the final adjudication, the judge is that it?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2635.43,2636.575,The judge does.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2636.575,2637.06,I see.
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2637.06,2644.921,"He enters a -- there is a little bit of difference about this in Colorado, but primarily, he is supposed to enter semi-annually a master decree covering all the matters with --"
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2644.921,2649.347,"Well, how’s the whole proceeding initiated, by something that’s filed in the court?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2649.347,2653.036,Someone goes in and files a claim for lack of better word.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2655.097,2656.072,Where does he file it?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2656.072,2661.425,"With the water clerk who is the clerk of the court, and then the court governs the whole division."
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2661.425,2662.544,"Oh, he is the clerk?"
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2662.544,2663.346,Of the court.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2663.346,2664.903,I see.
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2669.321,2670.718,Yes sir.
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2680.025,2683.095,When is it subject to removal of the federal court?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2686.356,2698.145,"I think as soon as United States could show that its rights were being interfered with, and that the state court certainly, if it goes into the position to handle them, might grab go ahead and handle it."
1970.812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2716.94,2718.222,In that proceeding?
1970.812,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2718.222,2724.623,In that year with the same clerk and goes before the same referee and gets the same judge and a decree.
1970.812,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2826.575,2829.025,Thank you Mr. Balcomb.
1970.812,2,33744,kiechel,,2831.193,2833.613,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.812,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2833.613,2835.678,What about this removal?
1970.812,2,33744,kiechel,,2838.985,2841.327,I wish I could be as confident in saying that it is removable.
1970.812,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2841.327,2842.395,Have you ever tried it?
1970.812,2,33744,kiechel,,2842.395,2844.059,"Yes, we have Your Honor."
1970.812,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2862.594,2866.481,"Incidentally what were the rights claim by the United States in that litigation, reserved or appropriate?"
1970.812,2,33744,kiechel,,2866.481,2868.473,Those were rights including reserved rights --
1970.812,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2868.473,2869.366,Including reserve.
1970.812,2,33744,kiechel,,2869.366,2875.317,"-- on federal forest, national forest."
1970.812,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3033.447,3043.206,Are you suggesting that we have to decide in this case whether this Colorado procedure is a judicial or a administrative proceeding?
1970.812,2,33744,kiechel,,3043.206,3043.386,I’m saying --
1970.812,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3043.386,3045.144,In order to decide the --
1970.812,2,33744,kiechel,,3045.144,3045.322,I’m sorry.
1970.812,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3045.322,3046.549,-- just wanted the consent statute?
1970.812,2,33744,kiechel,,3046.549,3053.796,I’m saying Mr. Justice Brennan that Congress intended to consent to the joinder of the United States only in judicial proceeding.
1970.812,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3053.796,3064.861,"Well, now accepting that premise, now you’re suggesting that we have to decide whether this Colorado procedure in this case was or was not a judicial proceeding?"
1970.812,2,33744,kiechel,,3064.861,3075.844,Yes and I think that you should -- you can decide by reference to the Colorado Act is an administrative procedure.
1970.812,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3075.844,3081.595,But you’re suggesting we have to decide whether is or isn’t a judicial proceeding?
1970.812,2,33744,kiechel,,3081.595,3082.582,Yes in --
1970.812,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3082.582,3088.603,If we accept your premise that Congress meant the consent statute to apply only if judicial procedure.
1970.812,2,33744,kiechel,,3088.603,3089.396,Yes Your Honor.
