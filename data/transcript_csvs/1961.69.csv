1961.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.719,"Number 69, John Machibroda, Petitioner, versus United States."
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,16.936,18.177,If the Court please.
1961.69,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,116.792,119.292,(Inaudible)
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,119.292,119.9,Yes Your Honor.
1961.69,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,119.9,122.449,(Inaudible)
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,122.449,126.602,His counsel was asked to speak and did not Your Honor.
1961.69,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,128.946,131.358,(Inaudible)
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,131.358,133.862,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1961.69,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,162.186,173.935,(Inaudible)
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,173.935,176.738,That's right.
1961.69,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,646.912,655.296,"Oh, I suppose an understandable thing the United States Attorney is -- of this is one that has something on the file, isn't it?"
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,660.512,662.724,"From Mr. Condon's standpoint, I can understand that."
1961.69,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,671.449,674.582,"Did the court really rely on it, the rule?"
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,674.582,682.963,"Well, the Government says and they're technically quite accurate that the court below did not specifically rely on it."
1961.69,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,949.068,963.441,"I don't suppose your position doesn't go to the extreme of saying that no matter what a prisoner alleges if it creates an issue of facts, he is automatically entitled to a hearing."
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,963.441,964.184,"No sir, Your Honor, the --"
1961.69,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,964.184,978.745,But the real issue here is whether the District Court will try this case that these papers before him acted -- an abuse of discretion or an excess of what he should've done in denying this application about the hearing.
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,980.871,983.417,I would not describe it as a discretionary matter.
1961.69,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,983.417,1000.347,"Well, discretionary is not a happy word but at least you got to show something more, don't you to make a due process claim merely that the papers on their face raise a trivial issue of fact?"
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1000.347,1001.269,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1961.69,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1001.269,1001.953,You don't?
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1001.953,1004.703,No sir.
1961.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1004.951,1031.72,"But -- in the answer to -- wouldn't the answer to Justice Harlan's question depends somewhat very greatly on whether the things alleged in the petition, were things within the knowledge of the trial judge or things that were extraneous to the actual court rule conduct of the parties."
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1031.72,1036.527,"Oh, I think that would make a great differences, if he alleged facts that had occurred in court."
1961.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1036.527,1037.38,Yes.
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1037.38,1038.381,He would --
1961.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1038.381,1040.594,But that wasn't your situation as I understand it.
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1040.594,1041.464,No sir.
1961.69,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1050.33,1064.188,What significance do you attach to the courts asking any â€“ (Inaudible)
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1064.188,1065.081,Yes sir Your Honor.
1961.69,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1088.242,1091.101,What else that the court should've done or could've done?
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1091.101,1091.886,Yes sir.
1961.69,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1250.834,1259.929,"What was the time in the rule, Mr. Reitz between the plea, the sentencing and this 2255 motion?"
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1259.929,1264.964,The sentencing took place in May 1956.
1961.69,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1264.964,1267.141,And the motion was made when?
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1267.141,1270.358,The motion was made in 1959.
1961.69,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1277.005,1282.667,Is there any explanation to the delay that the record indicates?
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1282.667,1300.48,"No explanation beyond the facts that we know that the prisoner at the outset on the allegations that I say, we have to accept as true protested four letters, two to the Court and two to the Attorney General which -- to which he received no response."
1961.69,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1464.613,1488.22,"On the ground that this plea was induced by fraud of the Assistant District Attorney is irrelevant you say to show that in the trial of this codefendant, he took full responsibility on the stand for the holdup."
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1488.22,1493.923,I don't know that was -- I don't know that that was what he testified Your Honor.
1961.69,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1534.745,1550.136,"I thought you were arguing though the reason the Court to gain the total facts, with this defendant was that he had taken the stand in the trial of the codefendant and assumed all of the claim in an attempt to exonerate the codefendant?"
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1550.136,1561.001,"No, the motion alleges that the judge was vexed because of his testimony unfavorable to the Government."
1961.69,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1575.058,1584.565,"Mr. Reitz, what has happened between the original sentencing which was in -- on May 23rd, 1956, is that right?"
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1584.565,1585.416,Yes sir.
1961.69,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1585.416,1596.007,"And then this motion, I don't know when it was filed, it was disposed off by Judge Kloeb on September 30th, 1959."
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1602.402,1609.479,The only thing the record shows Your Honor -- I'm not sure whether I can use the word record.
1961.69,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1625.277,1628.857,Did these two counsels continued to be his counsel?
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1628.857,1629.848,No Your Honor.
1961.69,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1631.215,1637.631,Did he have any counsels -- did he had counsel -- did he have any counsel between the sentence and this motion?
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1637.631,1639.55,Not to my knowledge and the motion was filed pro se.
1961.69,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1639.55,1651.357,Was there anything to disclose -- to show that he wasn't aware of these facts that he now set forth? Or that (Voice Overlap) --
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1651.357,1660.946,"No, he -- in fact the motion specifically alleges that he was aware of the facts and protested immediately upon arriving in jail."
1961.69,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1660.946,1663.82,But no -- no proceeding was started on the basis of this --
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1663.82,1665.748,No formal legal proceeding.
1961.69,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1665.748,1667.769,Any explanation of why it was delayed?
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1667.769,1671.147,No explanation in the record.
1961.69,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1677.305,1682.439,"Well, you don't have to get legal education regarding the facts that are -- within your own -- do you?"
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1682.439,1684.447,"No, but the remedy that you might seek is --"
1961.69,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1684.447,1687.393,Why do you think it?
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1696.463,1699.662,I don't know that it appears Your Honor.
1961.69,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1704.249,1706.681,"What I mean, the nature of the enterprises with which he is charged."
1961.69,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1708.438,1709.392,"Oh, the bank robbery?"
1961.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1793.249,1796.494,Ms. Cooper.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,1796.494,1798.464,May it please the Court.
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1878.559,1881.726,"The answer -- I'm sorry I didn't get it, he answered to the same charges?"
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,1881.726,1882.503,"Oh, yes."
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1882.503,1884.514,Thank you.
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1884.514,1890.301,"What were the proceedings that you've mentioned Ms. Cooper, just what were the proceedings?"
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,1890.301,1892.005,As far as the District Judge's conservation --
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1892.005,1896.472,If -- you may not -- an arraignment I suppose of (Voice Overlap) --
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,1896.472,1897.622,"Oh, yes, I'm -- oh -- before --"
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1897.622,1898.129,-- but the --
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,1898.129,1900.776,"Yes, I'm coming to that."
1961.69,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1946.377,1948.649,Didn't you he testified against the Government?
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,1951.603,1951.994,Yes.
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1956.414,1965.507,"Now what is the bearing of those three items or episodes in relation to these subsequent, these present claims."
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,1973.516,1979.938,"Well, personal observation -- the judge's own personal observations of the petitioner's --"
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1979.938,1981.041,Were that of the (Voice Overlap) --

1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,1982.735,1983.779,-- assurances.
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1983.779,1988.745,He gets some judgment regarding the prisoner's -- petitioner's intelligence?
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,1988.745,1989.378,That is true.
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1989.378,1994.761,"The capacity to apprehend, his strength of character, and things like that."
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,1994.761,1997.461,Yes.
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2042.338,2048.614,"Ms. Cooper, you mean Schumann & McCullar (ph) or some other counsel?"
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2048.614,2049.855,"Yes, Schumann & McCullar (ph)."
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2049.855,2050.766,Schumann & McCullar (ph).
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2050.766,2051.714,I think --
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2051.714,2053.484,They were counsels of his choice.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2053.484,2053.731,Yes.
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2053.731,2055.289,He retained them?
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2055.289,2055.775,Yes.
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2055.775,2059.094,Evidently ceased them.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2059.094,2059.427,Yes.
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2183.942,2184.863,65?
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2184.863,2191.954,"50 -- 55 and 56 of the record, Number 69."
1961.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2566.595,2568.754,"That was reaffirmed just yesterday, wasn't it?"
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2568.754,2574.329,"Yes sir, it was, in the (Inaudible) case."
1961.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2574.329,2583.27,Has the petitioner in any of his papers asserted these?
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2583.27,2593.493,"Not to my knowledge Your Honor, no."
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2761.244,2762.489,Who were -- Ms. Cooper.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2762.489,2763.121,"Yes.,"
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2763.121,2768.933,"Suppose this went to a hearing, who were the potential witnesses?"
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2777.03,2783.227,As far as the allegations would allege they would be the only witnesses.
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2783.743,2783.969,So the --
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2783.969,2785.556,-- petitioners does not in a --
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2785.556,2786.315,The judge?
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2786.315,2786.59,Yes.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2786.59,2788.456,"Judge, yes."
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2788.456,2816.26,So the -- the only other material with the court that the judgment gets in regard to this charge is to get the same -- to get the statement of the U.S. Attorney and the petitioner respectively under oath and subject to possible and all the power and process of cross-examination which would break down to a week.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2824.208,2824.885,Yes.
1961.69,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2824.885,2833.702,I mean translating in to what would happen into actuality instead of just abstract speculation and fanciful taking.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2833.702,2836.0,Yes Your Honor.
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2836.0,2861.727,I suppose Ms. Cooper also though there might be some other witnesses in connection with the letters that the man said he wrote to the Attorney General and to the judge for instance of the -- if he said he gave them to the warden in the prison and they were lost some place in transit and they developed that he did actually do it.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2869.436,2879.615,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe he specifically alleges that the names of those witnesses in his affidavit is there might be --"
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2879.615,2881.723,"So that he wouldn't have to and that's evidentiary, isn't it?"
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2896.337,2917.35,I don't say that he has to name the -- no Your Honor but the -- he has to provide details to the extent that it would make his motion meet the requirements of the Section that the -- the allegations must be --
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2917.35,2918.675,May I ask you this question.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2940.183,2943.011,"On the same records, Your Honor?"
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2943.011,2943.501,Yes.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2943.501,2943.734,On the same --
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2943.734,2944.794,Yes.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2957.01,2974.75,"Well, Your Honor that might be a harder case than this but we think that the record itself in this case is the presumption of regularity quite apart from the personal knowledge of the judge."
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2974.75,2981.606,"Well, I was wondering how could the record show anything about these letters."
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3009.036,3009.709,He alleged --
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3009.709,3013.073,To the extent to deny him a hearing.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3013.073,3019.003,As I've said Your Honor that would be a harder case.
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3019.003,3040.827,"It isn't a question whether it's a harder case, that wasn't your -- would he be entitled to -- would the judge be entitled to say in most circumstances, on the records, files and documents shown conclusively that he's not entitled to a hearing and is denied or would he be obliged to give him a hearing?"
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3040.827,3049.056,I think Your Honor that each case would have to be considered on the basis of the files and in records.
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3051.772,3056.763,Well I've talked about these files and these records but to another judge.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3056.763,3064.911,"To another judge, it's presumably the letter to the judge is a part of the files and records."
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3070.216,3071.166,"No, there are no records."
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3075.061,3076.309,There is one letter there.
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3076.309,3076.622,Yes.
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3113.297,3133.412,"Well, Your Honor I certainly think the strange judge would have to take into consideration everything within the files and record and/or as to whether or not in that case, particular case, he would be required to grant him a hearing."
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3135.864,3136.353,Well I don't (Voice Overlap) --
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3136.353,3139.305,The totality of the circumstances is so important.
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3145.635,3165.352,"Well Ms. Cooper I don't want to be persistent but I'll tell you just why I asked that, I wonder if this man is being denied a hearing in this case just because the judge says I've had experiences with this man."
1961.69,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3215.495,3217.616,"Well, no Your Honor."
1961.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3288.044,3288.374,Mr. Reitz.
1961.69,2,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,3288.374,3290.921,May I just add one more word Mr. Chief Justice.
1961.69,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3303.123,3303.874,He -- who?
1961.69,2,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,3303.874,3309.414,Defense counsel to find out why it was in a brief span of days.
1961.69,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3342.382,3346.173,Are there any affidavits from former counsel in the case?
1961.69,2,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,3346.173,3346.747,No Your Honor.
1961.69,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3356.165,3360.321,"He would have won the case, he would get a new trial, wouldn't he?"
1961.69,2,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,3360.321,3360.837,Yes sir.
1961.69,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3362.458,3365.651,Did he deny -- has he denied his guilt?
1961.69,2,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,3365.651,3371.227,To my knowledge here Your Honor there's nothing in the record affirmatively denying it or admitting it.
1961.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3371.227,3381.716,"Well Mr. Reitz you mean if not a thief, just one is a case where you're representing him here."
1961.69,2,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,3383.155,3384.291,We'd get the hearing and that's (Voice Overlap) --
1961.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3384.291,3385.238,All you'd get would be a hearing.
1961.69,2,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,3385.238,3388.004,I thought Mr. Justice Black might be one of the hearing.
1961.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3388.004,3388.336,Yes.
1961.69,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3388.336,3389.132,And that was held.
1961.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3389.132,3391.574,"But all you seek here is a hearing, is that right?"
1961.69,2,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,3391.574,3392.023,That's right.
1961.69,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3400.168,3402.097,But the judge did.
1961.69,2,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,3402.097,3404.359,I would think that's further testimony by the district judge.
1961.69,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3404.359,3406.345,(Inaudible)
1961.69,2,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,3406.345,3409.453,"It's in his memorandum, yes Your Honor."
1961.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3409.453,3410.117,Very well.
