2004.03-377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.166,"We'll hear argument next in No. 03-377, the Koons Buick Pontiac v. Bradley Nigh."
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,53.87,55.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,205.252,206.571,Can I interrupt you right there?
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,206.571,207.564,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,207.564,212.804,What did the word subparagraph describe in the 1974 statute?
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,212.804,214.745,It... it described subparagraph (A).
2004.03-377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,214.745,216.314,Subparagraph (A).
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,216.314,216.769,Yes.
2004.03-377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,216.769,217.429,Okay.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,217.429,217.967,And I'll explain--
2004.03-377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,217.967,218.915,"That's the small (a), isn't it?"
2004.03-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.915,219.658,Capital (A).
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,220.567,220.939,--That's capital.
2004.03-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,220.939,224.095,Which had... which had two... two subparts--
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,224.095,225.664,"Not in '74, Your Honor."
2004.03-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,226.49,227.15,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,227.605,229.174,--In 1976--
2004.03-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,229.174,230.743,After the amendment in '76--
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,230.743,231.32,--Correct.
2004.03-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,231.32,232.146,--it described the--
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,232.146,232.972,Precisely correct.
2004.03-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,277.31,281.48,Was it ever challenged or was this just a common assumption?
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,282.24,282.983,"--Well, there are--"
2004.03-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.983,283.809,--Was that issue litigated?
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,283.809,296.979,"--Your Honor, there are a number of... of cases that applied it presumably to plaintiffs if they thought they had an argument, would have liked to argue they could have gotten more than $1,000, but there... there are a bunch of cases we've cited in our brief that... that show that that was the consistent interpretation."
2004.03-377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,296.979,298.215,Let me just be sure.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,312.871,314.895,"Correct, actually clauses, Your Honor, but that's correct, yes."
2004.03-377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,314.895,315.388,All right.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,315.388,326.822,"What then happened in 1995... and this... the actual enactment appears in the blue brief at page 10, footnote 6, and this is also I think important."
2004.03-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.288,429.899,"Well, Mr. Ayer, if I just read the statutory language as it appears now, the impression I get is that the language in capital (A), little (ii), except that the liability, just applies to little (ii)."
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,440.756,444.843,"Well, Your Honor, we... we have... and... and your reasoning... and I'll... and I'll expand on it slightly."
2004.03-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.876,496.195,May... may I stop you at that point?
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,506.432,506.803,--Correct.
2004.03-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.803,514.977,Had you introduced... have you argued before the Fourth Circuit those drafting manuals?
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,514.977,515.514,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.867,602.328,"The problem I have, Mr. Ayer, is I don't... I can accept your belief that... that subparagraph refers to all of (A) and yet still agree with the respondent here or with the court below because what... what limits the... the phrase, shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000... what limits it to subpart (2) is not the word subparagraph but rather the fact that it is an exception only to (2)."
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,607.445,608.105,Right.
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.105,620.548,"--The liability under (ii) is a liability under this subparagraph, and the exception to little (ii) is only an exception to little (ii)."
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,639.934,642.906,"Well, now, that was a bit... all of that was true prior to 1995."
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,642.906,651.823,"--Well, that may be, but now you're... now you're relying on... on the... on the statutory history argument rather than on the mere meaning of the word subparagraph."
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,658.76,659.791,It refers to a section with a capital (A).
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.791,662.104,Refers to all... all of (A).
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,662.104,662.426,Okay.
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,662.426,681.051,"But when that phrase is used in an except clause that only applies to little (ii), it... it still says the... the foregoing liability under this subparagraph, that is, the liability contained in little (ii)--"
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,681.051,681.489,Let me go--
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.489,683.402,--which is a liability under this subparagraph.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,683.857,685.26,"--Well, it is, Your Honor."
2004.03-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,731.539,749.622,"--But even if we don't accept that... and I... if you're going to reach this, I... I don't want to spoil your sequence, but even if we don't accept the Rosetta stone, in order to get to the... to the position below, you've got to read subparagraph to refer to what we would normally call a clause."
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,749.622,749.993,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,798.207,814.471,"But that convention, it seems to me, is much less strong than the fact that you don't read a word to mean one thing for purposes of one part of the... of the whole paragraph and another thing for the purposes of the rest."
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,820.498,822.439,"Well, I mean, I think that that's the next thing--"
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.439,825.123,And that is simply a flat contradiction.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,825.123,825.389,--Well--
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,825.389,831.788,And... and the... the reading given by the court below produced no flat contradiction in the terms of the statute.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,831.788,834.184,"--Well, it... it flatly contradicted the standing meaning of the word subparagraph."
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.503,839.961,No... no contradiction within... within the statute itself.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,839.961,840.35,Well--
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.35,849.909,"It may have given what you call the Rosetta stone a different meaning, but it did not produce a... a contradiction in the terminology of the statute, whereas yours does."
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,858.333,869.228,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that the principle or the canon that the specific controls the general is one that... that Your Honor set forth in the... in the Casey case, and many other cases have asserted it."
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.148,891.398,It isn't straightforward.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,899.693,900.231,Only if--
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.231,911.005,"--you're urging that one interpretation is better than another, and if there were an unavoidable conflict, I would agree that (iii) would... would overrule (ii), but it is not necessary to read (ii) that way."
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,911.005,917.626,"--What you have to do, Your Honor, to take the approach that the court below took is ignore the established meaning of the word subparagraph."
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.774,958.393,I don't want to have to go through the... the legends of the... of the legislative process every time I read a statute.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,960.622,961.365,I thought Your Honor was--
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.365,964.503,--it seems to me that I should interpret it the way it is written.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,975.937,977.352,"--Well, I mean--"
2004.03-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.352,979.531,It's not my job to correct their mistakes.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,979.531,990.798,"--Again, I... I... all I can say is that it... it seems to me that we really do need to look at the meaning of the word subparagraph at the time it was enacted by Congress."
2004.03-377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.913,1024.978,"May I ask you, Mr. Ayer, does your opponent agree that prior to the 1995 amendment, the word subparagraph in the (ii) part of (2)(A) referred to (i) as well as (ii)?"
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1024.978,1028.321,I am not positive if they do agree with that.
2004.03-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1037.405,1040.56,Could we talk about the facts of this case?
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1046.693,1047.147,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1047.147,1053.464,And the limit there would be twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with it--
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1053.464,1054.085,Correct.
2004.03-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1054.085,1056.647,--Unless the except provision applies.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1056.647,1057.057,That is correct.
2004.03-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1057.057,1058.998,And what would that dollar amount be here?
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1058.998,1064.487,"Well, that... that dollar amount in this case... and... and the judgment as it now stands is over $24,000."
2004.03-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1065.602,1069.772,"And you argue that the limitation is $1,000."
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1069.772,1070.06,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1093.632,1109.153,"What about the argument that this drafting manual that you're relying on for the meaning of paragraph, subparagraph, clause wasn't... what was the year it was published?"
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1109.153,1110.434,"--Well, there... there are two, Your Honor."
2004.03-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1129.094,1134.667,Because the argument is that these manuals came out after this TILA statute.
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1134.667,1135.204,"--Right, Your Honor."
2004.03-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1269.118,1282.531,Would there be any conceivable reason why Congress would have wanted a higher damages award for hard-to-detect misconduct of the type under little (i)?
2004.03-377,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1282.531,1286.868,"Your Honor, I mean, there's a lot of speculation in a number of the briefs."
2004.03-377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1377.747,1379.029,"Very well, Mr. Ayer."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1381.008,1386.542,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2004.03-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1405.406,1413.497,"Well, what... what do you think the term, this subparagraph, meant before 1995?"
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1413.497,1418.038,"Justice O'Connor, I'm not certain what it meant."
2004.03-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1419.319,1426.128,Do you agree that the courts had interpreted it to apply to both little (i) and (ii)?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1426.128,1436.121,"--I agree that that's what the opinions in the Dryden and the Mars case said, but I would point out that in both of those cases that was not the issue before the Court."
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1452.113,1456.099,"Well, isn't the difficulty with that... that the point that I raised with Mr. Ayer?"
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1499.112,1502.789,"--Well, the answer is this subparagraph."
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1509.477,1510.098,"Well, no."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1525.33,1530.449,"Well, the... the answer I believe is in... is in the context of the statute."
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1538.251,1541.344,"Well, the... you can look at that either way, it seems to me."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1559.92,1565.288,"I would disagree with you because of the language, the word or."
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1571.565,1573.34,That's... that's the argument for your reading.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1580.232,1585.312,"--You have to understand that... that all three of these are very, very different."
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1589.808,1591.006,"Well, but wait a minute on that."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1593.318,1598.89,"--Before 1995, there weren't... there was not the section regarding the home mortgages."
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.89,1602.977,"I understand, but it was my understanding... you correct me if I'm... you say there are just two cases."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1623.017,1626.648,I don't think you should accept it as a starting point because of the history.
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.431,1647.354,"You don't think this issue would... if there was a serious question about that, you don't think that there would have been a single case that would have arisen between 1974 and 1995 that made the... that gave this interpretation to... I want to call it... clause (i) and clause (ii)?"
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1649.128,1655.361,--History suggests that most of those cases that came up... and if you look at them... in the early years were the technical cases.
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1660.646,1663.701,"They couldn't have involved more than $1,000 if people read the statute the way I read it."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1677.158,1683.02,"--That... that was the assumption that was made at that point, and the Fourth Circuit followed that assumption."
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.02,1685.703,That that applied only to clause (ii)?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1687.023,1687.306,No.
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.482,1692.103,Right.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1692.103,1705.849,"But that was an assumption, and as... and as Judge Luttig pointed out, that was the assumption of the Fourth Circuit at the time, but when it got a new piece of evidence, when the statute was amended and added (iii), it explained clearly that the assumption was debunked."
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.849,1713.651,"Do you think your position would have even been plausible before (iii) was added, if the word subparagraph meant only clause (ii)?"
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1713.651,1714.394,"Yes, I do."
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1716.789,1721.331,"So, in other words, if that's right, I guess when I go get a mortgage... this is before."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1738.543,1739.286,--No.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1743.706,1744.57,"No, no."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1745.852,1746.678,Under (i) there's--
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1746.678,1746.945,Before.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1747.671,1748.247,--That's correct.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1748.247,1748.702,What was it?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1748.702,1750.083,"It's $25,000."
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1755.368,1758.844,"So the maximum amount financed on my house was $1,000,000."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1777.287,1777.842,--No.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1779.971,1781.374,Didn't apply to mortgages at all?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1781.374,1781.746,No.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1782.368,1782.906,Okay. That's the answer.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1787.381,1788.457,--Correct.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1788.457,1790.232,And closed-end mortgages fall under (iii).
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1790.232,1791.262,Second mortgages.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1791.262,1791.922,Second.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1795.954,1797.412,"Well, it's a closed-end."
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1797.412,1798.034,All right.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1801.006,1803.606,They... no.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1805.58,1805.88,No.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1811.331,1811.907,That's correct--
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1811.907,1815.418,"So if it's under an open credit plan, i.e., a home equity mortgage, it's under (i)."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1815.418,1816.077,--Correct.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1816.077,1816.737,Correct.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1828.504,1829.535,No.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1830.816,1831.559,Because?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1831.559,1834.615,"--in that it would not have applied to over $25,000 at the time."
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1834.615,1835.108,Under (i).
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1839.194,1839.649,Right.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1839.649,1840.309,Okay.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1840.309,1843.076,Subsection (iii) was a completely different set to deal with the--
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1843.076,1849.985,"I'm trying to figure out what the range is on your reading under (i), and what I... I've been telescoping my questions."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1861.857,1863.222,"--No, no."
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1863.222,1863.305,No.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1865.329,1864.42,The amount financed.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1883.739,1883.989,Okay.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1884.936,1894.967,"Petitioner argues that the term subparagraph, as used in TILA, always... always... means the capital letter."
2004.03-377,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1900.623,1901.905,I don't believe they said always.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1913.672,1915.613,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.112,1943.765,Does this appear somewhere in the papers?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1943.765,1944.713,--No.
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.366,1946.821,But you're citing them.
2004.03-377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.421,1952.393,What are you reading from?
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.393,1953.469,He's... nothing.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1953.469,1957.017,"From... from the statute itself, 1637a."
2004.03-377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.017,1959.042,And where is that in the briefs?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1959.042,1963.555,It is not in the... it is cited in a footnote to support the proposition that--
2004.03-377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.555,1964.986,Where is the footnote?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1964.986,1966.472,--It is on page 23.
2004.03-377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1966.472,1967.808,It's just cited.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,1969.361,1970.02,No.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2002.692,2003.047,All right.
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.276,2005.542,Wait.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2007.96,2012.501,It proves that it clearly could not be referring to the capital letter (C).
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.359,2015.474,"No, because (C) doesn't do anything."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2015.474,2016.855,--(C) doesn't have any requirements.
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.855,2017.936,"Just read it... read it once more, would you?"
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2017.936,2018.308,Certainly.
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2026.192,2027.185,It couldn't be under (C).
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2027.39,2028.133,It couldn't be possible.
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2030.695,2040.559,"Yes, but it is true if you look at that footnote... is it not correct, though, looking at that footnote, that the statute does repeatedly use a capital letter to describe what is clearly a subparagraph?"
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2040.559,2042.334,"--Well, there are... I agree with that."
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2059.014,2064.177,"In other words, you're saying the... we should read this as though it said, under this subparagraph (2)(A)(ii)."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2064.177,2066.983,"If it said that, I don't think we'd have a dispute here."
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2068.219,2070.447,--The difficulty that I'd like you to... for me.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2136.457,2141.946,"Well, the Fourth Circuit looked at that, and they looked at the language on how it was going to work together."
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.808,2168.656,You're--
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2168.656,2169.361,--thinking it's--
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.361,2170.021,--you're getting back to the language.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2184.882,2186.368,Well--
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.368,2188.141,Is there no reason why it would make sense?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2188.141,2188.968,--There's only one limit.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.787,2200.734,--What do you mean there's no limit on (iii)?
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.963,2203.418,Right.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2203.418,2204.821,"--Right, but it's not a limit to anything."
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.354,2230.75,"Yes, but he's asking what the purpose of this would be for these mortgages, you know, which is a pretty big deal, a mortgage, you know, really putting a lot at risk when you get into a mortgage."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2248.127,2248.954,--Okay.
2004.03-377,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2274.178,2274.361,May I stop you there?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2280.661,2282.23,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, you can."
2004.03-377,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2285.984,2290.32,So all... all these cases are cases in which you couldn't prove any actual damages.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2290.32,2305.181,"Well, the problem is that it's very difficult to prove actual damages under the Federal Truth in Lending Act because there is that requirement that you go and show that you could have gone somewhere else and gotten a better deal, which by the time the consumer comes to the lawyer, that time has passed."
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2315.128,2315.667,All right.
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.608,2319.094,Didn't you get actual damages in this case?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2319.094,2320.208,I'm sorry.
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.208,2322.066,Didn't you get actual damages in this case?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2322.066,2323.84,"No, Justice Stevens, we did not."
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2325.948,2328.753,--Start from your own analysis.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2376.762,2379.651,I disagree that there are no limitations.
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2398.766,2409.706,"Well, they do... they happen to be right at this moment in the business climate, but that is not the characteristic climate in which this act has operated over the years and presumably will operate again as interest rates start their way back up."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2409.706,2413.338,"But the... the cap is the amount of the finance charges, the total amount of the finance charges."
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2432.535,2443.348,"Well, but there's a cap, but he's still going to get more money than he would be if exactly this same kind of behavior had taken place with respect to the financing of a mortgage on a half a million dollar house."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2443.348,2444.713,I... I disagree.
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2444.713,2445.206,That's strange.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2445.206,2452.143,"I... I disagree with that analysis because under subsection (4), you're going to be able to go back and demand rescission."
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2457.865,2472.438,"Well, but getting all of your money back is... is presumably going to make you whole so far as the transaction is concerned, and we have to assume that allowing the transaction under (i) is going to keep you whole so far as the transaction is concerned."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2493.836,2497.701,"Well, in... in this case, in Mr. Nigh's case, he was not made whole."
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2513.199,2513.488,No.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2532.518,2542.959,"--Well, under the Truth in Lending Simplification Act of 1980, Congress came back and put a number of limits on (i) that did not apply to (iii), but do apply to (i)."
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.881,2624.776,"Mr. Blankingship, I thought that part of your response to Justice Souter would have been that there's nothing anomalous about imposing a dollar limit on massive transactions and not imposing a dollar limit on smaller transactions, that that is precisely what you would expect Congress to do."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2634.436,2635.362,I would agree.
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2635.362,2648.349,"But if that is the answer, you're still left with the situation, as I understand it, in which the recovery under the small loan is going to be potentially in, I suppose, many cases practically bigger than the recovery under the large loan."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2650.783,2655.324,"It... it is possible there are, but there are so many different variables."
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2658.38,2660.897,"Of course, in (ii), it's... it's covered."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2670.435,2672.747,"Of the amount due on the lease, yes."
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2672.747,2673.202,Yes.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2673.202,2673.74,It's a little bit different.
2004.03-377,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2673.74,2686.205,"So it... so it's... so you'd have to say Congress wanted to impose a limit on these small (ii) $25,000 or less transactions, but they didn't want to impose any limit on the small (i) $25,000 or under transactions."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2687.774,2691.034,"Well, I think that's... that's potentially right."
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2709.118,2722.902,"Let me... let me ask you a question which you are free to decline to answer because it... it rests upon an assumption that you don't make but the Fourth Circuit did make, and if you say, look, I don't want to defend the Fourth Circuit on this, okay with me."
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.902,2723.812,Don't answer.
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2724.283,2724.926,The--
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2724.926,2727.072,I think I know where you're going too.
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2727.072,2727.898,--the Fourth--
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.898,2729.756,I've never heard counsel refuse to answer.
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2732.562,2734.42,--The... not refuse to answer.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2804.887,2819.664,"Well, I... I think in the United Bank v. Wolas case, where the Court held that the fact that Congress may not have foreseen the consequences of a statutory enactment is not a sufficient reason for refusing to give effect to its plain meaning, is... is probably the answer to the question."
2004.03-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.007,2823.667,That's not the answer.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2849.962,2852.729,And that's... I absolutely--
2004.03-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2852.729,2855.042,"If this is an express repeal, you win."
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2855.618,2858.014,Let... let me just make sure I understand.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2870.29,2874.854,--I'm not sure I understand the question.
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2874.854,2886.826,"Did the... did the 1995 enactment, which added clause (iii), did that change the preexisting meaning of (i) and (ii)?"
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2886.826,2890.253,"Yes, by its... by its language, by its introduction."
2004.03-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.253,2896.485,"So then you're agreeing that prior to the 1995 amendment, your opponent's reading of... of (i) and (ii) would have been correct."
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2896.485,2902.058,I would agree that that's what the law was and that's what had been stated before.
2004.03-377,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2906.395,2911.429,Is it relevant that all that Congress did was added (iii)?
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2915.227,2915.804,--No.
2004.03-377,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2934.73,2938.262,So Congress basically left (i) or (i) and (ii) alone.
2004.03-377,1,15585,a_hugo_blankingship,,2938.262,2943.63,"--They did leave them alone, as they have in... in a lot of these amendments."
