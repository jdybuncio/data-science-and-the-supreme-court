1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.236,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-6465, Ray Lewis v. United States."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,14.552,18.023,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-6465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,62.364,67.768,But wouldn't be if the counts were split up into two separate prosecutions.
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,67.768,69.851,"That is correct, Justice Ginburg... Ginsburg."
1995.95-6465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,69.851,81.378,"So if we accept your view in order to make anything but sort of a farcical rule we would have to, I suppose, have a rule of compulsory joinder."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,81.378,83.75,"I disagree with that, with all respect, Justice Souter."
1995.95-6465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,101.892,103.792,"Well, it may, it may not."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,141.816,145.669,I continue to disagree with that view.
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.559,181.092,"You, at any rate, are not arguing for a compulsory joinder rule along with your view of the jury trial requirement."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,181.092,182.604,"I am not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-6465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.23,212.097,"Mr. Statsinger, how does your... how does the rule you're urging square with the proposition that you cannot avoid jury trial requirement by committing that you will not ask for a sentence of more than 6 months?"
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,226.264,227.844,"No, you cannot, Justice Souter."
1995.95-6465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.844,233.248,"Now, why would that be consistent with the rule that you're urging here?"
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,242.114,246.317,"The two positions are entirely consistent, Justice Souter, for this reason--"
1995.95-6465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,246.317,248.96,"He's Souter, I'm Scalia."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,248.96,249.651,"--I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-6465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,250.499,251.94,You have paid me a great compliment.
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,252.782,254.152,With that proposition I agree.
1995.95-6465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.152,255.434,Our jurisprudence is very similar.
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,260.375,283.141,"Justice Scalia, the two propositions are not in conflict, and the reason is because the way this Court has defined criminal seriousness for jury trial purposes is by looking at the authorized penalty regardless of whether it's the authorized penalty for a single serious offense or for the aggregate authorized penalty of petty offenses."
1995.95-6465,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,292.838,302.144,"Well, so then it's not just the power of the judge that you're concerned with, it's the dignitary or the interest or the stigma that's attached to the crime."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,302.144,305.486,--That is a component of this as well.
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.051,332.715,But that's not the way our cases have interpreted it.
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,341.988,359.241,"That is true, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the important distinction between the Court's prior cases and this case was that in each of those cases the defendant was only being tried on a single count, so in a sense the question never arose in those cases, but it is our position that--"
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,359.241,364.545,So you say there's a lot worse stigma being convicted of two counts than one?
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,364.545,374.93,"--It may not be a lot, Mr. Chief Justice, but I believe that there is some, and I... again, I... this is not our exclusive justification for this."
1995.95-6465,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,378.083,385.879,"That has to be your principal justification if the judge says, or the prosecution says at the outset that 6 months is the maximum."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,393.984,401.408,"Well, we are left with the stigma, and we are left with the possibility of an unfair or an unjust conviction in the first place."
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.743,430.339,"Well, but if that's logical, why did the Court ever say that a jury trial doesn't carry over to misdemeanors?"
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,435.041,440.414,The Court... the Court did that for two reasons.
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.373,485.535,"Well, why do you say regardless of the promise?"
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,485.535,492.559,I say that because the relevant measure of criminal seriousness has always been what is authorized rather than what is actually imposed.
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.559,497.231,"Well, so you say the sentencing consequences, and it is quite an abstract thing."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,502.424,503.947,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-6465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.756,528.923,"And the reason for that was, as we've said in recent cases, the judiciary should not substitute its judgment as to seriousness for that of a legislature, which is far better equipped to perform the task."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,551.538,562.324,"Justice Scalia, the legislative judgment that we are discussing is embodied in section 3584(a), which authorizes consecutive sentences on multiple counts."
1995.95-6465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.639,567.84,I see.
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,567.84,575.884,"--consecutive sentences, and that it reflects a judgment that the commission of multiple offenses is a more serious transgression than the commission of a single offense."
1995.95-6465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,639.725,646.511,"Mr. Statsinger, I have a question... I don't know whether it goes to standing, but this sentence here was probation, right?"
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,659.4,663.892,I don't think it is a standing question.
1995.95-6465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,710.112,712.952,It sounds like the kind of determination that lawyers might make instead of the clients.
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,714.344,715.967,--I don't believe it was the case--
1995.95-6465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.967,716.124,Yes.
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,716.124,716.925,--in this case.
1995.95-6465,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,716.925,731.135,"Perhaps you'll argue that this is quite irrelevant either way, but I have no sense of how burdensome this rule that you propose would be on all of the State courts."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,752.238,756.672,"The answer, Justice Kennedy, is that this would not be a burdensome rule."
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.338,781.39,But that doesn't go to the State court situation that Justice Kennedy was asking about.
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,781.39,785.543,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but I have looked at that as well."
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.345,807.546,"We're talking about 17 or 20, I guess."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,807.546,811.069,"Roughly 17 or 20, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,831.201,835.034,"Yes, but this... no one is saying here that Duncan should be changed."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,842.368,850.305,"--I agree that it is a fair question, Mr. Chief Justice, but I believe that the answer to the question is that it will not have a tremendous impact on the States."
1995.95-6465,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,850.305,864.954,"Well, it seems to me likely that it will, because 6 months is a fairly common cutoff point for petty offenses, and it seems to me quite ordinary, quite frequent for prosecutions to charge more than one petty offense."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,864.954,892.533,"Even if it is, Justice Kennedy, the possible consequences to a defendant who has a large number of 6-month offenses stacked up are severe indeed, so severe we believe as to trigger what the Sixth Amendment was intended to do, which is to protect defendants who are facing serious consequences from the potential abuse of power that the Framers saw in a bench trial."
1995.95-6465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,905.01,912.405,"I suppose you're arguing that the larger the number, the more important it is to vindicate the right."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,912.405,916.198,"I don't need to argue that, Justice Stevens--"
1995.95-6465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,916.198,916.499,"Yes, that's your point."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,916.779,942.126,"--but it may well be right, certainly with respect to what the Sixth Amendment really means and the core values that it contains, a society in which large numbers of defendants are subject to many years... and the Government would concede that there's no limit, potentially unlimited exposure... that those are exactly the kinds of cases that the Sixth Amendment is supposed to cover, and that--"
1995.95-6465,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,942.126,950.01,"Well, but you argue that there's no right, even if there's an agreement in advance, undertaking in advance to limit the sentence."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,950.01,954.964,"--I do agree with that, and again, I say so for two reasons."
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.238,1041.411,"Except Codispoti, there was no limit on the sentence for contempt, was there?"
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1041.411,1044.053,There was no limit on the sentence for contempt.
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.053,1046.026,"Then it really isn't on all fours, is it?"
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1046.026,1055.971,"Mr. Chief Justice, it's on all fours on the preliminary question of whether the prosecution was serious enough to trigger the jury-trial right in the first place."
1995.95-6465,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1085.31,1099.561,"Well, except that if our guideline is for determining seriousness what the legislature determines is serious, then Codispoti has no relevance for us, because the legislature hadn't made that determination."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1099.561,1125.767,"--It does, Justice O'Connor, because the Court has repeatedly said that the actual sentencing decision in a contempt case represents the identical judgment to the legislative judgment in a statutory offense case, so it is our view that in a sense the Court has turned to the sentence imposed, actually imposed in contempt cases as a substitute for the legislator's judgment, but the court has always viewed them as equivalents."
1995.95-6465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1125.767,1138.215,"Add that in Codispoti each individual sentence was for less than 6 months, so when you combine that with Blanton, you have a series of 6 months offenses."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1139.236,1140.137,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-6465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.137,1144.518,"All right, so that's... and... go ahead."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1146.041,1146.561,"Oh, yes."
1995.95-6465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1209.002,1225.573,"--Maybe I should ask, because the thing that I find difficult with Codispoti is, it seems to me that Codispoti's... you have cases that stand for the proposition if you have more than a major... minor offense, you have to have a jury, all right, and here we have only minor offenses."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1234.749,1235.748,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-6465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1235.748,1243.885,"All right, so why isn't the obvious answer to that here, well, the Constitution forbids your client from being punished by more than 6 months."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1247.227,1270.032,"Well, the Court... certainly the Court has never held that in the context of statutory offenses, even though it has in the context of contempt cases, and I think one problem with that is that it would have the, in a sense, perverse result of granting a broader Sixth Amendment right to contempt cases than for statutory offense cases."
1995.95-6465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1270.032,1275.185,Why?
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1275.185,1285.991,Because the contempt cases where the counts were... the contempt cases where the counts were stacked would always trigger a jury-trial right unless there was such a promise.
1995.95-6465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1285.991,1288.054,There need be no promise.
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1302.673,1309.108,"I see your point, Justice Breyer."
1995.95-6465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1333.622,1335.155,To Codispoti.
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1335.155,1343.54,"--Aside from that, I'm not sure how that rule could be squared with a rule that would say, in any case, whether it be for a felony or a string of misdemeanors--"
1995.95-6465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.54,1345.23,No.
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1369.356,1371.339,--That is an excellent response to that.
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1446.687,1459.744,"Well, that might be persuasive if the reason bench trials were reversed here was because there was no evidence to support the judgment conviction, but I take it that's not what you're saying."
1995.95-6465,0,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,1468.042,1470.472,"--Of course he can, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-6465,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1493.747,1495.688,"Very well, Mr. Statsinger."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1497.871,1501.902,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.452,1549.645,"Of course, it's true that in the examples you give, those would have been separate prosecutions."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1549.645,1552.479,"Those would have been separate prosecutions, Justice Stevens."
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1552.479,1553.057,"Whereas, here you have one prosecution."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1553.057,1554.419,Here you have one prosecution.
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.419,1556.76,And the Constitution refers to prosecution as the test.
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1556.76,1567.426,We believe there's no basis to petitioner's textual argument that the constitutional reference to criminal prosecutions means that the prosecution as a whole is the relevant unit for purposes of the jury-right analysis.
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.94,1636.212,But he argues as a practical matter the prosecution isn't going to do that.
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1640.256,1643.419,"--Well, the joinder rule is discretionary, it's not mandatory."
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1643.419,1649.222,"I understand, but isn't it in 99 and 99/100th percent of the cases of this kind that would be tried jointly?"
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1649.222,1663.542,"I think there are plenty of practical situations in which two offenses perhaps arising, one a couple of months later than the other, might happen to go to trial separately, that individual could have--"
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1663.542,1670.566,"Yes, I know you could give a lot of hypothetical cases, but as a practical matter it's just a waste of time to have two separate trials in a matter like this."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1674.24,1695.604,"--The basic point, though, is that you look not to the prosecutor's decision under Rule 8 whether to join or not to join, but the established methodology for determining which offenses are serious is to look to the legislative assessment of the seriousness of the offense or the offenses, and the prosecutor's decision whether or not to join is not a legislative assessment."
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1701.999,1709.153,But can you not say the legislature has authorized a maximum punishment of 12 months on the facts in this particular prosecution?
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1709.153,1714.006,"No, and that follows on the response that petitioner's counsel gave to Justice Scalia."
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.955,1747.789,"Well, the legislature certainly decided that if these two misdemeanors are tried together, the judge is authorized to impose a sentence of 12 months."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1747.789,1749.792,--The Congress--
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1749.792,1750.223,Is that not correct?
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1750.223,1751.192,--The Congress--
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.192,1752.864,Is that not correct?
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1752.864,1762.061,"--Justice Stevens, I think it's not correct, because 3584 speaks to the situation of multiple crimes without regard to whether they're tried together, whereas petitioner's rule--"
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1762.061,1763.23,"Correct, but it includes the cases the are tried together."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1763.23,1764.742,"--It does, but it includes--"
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1764.742,1768.545,And it does authorize in the cases that are tried together a 12-month sentence.
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1768.545,1786.596,"--I think my point, Justice Stevens, is that because that legislative authorization, 3584, speaks equally to the situation of separate trials and to the situation of trials together, it can't reflect a determination by Congress that the together situation is more serious."
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1786.596,1790.26,"It can't reflect the determination that two misdemeanors are more serious than one, or twice as serious as one?"
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1790.26,1799.887,"That's precisely right, it doesn't reflect that, because the two tried separately, as petitioner concedes, are not subject to the jury right, and therefore that congressional determination--"
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.887,1805.851,"And, of course, they're not subject to it because they're not one prosecution within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1805.851,1830.645,"--Moreover, I would point to this Court's language in Blanton v. Las Vegas, in which the Court pointed to the relevant legislative determination of seriousness as the determination that the legislature includes within the definition of the crime itself that in setting the maximum penalty for the particular offense, it's looking at that offense as the unit and setting the maximum penalty for that offense."
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1830.645,1837.05,"But if you do look at the prosecution as a unit, you could have, I suppose, 10 or 15 misdemeanors joined together in 10 times 6 months in a single prosecution."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1838.713,1839.273,That's our position.
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1839.273,1839.682,Yes.
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1839.682,1840.793,"As a theoretical matter, you could."
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.836,1847.729,Or a prosecution decision to have 10 separate trials instead of one joint trial.
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1847.729,1848.868,That's right.
1995.95-6465,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1848.868,1850.19,Ms. Pillard--
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1898.661,1911.819,"Justice Ginsburg, in the criminal area as well, where a collateral estoppel issue would arise and where the jury right would apply to the separate claims, we believe the same principle would follow."
1995.95-6465,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1979.255,1985.129,"Would the justice of the peace have the authority to send the defendant to prison, though, as opposed to a jail?"
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1985.129,1993.163,"Yes, I believe the justice of the peace would have authority to send an individual up to prison for a period of time."
1995.95-6465,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.163,2003.93,Do you know of any cases where justices of the peace aggregated offenses where you had multiple counts?
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,2003.93,2010.785,We do have cases where the justices of the peace aggregated offenses in the King v. Swallows and Queen v. Mathews.
1995.95-6465,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2016.72,2020.073,"And what were the terms there, the length... the length of--"
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,2020.073,2020.984,--Those were assigned cases.
1995.95-6465,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2044.338,2067.203,"--It does seem to me that if you have multiple crimes with a common modus operandi and they're aggravated so there's a potential of a 5-year sentence, say, even though individually each crime is only 6 months, there is something disturbing about saying the defendant must stand before the judge without the protection of the jury in that case."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,2078.949,2104.289,"It doesn't assume that so much as highlight the focus on not what the rules and the prosecutor and the court do in framing a particular prosecution, but that the focus has always been on what the legislature does, and the legislature doesn't and cannot address the various offenses that might be grouped together in a particular prosecution or might not."
1995.95-6465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2136.97,2139.161,That's what I didn't understand about Codispoti.
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,2149.849,2152.521,We don't think--
1995.95-6465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2152.521,2156.965,"But I... and if that's so, then there'd be a constitutional bar, but I don't know that that is what it meant."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,2161.009,2170.624,--We don't think it makes a constitutional difference whether the ultimate sentence is less than 6 months or whether the promise at the outset of trial--
1995.95-6465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.624,2196.602,"Well, if it's a promise... I mean, there's something rather disturbing about saying anyone of, you know, several thousand magistrates here at some point, or judges or whatever, they're all just going to take it on themselves, and they might say some words, and then we'll get into an argument about what they meant, and... I mean, this whole set of rules, I take it, is a judgemade effort to create a kind of rough order on a common law that was very unrough in terms of the meaning of criminal proceeding."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,2196.602,2197.781,--That's right.
1995.95-6465,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.904,2222.818,"You'd say that there wouldn't be even if was more than 6 months, so long as it just accumulates offenses."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,2222.818,2223.329,That's right.
1995.95-6465,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.429,2231.564,"But even... you'd say even if you're wrong about that, at least where the ultimate sentence is no more than 6 months, the defendant can have no complaint."
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,2231.564,2233.464,"--That's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-6465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2233.464,2234.896,It's at that point I need some help.
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,2247.454,2264.784,"I think the premise of the aggregation theory is that the accused has a right to interpose a jury between himself and a possible prison term of 6 months arising out of a single proceeding, but it requires in order even to reach that question that you're looking at an actual result for the individual defendant."
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.722,2374.109,May I ask you if you have any comment on Justice Kennedy's question of your adversary about how serious a problem this really is?
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,2384.144,2387.448,"I really don't have anything systematic, Justice Stevens."
1995.95-6465,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.415,2415.796,Thank you.
1995.95-6465,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,2415.796,2416.837,If there are no further questions--
1995.95-6465,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2416.837,2419.089,"Thank you, Ms. Pillard."
1995.95-6465,2,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,2421.941,2425.643,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-6465,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2471.061,2489.213,"Do you know whether at common law at the period that would be relevant for us, which would be the time of the founding, that justices committed to prison or to jail as punishments as distinct from simply incarceration awaiting trial?"
1995.95-6465,2,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,2489.213,2503.603,"It is our understanding that... at least, it is now widely accepted historically that common law justices did have the power to send people to the local jail but not to prison."
1995.95-6465,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2503.603,2504.864,In 1791?
1995.95-6465,2,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,2504.864,2509.548,"That's... we don't have a rough sense of the exact years, but I think at this point--"
1995.95-6465,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2509.548,2509.927,"Well, that would matter."
1995.95-6465,2,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,2509.927,2510.348,--Right.
1995.95-6465,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2510.759,2515.851,"I mean, if that developed afterwards, then it wouldn't be comprehended by the Sixth Amendment."
1995.95-6465,2,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,2515.851,2521.655,"--We would be willing to accept that there was the authority, even before--"
1995.95-6465,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2521.655,2525.989,"I know you would be willing to accept it, but do you have any authority to that effect?"
1995.95-6465,2,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,2525.989,2527.168,"--We do not, Justice Souter."
1995.95-6465,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2546.531,2548.963,And what cases do you have for that?
1995.95-6465,2,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,2548.963,2557.709,"--We don't have cases, Justice O'Connor, we have an absence of cases suggesting that the procedure didn't exist."
1995.95-6465,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2574.361,2586.827,"You don't consider relevant to this problem that we have that in the old days, 1791, this would not have been a petty offense, it would have been... this offense would have been a rather serious offense."
1995.95-6465,2,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,2586.827,2589.108,"Oh, I consider that extremely relevant, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.95-6465,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2617.609,2618.571,Suppose a State--
1995.95-6465,2,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,2637.885,2640.666,If that were a legislative determination?
1995.95-6465,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2640.666,2647.08,"Yes, but that if the prosecution had the option, it elected the option to go to another court, that the offenses would be greater."
1995.95-6465,2,41990,steven_m_statsinger,,2648.35,2658.457,"Well, consistent with our view that it is the legislative judgment that is paramount, we would have to defer to the legislative judgment and conclude that in that circumstance there would be no jury trial."
1995.95-6465,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2659.417,2660.25,"Thank you, Mr. Statsinger."
