2011.10-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.42,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1265, Martel v. Clair."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,8.304,12.074,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,65.025,69.41,Was there some way that Clair knew that the court was just about to issue its decision?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,69.41,80.468,"--I think, Your Honor, the only way to be sure was the fact that at some point, as I understand it, the district court judge had announced the day he would be retiring, which would be June 30th of 2005."
2011.10-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,88.056,91.274,"There was a deadline set for all submissions, wasn't there?"
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,91.274,100.966,"There was an initial deadline set for the filing of the briefing, post-evidentiary hearing briefing, and there would be no extensions of time."
2011.10-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,145.66,153.014,"But this petition had something new, the report that his investigator had turned up this evidence."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,153.014,154.699,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-1265,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,178.315,187.503,"There has been some additional litigation regarding this physical evidence since this -- the time of -- of the unsuccessful substitution request, hasn't there been?"
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,187.503,188.486,That's correct.
2011.10-1265,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,188.486,190.872,Could you tell us what has happened with that?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,190.872,191.672,I'm sorry?
2011.10-1265,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,191.672,192.122,I'm sorry.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,194.424,204.546,"The status of that litigation: Once the -- the petition was denied, Mr. Clair filed a notice -- there was a notice of appeal filed by the Federal Public Defender."
2011.10-1265,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,242.421,243.423,That's what I was referring to.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,243.423,243.79,Yes.
2011.10-1265,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,243.79,245.057,And what -- what has happened there?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,248.325,268.138,"There -- there had been -- there has been some testing of the evidence during -- during that time by the Orange County law enforcement in regards to its relationship to the crime, or its relationship to another crime that occurred at that time, which I think that information is set forth in the appendix to the opposition to the petition for certiorari."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,270.407,271.09,I'm sorry.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,274.376,292.604,"--The -- the outcome of -- of the testing is that, to the extent that the testing was done to see if the -- there was any DNA matching between the other murder that had occurred a couple days before and the murder of Ms. Rodgers -- let's see if I can say this succinctly."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,309.482,319.071,"Counsel, as I read your briefs, I think you're making, perhaps, two different arguments."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,326.077,326.611,Okay.
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,326.611,341.004,"Which is, this presentation seems to be that, regardless of what standard we apply to the court of appeals review of what the district court did in denying the motion to substitute counsel, that it was wrong."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,350.192,351.442,"I -- yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,356.677,357.044,All right.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,436.628,436.978,Yes.
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,466.581,468.149,But what does that have to do with
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,485.942,487.108,--I'm sorry--
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,487.108,490.245,He never got an explanation from the Federal defenders.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,490.245,535.624,"--Your Honor, it in fact -- it would be -- it's appropriate -- if the record -- if the allegations of the -- of the Petitioner and the record before the court is sufficient for the court to make the finding that there is in fact no basis for substitution, it is not necessary for the court to go ahead and conduct an inquiry or a hearing or to initiate other further process in the case; and the allegation here which went to the physical evidence in the case from the standpoint of the evidence in this case, and the way this case is prosecuted, and the evidence of Mr. Clair's guilt, the fact that there was additional physical evidence that might be available, simply wouldn't have supported any cognizable claims in the Federal habeas corpus action."
2011.10-1265,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,541.528,543.63,What about a -- a possible Brady claim?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,551.9,567.246,"There I have to -- I think I have to take what the Ninth Circuit says in its opinion about this case, which is what we have here is physical evidence that could be subject to forensic testing now that was not available in 1987."
2011.10-1265,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,587.157,589.759,What about an actual innocence claim?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,589.759,602.167,"Well, an actual innocence claim, I think to begin with, it wouldn't be clear, based on this Court's jurisprudence at the time, that a factual innocence claim would be cognizable in this Federal habeas corpus proceeding."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,626.55,631.519,"You are familiar with 3599(e), aren't you?"
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,631.519,632.438,Yes.
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,632.438,638.175,Which requires counsel to participate in subsequent proceedings.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,638.175,639.592,Yes.
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,639.592,641.044,Of a certain type and limited.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,663.99,666.609,"Actually, Your Honor, yes, it is."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,695.528,697.046,"Oh, but you are presuming you are going to win."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,697.046,697.796,--Excuse me?
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,697.796,699.08,You are presuming you are going to win.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,712.223,734.503,"Well, Your Honor, the -- the point is is that by the time you have reached that juncture, in which the claims have been raised and litigated multiple times in multiple forums, that the need for the type of communication and contact that occurs at the trial and State appellate level is not as essential or necessary at that juncture."
2011.10-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,734.503,752.967,"Suppose -- suppose the public defender had said to the district court what it said to the Ninth Circuit, and that is that the attorney-client relationship has broken down to such an extent that substitution would be appropriate, which wasn't asked."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,765.358,771.862,"Yes, he would have, especially given that the case at that point was completely under submission and simply awaiting for decision."
2011.10-1265,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,786.271,796.31,"If I understand your answers to some of these questions, you are not at all relying on the fact that the district court had made this decision 2 months earlier."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,803.497,805.599,That -- that is correct.
2011.10-1265,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,820.508,826.679,So when is a district court required to engage in some kind of inquiry?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,826.679,844.224,"Well, when the -- when the allegation is made that -- by the petitioner that he has, in fact, been denied what he is entitled to under 3599, which is the appointment and representation by counsel qualified under that statute."
2011.10-1265,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,844.224,858.65,"Well, I -- I was, again assuming as Justice Sotomayor was, that if we're in an interest of justice world, if that's the appropriate standard, when is the district -- when does the district court have to make an inquiry, and what kind of inquiry does he have to make?"
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,858.65,881.416,"The -- the inquiry -- the inquiry would occur when an allegation was made that, for whatever reason, the counsel does not meet the qualifications that are expected to be met, the counsel has a adverse conflict of interest, or counsel has basically reached a point where he is no longer representing or acting as an advocate for--"
2011.10-1265,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,881.416,885.218,"Well, you're -- I thought that that test was an alternative to the interest of justice standard."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,895.257,906.814,"--I think in the context of the Federal habeas corpus action, that is in fact -- in which there is a statutory right to counsel -- that is in fact the interest -- where the interest of justice standard would be."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,908.316,910.283,So this is sort of a made-up standard.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,910.283,911.451,--No--
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,911.451,919.791,Can you point to one case in which this standard has been used by any district court or court of appeals?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,919.791,921.224,"--No, I cannot."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,921.224,931.849,"Can you point to any inquiry by Congress in which such a test was discussed, considered in any way?"
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,931.849,933.115,"No, I cannot."
2011.10-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,933.115,934.884,Where did you get it from?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,934.884,949.976,It's actually analogous to the way this Court over the years has divided up the jurisprudence regarding the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the dividing line between claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and claims of denial of counsel.
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,949.976,967.438,"Well, so what you're suggesting is in noncapital cases, which are less serious, you are going to have a higher bar for a right that the statute gives a judge without any limitation."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,975.376,978.661,"No, we're not in the context of a noncapital habeas."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,994.022,1005.747,"So how about a standard that the courts are used to and one that has a basis in Congress's choice, like interest of justice?"
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1005.747,1019.238,"Well, actually, Your Honor, I think we have in fact, to the extent we are analogizing to what this Court has long done as far as dividing question of Sixth Amendment claims between ineffective assistance of counsel and denial of counsel."
2011.10-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1055.344,1057.013,It doesn't have a fixed meaning.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1106.428,1109.48,That is certainly an aspect of the complaint.
2011.10-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1111.749,1112.366,What's important?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1112.366,1127.109,--What is important here is that the premise of the Ninth Circuit's opinion is that it would be an acceptable motion for substitution for the -- for Mr. Clair to complain or allege disagreements with his counsel about--
2011.10-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1127.109,1130.228,"All right, so what's bothering you is the way they applied it."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1130.228,1131.128,--Well--
2011.10-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1131.128,1138.065,"And they applied it in circumstances that you think -- the district judge actually, his decision was fine."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1153.159,1166.501,"--Yes, our concern, Your Honor, is that the premise of the Ninth Circuit's opinion is -- goes to what the appropriate standard, what the appropriate level of complaint, whatever you want to call it--"
2011.10-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1166.501,1179.561,"So what you really want us to do is to look at the record of the case, go through it, and say, here, whatever words you want to use, the district court acted in his discretion in saying don't change the counsel?"
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1183.696,1184.846,"--Yes, that is -- yes."
2011.10-1265,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.846,1186.065,"Well, no, you don't want that."
2011.10-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1188.916,1189.549,No--
2011.10-1265,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.549,1200.724,"You want us to say the words to be used are the words that we use in deciding whether you have been accorded your constitutional right to counsel, right?"
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1200.724,1203.759,"That's -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1204.909,1207.728,"--I didn't mean literally ""whatever words you use""."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1225.706,1250.573,"--I think the confusion here is caused by the fact that the Ninth Circuit opinion started out by borrowing the phrase ""interest of justice"" and inserting it into a section where -- where it was not inserted, and it would appear to be a deliberate act of Congress to do that, and then it gave it a meaning which we think under any circumstances would be inappropriate in this context."
2011.10-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1250.573,1267.2,"I suppose you don't think that the standard of review is abuse of discretion, because if you do then I suppose you are assuming that the district court has discretion whether to grant the motion or not instead of being confined by a particular standard."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1267.2,1274.355,"Well, abuse of discretion -- if the Court is wrong as a matter of law, of course, it automatically -- I mean, that is an abuse of discretion."
2011.10-1265,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1291.748,1296.202,"Well, but abuse of discretion doesn't mean that the judge operates in a vacuum."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1319.484,1344.283,"Well, Your Honor, the substance -- if we want to call it an interest of justice standard, the substance of it would be that it would not be -- substitution would not be -- it would not be appropriate to move for substitution on the basis of disagreements with counsel about tactical or investigative decisions, such as Mr. Clair did here."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1351.271,1352.655,"Counsel, could I give you an example?"
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1392.529,1395.048,"Qualifications, just the basic--"
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1395.048,1399.783,"Well, this is Seth Waxman, sitting right next to you."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1399.783,1401.635,"--He's undoubtedly qualified, Your Honor."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1401.635,1403.987,I suspect that's the case.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1403.987,1405.67,Otherwise he wouldn't have the appointment.
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1405.67,1414.71,"So beginning of the case, first decision, and defendant comes in and says: Substitute my attorney."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1418.263,1421.198,There are several responses to that.
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1443.062,1446.764,So there are some decisions that the client controls?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1446.764,1451.482,"--There have always been some basic decisions the client makes in any, in any case."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1452.199,1454.784,But that's not abandonment.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1462.79,1472.329,--It is in fact the failure of the lawyer to truly act as an agent for the client at that point.
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1472.329,1479.235,"Well, if I tell my attorney, follow these leads, that's a failure of an agent as well."
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1479.235,1487.839,"It's actually, though -- that is in fact normally always considered to be an area that's within the domain of the attorney."
2011.10-1265,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.364,1526.882,Volunteer issue?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1528.332,1533.886,"--A volunteer issue is when someone says: I do not want to pursue my remedies, I want to simply be executed."
2011.10-1265,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1536.672,1537.238,--You call that a volunteer--
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1537.238,1537.805,We call that a volunteer.
2011.10-1265,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1537.805,1538.274,--Volunteer.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1540.14,1542.659,That's the normal term of art.
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1542.659,1558.768,"Given my example, isn't it the case that under the interest of justice standard there will be situations in which a substitution like the one I just posited would be right, that wouldn't be right under your standard?"
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1558.768,1570.759,"Your Honor, I think that actually our standard would cover what is appropriate for protecting the defendant's statutory right to counsel, and that--"
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1570.759,1576.98,Are you suggesting that for noncapital defendants Congress chose to give them more rather than less?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1576.98,1578.432,"--No, not at all."
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1586.938,1588.371,But you are saying capital have lesser rights.
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1588.371,1597.326,My guess -- I don't think this Court has ever drawn a categorical difference between them in terms of what rights are available to them for purposes of representation by counsel.
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1597.326,1603.997,Isn't delay one of the factors that courts routinely look at under the interest of justice standard?
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1603.997,1604.649,Yes.
2011.10-1265,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1612.069,1618.573,"So we go back to Justice Breyer's point that, even under the interest of justice standard, you are claiming there was an error?"
2011.10-1265,0,44207,ward_campbell,,1618.573,1619.909,Absolutely.
2011.10-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1627.179,1628.013,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1633.232,1635.934,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1265,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1666.154,1667.073,Isn't he always--
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1667.073,1684.851,"So what if last week we get notice from Mr. Clair that he is dissatisfied with his Supreme Court counsel; that communication has broken down; that you plan to argue particular -- present particular arguments, and he doesn't want you to do that."
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1689.753,1704.779,--I think if you have any obligation whatsoever -- and I want to make clear that there are -- these kinds of letters and requests for last minute substitutions happen all the time and in the mine run there may not be any duty of independent inquiry.
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1715.32,1715.803,No.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1737.819,1739.419,"No, of course not."
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1763.751,1764.819,I want to ask you about that.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1774.859,1775.375,No.
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1775.375,1778.813,Then what is the significance of the fact that he was going to retire?
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1778.813,1786.5,The -- the significance of the fact that he -- he hadn't announced that he was going to retire.
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1796.188,1796.857,So you are saying--
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1796.857,1797.874,--that he had previously--
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1797.874,1806.313,"--So you are saying he violated his judicial oath for his own personal convenience, that he failed to do something that you say he should have done, because he was retiring?"
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1806.313,1813.067,--I'm not -- he -- The error would have been the same if he had stayed on the bench for another 10 years.
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1813.067,1817.938,So why do you say six times in your brief that the judge was retiring the next day or retired the next day?
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1817.938,1821.656,Because -- It goes to their complaints with the remedy in the case.
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1828.594,1829.162,There's another judge.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1829.162,1829.779,Yes.
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1829.779,1830.662,There's another judge.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1835.832,1838.534,"Well, I -- I apologize if it gave that impression."
2011.10-1265,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1870.906,1871.356,"--Mr. Waxman, what--"
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1871.356,1873.441,I'm still trying to get to the point -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1876.993,1881.812,"--It goes to the remedy, and it goes to the fact he--"
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1881.812,1884.147,How does it go -- How does it go to the remedy?
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1884.147,1892.002,--It -- they are alleging that there was an abuse of discretion not to send it back to the judge to do what he had declined to do.
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1930.211,1930.544,"Well, that was the--"
2011.10-1265,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1930.544,1930.827,--Mr. Waxman--
2011.10-1265,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1930.827,1931.727,That would be pretty incredible.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2028.475,2034.644,"Well, this -- it may very well be what was in his thought processes, but we don't know that."
2011.10-1265,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2034.644,2054.722,"But we know what was in his thought processes, Mr. Waxman, because 14 days later he issued a 60 or 61-page opinion with -- dealing with 47 different claims, many of which, many of which, related to actual innocence, which was the gravamen of the letter of the complaint on the 16th."
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2062.312,2086.26,"Oh, I -- I think that the -- that a district judge faced with a request to substitute counsel at this very late stage is appropriately -- appropriately takes into account everything that has happened, everything that he has allowed to happen, everything that defense counsel has -- has done, and he is obviously permitted to approach this request with a high degree of skepticism, and a strong--"
2011.10-1265,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2086.26,2091.314,"--And you are suggesting, Mr. Waxman, that he did not have to make an inquiry in every case, is that right?"
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2092.064,2092.714,--That's right.
2011.10-1265,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2093.314,2097.051,So what -- when does a person have to make an inquiry?
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2097.051,2098.518,"--Well, of course--"
2011.10-1265,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2098.518,2102.872,What in this case required an inquiry on the judge's part?
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2102.872,2145.482,"--I think, you know, if the district judge is presented with factually supported allegations that appointed counsel has failed to pursue newly discovered evidence that may be germane to an issue to be decided, especially where the potential import of that evidence is specifically explicated and corroborated by a willing percipient witness, in this case the investigator who viewed it, the district judge has an obligation simply to ask counsel for the State and counsel for the defense, please respond, as the judge did in June -- in March."
2011.10-1265,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2149.518,2173.485,"Well, I guess this goes back to Justice Alito's question, but suppose the judge says to himself, even if the response comes in, yes, relations are terrible because the client wants the lawyers to -- to investigate a particular thing and the lawyers don't want to investigate that thing, the judge knows, it doesn't make a difference either way, because he is ready to issue his opinion."
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2182.139,2189.411,"--Well, because the judge could not know that based on the allegations in the Ford letter and the Clair letter."
2011.10-1265,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.664,2252.001,The Ninth Circuit -- I see -- I think I see what they were trying to get at.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2266.495,2267.111,Yes.
2011.10-1265,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.545,2268.28,That's where they were trying to go.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2305.57,2310.44,--He can't ask to amend a petition in a case in which there's a final judgment.
2011.10-1265,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2315.994,2316.644,And what did--
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2316.644,2317.278,And very--
2011.10-1265,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2317.278,2320.981,"--I think you answered this, but I can't remember the answer."
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2325.883,2326.349,--No.
2011.10-1265,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2380.02,2392.244,So there is no -- so in other words -- what the Ninth Circuit in my view is trying to do is they've worked out some complicated way of trying to get the district court to consider the motion about the new physical evidence.
2011.10-1265,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2403.233,2403.801,Mister--
2011.10-1265,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.801,2406.251,--I'd just like to know what he's thinking.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2406.251,2410.805,"I have an answer to your question, but of course I'll defer to any superseding question from--"
2011.10-1265,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2410.805,2413.924,--It has to go with the scope of the remedy that they did.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2413.924,2414.424,--Uh-huh.
2011.10-1265,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2414.424,2442.843,"Assuming, as I do and you just said, that what the Ninth Circuit said is there is -- he should have gotten a reason, an explanation, but now there is a new attorney anyway, so what do we do, isn't the normal thing to do just to remand it, to let the district court decide what steps it wants to take, including to decide whether or not it would have granted the motion for substitution if it had heard the explanation?"
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2442.843,2444.776,Yes.
2011.10-1265,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2444.776,2447.662,"Meaning, there was a new judge."
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2453.314,2453.649,No.
2011.10-1265,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2453.649,2457.451,And to decide whether under the facts as they existed at the time.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2457.451,2459.47,Of course not.
2011.10-1265,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2474.393,2474.96,But it's not academic.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2478.029,2478.695,--Well--
2011.10-1265,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2478.695,2494.957,"--to say, what happened back then; I don't believe the motion was timely; I don't believe that you were foreclosed from doing other things; motion to substitute would have been denied; end of case."
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2494.957,2514.784,"--I guess I'm not sure there is a huge difference between that and what the Ninth Circuit did or what I understand the Ninth Circuit to be doing, which was to issue an order -- basically say the substitution motion had to be decided within the broad discretion that the law allows before entry of judgment."
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2534.098,2534.665,--Counsel--
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2534.665,2536.55,--he has counsel and -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2536.55,2536.95,--No.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2541.769,2546.323,"Yes, I do have an answer to Justice Breyer's question, if I can just -- thank you."
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2551.044,2555.261,Why don't you finish your answer to Justice Sotomayor and then go back to Justice Breyer.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2555.261,2555.645,Thank you.
2011.10-1265,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2700.073,2701.173,That's like -- Mr. Waxman--
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2701.173,2702.473,--it was an abuse of discretion not to ask.
2011.10-1265,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2703.358,2706.827,"--Mr. Waxman, I thought this is a case that has been going on for, like, 12 years in the district court."
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2706.827,2707.293,Yes.
2011.10-1265,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2707.293,2738.112,"And I thought that the basic disagreement between the client and counsel was counsel said: Our best shot is going to be to keep you alive, so we want to do everything we can to change the death sentence, and then -- and we don't want to detract from that by making a claim of actual innocence when the -- there'd be very slim basis for that."
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2750.689,2770.667,"Justice Ginsburg, if that had -- if the judge had inquired of counsel and counsel had given that reason, that would be something that the Court could evaluate in deciding whether the balancing test that is required by the interests of justice standard satisfied his inquiry."
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2774.887,2782.225,"Counsel, if -- the interests of justice, does that include the available resources of the Federal Public Defender?"

2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2835.293,2837.562,--All of those things go into the interest of justice balancing.
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2838.762,2848.451,--Is the -- is the person in a different position with the new counsel than he would have been with the old concerning the standards about reopening things?
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2860.425,2860.808,Of course.
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2860.808,2862.027,--the restrictions that you just talked about.
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2862.027,2863.043,Of course -- of course not.
2011.10-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2899.067,2907.572,"And one of the things I think the district court would do in that situation with the same counsel is say: Look, this was a tactical strategic decision of the lawyer."
2011.10-1265,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2923.918,2938.444,"Well, I think that in a value -- if substitute counsel -- if there is a remand in this case and substitute counsel makes a Rule 15 motion, the Court will evaluate that under the broad interests of justice standard."

2011.10-1265,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3198.326,3200.761,But the interests of justice is such an open-ended test.
