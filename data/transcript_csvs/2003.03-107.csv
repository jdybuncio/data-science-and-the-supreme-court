2003.03-107,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,33.737,"We'll hear argument now in No. 03-107, the United States v. Billy Jo Lara."
2003.03-107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,8.854,11.939,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,76.299,79.917,Why didn't... why didn't they extend it to non-Indians?
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,95.712,100.164,I think the answer lies in... in the longstanding jurisdictional regime on Indian reservations.
2003.03-107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.1,129.383,"Well, why couldn't they have changed that?"
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,135.087,148.43,"Congress could have done so, but Congress, with the plenary power over Indian affairs, chose... decided that the proper course or the most appropriate course was to have that jurisdiction exercised by the Indian tribes."
2003.03-107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,159.12,159.82,What's--
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,174.731,179.699,"It... generally, it has been understood to require a tribal affiliation."
2003.03-107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,193.109,193.509,"Yes, but what is that?"
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,194.243,215.206,"And under that, obviously, someone who is an enrolled... formally enrolled member would be an Indian, but as this Court pointed out in footnote 7 of its Antelope decision, the... that provision has not been construed to require that strictly, that ordinarily someone who is an Indian and has a tribal affiliation and is recognized by the tribe is also regarded as an Indian."
2003.03-107,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,231.315,250.729,"Mr. Kneedler, is it the case that the Bill of Rights is... has not been thought applicable to criminal defendants who are members of the tribe in a tribal court or to non-tribal Indian... non-tribal member Indians?"
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,250.729,250.995,Yes.
2003.03-107,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.345,253.581,In... in tribal court.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,253.581,253.997,--Yes.
2003.03-107,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.437,272.393,Would that be perhaps one reason why Congress didn't go ahead and subject non-Indians to tribal prosecution?
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,272.393,285.7,"--Well, it... it may be, but... but it's important to recognize what... what Congress has also done here was to enact the Indian Civil Rights Act which extends to Indian tribes many of the requirements of the Bill of Rights."
2003.03-107,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,285.7,286.218,But not all.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,286.218,302.395,"Not all of them, but Congress in 1968 examined the question of the... of the rights of... of Indians and others subject to tribal jurisdiction and... and applied the... the provisions of the... of the Indian Civil Rights Act."
2003.03-107,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.78,313.536,Should we consider in this case the due process and equal protection arguments that are--
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,313.536,316.155,--I don't... I don't believe they are before the Court.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,339.77,357.481,"--Well, I suppose under one view of the case... and it's... it's not your view... if this were deemed to be a delegated power, then the absence or the... the presence of obligations under the Bill of Rights would become very important."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,357.481,362.033,"Well, I... it depends what one means by delegation."
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,385.899,386.834,But... but it--
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,386.834,388.284,--to then execute those laws.
2003.03-107,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,388.284,393.402,--But it is exercising the power of the United States as distinct from the power of some other sovereign.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,403.294,403.627,Right.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,417.301,423.355,"Well, if it's authorized... exercising its own power, how then can Congress make the Bill of Rights applicable."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,427.075,427.442,--Yes.
2003.03-107,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,445.971,453.476,"Mr. Kneedler, may I raise the... the point that is... is the greatest trouble for me so... so you perhaps could address that?"
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,557.644,557.944,Yes.
2003.03-107,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,571.969,585.961,"Well, it may have a great deal to do with whether we can change our conceptualization about dependent sovereignty, but as long as we keep that conceptualization, it seems to me we've got to accept the conclusion that... that I suggested."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,585.961,586.263,--No.
2003.03-107,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,603.775,617.515,"Okay, but if it does so, we have to accept the... if we're going to follow that route, we will have to accept the conclusion that the whole concept of dependent sovereignty has... has been modified in... in some way because you can't have it both ways."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,617.515,617.948,--No.
2003.03-107,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,637.512,644.583,"Well, if that... if that were all we meant in Oliphant, we would have said the... the Federal Government could take away this power by statute."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,652.672,670.967,"--But it... if... if one looks back at the Oliphant decision, what the Court there described its... its undertaking was was essentially a... a... an articulation of what it called Indian law which is a... a combination of judge-made law but against the backdrop of treaties and statutes."
2003.03-107,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,719.88,722.249,"Well, isn't... isn't that what we're talking about--"
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,722.249,722.666,--No.
2003.03-107,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,723.116,724.268,--when we talk about sovereign power?
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,724.268,727.136,--This is not a unilateral assertion of tribal power.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,777.419,785.339,And that has always been thought to be a great anomaly that a constitutional requirement could be eliminated by a Federal statute.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,789.893,800.182,"No, but... but the point is that in that situation, even when the Constitution itself has, as a matter of constitutional law, limited State authority, Congress can lift that."
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,801.718,803.401,"Well, let's... let's apply that across the board then."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,806.003,807.205,--No.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,807.605,808.455,Clearly you're not going to urge--
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,808.455,808.905,--No.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,809.255,810.974,--Congress can lift the Double Jeopardy Clause?
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,810.974,811.407,--No.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,816.294,818.412,There's... there's a distinction between the Bill of Rights and the rest of the Constitution.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,818.412,832.57,"Well, under... under this Court's decision... decisions, Congress has been authorized to allow States to regulate in areas it... it would otherwise not be able to, and when it does so, it's exercising its own sovereign power, not power delegated by the Federal Government."
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,861.589,861.989,Authorized States.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,861.989,862.505,Pardon me?
2003.03-107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,862.505,863.455,Authorized States.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,863.455,863.989,Excuse me.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,878.599,916.457,"So in saying that, what you're doing... is what you're doing taking the word dependent in domestic dependent nation and saying that Congress has a degree of leeway to define what is and what is not encompassed by the word dependent so that if Congress wants to, it can say that whereas previously an exercise of pre-1650, your Indian jurisdiction, because they could have, you know... which was removed by the word dependent is not removed--"
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,916.457,916.89,Yes.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,916.89,921.111,--because Congress... Congress can redefine the term dependent?
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,921.111,922.594,I... I agree with your result.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,929.531,929.966,Yes.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,929.966,930.999,--in this case Congress.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,944.291,956.165,"So when you look at Duro, it... it said that what it found the exercise of criminal jurisdiction inconsistent with was the notion of dependency in the phrase, domestic dependent nation."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,956.165,957.201,Yes.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.817,964.787,"And... and therefore... and... and there... so Congress has the authority to say no, at least as to future, it is not inconsistent."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,964.787,965.306,--Yes.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,965.306,966.206,Is that right?
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,996.308,996.725,Yes.
2003.03-107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,997.708,1002.212,I... I find it hard to think that that's all that the Double Jeopardy Clause means.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1002.212,1024.558,"--Well, the... this Court held in Wheeler that prosecution by an Indian tribe of a... of a member of the tribe in that situation, followed by a prosecution by the Federal Government for what would... the same conduct, was not the same offense because the ultimate authority to prosecute derived from different sources."
2003.03-107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.558,1029.362,"But derived from inherent tribal authority, which had not been taken away."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1042.02,1056.013,"--Well, it... I... I think by inherent what the Court meant in both Oliphant and... and in Duro was original sovereignty that has continued unlimited or unrestricted down to the present day."
2003.03-107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.334,1063.167,That provides a limitation.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1074.974,1075.641,"--Well, I... I--"
2003.03-107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.641,1079.545,It doesn't matter what has been allowed to... to continue down to the present day.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1090.168,1105.26,"--If... if we... if we look at the reality of the nature of the prosecutions here, this was a prosecution brought by tribal officials in a tribally constituted court enforcing provisions of tribal law, not title 18, under a tribal constitution."
2003.03-107,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.862,1113.699,Are you saying that Congress could require the trial of non-Indians before a... an Indian tribal court?
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1113.699,1114.166,--Yes.
2003.03-107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1143.904,1146.57,This is maybe... it's very interesting.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1190.949,1193.568,"Well, several things."
2003.03-107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1214.648,1219.219,"Well, the statute isn't going to help in terms of my question because I'm interested in Congress' power."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1219.219,1220.002,--Yes.
2003.03-107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1220.719,1224.521,And... and maybe we don't have to reach that in this case.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1224.521,1225.372,--I... I think--
2003.03-107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.372,1228.574,And maybe the answer to this case makes no difference in respect to that.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1228.574,1237.013,"--I... I think... I think in asking a due process question, you might be asking... a procedural due process question, you might be asking an equal protection type question."
2003.03-107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.013,1240.132,"I'm asking a question in respect to right to counsel, for example."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1240.132,1245.184,Right... right to counsel is not... is not expressly guaranteed by the Indian Civil Rights Act.
2003.03-107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.408,1263.681,"Well, except... except with respect to the Indian Civil Rights Act, you can... you can... and I think this solves due process problems."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1277.588,1278.257,Yes.
2003.03-107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.257,1296.469,"But to now extend the Government's power to subject people to this kind of trial beyond members of the... of the tribe that... that has the tribal court to members of other tribes and, as you necessarily acknowledge, even to non-Indians, that's a... that's a step I'm... I'm not prepared to contemplate."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1296.469,1317.132,"Well, with... first of all, with respect to members of tribes other than the prosecuting tribe, Congress in the exercise of its plenary authority over tribes we think certainly should have the power to regulate the relationship among tribes, tribes with each other, and relationships of tribes and their respective members with each other."
2003.03-107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.132,1317.782,"Well, would it--"
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1317.782,1319.098,That's what Congress has done here.
2003.03-107,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1319.098,1326.404,"--Would it be a defense, say, to someone charged with a crime in Wisconsin to say volenti non fit... you move to Minnesota."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1327.238,1327.671,"No, it would not."
2003.03-107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1352.721,1362.344,"--Mr. Kneedler, just to bring it back to this case, as I understand it, there was no due process or equal protection challenge by Mr. Lara."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1365.463,1365.846,That's... that's correct.
2003.03-107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.219,1375.652,"Because if it's not valid, then he's being prosecuted for the first time."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1375.652,1376.337,--Right.
2003.03-107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.221,1386.043,"Yes, but all these questions are very relevant to whether we should accept your... or... or the Government's assertion of what Congress can do."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1396.648,1404.338,"Well, there... there's I think another important point to be made about the nature of Congress' powers in this area."
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.937,1452.635,"But... but... so... so what you're saying is that if the Court has very substantial concerns over the Government's proposition that within the territorial United States a non-constitutional entity can be allowed to try a United States citizen, if we have concerns about that, you're giving us no ability to draw a line so that you can prevail in this case."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1464.626,1465.21,"--No, I... I--"
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1465.21,1467.162,And this is an astounding proposition.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1467.162,1469.264,--I did not... I did not mean to say... to say that.
2003.03-107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1497.014,1500.883,"Yes, but that was before Indians were citizens of the United States."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1500.883,1501.383,--But... no.
2003.03-107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1505.686,1516.126,"Yes, but one wonders if you go beyond members of the tribe itself to outsiders, whether that distinction between citizens of the United States is valid."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1516.126,1518.828,--I... I believe it is.
2003.03-107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1530.367,1534.188,But that was... that was not in the context of regulating non-Indians.
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1534.188,1534.888,--No.
2003.03-107,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1556.817,1558.119,"Yes, but they are also not dependent sovereigns."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1558.119,1558.503,--That's--
2003.03-107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.503,1561.155,"I mean, there's an entirely different conceptualization involved."
2003.03-107,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1561.155,1571.344,"--But again, in our... in our view, the dependency describes Congress' power to regulate and limit and prescribe the rights available in tribal courts."
2003.03-107,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1573.213,1574.263,"Very well, Mr. Kneedler."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,1576.415,1588.905,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1624.578,1650.294,"If we take your approach then in trying to carry out what was the will of Congress, I think we'd have to say that the first prosecution doesn't count because the one thing is... seems to me pretty clear from this record, that Congress did not want to have a situation where there was a delegation of Federal authority."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,1696.088,1702.492,"Your Honor, I believe that Congress' intent was clear on two points."
2003.03-107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1731.829,1732.697,But you can't do that.
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,1774.188,1787.346,"--And if this Court was to determine that this is a... that this is not a delegation and that this Court determines that the statute cannot be saved, then Mr. Lara still was prosecuted in the tribal court."
2003.03-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1804.623,1814.246,"Do you... do you have authority for the proposition that if you're tried by a court without jurisdiction, it's nevertheless sufficient to invoke double jeopardy, if we have to reach that here?"
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,1816.948,1818.633,I don't believe that it's novel.
2003.03-107,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.665,1851.021,What if... what if he'd been prosecuted in France and served 90 days there and then he was tried here?
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,1852.838,1854.556,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2003.03-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1854.556,1862.393,"Well, and... and furthermore, you have a habeas remedy after the first... after the first trial to... to object to the sentence."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,1886.525,1889.743,Congress can... could always give it back under a delegation.
2003.03-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1891.293,1892.862,Why... why would it be a delegation?
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,1900.333,1906.003,--What Congress takes away and Congress gives back is a power of Congress.
2003.03-107,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1910.79,1912.19,May... may I interrupt you on that?
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,1928.466,1947.613,"--I think technically they would, but in that situation it's... it's not so important whether they're using a delegated power or a sovereign power because this case presents unique facts where sovereignty becomes of paramount importance because of this Court's adoption of the dual sovereignty doctrine."
2003.03-107,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1968.091,1968.777,Mr. Reichert--
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2011.553,2022.177,"When Congress acts with... as it acts towards Puerto Rico, it can use its treaty powers and not be conferring sovereign power on Puerto Rico."
2003.03-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2023.81,2025.545,"Suppose it does. Suppose it says the commonwealth, which is a totally uncertain concept, henceforth means A, B, C, D, and E."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2092.002,2103.11,"--To address that, Puerto Rico is different than a State and Puerto Rico and States are very different from tribes."
2003.03-107,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.942,2140.485,"--Can I just... it seems to me that's a critical part of the case where the... supposing the tribe had a... a criminal statute and saying you cannot cut trees above 5,000 feet on the mountains because that's sacred land or something like that."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2162.915,2166.45,--I believe that that would be a delegation of Congress' power.
2003.03-107,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2173.787,2182.143,Where... where do you get the authority for that one-way ratcheting when we've said that Congress has plenary power over the tribes?
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2186.78,2201.456,--I would look to Oliphant or to United States v. Sioux Nation or the Alcea Band of the Tillamook Tribe wherein this Court said Congress' plenary power is not absolute.
2003.03-107,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2216.733,2217.133,Okay.
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2295.918,2298.954,The--
2003.03-107,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2298.954,2306.123,"In other words, it's... it's the sovereign relationship rather than an act of Congress that takes away that is crucial for understanding the issue here."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2306.123,2319.181,--If I could just... it's this Court that said that that... that recognized... and its role is to say what the law is... looked at the dependent nature of the Indian tribes and said this does not exist.
2003.03-107,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2321.05,2322.319,"We said that in Oliphant, among other things."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2322.319,2322.952,--Correct.
2003.03-107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2322.952,2323.652,"Yes, okay."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2329.056,2332.941,"Yes, but Congress can always give back using their plenary power."
2003.03-107,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.729,2341.947,--But do we... I'm sorry.
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2376.954,2385.66,"--It's a result, Your Honor, of their accepting the dependent... accepting the protection and the benefits and the burdens of the United States."
2003.03-107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.2,2412.727,Essentially the trouble I have with your case is that it depends on making a distinction between the status of... of Indian sovereignty which hasn't yet been taken away but which exists totally the whim of Congress.
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2451.968,2452.804,"--That's right, and--"
2003.03-107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.804,2459.291,"Well, why shouldn't the... I mean, I... I... if the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't apply in one situation, it seems to me it shouldn't apply in the other."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2459.291,2464.178,"--And Billy Jo Lara was prosecuted using Federal power, and that's... and that's the premise."
2003.03-107,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2471.998,2477.585,Why... why doesn't Gideon v. Wainwright and all the other provisions of the Bill of Rights apply?
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2477.585,2481.021,--To Billy Jo Lara as a non-member of the tribe?
2003.03-107,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2482.223,2487.441,To... to any Indian tribal prosecution of its own... even of its own members.
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2487.441,2500.601,"Because this Court said in United States v. Wheeler that the... the member of a tribe has accepted the benefits and the burdens of being a member of that tribe, and one of the burdens is that the Bill of Rights does not apply."
2003.03-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2522.18,2548.748,"So... so the answer then to the due process problem, which you've just given, is that the... the member... the tribal member, the non-tribal Indian, and the non-Indian are all persons subject to the Due Process Clause, but what counts is due process may vary between whether you are a tribal member or not because of the argument you just gave."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2602.233,2611.155,"Your Honor, as I understand your question, you're looking for where in the Constitution Congress has the power or this... or this body has the power."
2003.03-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2611.155,2611.572,To the contrary.
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2662.355,2666.159,Congress has specific enumerated powers in the Constitution.
2003.03-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.146,2674.765,I want to turn the question then.
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2699.88,2701.096,In the Treaty Clause.
2003.03-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2732.767,2753.615,"Now, my impression is that we used to do this through treaty, but at some point the House of Representatives was somewhat unhappy about not having a role in this and therefore it became changed such that the relationship with the Indian tribes is defined through agreement ratified and enacted into law by both houses of Congress."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2757.067,2764.589,"I'm not sure that it was... if it was unconstitutional or not, but I don't think that's the important distinction, Your Honor."
2003.03-107,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2778.682,2793.342,"Well, I... I suppose that if this Court said that the nature of sovereignty is such that it has certain limits and that this is imposed because of the Constitution and because of long use, perhaps Congress couldn't change it."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2794.675,2795.794,--But Congress--
2003.03-107,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2795.794,2796.61,We have not said that.
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2809.201,2815.438,"--And Congress is already attempting to... with the Hicks fix to overrule Hicks, Montana, and Oliphant."
2003.03-107,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2820.259,2847.742,"That may well be a different case because then we're concerned with the powers of... of Indian tribes as a historical matter of their sovereignty over citizens of the United States who have direct relations, responsibilities, obligations, and rights both with their States and with the National Government, and under the insular cases, the Constitution applies with full force to the territory of the United States."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2850.428,2854.313,--But Mr. Lara owes no allegiance whatsoever to the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe.
2003.03-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2863.086,2867.723,Then you're making a... then you're making a constitutional argument and it's an appropriate argument.
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2886.368,2891.605,In... and thank you.
2003.03-107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2916.686,2923.44,"What about someone who lives on the reservation, marries a woman who is a member of the tribe?"
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2941.552,2950.508,"--Because if the Court were to adopt that position, then there would be no reason not to subject non-Indians to tribal jurisdiction as well."
2003.03-107,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2951.693,2955.061,"Well, how do you distinguish Brendale with a zoning ordinance and so forth?"
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2957.144,2960.882,--Criminal... criminal jurisdiction is significantly different than civil jurisdiction.
2003.03-107,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2960.882,2962.832,And... and what's... what's the authority for that?
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,2962.832,2967.119,"I believe that that's in my brief, Your Honor."
2003.03-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2997.638,3000.173,But then you've given the answer to your own question.
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,3056.86,3058.629,And... and it's interesting.
2003.03-107,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3087.796,3088.596,"Well, we do it all the time."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,3095.218,3102.888,"--But it's not required to step into a courtroom in the United States and say before this proceeding starts, I want to invoke all of my rights."
2003.03-107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3109.042,3115.631,"Of course, he'd be subjected to the same thing on his own reservation, on the reservation of his own tribe, and you say that's okay."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,3115.631,3123.119,This Court has said that... that prosecuting a member on his own tribe is okay because he has... he has consented to that.
2003.03-107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.119,3131.975,"Mightn't there be such a thing as, you know, when... when you enroll in any tribe, you subject yourself to what might be call Indian law--"
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,3131.975,3132.691,No--
2003.03-107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.691,3136.177,--the law of your tribal council and the law of... of other tribal councils?
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,3147.15,3150.436,"--It would be wonderful if tribes were the same, but tribes are not."
2003.03-107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3171.283,3184.924,How does that differ from somebody from Virginia who caused some trouble in Louisiana and doesn't want to go to the Louisiana courts because they have this mixed civil/common law system?
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,3184.924,3195.465,--Because a criminal defendant in Louisiana under your... under your example would have the full benefit of the Bill of Rights which a... which an Indian does not have in tribal courts.
2003.03-107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3209.658,3210.125,But this is--
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,3231.571,3234.356,Because Mr. Lara was prosecuted under the color of law.
2003.03-107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3237.725,3239.51,"Yes, but there's no valid judgment if you're right."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,3239.51,3243.046,--And Mr. Lara never attacked his... his judgment.
2003.03-107,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3253.337,3253.687,No.
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,3261.674,3263.043,"No, I am not, Your Honor."
2003.03-107,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3312.007,3312.79,Can I ask just one question?
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,3315.226,3319.694,The... the--
2003.03-107,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3319.694,3322.831,"Well, it will be in the record."
2003.03-107,1,16812,alexander_f_reichert,,3328.549,3328.901,--No.
2003.03-107,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3338.007,3339.674,"Thank you, Mr. Reichert."
2003.03-107,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3342.043,3345.095,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-107,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3380.951,3384.47,And I take it tribal membership is always consensual in the context that we're talking about?
2003.03-107,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3384.47,3388.107,"--I... I think... I think it would... yes, it would be."
2003.03-107,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3418.793,3424.697,Is it correct that a defendant in the case right before the trial starts could disavow his Indian status?
2003.03-107,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3424.697,3425.013,No.
2003.03-107,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3433.403,3436.105,I wonder if that... why that would follow?
2003.03-107,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3441.825,3442.525,No.
2003.03-107,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3558.867,3569.823,Could the Congress define a... a criminal offense between one Indian as another Indian and require that the trial be in a tribal court?
2003.03-107,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3569.823,3573.025,A title 18 offense?
2003.03-107,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3573.025,3573.544,Yes.
2003.03-107,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3573.544,3575.344,I... I think that--
2003.03-107,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3575.344,3579.281,"Because my next question would be if they did, could there then be double jeopardy if there was a second trial."
2003.03-107,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3579.281,3584.916,"--That... that would... that... that might present a... a separate problem, but if the... because there... it might be the same offense."
