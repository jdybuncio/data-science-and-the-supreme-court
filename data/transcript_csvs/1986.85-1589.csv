1986.85-1589,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.387,"We will hear argument next in No. 85-1598, Iowa Mutual Insurance Company versus Edward M. LaPlante."
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,70.566,80.859,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court, we have today another Indian case from Montana."
1986.85-1589,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.333,228.457,That sounds like bad news.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,228.457,230.081,It is bad news.
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,246.232,248.183,"What is the good news, Mr. Davis?"
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,248.183,286.496,"The good news, Justice Scalia, is that you have an opportunity to fix it, and I hope to... we can take some small steps today towards fixing it, and I guess the point I want to stress is that certainly in dealing with theory and with concepts like Federal preemption and the retained sovereignty of Indian tribes with which this Court grapples, it is necessary to keep in mind that we foot soldiers like Mr. Bottomly and I out in the trenches in Great Falls or wherever, in Browning, Montana, have to apply these concepts in a workable framework."
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.496,300.585,"Workable framework that you would be able to bring suit in Federal Court if you are an out of state insurance company, but if you are an in-state insurance company you can't bring suit in state court nor in Federal court, of course, because there is no diversity."
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,302.193,333.898,"I don't think so, Justice, and the solution I hasten to characterize is that I stumbled upon and that I have ultimately reached and I have suggested in the reply brief that I have filed with this Court is that it is necessary to avoid these kinds of jurisdiction... these legalistic gymnastics, it is necessary to go back to the beginning and start rethinking these jurisdictional concepts and rework them, I think, from Williams versus Lee forward."
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.62,459.052,Is there any line between this case and allowing the person who opens a trading post on an Indian reservation to sue in state courts?
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,459.052,461.66,I don't understand your question.
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.66,467.611,You are asserting that so long as one of the parties is a non-Indian it doesn't go to tribal courts.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,468.846,469.315,I think so.
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.315,477.719,"Even if the non-Indian... even in Williams, even if it were a case where the non-Indian is running a trading post on the reservation."
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,477.719,478.297,"No, I misunderstood you."
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,535.462,541.522,What about the school district last year?
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,541.522,546.285,"well, fortunately it wasn't a diversity case so I can't answer that particular--"
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,546.285,558.436,"Well I know, but you would say that state courts have jurisdiction even if the person who resides off the reservation still resides in the state."
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,558.436,564.793,"--Yes, the state court would have jurisdiction, Justice White, if--"
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.793,565.183,How about the school district?
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,565.183,567.527,--The school district was located on the Crow reservation.
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,574.259,576.884,School district resides on a reservation?
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,576.884,578.664,"--Well, it is physically located there."
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,583.616,598.423,"Well, if the school district exists off the reservation and goes on the reservation to pick up Indian children and there gets to be a dispute about that--"
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,598.423,618.354,"I would say that that type of dispute belongs in state court or if diversity exists it belongs in Federal court, and I am hard pressed to find any decision from this Court that says otherwise, that says... and I think the important point in the Crow tribe case, you refrained from deciding that very pointedly."
1986.85-1589,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,654.104,666.162,"--It is hard, isn't it, to distinguish some of what we said in the Farmer's Union case two terms ago from something very much like that."
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,672.175,682.327,"Oh, I agree, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but I think the first critical distinction is the nature of the case that came before you in the Crow tribe case."
1986.85-1589,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,704.446,731.543,"Well, but certainly Federal question Jurisdiction, although perhaps... it must be based in the Constitution in some way, though not granted until much later than diversity jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts, but if Federal question jurisdiction such as the jurisdiction of the tribal court, if that sort of a case filed in the District Court must be first referred to the tribal court can't you say that a diversity case should be no different?"
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,731.543,732.825,"--Yes, I can."
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,817.821,828.551,You would agree that the tribal court would be the proper forum to try out the argument between the LaPlantes and the Wellmans?
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,828.551,835.268,"I have no argument with that at all, apart from any limitations imposed by the tribe itself on--"
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.268,836.815,And it is just that the Wellmans had some insurance.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,836.815,838.36,--Yes.
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,838.36,843.436,And that they had gotten through a broker off the reservation.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,843.436,844.67,"well, yes."
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.67,848.888,And your client provided the insurance.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,848.888,849.557,That is correct Judge.
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.85,869.41,Could the tribal court have ever gotten jurisdiction over the insurance company?
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,869.41,888.979,"I suppose if they were going to relocate from DeWitt, Iowa, to Browning, Montana, and set up shop there, I would concede in those circumstances, yes, but short of that state of affairs, that their place of business was on the reservation, no, and I don't think the necessary... the corollary to that is, we start applying loss--"
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.979,897.211,"Well, suppose the insurance company has no existence on the reservation but it does have offices off the reservation and within the state."
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,901.6,905.223,"--I would agree not, that they should not be allowed to."
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1039.218,1043.7,"The Ninth Circuit dismissed the case, ordered the case dismissed, completely dismissed."
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1044.059,1049.996,"Well, it is a dismissal... I have to read it as comparable to National Farmers, a dismissal without prejudice."
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.996,1056.79,"I thought it held that since the state courts wouldn't have jurisdiction, that there wasn't any diversity jurisdiction either."
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1056.79,1057.603,That's correct.
1986.85-1589,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.134,1061.119,And they ordered the case dismissed.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1061.119,1088.53,"Well, they have, but you go back to the R.J. Williams case and I guess there is that ultimate question, to see... if, as I understand their rationale, If we ultimately determined that the Blackfeet tribal court doesn't have jurisdiction over this type of controversy, ipso facto the state court would be vested with jurisdiction perhaps and therefore the diversity jurisdiction would exist because we then get over the Woods versus Interstate Realty hurdle."
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.723,1168.593,"Mr. Davis, let's assume we don't accept that broad invitation of yours, and we adhere to the proposition that the tribal court would have jurisdiction or at least arguably would have jurisdiction here."
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1180.527,1181.635,Yes.
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.649,1186.009,Right.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1220.917,1224.509,First of all because they aren't state courts.
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.209,1243.393,"I mean, it is one thing to say that we should have accepted this case if it had walked in without any prior proceeding in the tribal courts, but here you have a proceeding already there."
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1243.393,1247.876,We have a different... we have the underlying tort claims proceeding in tribal courts.
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.876,1248.673,That's right.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1248.673,1258.076,"To that extent it is no different from any other, a typical declaratory judgment action for which, of course, there is an express grant of Federal jurisdiction."
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.076,1264.495,Suppose that suit had been in state court and then this same diversity suit were attempted.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1271.181,1271.822,"Well, I hope so."
1986.85-1589,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.604,1357.21,"Mr. Davis, just to clarify, maybe it is covered in your briefs, but in your view what jurisdiction's substantive law governs the decision of the coverage question?"
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1357.21,1360.85,I don't think there is any practical dispute that it is Montana law.
1986.85-1589,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1360.85,1361.694,It would be Montana.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1365.881,1369.427,"Well, again, that is an interesting matter, but again it is Montana law."
1986.85-1589,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.754,1422.219,Would it not be possible that the tribe could decide as a matter of its own law that the failure to get workman's compensation somehow establishes liability as a matter of tribal law or something like that?
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1422.219,1427.358,"I suppose it could, but again, they are just adopting Montana law."
1986.85-1589,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.358,1429.06,At least their complaint does.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1432.01,1434.432,We don't know at all what the tribal court is going to do.
1986.85-1589,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1451.505,1464.513,"Well, on your suggestion that we start from scratch, in effect, and redefine the jurisdictional boundary, are you suggesting that the boundaries are mutually exclusive, that you are in the Indian camp, you can't come in state court, and vice versa?"
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1464.513,1467.106,--Are you asking what type of litigant?
1986.85-1589,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.664,1491.755,But you would say that if there is jurisdiction in the tribal court under your new definition of the boundary there would be no jurisdiction in either the state court or the federal court?
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1491.755,1498.784,"--If we have a Williams type Lee dispute, yes, I would say that the tribal court jurisdiction, the matters that belong in tribal court--"
1986.85-1589,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1498.784,1499.862,That is exclusive.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1499.862,1500.876,--Yes.
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.455,1505.125,You wouldn't allow the Indian--
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1505.125,1505.797,"--No, no, I am--"
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.797,1509.062,--in Williams to bring that suit in state court if he wanted to?
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1509.062,1509.687,--Well that was the store owner.
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1511.406,1512.062,"Right, the Indian."
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1512.062,1512.623,The Indian--
1986.85-1589,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1512.623,1514.701,Let's assume the Indian was suing the store owners.
1986.85-1589,0,35714,maxon_r_davis,,1514.701,1517.684,"--Yes, and I think that exists now, and I apologize for the confusion."
1986.85-1589,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1654.444,1655.663,"Thank you, Mr. Davis."
1986.85-1589,1,29207,joe_r_bottomly,,1657.975,1684.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Ninth Circuit and the District Court were correct in the dismissing of this case because to take diversity jurisdiction when there is a pending action in tribal court which involves the identical issues and disputes would contradict the firm federal policy to promote tribal self-government--"
1986.85-1589,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.808,1688.15,"Mr. Bottomly, let me stop you right there, because is this the identical dispute?"
1986.85-1589,1,29207,joe_r_bottomly,,1697.195,1703.597,--They are identical claims because Iowa Mutual as an affirmative defense raised the coverage question.
1986.85-1589,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.597,1707.767,"That aspect of it overlaps, but the negligence aspect doesn't overlap."
1986.85-1589,1,29207,joe_r_bottomly,,1707.767,1714.468,"That's right, but the part of the declaratory in federal court that they want determined, that is the insurance contract issues."
1986.85-1589,2,35714,maxon_r_davis,,3088.239,3089.567,"Yes, Chief Justice."
1986.85-1589,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3108.484,3110.138,0 xxx.
1986.85-1589,2,35714,maxon_r_davis,,3110.138,3110.232,--Yes.
1986.85-1589,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3116.698,3119.682,0 xxx.
1986.85-1589,2,35714,maxon_r_davis,,3119.682,3122.072,The tribal judge has said so.
1986.85-1589,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.99,3143.751,"Well, now, did I understand your opponent to say that this bad faith action cannot go forward in Montana courts any more?"
1986.85-1589,2,35714,maxon_r_davis,,3143.751,3145.423,In Montana state court.
1986.85-1589,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.343,3147.015,"Yes, that's what I mean."
1986.85-1589,2,35714,maxon_r_davis,,3147.015,3150.795,"--Well, it can go forward, but it has to await the resolution of the underlying tort claim."
1986.85-1589,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3155.481,3155.934,"All right, I understand."
1986.85-1589,2,35714,maxon_r_davis,,3155.934,3156.825,All right.
1986.85-1589,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3272.47,3274.548,"Your time has expired, Mr. Davis."
