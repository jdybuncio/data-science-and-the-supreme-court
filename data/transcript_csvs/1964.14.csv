1964.14,0,36476,marion_b_plant,,11.23,12.845,May it please the Court.
1964.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,661.07,662.899,Time for what Mr. Plant?
1964.14,0,36476,marion_b_plant,,662.899,668.307,For further discussion of the problem of the contracting out the work or anything else --
1964.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,668.307,668.527,Yes.
1964.14,0,36476,marion_b_plant,,668.527,668.802,-- the union might --
1964.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,668.802,669.149,And not in connection --
1964.14,0,36476,marion_b_plant,,669.149,670.43,-- want to talk about.
1964.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,670.43,674.151,-- not in connection with any contract -- future contract of --
1964.14,0,36476,marion_b_plant,,674.151,675.74,It might have been involved.
1964.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,675.74,676.246,(Inaudible)
1964.14,0,36476,marion_b_plant,,676.246,678.193,Might have been involved.
1964.14,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3575.282,3579.667,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3967.025,3973.907,And the mergers for the -- and the mergers were -- it involves a (Inaudible) issue?
1964.14,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3973.907,3976.274,I don't recall whether the Board has so held.
1964.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3980.755,3986.405,"But I suppose if the principle would apply, if it -- it involved termination of tenure."
1964.14,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3986.405,3992.034,"It would seem that if that were made, the exclusive test that it then would apply, yes."
1964.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4163.868,4170.529,"Right up until this case or its immediate predecessor, the Court -- the Board had held the same thing with respect to this?"
1964.14,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4170.529,4175.243,"I -- a little later Mr. Justice Stewart, we'll respectfully disagree."
1964.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4175.243,4177.474,"Well, I know in your brief you do."
1964.14,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4177.474,4179.233,"Well, as I do here most emphatically."
1964.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4179.233,4182.046,"Well, I'm not pressing it but --"
1964.14,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4182.046,4184.423,So I don't think it could be said that right up till this case --
1964.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4184.423,4184.995,But --
1964.14,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4184.995,4185.647,-- the Board is --
1964.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4185.647,4187.6,That's what Mr. Plant has told us in (Voice Overlap) --
1964.14,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4187.6,4188.834,That's what Mr. Plant has told you.
1964.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4188.834,4190.135,-- told us in that way.
1964.14,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4190.135,4201.637,"He omitted to mention the one clear decision to the contrary, the case that was cited by approval -- cited with approval by this Court in Teamsters against Oliver's."
1964.14,2,20827,david_e_feller,,5719.508,5722.581,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.14,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6004.168,6007.585,That kind of case is not exactly the kind of case we have before us?
1964.14,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6007.585,6016.107,"No, but the first question -- the question which Mr. Plant argues is that that there is no duty to bargain about contracting out."
1964.14,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6075.827,6077.873,"That is, if one side or the other brought it up?"
1964.14,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6077.873,6077.955,That's right.
1964.14,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6077.955,6078.596,Is that --
1964.14,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6078.596,6116.587,"And indeed even in the unilateral action cases, of the three cases that have been talked about, this case, Town & Country and Adams Dairy which is pending for cert, two of those cases Adams Dairy and Town & Country, the trial examiners who were bound by Board decision had decided and said explicitly it's well established that there is a duty to bargain about contracting out and found employer violations by unilateral action in 1960 before the Board announced the supposedly new change in doctrine and before there was the change in the membership of the Board that's been talked about."
1964.14,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6329.516,6334.685,"But entirely consistent with the position they now take, isn't it?"
1964.14,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6334.685,6335.161,Yes.
