2005.04-698,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,28.516,We will now hear argument in Schaffer against Weast.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,30.48,46.445,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court-- As Congress recently reaffirmed, the IDEA was enacted to protect the rights of children with disabilities, and the rights of their parents."
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,111.763,117.328,"Now, Congress was silent on this subject of the burden of proof, was it not?"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,117.328,118.78,"Yes, it was, Justice O'Connor."
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.78,127.996,"Was there... did you find anything in the legislative history... I know some members don't care to look at that, but I would be willing--"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,133.142,145.278,"We are aware of none, Your Honor. What we... what we have here is a situation where Congress, when it wishes to allocate the burden of proof one way or the other legislatively, knows how to do so."
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.397,156.551,Excuse me.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,160.061,162.979,"Well, Your Honor, the APA governs Federal agencies, it doesn't--"
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.979,163.61,I see.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,163.61,164.061,--govern proceedings--
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.061,164.463,I see.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,164.463,164.964,--under the--
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.964,165.274,So--
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,165.274,165.655,--under the IDEA.
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,165.655,168.974,--what it if were... what it were a school on a Federal base?
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,171.029,172.313,"Your Honor, there are--"
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.313,173.787,--military schools on military--
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,173.787,175.179,--DOD schools--
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.179,175.873,--DOD schools.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,178.769,179.841,"--We don't believe so, Your Honor."
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.841,179.951,No?
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,179.951,181.445,They are not.
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,188.636,190.771,"Well, you'd be suing some Federal agency."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,200.079,217.692,"--I don't agree, Your Honor, and let me explain why, because of the unique structure of this Act, it creates an equal partnership between parents and the school system, with the purpose of that partnership being to produce an Individualized Education Program for the benefit of the child."
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.893,235.585,"Yeah, well, what if you had an IEP that the parents had initially agreed with, and then they decide it isn't working well, they want to challenge it."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,237.92,243.466,"Your Honor, that would be a different situation, and courts below have reached different results on that."
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.942,253.164,"Well, you mean the court has... every court faced with this problem is supposed to decide, in that particular case, who hast who has the burden?"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,253.164,254.155,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.76,269.941,Do you--
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,269.941,270.422,--in this case--
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.422,277.412,--do you think it's open to a State to adopt a general rule on who has the burden of proof under this statute?
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,277.412,280.171,"--Your Honor, we think that it is not."
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.019,287.351,Have some States purported to adopt a general rule on this?
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,287.351,288.896,"--Some have, Your Honor."
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.896,288.896,And you think that's invalid.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,288.896,296.167,"Well, we believe... yes, Your Honor, we believe it is a... it is a Federal law question."
2005.04-698,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,319.156,334.261,"Mr. Hurd, do you recognize... to narrow what... the issue... that the parent objecting to the school's IEP would at least have a burden of coming forward?"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,355.535,358.964,"--Your Honor, we don't believe that it's necessary."
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,422.831,434.876,"What case is your closest one to support the view that the Court should adopt some particular rule here, based on the scheme?"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,434.876,436.0,Well--
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,436.0,437.042,What do you rely on?
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,439.469,440.13,"--Your Honor, I would--"
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,440.13,440.851,--guiding principle.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,440.851,457.147,"--I would... Justice O'Connor, I would point, for example, to your opinion in Gebser vs. Lago Vista, where you said that the general rule... this was not a burden of proof case, but, in any event, you said the general rule must yield to the purposes of the statute--"
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,457.147,458.529,"Okay, but let--"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,458.529,458.661,--in order to figure out--
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,458.661,459.142,--let's talk--
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,459.142,459.362,--congressional intent.
2005.04-698,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,459.362,461.277,--burden of proof cases.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,467.023,477.422,"Well, Your Honor, the Court, last year, in Alaska versus EPA, said, there is no single rule, or principle, governing the allocation of the burden."
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.456,516.551,I understand the purposes of the statute argument.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,530.251,530.772,Your Honor--
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.772,530.772,--that will always be the case.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,530.772,538.896,"--Justice Scalia, the purpose of the statute is to obtain for the child an Individualized Education Program."
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.896,539.076,That's fine.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,558.674,561.873,"Well, Your Honor, this is a unique statutory scheme."
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.645,576.086,Sure.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,576.086,577.751,"--that purpose is served far more, Justice Scalia--"
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.751,591.332,"And the Federal Tort Claims Act, for all I know, says, in its prologue... or, if it doesn't, it should have, or it could have... the purpose of this is to assure that every person who's been injured by a... by a Government tort obtains relief."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,591.332,598.303,"--But let me, then, point out the very different paradigm between the ordinary tort claim statute and this statute."
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.712,631.712,"Well, that's--"
2005.04-698,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,631.712,634.368,"Well, that's where I am not understanding your argument."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,662.748,663.499,Justice Scalia--
2005.04-698,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,663.499,669.085,"Instead, what we have here is a fight about whether it's a good IEP or no IEP."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,669.085,674.139,"--Justice Scalia, with all due respect, there is no IEP; there's only a proposed IEP."
2005.04-698,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,675.171,675.361,Then--
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,675.361,675.912,--the crucial difference--
2005.04-698,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,675.912,676.936,--then we're arguing about words.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,676.936,678.018,"--The point, though, is that with--"
2005.04-698,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,678.018,679.44,"The State is not saying,"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,686.269,690.069,"--Your Honor, that is not an IEP; that is a proposed IEP."
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,732.776,735.925,--What sense does it make for the parents to tell that to the school system?
2005.04-698,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,736.335,735.925,"In an... in an equal partnership argument, nobody's got the burden of proof."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,735.925,748.121,"Your Honor, in an equal partnership argument, nobody has the burden, because they initiated the proceeding to ask for the goal that Congress had in mind--"
2005.04-698,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.121,749.365,In all events--
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,749.365,749.896,--that the child have an IEP.
2005.04-698,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,749.896,752.342,"--in all events, it seems to me that it's still cut against you."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,772.482,773.203,They--
2005.04-698,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.203,775.951,"--than most... than most complainants, than most aggrieved persons do."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,775.951,780.063,"--Well, Your Honor, actually their discovery rights are less than what they would normally have."
2005.04-698,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,782.901,783.482,Then let--
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,783.482,783.532,--equal partners--
2005.04-698,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,783.532,785.367,--let me point... let me point out something else.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,817.01,822.586,"--Your Honor, we disagree with that, because of the structure of the Act."
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,830.017,834.137,That's a well established principle of administrative law.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,865.373,865.373,"Well, Your Honor--"
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,865.373,880.227,"--is there a... can you think of any instance, in all of administrative law, where you didn't start out with the idea that a person challenging a... an agency action that's been taken, and so forth, doesn't have the burden of proof?"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,880.227,885.732,"--Your Honor, there is no analogous case, because--"
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,885.732,886.112,That's what I--
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,886.112,886.763,--because--
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.763,887.024,"--I do think that, yeah."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,887.024,890.083,--because there is no analogous statute.
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,890.083,890.253,There isn't?
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,890.253,891.657,There's no analogous statute.
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,901.355,901.556,All right.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,934.339,934.539,Well--
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,934.539,935.41,"--""# in equipoise""?"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,935.41,938.638,"--Your Honor, I don't... I don't know how many times the hearing officer has said that."
2005.04-698,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,948.476,954.453,"May I ask you, before you get to your three reasons, to go back to your... something that you said?"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,974.072,974.252,In this--
2005.04-698,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,974.252,977.391,--the school district did come forward.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,989.697,997.972,"--Your Honor, I believe that the typical procedure would be that the... whichever party has the burden of proof would go first."
2005.04-698,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,997.972,999.767,"But you said, in this case--"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,999.767,999.849,It--
2005.04-698,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,999.849,1001.484,--the school district went first.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1001.484,1001.815,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-698,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1008.535,1014.662,"So, now, as a result of the fourth circuit's decision, do the parents always go first--"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1014.662,1015.233,--Oh--
2005.04-698,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1015.233,1016.184,--and not the school district?
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1028.491,1037.299,"--Your Honor, the typical rule is, obviously, that whichever party has the burden of proof in that proceeding would go first, but--"
2005.04-698,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1037.299,1054.168,"So, you think the ALJ... or the administrative hearing officer in this case told the State to go first... the school district to go first because he thought that maybe they had burden of proof, and would not have asked them to go first if he didn't?"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1054.168,1058.278,"--Your Honor, there was a... it's unclear why he had them go first."
2005.04-698,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1079.929,1082.324,"So, but you're saying this... this is an ad hoc thing."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1085.062,1093.367,"--Your Honor, the general practice would be that whoever has the burden of proof, the burden of persuasion, would also be the one to go first and go last."
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.903,1175.388,"--And it's only play money, right?"
2005.04-698,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1175.388,1176.732,"Isn't the question, Who's going to pay for it?"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1184.183,1193.741,"--Well, not in that case, where the... my hypothetical was, where the hearing officer has awarded services--"
2005.04-698,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.741,1198.665,But isn't it true that many of these fights occur after much of the education has already taken place--
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1198.665,1200.639,"--Your Honor, because of--"
2005.04-698,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.639,1200.639,--and they're fighting about who pays for it?
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1200.639,1211.972,"--the wheels of justice grind slowly... sometimes they do, but they... the key point here is, look at what happens if the hearing officer denies services the child needs."
2005.04-698,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.633,1225.813,"Well, that's--"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1225.813,1226.124,--to the child--
2005.04-698,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.124,1230.156,"--that's not true if the parents can afford to pay for it, and have, in fact, paid for it."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1235.602,1235.712,"--Your Honor, in most cases--"
2005.04-698,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.712,1236.943,--not in all cases.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1236.943,1237.187,--it would be true.
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.764,1263.475,"Mr. Hurd, here's--"
2005.04-698,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.475,1262.764,This is true.
2005.04-698,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.764,1269.102,--here's my problem with your assertion that we have to decide it in the way that furthers the purposes of the statute.
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1309.137,1321.353,"--Your Honor, my purpose is not to minimize the monetary interests involved, but it is to focus the Court's attention on the aspect of it that Congress had focused on."
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1336.519,1337.49,"All right, that's true."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1390.177,1394.298,"--Well, Your Honor, those cases would not arise under the IDEA--"
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1394.298,1396.383,"Wouldn't it, if it were related to the placement?"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1396.383,1400.476,"--Your Honor, your hypothetical did not change the child's placement."
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1400.476,1418.126,"No, no, I say that there are a number of... what I'm thinking of is a lot of interim decisions that come up that are affecting how the child is placed... whether in class, whether in that class, whether with a special teacher, whether without a special teacher, whether with somebody during the recess periods, whether not."
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1426.694,1434.498,"Your Honor, the initial matters you discussed... sent to the back of the room... the IDEA is not implicated there."
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1442.15,1456.431,"What I'm driving at is... and I think it was well expressed in one of these cases, a New Jersey case, perhaps... but is it the same burden of proof whether the matter is interstitial or whether it's an initial placement or a change of--"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1456.431,1457.014,"--Yes, sir."
2005.04-698,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1457.014,1461.307,"--placement? Do we have the same burden of proof always on the school board, no matter what?"
2005.04-698,0,45023,william_h_hurd,,1461.307,1462.459,"I understand your question, Your Honor."

2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1650.723,1656.029,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-698,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1678.264,1687.299,"This is a case where the parents unilaterally decided to move the child to a private school, and then they sought tuition reimbursement?"
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1687.299,1688.014,"--That's correct, Justice--"
2005.04-698,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1688.014,1688.224,Yes.
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1688.224,1688.665,--O'Connor.
2005.04-698,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1692.194,1692.194,As I understand it--
2005.04-698,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.194,1696.254,"You don't contend the rule would be different if we were... if it was all prospective, do you?"
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1696.254,1697.588,--No.
2005.04-698,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1743.682,1751.864,"--Before we... you go onto the argument, your answer to Justice O'Connor, if I remember the facts correctly, wasn't quite right."
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1776.38,1778.867,"--Justice Ginsburg, that's correct."
2005.04-698,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1799.839,1806.136,"Which the parents didn't think was acceptable and, in the interim, placed the child in another private school."
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1812.253,1835.272,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, except that the record does show that, during the time that the IEP was being developed, the parents applied for the child to attend a private school and actually accepted an application fee and enrolled the child in that school, and the ALJ in this case found that the parents had made a predetermined decision to send the student to child... the student--"
2005.04-698,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1835.272,1835.472,I thought--

2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1858.528,1862.63,"--Your Honor, there are three situations in which the school district can be the complaining party."
2005.04-698,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.59,1875.769,"Now, why would the school district have to take any action?"
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1876.51,1879.971,"Well, under the statute--"
2005.04-698,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.971,1880.242,"--just say,"
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1883.85,1890.451,--The Congress placed on school districts the obligation to identify disabled children within their jurisdiction.
2005.04-698,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.451,1890.801,Right.
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1890.801,1902.848,"And when they have... they believe they identified such children, and they request the parents to subject them to the evaluation... Congress placed on the school districts to at least conduct an evaluation in that situation, and if parents disagree--"
2005.04-698,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.848,1903.258,Okay.
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1903.258,1910.038,--school districts can initiate. The second situation is in... is where children act up in the classroom.
2005.04-698,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1978.131,1994.409,"--Mr. Garre, do you have any numbers, overall, how... of the incidence of the parents going to the administrative hearing first, as opposed to the school district?"
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2001.941,2005.01,"Your Honor, I don't have those statistics."
2005.04-698,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2040.055,2069.254,"When we go back to the... an answer you gave before, when we were going through what, in fact, happened, the suggestion that maybe the parents were just trying to get the private school tuition reimbursed, the... there was a finding, wasn't there, in the district court, in the... this is in the petitioner's appendix, at 46 and 47... the district court said,"
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2078.922,2080.956,"--The... Your Honor, that's correct."
2005.04-698,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2104.757,2110.213,"Well, if I take... if I accept your view of that, that would be a Federal rule written into the statute."
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2149.931,2153.552,"--Yes, Your Honor, and, in fact, we've suggested that."
2005.04-698,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2153.993,2159.026,"Well, you haven't suggested leaving it up to each State, because you're suggesting a uniform rule."
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2160.18,2165.736,"--Well, Your Honor, to be clear, we think that this... that the statute establishes a Federal floor."
2005.04-698,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.052,2171.303,"Oh, it's just--"
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2171.303,2171.844,--unless--
2005.04-698,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.844,2172.034,--a default rule.
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2172.034,2172.796,--Exactly.
2005.04-698,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2173.377,2173.567,All right.
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2177.93,2178.342,--And that--
2005.04-698,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2178.342,2184.008,"But then, why not, here, send it back and say that the ALJ tried to answer the wrong question?"
2005.04-698,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2195.21,2198.999,"Well, is there any doubt, here, that there's no State law?"
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2198.999,2204.978,"--No, Your Honor, and I believe you just heard Mr. Hurd acknowledge that there is no statute or regulation on this."
2005.04-698,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.978,2206.643,"--No, but I've never heard of a State without law."
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2207.254,2207.736,Well--
2005.04-698,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.736,2208.868,--black hole in the law--
2005.04-698,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2208.868,2211.586,On the burden of proof in IEP cases--
2005.04-698,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2211.586,2211.766,--Well--
2005.04-698,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2211.766,2212.738,--I should have said.
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2212.738,2217.621,"--And, Your Honor, the Maryland case law adopts a traditional rule for administrative proceedings."
2005.04-698,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2223.53,2225.896,"These cases are appealed to Federal courts normally, aren't they?"
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2225.896,2230.641,--These cases... the Congress gave them the right to bring a civil action in Federal court.
2005.04-698,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.641,2230.971,In Federal courts.
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2239.637,2248.011,"Well, Your Honor, I think... we analogize it to the question of the substantive amount of benefits to which parents are entitled under the Act."
2005.04-698,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2280.567,2281.128,It's not hypothetical.
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2290.587,2290.968,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-698,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2302.03,2302.22,Well--
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2302.22,2302.03,--Minnesota has said that--

2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2328.248,2332.318,"--Well, Your Honor, because of the spending clause nature of the legislation."
2005.04-698,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2333.764,2334.285,"Well, would you--"
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2334.285,2339.408,--this establishes a Federal floor that States can go beyond if they want to assume more costs under the Act.
2005.04-698,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.408,2345.234,"--Well, you have a statute that... you know, it's in... it's in great detail... on administrative procedures."
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2360.979,2366.365,"Well, Justice Scalia, we agree, in the sense that we think that the statute establishes at least a default rule."
2005.04-698,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2386.133,2386.995,May I--
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2386.995,2387.176,That would be--
2005.04-698,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2387.176,2387.947,--ask this question?
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2418.327,2438.758,"--Well, Justice Stevens, Congress has answered that problem, in the sense that it requires, in response to a complaint, the school district to submit the proposed... the IEP, the educational plan, it's adopted, as well as the other considerations... the other options it considered and why it didn't accept those other options."
2005.04-698,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2443.051,2443.331,Right.

2005.04-698,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.167,2454.4,"But then, at the hearing, who... who introduces the first exhibit or the first witness?"
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2454.4,2463.828,"--Well, the way it's done in the States right now is, where, in the jurisdictions where school districts bear the burden of persuasion, they are required to go first."
2005.04-698,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.954,2486.755,May I ask this?
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2492.492,2495.931,"--I don't know the answer to that question, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-698,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2498.567,2500.324,"I know, analytically, it's a different issue."
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2505.037,2511.104,"That's absolutely correct, and that's certainly the way that we think it would... it would, more preferably, operate under the statute."
2005.04-698,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2538.927,2539.137,--Why?
2005.04-698,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2563.668,2576.929,"--The... we would agree with you, Justice Breyer, but, in practice, many of these cases, the dispute is over the provision of experimental therapies for children with disabilities, particularly children with autism, where medically and educationally--"
