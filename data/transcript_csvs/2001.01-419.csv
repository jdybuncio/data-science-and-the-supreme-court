2001.01-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.197,"We'll hear argument now in No. 01-419, City of Columbus v. Ours Garage and Wrecker Service, Inc.-- Mr. Sutton."
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,10.197,13.707,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,98.579,107.329,"Well, I think the argument on the other side, Mr. Sutton, is that the first section (a)(1) does say, no State or political subdivision thereof and no interstate agency."
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,119.961,120.87,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,159.713,164.793,Would your argument be the same if the State had not made a specific delegation?
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,166.938,181.983,"Actually it did, although it's... it's backwards, in the sense that they generally regulate all motor carriers at the State level, but they exempted tow trucks, therefore allowing political subdivisions like Columbus to enact their own tow truck ordinances."
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.546,213.378,"Mr. Sutton, would... would you look a little further down in, in the provision set forth in the appendix to your brief?"
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,219.118,219.778,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.778,223.698,"--in which it says, shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State."
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,228.694,229.438,No.
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.097,232.343,All right.
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,243.638,244.214,Right.
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.214,257.505,"Again, it uses the same... shall not restrict, does not apply to the authority of a State, or a political subdivision of a State, to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision."
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,271.131,271.912,We're not saying--
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,271.912,273.11,You wouldn't have--
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,273.11,273.36,--We're not--
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.36,274.407,--you wouldn't have needed that language there.
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,274.407,275.999,--We're not saying States are political subdivisions.
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.117,290.571,Well--
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,290.571,294.841,--style in 1995 modified the 1994 act.
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,296.061,302.338,--I think we always look at an act in toto and... and don't try to piece it apart as to what was enacted when.
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,305.449,307.457,"--That's... that's true, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.887,315.291,"It doesn't modify it, but it... it can give clear indication of what... of what it meant."
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,321.879,322.605,--Right.
2001.01-419,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,371.069,386.795,"Mr. Sutton, are you making the distinction there between the safety regulations which would be covered under (c)(2) and the economic regulation which would be the main prohibition?"
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,386.795,387.416,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,427.95,429.026,There's a--
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,429.026,429.686,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2001.01-419,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.686,439.55,"--There's a question I think that still would be left open even if you prevail; that is, whether these regulations are appropriately characterized as economic or safety."
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,441.325,441.697,Absolutely.
2001.01-419,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.697,443.554,But that hasn't been adjudicated yet.
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,443.554,444.176,Absolutely.
2001.01-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,497.962,498.805,Where... where exactly is (c)(2)(A)?
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,498.805,501.39,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.495,584.731,"Well, but it's not defined."
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,590.387,591.956,"That's not our argument, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.664,594.391,I understand it's not your argument.
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,594.391,595.3,--We're not saying--
2001.01-419,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.3,596.21,It would be a stronger argument if that were your argument.
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,598.106,598.932,"--I... I disagree, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,622.255,631.709,"Well, in that connection, I was going to ask could this... suppose that you do not prevail in this case and we accept the respondents' interpretation."
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,661.636,663.122,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,664.32,666.837,"So, then we're not arguing about very much in your view."
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,666.837,671.378,"--Well, Your Honor, that would strike me as an extraordinary hoop for Congress to ask the States to step through."
2001.01-419,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,683.806,688.014,There's a... there's a problem with cities when you get to safety regulation for trucks.
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,695.982,697.013,Right.
2001.01-419,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,698.666,700.068,On routes.
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,700.068,700.357,Right.
2001.01-419,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,723.846,729.335,"Yes, but I mean, there's a long history in the ICC of trying to create, say, dynamite truck routes."
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,759.346,773.629,"Well, hazardous... I... I don't think the general rule has been that either the Federal Government or the States have been concerned about heavily populated regions deciding, for example, to route hazardous materials around their beltway as opposed to through the middle."
2001.01-419,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,782.258,784.049,But I'm looking for specifically--
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,784.049,804.565,"--In a size and weight situation, of course, you're going to situations where bridges or particular roads in, you know, densely populated areas require different rules than in rural regions of a State where, for example, the roads are bigger and even if they're not bigger, they're not as near to either businesses or heavily populated areas."
2001.01-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,804.565,812.573,"--How about a restriction that on a particular residential street that's, nonetheless, an arterial highway, no trucks over 10 tons?"
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,812.573,831.875,"Could... could a... a... the question, first of all, would be whether that relates to interstate commerce, and if it relates to interstate commerce... that is, commerce between States... then the Department of Transportation is... is going to very heavily regulate that particular route restriction and... and has authority to preempt it, even as a matter of regulation."
2001.01-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.051,859.634,"Mr. Sutton, can I ask you, do you regard... just assume the... assume the other side is right on their interpretation."
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,864.818,873.856,"It is, Your Honor, but title 49... I think it's 31147... specifically says that traffic laws... I think a speeding limit would fall under that--"
2001.01-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.856,874.888,It would be a traffic law?
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,874.888,885.745,"--is something that the Department of Transportation does not regulate and neither does Congress, which to me is one more indicator that you don't, after 1994, start having free-form debates about what safety means."
2001.01-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.745,895.033,"But even if the... if it's not federally regulated, would there, nevertheless, not be preemption under their interpretation of this provision of speed limit rules?"
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,895.033,896.519,On what ground?
2001.01-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,899.408,900.606,No.
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,904.404,906.096,As... I see what you're saying.
2001.01-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.096,913.154,--as... as saying only States are... can... are... preserve the right to... to regulate safety--
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,913.154,914.269,Right.
2001.01-419,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.269,918.977,--it seems to me that would preempt a local government's right to fix a 15-mile limit in a school zone.
2001.01-419,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,918.977,920.668,I understand what you're saying.
2001.01-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,980.771,981.326,"Very well, Mr. Sutton."
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,983.145,1002.131,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The phrase, safety regulatory authority of a State, in section 14501(c)(2)(A) is most naturally read to encompass the State's traditional authority to delegate its powers to political subdivisions."
2001.01-419,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.619,1028.031,"We understand all that, of course."
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1060.543,1063.226,I guess there are about three responses we would make.
2001.01-419,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.393,1078.914,Right.
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1078.914,1084.624,"--petitioners' brief, it refers to the authority of a State or a political subdivision of a State to enact or enforce a law."
2001.01-419,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1151.565,1159.284,Has there been any... what's the closest case respondents could cite to show a contrary practice?
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1159.284,1163.636,I believe the respondents have cited a couple of court of appeals cases which have held--
2001.01-419,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1163.636,1164.196,From this Court?
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1164.196,1165.207,--None from this Court.
2001.01-419,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.797,1185.828,"Well, there are many Federal statutes that... that make grants to municipalities for various functions and don't make it to the State."
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1216.869,1227.726,We cited the Lee Deadwood case in our brief as support for the proposition that Congress would constitutionally be authorized to preempt municipal law without preempting State law if it chose.
2001.01-419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1234.042,1244.733,"Mr. Stewart, would you be able to give us any examples of municipal safety regulations that are preempted by this section as it's been interpreted below?"
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1244.733,1248.614,We... I think that as it's been interpreted--
2001.01-419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1248.614,1249.563,As a practical matter?
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1249.563,1263.559,"--As it's been interpreted below, I believe the types of regulations that have been held preempted are... are fairly similar to the City of Columbus's regulation, namely, a licensing scheme in which the vehicle is inspected, the driver is tested to ensure proficiency in the operation of the vehicle."
2001.01-419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1268.593,1271.111,"So, we're really talking about licensing schemes."
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1278.42,1290.159,"--I... I think that the licensing scheme, while we would respect Ohio's decision to delegate that to municipalities, it... in truth I think this is something that could fairly realistically be accomplished at the State level."
2001.01-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.203,1325.519,"Mr. Stewart, before your time goes out, will you give us your third point too?"
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1327.005,1338.894,"--The third point is that to the extent that the provision at issue here is ambiguous and the Court wants to interpret it by reference to other relevant statutory provisions, it is important to examine the larger statutory context."
2001.01-419,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.344,1416.747,Who... who administers this statute?
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1421.455,1425.913,--There... there is no Federal agency entrusted with the administration of this particular statute.
2001.01-419,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1499.967,1503.311,May I ask this question on the division of responsibility?
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1510.619,1512.31,That's correct.
2001.01-419,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1516.108,1530.431,"To what extent, Mr. Stewart, does the Department of Transportation... you said there's no administrator of the statute, but they do have authority under the motor safety... motor carrier safety assistance program that seems to be relevant."
2001.01-419,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1530.431,1544.921,"The motor carrier safety assistance program, and they also have authority under other provisions of title 49 to review and declare to be preempted State and local laws... State and local safety laws that apply to transportation in interstate commerce."
2001.01-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.778,1557.802,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2001.01-419,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1559.965,1576.954,"Mr. Cordray, I hope you'll tell us the practical effects of the decision below."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1576.954,1593.673,"The practical effect of the decision below, as you uncovered it in your questioning earlier, is that Federal law preempts municipalities and other local governments from imposing their own individual licensing schemes upon motor carriers of property and that is--"
2001.01-419,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1593.673,1598.381,"Well, it also speaks to routes or weight limitations."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1612.432,1624.797,"--Size and weight limitations, as the other matters addressed in (c)(2)(A), would be regulated at the State level, not at the local level under the proper reading of this statute."
2001.01-419,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1638.544,1647.46,"So that if a city says no trucks through the park with the public playground between certain hours, that has to be the... the State?"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1648.369,1659.31,"That could be done at the State level and it could be done either by going to the State legislature, as you suggested, or it could be done by setting up a very simple administrative scheme at the State level where you would go to the State department--"
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1659.31,1660.092,"Well, why would--"
2001.01-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1660.092,1661.168,"--Well, most cities I've been in had--"
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.168,1668.077,"--why would Congress choose to... to regulate in that way, say we want the State to do it but not the locality?"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1668.077,1671.942,--Specifically because they were trying to deregulate this market nationwide.
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.719,1678.275,No.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1687.296,1701.292,"--Again, I think that petitioners agree and all the courts have agreed that every subsection of (c)(2)(A) has to be read together, and to the extent municipal authority is being preempted in one respect, it's being preempted in all."
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1718.299,1719.618,May I ask a similar question?
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1732.128,1735.965,--Certainly they could.
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.475,1740.218,No.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1741.249,1745.253,--statute--
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1745.253,1746.246,They figure it's... it's dangerous because the thing is too deep and the trucks have to over-set... overturn or something like that.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1746.246,1748.225,--They... they would be... they would be diverting--
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1748.225,1749.256,"It would be preempted, I guess."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1749.256,1750.082,--They would be... no.
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.981,1756.937,"Supposing... truck size traffic, yes."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1756.937,1759.659,"Yes, but... but it's not directed simply to motor carriers of property."
2001.01-419,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1773.571,1778.335,"Well, then what about the... the answer that you gave earlier to the question that the Chief Justice and I had?"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1792.89,1798.008,--Let me step back.
2001.01-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1842.386,1847.049,"I understand that, but I'm at the same question that I think everyone has asked."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1926.554,1927.214,--All right.
2001.01-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.87,1933.613,It has nothing to do with this case.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1937.411,1937.95,Yes.
2001.01-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1937.95,1945.419,--at the moment I'm thinking all this traditional regulation of what street you can use if you're a truck is being wiped out.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1949.3,1950.043,"It could be dealt with either of two ways, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1970.41,1972.994,Motor carriers of property or just motor carriers?
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1972.994,1974.563,--Motor carriers of property which is what--
2001.01-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1974.563,1982.736,"In other words, if they... if they don't say on the street motor carriers of property cannot use this, then it's not preempted."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1982.736,1989.795,"--Then it is a general traffic regulation no different from where the speed limit says 55 miles per hour and trucks have to obey it, just as cars do."
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.622,1998.174,"Well, does the term, motor carriers of property... does that mean motor carriers of property for hire or any motor carrier that is carrying property?"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1998.174,2002.715,"--Well, it would be those who come within the terms of this specific preemption clause."
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.715,2003.997,"Yes, that's what I want to know."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2005.195,2005.788,Yes.
2001.01-419,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2011.26,2021.374,"So... so, if a State were to say all prices of all trucks in this State have to be $50... all trucks... and they don't say motor carriers of property, that's not preempted."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2021.374,2024.431,"No, that is not correct because it's specifically referenced--"
2001.01-419,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2024.431,2025.257,"Of course, it's not correct."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2028.246,2028.805,--Yes.
2001.01-419,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2028.805,2032.604,"--and they don't say motor carriers of property, it's the same."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2032.604,2033.469,The reason is... no.
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.668,2065.047,"Mr. Cordray, on this point, look at on page A-2, (c)(1), the general rule."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2069.839,2070.704,Right.
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.704,2072.19,Where are you reading from?
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.19,2079.248,"I'm reading on page A-2, (c)(1), the general rule from which (c)(2) is... is an exception."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2114.338,2117.432,"I believe it does, Your Honor, and it's just... it's just--"
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.432,2122.816,"Well, that would make it a very narrow provision then, wouldn't it, that... that we're excluding the... the municipalities from?"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2122.816,2123.831,--I believe it is.
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2123.831,2130.314,They just couldn't say you're not allowed to use this street to carry... to carry moving goods or--
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2130.314,2131.921,This is a key point.
2001.01-419,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2131.921,2146.039,"--But you're... you're asking... you're asking us to... to have a very careful grammatically correct reading of the act, and in your answer that... that you've just given to Justice Scalia, transportation of property is preceded by an or."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2153.719,2154.584,With--
2001.01-419,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2154.584,2162.469,"So, I'm not sure the qualification you urge on us, in order to mitigate the effects of this holding works."
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.469,2164.965,"Well, I don't know what it would go to if it didn't go to that."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2189.757,2191.902,--And the title of the provision is motor carriers of property.
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2200.652,2202.304,"--It's not the best statute, is it?"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2202.304,2203.147,I beg your pardon?
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.147,2204.617,It's not the best statute.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2205.648,2208.62,"It's... it's clear enough with respect to the things we care about here, which is that--"
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.62,2211.033,"Well, but I don't think it is."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2211.033,2215.596,--Congress very carefully attempted to distinguish between a State and a political subdivision of a State.
2001.01-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2222.078,2223.564,There's not a word of legislative history I take it--
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.564,2234.05,"--If you read (c)(1) as narrowly as you're suggesting, you don't even need the exemption because it only relates to law, regulation, or other provision related to price, route, or service."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2236.401,2237.97,"--No, that's not true, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2255.803,2257.085,"But, Mr. Cordray, that's open."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2313.843,2315.163,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2334.732,2347.857,"So, it's strictly a question of form that we're dealing with, that States, you can delegate to your cities, as you always have, just say, cities, what do you want and we'll give it to you by enacting a State law."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2347.857,2348.561,No.
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.193,2477.207,"Their... their answer is that... that when you speak of the regulatory authority of a State, that naturally connotes the authority to... to delegate that to... to municipalities."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2502.757,2505.054,"Two reasons why that does not work, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2516.942,2517.435,"Wait, wait."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2517.974,2521.317,"--Well, regulatory authority is the phrase used in the first subclause--"
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.317,2521.81,Right.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2521.81,2522.925,--of (c)(2)(A) related to safety.
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2522.925,2523.225,Yes.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2523.225,2525.154,But they're not talking about authority to regulate.
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2568.705,2578.281,"No, but (c)(1) uses may enact or enforce just as... as (c)(2)(C) does, whereas (c)(2)(A) does not."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2584.226,2585.59,"--That's correct, which is a telling point."
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.523,2601.937,"Well, if... but if you didn't add the political subdivision in those States and if you had a home rule State, then a local government could... would not be affected by it."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2601.937,2610.604,"No, not correct because their notion is that State includes delegating to its local government as a delegated power from the State."
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2614.585,2622.204,"When you described the regulatory... regulatory authority in gross as you do in (2)(A), then it would apply to the authority to delegate."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2631.946,2634.092,"Well, I don't believe it is, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.033,2651.842,"Well, don't you agree that if you didn't have all the other subdivisions in here, that would be the normal reading of regulatory authority, which would include the authority to delegate?"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2651.842,2655.436,--I would agree that if (c)(2)(A) alone were the statute--
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.436,2656.012,Correct.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2656.012,2657.415,--that would be a sensible reading.
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2668.067,2673.285,"Yes, but in one... but in one provision, they say regulatory authority, which has a plain meaning that you'd be... brings a result you disagree with."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2678.758,2679.789,--But it doesn't--
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.789,2681.814,"If you don't refer to political subdivision, it just wouldn't include it."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2681.814,2683.133,--It doesn't have a plain meaning.
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2692.216,2692.709,No.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2697.146,2697.705,--Correct.
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2702.369,2716.737,(c)(2)(A) at the bottom of page A-2 in the same sentence uses this shall not restrict the safety regulatory a State... authority of a State with respect... or the authority of a State.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2719.709,2720.656,That was my point.
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2724.66,2725.94,"Well, obviously, I... I missed it, so say it again."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2726.972,2727.511,"--Well, that's exactly right."
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.027,2730.399,Where?
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2731.719,2733.455,--We're talking about (c)(2)(A).
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2733.455,2734.114,At the bottom of page A-2.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2734.114,2738.118,This is a point I tried to make earlier and I did not make it as clearly as the Chief Justice just did.
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.118,2738.572,I didn't get it.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2738.572,2749.718,"But they're attempting to give some special meaning to the phrase safety regulatory authority, but by their own argument, that can't follow because they want to... they have to read all these provisions the same way."
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.152,2753.433,The authority of a State.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2753.433,2757.354,"--to the authority of a State, nothing about safety, nothing about regulatory, and has to be read in the same fashion."
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.238,2774.898,You're too fast for me.
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.18,2778.12,At the very end of that provision.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2778.12,2779.895,--It's the third subclause in (2)(A).
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.895,2780.721,(2)(A).
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.721,2781.502,"Oh, in... in (2)(A), okay."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2781.502,2800.616,"And that is completely at odds with the statute because in 14504, which this Court is going to take up in a case called Yellow Freight next term, it says specifically there... Congress said even 50 registrations by motor carriers of property in different States for insurance purposes is too many for our taste."
2001.01-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2801.647,2802.762,"Well, what about the middle one?"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2805.834,2806.477,--Yes.
2001.01-419,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2806.477,2821.505,"Now, I can't figure out, for the life of me, how... why Congress would have wanted to say the State can impose limitations on the use of highways, but the city cannot impose limitations on the use of streets."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2824.477,2833.022,"That would be one respect, Your Honor, in which either... if it was a general traffic regulation, then it would not be preempted at all."
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2837.109,2846.025,"I thought part of your argument was also that streets are not highways, and I'm surprised you didn't make that point when we were talking about the... you know, no trucks on a school street or something like that."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2855.063,2860.802,"--Arguably it could be, but I believe for purposes of title 49, it's a defined term to include streets."
2001.01-419,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2868.149,2870.174,And you found not a word... am I right?
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2884.125,2886.065,One way or the other.
2001.01-419,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2887.635,2888.294,Is that right?
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2888.294,2889.78,--generally are not within the preemption clause.
2001.01-419,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2889.78,2890.608,"No, no."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2892.67,2893.124,Yes.
2001.01-419,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2894.034,2897.311,"And I'm having trouble, and therefore I... I just sometimes look at the legislative history--"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2897.311,2897.682,"--Yes, I understand."
2001.01-419,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2897.682,2898.159,--to try to figure it out.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2900.283,2903.322,The legislative history here is confused and somewhat unilluminating.
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.322,2904.847,--I guess we'll have to use the statute.
2001.01-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2905.923,2917.207,"Mr. Cordray, is there... is there an example... any other example of a Federal statute... I mean, it is unusual to say, States, you can no longer decide how your authority is going to be exercised."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2935.311,2937.169,There are two responses to that question.
2001.01-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2951.248,2951.908,"Well, that's a State... that's... that's--"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2951.908,2954.053,--May I--
2001.01-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2954.053,2958.8,--Congress giving money to a municipality.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2964.001,2967.056,"--I know of none, but this is a new departure for Congress."
2001.01-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2983.199,2994.344,"Since it was... since you say it's singular and this is new, wouldn't you expect Congress to make a clear statement that the State may not delegate this authority because--"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2994.344,3004.414,"--Congress did make a clear statement by including the term, political subdivision, whenever it wanted political subdivisions to either have authority or be restricted in that authority, and then specifically speaking only to States here."
2001.01-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3009.615,3013.702,--And the State may not delegate this authority to a political subdivision.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3020.555,3025.552,"They could have used the term State everywhere alone and then said, State but not political subdivision, here."
2001.01-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3047.76,3048.791,The executive branch.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3070.067,3073.6,--That's a... that's a statement I couldn't disagree with more strongly.
2001.01-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3078.529,3081.856,They've not conceded the Department of Transportation... you... deserves no respect.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3081.856,3098.387,"--The... the notion that a deregulatory statute that took governmental entities out of an area to create a free market would now be subject to umpiring by the Federal agency, in terms of the scope of preemption, which is an issue this Court has always said is for the courts to determine--"
2001.01-419,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3098.387,3099.234,I didn't say umpiring.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3115.293,3116.613,--Their construction is to leave them as an umpire.
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3143.362,3144.105,"Well, if... if you lose, you know--"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3144.105,3145.303,--in any of their prior--
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3145.303,3149.678,"--If you're changing your argument... you know, if you lost in the lower court, you'd probably be well advised to change your argument."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3150.215,3152.445,"--I wouldn't disagree with that, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3153.393,3179.937,"Mr. Cordray, what... what about the point made that if... if you accept your interpretation, municipalities not only would not be able to enact regulations themselves, they would not be able to enforce regulations adopted by the... by the State, which would be a great inconvenience, that the only enforcement can be by the State police and not by local... local police."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3179.937,3184.312,"--We agree, but that's not what this preemption clause is about or any preemption clause is ever about."
2001.01-419,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3210.607,3225.839,"If we think this statute is... that there are arguments either way for interpreting it, shouldn't we pay heed to the petitioners' point that it's a very serious matter for the Congress of the United States to tell States how they should govern themselves?"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3225.839,3230.669,"We think the language of the statute is clear here, Your Honor."
2001.01-419,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3232.981,3235.006,Let's... let's say we... we disagree with that.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3253.332,3254.036,--No.
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3296.511,3301.052,It seems to me your argument boils down to the point that there are 10 provisions in the statute.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3308.65,3310.357,"No, that's not what it boils down."
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3310.357,3311.0,That's about all it amounts to.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3311.0,3315.559,"It boils down to the fact that Congress deliberately inserted a phrase here, political subdivision of a State, so that it can preempt--"
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3315.559,3316.573,"In the... in the nine, right."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3316.573,3317.566,--And... and it--
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.566,3320.0,"If you just read the one all by itself, it's perfectly clear too."
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3320.0,3329.205,"--Well, it's... it is clear, I believe, because it's clear because they said a State cannot... a political subdivision cannot--"
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3329.205,3329.865,But the only reason--
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3329.865,3331.722,--and they state the authority of a State to do certain things.
2001.01-419,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3331.722,3335.232,--The only support you have is they're not as detailed and specific in the one in question as they are in the other nine.
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3335.232,3336.552,No.
2001.01-419,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3349.434,3352.117,"Your support is the context of the statute, which--"
2001.01-419,2,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3352.117,3353.642,No.
2001.01-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3355.683,3356.986,"--Thank you, Mr. Cordray."
2001.01-419,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3359.298,3363.635,I'd like to respond to a few of the points--
2001.01-419,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3363.635,3366.357,"Mr. Sutton, could you ask one... answer one factual question for me?"
2001.01-419,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3378.905,3379.443,--Yes.
2001.01-419,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3379.443,3380.391,And that would be a crazy scheme.
2001.01-419,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3391.416,3394.675,"No, Your Honor, not in... in the insurance area."
2001.01-419,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3450.132,3455.067,"The same problem, you didn't, is... to me anyway, is... is (3)(A)."
2001.01-419,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3473.604,3474.097,Right.
2001.01-419,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3474.097,3474.94,--and he put in political subdivision.
2001.01-419,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3490.733,3491.204,Right.
2001.01-419,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3500.392,3501.014,That's the answer.
2001.01-419,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3501.014,3502.044,"That's the answer, number one."
2001.01-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3540.971,3544.231,"Well, what's... what's Congress's authority to regulate intrastate commerce?"
2001.01-419,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3544.231,3549.433,"It's at its outer edges, and that to me is what is so odd about this particular interpretation."
2001.01-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3583.407,3584.15,"Thank you, Mr. Sutton."
