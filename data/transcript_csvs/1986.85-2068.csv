1986.85-2068,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.388,"We will hear this argument in Case No. 85-2085, Walter H. Rankin, Etc."
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,68.862,93.463,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, chronologically developing our case, on January 12, 1981, Constable Rankin, who represents one of the eight constable precincts in Harris County appointed a new deputy, Ardith McPherson."
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,358.003,362.002,Is that also the man that sweeps the floor?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,362.002,364.922,"I did not hear you, sir."
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,364.922,371.451,Does that also include the man that sweeps the floor in the constable's office?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,371.451,373.169,"No, sir, it does not."
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,373.169,374.777,"Well, how far down does it go?"
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,374.777,375.699,All right.
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,375.699,378.213,How far down?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,378.213,381.338,The man who sweeps the floor in the constable's office is not employed by the constable.
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,389.476,402.735,Does the woman involved here do other than what every other computer operator does in the United States: feed material in by punching keys?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,407.922,408.53,--That is--
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,408.53,410.17,And that's all she does?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,410.17,412.904,"--No, we won't concede that, Your Honor."
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,415.982,418.544,What else does she do other than punch keys?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,418.544,419.31,--All right.
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,426.369,427.432,What else?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,427.432,437.365,"--That is all at this point, because this was still in her probation period, and she had not yet actually learned that job yet."
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,437.365,442.583,"I mean, you're talking about the whole county is interested in what she does and all?"
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,451.47,452.298,All right.
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,461.953,464.295,Wouldn't it be closer to thousands?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,464.295,465.95,"It may very well be, Your Honor."
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,465.95,470.777,I think we have a misunderstanding about the importance of the job.
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,481.586,483.68,All right.
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.836,533.426,"I guess it's a lucky thing then that the constable is not himself responsible for keeping the courthouse clean, which could have been the case."
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,534.036,535.676,"Which could have been the case, yes, sir."
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,539.111,542.641,--Then your argument would indeed extend to the man who swept the floor; right?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,542.641,550.295,--He would have employed a deputy who swept the floor unless there were some changes in the law that authorized him to employ the floor sweepers.
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.295,552.294,And you would be making the same argument here--
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,552.294,553.075,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.075,554.199,--because that man had the name of deputy?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,554.199,555.058,That's right.
1986.85-2068,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,639.885,643.321,"Mr. Lee, is this process, is it civil; is it criminal; is it both?"
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,643.321,645.321,"It is both, Your Honor."
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.423,788.654,"Mr. Lee, was this lady fired because of what she said or because of what she believed?"
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,796.775,797.025,"--She was, Your Honor."
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.525,799.853,I know.
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,805.835,806.491,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.491,809.615,Do we know whether she would have been fired?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,827.298,833.047,"Your Honor, I would say not, based upon two trials that we have been through in the District Court."
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.808,845.12,--she really meant it?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,845.12,846.432,--No.
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.733,881.701,"Well, we don't really know that."
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,883.232,886.387,"--There was a finding by the District Court in both trials, Your Honor."
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,886.387,887.059,That what?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,887.059,890.87,That she had said it and that she meant it.
1986.85-2068,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,890.87,892.916,"No, that isn't correct, is it?"
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,906.005,926.56,"In the end of the trial on the second trial, the retrial, the Court announced his decision, his findings of fact and conclusions of law from the bench."
1986.85-2068,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.93,939.148,What page?
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,939.148,939.945,I do not--
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.945,941.428,"25a, he says,"
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,949.755,950.739,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-2068,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.739,951.472,That's all he says.
1986.85-2068,0,17804,billy_e_lee,,968.138,970.591,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-2068,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.398,983.882,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,985.429,997.456,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-2068,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1040.424,1047.25,"Mr. Nager, that's what we have here, a firing because of what she said, not because of the kind of person she was; right?"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1057.122,1062.48,"The short answer is yes, although I'm not quite sure you can separate them out--"
1986.85-2068,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.48,1063.947,We can.
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1063.947,1066.15,--by what the constable said.
1986.85-2068,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1090.859,1097.139,"Is there reason to think she would have been fired if she had said that, but then it turned out that she didn't mean it?"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1097.139,1103.277,"The record doesn't reflect what Constable Rankin's thinking was on that subject, Justice Rehnquist."
1986.85-2068,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.277,1104.308,It was important to him.
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1106.089,1119.943,"Yes, he did, which shows that he was trying to find out whether or not she was an individual who indeed believed that it was okay to assassinate... attempt to assassinate the President, to violate criminal laws."
1986.85-2068,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1174.173,1178.875,"Would the result be different in some other kind of public officer, Mr. Nager?"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1183.826,1187.309,The clerk's office of the court system of Harris County?
1986.85-2068,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1187.309,1188.465,"Yeah, where papers are filed."
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1188.465,1195.291,"We believe the answer would be the same, Justice O'Connor, although the twist on the theory would be slightly different."
1986.85-2068,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1221.425,1223.001,What about the garbage service?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1223.001,1237.512,"--When an employee expresses approval of a violation of a serious criminal law, that is indicative of the type of expressive activity that that employee will engage in as regards to the function of the agency with which she is employed."
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1246.149,1248.821,What about the street clean-up?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1248.821,1256.256,"Once again, Justice Marshall, it is our position before this Court that--"
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1256.256,1261.644,"Well, just what harm was done to anybody by her statement?"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1264.861,1272.951,--The harm in this case is to the Government's interest in promoting the public understanding and respect for the laws of the constables.
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1272.951,1275.247,For uniformity of thought?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1275.247,1282.651,"No, Justice Marshall, not for uniformity of thought, but for understanding about the requirements of the law."
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1293.055,1293.663,You tell me; I don't know.
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1293.663,1300.442,"--A law enforcement agency is responsible for teaching the public about the requirements of the law, for emphasizing their importance."
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1300.442,1309.344,"This statement was made in an office where nobody was there but employees of that office, and it doesn't even show how many were there."
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1313.999,1319.887,It is correct... it is correct that this statement was made in an office.
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1337.414,1340.179,At that stage what was the harm done?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1340.179,1345.646,The harm at that stage was she had indicted that she would approve of violations of the criminal law.
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.238,1350.035,"Mr. Nager, may I?"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1358.44,1361.672,--I'm not aware of a law which prohibits--
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.672,1362.563,Would you make the same argument in that case?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1362.563,1363.376,--I'm sorry.
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.953,1365.875,"Would you make the same argument... Say, it wasn't Gadhafi."
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1371.856,1372.121,Yes.
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1373.715,1374.34,It would be the same?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1374.34,1375.073,"In fact, it's somewhat--"
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.073,1377.604,So we can disregard the fact that the President of the United States is involved?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1377.604,1378.041,--Yes.
1986.85-2068,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.413,1389.896,"Well, I don't know."
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1395.801,1398.362,--I was comparing one life with another.
1986.85-2068,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1398.362,1398.737,"--know,"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1403.736,1404.454,Absolutely.
1986.85-2068,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1404.454,1415.482,"And likewise, I presume, killing Al Capone isn't quite as bad as killing the President in the scheme of what is considered to be a terrible... I mean, what amounts to an attempt to bring down the government; right?"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1415.482,1417.404,"You're absolutely right, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.138,1422.419,You would make the same argument.
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1433.835,1435.007,--Yes.
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1435.007,1438.1,"And you'd even make the argument, if she said,"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1441.723,1447.19,To the extent that she is approving a violation of a criminal law--
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1447.19,1448.408,She could be fired for that.
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1448.408,1450.891,"--and that stealing a loaf of bread would constitute a violation of the criminal law, yes."
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1478.554,1481.522,"Well, following up on Justice Marshall just a minute: Who are the pupils in this case?"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1481.522,1487.084,"--The pupils in this case are her fellow employees, one."
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1487.084,1489.051,Was she ever told all of that?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1489.051,1491.002,Was she ever told--
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1491.002,1503.81,That she is a minion of the law and somebody that stands for this and that and should conduct herself in such a fashion as to not bring disrepute upon this office.
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1505.793,1507.231,--The record doesn't reflect it.
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1507.231,1509.387,"Well, don't you need it in order to argue it?"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1509.387,1510.527,"No, I don't believe it does."
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1512.23,1513.557,Yet you assume it.
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1513.557,1522.522,"--opinion in Arnett versus Kennedy specifically says... in a context of public employees cases, we don't need a detailed code of procedure and substantive rules."
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1522.522,1523.022,"I didn't say ""detailed""."
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1533.769,1535.394,That is true.
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1539.252,1540.877,You know there wasn't any other reason.
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1540.877,1544.593,"Yes, Justice Marshall, that's true."
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1545.359,1547.248,"Suppose she had advocated,"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1553.575,1557.136,--We would say that she could be discharged for that.
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1557.136,1558.182,Really?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1558.182,1559.12,Yes.
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1563.728,1569.71,"How many have been discharged for that in Texas, in Houston?"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1569.71,1571.835,--I do not know the answer to that.
1986.85-2068,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1571.835,1572.46,You can't name one?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1572.46,1574.365,I certainly cannot.
1986.85-2068,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.532,1644.125,"If she were an employee in the Interior Department, that would be okay then; right?"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1644.125,1645.859,"--""That"" being?"
1986.85-2068,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1645.859,1646.686,The same thing.
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1651.231,1688.139,"Now, as I tried to... in response to Justice O'Connor's question... say, although we think it would be a different case, we would be willing to defend it on the theory that by expressing approval of such a serious act as a violation of a criminal law as approval of murder, that, in fact, that would be an indicator that a public employer could use to acknowledge and determine that this employee of the Interior Department is not one who would carry out to the best of his or her abilities the functions of the Interior Department."
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1688.139,1689.653,May I ask another question?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1699.59,1720.112,"That's a good question, and I think it will point out, hopefully, a good part of our answer is that the issue is: Does the expressive activity indicate that that employee is one who will act inconsistently with the function of the agency today, such that if the statement could be reasonably understood--"
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.112,1725.422,That the employee would act... You think this is a suggestion that this person would try to kill the President?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1725.422,1727.187,"--No, no, not at all."
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1727.187,1727.422,Oh?
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1727.422,1735.389,We did not at all suggest that this individual was making any threat on the life of the President or that she was actively encouraging anyone.
1986.85-2068,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1745.495,1746.386,You're changing the hypothetical a little.
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1753.853,1759.616,--We think that... I'd have to say that we would think that she could be discharged for that.
1986.85-2068,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.698,1793.617,"Well, didn't the Court of Appeals say something more?"
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1793.617,1797.975,It focused on the--
1986.85-2068,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.975,1806.862,"It says there has to be... Her statement not only has to be inconsistent with the mission of the agency, but inconsistent with her role in the agency's function."
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1806.862,1807.049,--Right.
1986.85-2068,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.331,1816.923,"And there was this low-level employee, the Court of Appeals said to balances... that she should be able to make this kind of a political speech."
1986.85-2068,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1816.923,1828.872,"--And we're suggesting that this is, (a), not an appropriate inquiry for the court to be making, that that is something in the discretion of the employer, the employer could take into account in determining whether to reprimand her or discharge her, or whatever."
1986.85-2068,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1894.349,1895.911,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,1897.926,1903.799,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1986.85-2068,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.175,1992.187,"For instance, if a newspaperman heard about this statement and interviewed her on television and said,"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,1998.185,2000.935,"--I think that's a different case, Justice White."
1986.85-2068,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.121,2003.262,"Well, it may be, but what's your answer?"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2003.793,2010.697,--My answer to that for her position would be that there would still not be a right to fire her.
1986.85-2068,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.663,2023.257,"Well, he says, ""What's your job""?"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2031.347,2033.659,"Well, that was not what she said."
1986.85-2068,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2064.148,2077.266,"Do we accept the case, Mr. Cutler, on the statement of the Court of Appeals that McPherson actually hoped the President would be assassinated?"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2077.266,2083.827,"The Court of Appeals didn't quite say that except arguendo, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-2068,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2083.827,2084.311,"The Court says,"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2090.357,2090.482,Yes.
1986.85-2068,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2092.31,2093.762,And do we decide the case on that basis?
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2093.762,2115.253,"--They go on to say, a sentence or so later, that whether her remark was a comment on the President's policies or an actual wish for her assassination, it was still on a matter of public concern; and that's what I'd like to come to right now."
1986.85-2068,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.253,2119.08,That the desirability of assassinating the President is a matter of public concern?
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2119.08,2130.405,"Not the desirability of assassinating the President, but expressing a disapproval of the President's comments in terms as strong and as ill-advised as,"
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.795,2270.353,"Your theory is that any statement, hyperbole or anything else that occurs during the course of a political discussion like that gets special protection; right?"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2270.353,2272.696,I would say that gets special protection.
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.523,2295.939,"You could fire an employee, I take it, who constantly uses profanity, vulgar, obscene language around the office, but not... or arguably not, you'd have to meet a different... a substantially different burden, if he only uses that language in the course of his political discussions?"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2295.939,2313.744,"Well, if he uses obscene language, you said, I believe, Justice Scalia, commonly or regularly that might affect employee morale or efficiency, it might well be someone who went around even in the context of a political discussion--"
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.744,2314.649,You're applying the test.
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2330.487,2339.843,"--If it is part of a discussion on a political issue or meant to be an expression on a political expression, it has to be weighed."
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.779,2346.435,Why is that?
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2362.509,2367.726,"Well, we're now in the context, I take it, of can this discussion be prohibited or punished?"
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.195,2370.648,--No.
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2379.566,2380.145,--not a political issue.
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.145,2386.268,--we have to look at the whole preceding ten minutes of her conversation or we can't just look at the single sentence?
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2386.268,2388.346,I think you have to look at the--
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.346,2395.968,"If you look at the single sentence, you would acknowledge, I hope, that it is not a matter of public concern, that we don't debate on whether the President should be assassinated or not."
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2395.968,2401.889,"--We certainly don't debate on whether the President should be assassinated, and I deplore myself any such statement."
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2401.889,2403.356,So if we would only look at one sentence--
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2403.356,2403.997,"A statement,"
1986.85-2068,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.035,2432.129,"--Well, are you suggesting--"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2432.129,2432.519,And it happens all the time.
1986.85-2068,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2432.519,2437.065,"--Are you suggesting, Mr. Cutler, that there's a difference between saying,"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2442.891,2446.452,"Yes, I do think there is."
1986.85-2068,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2446.452,2447.279,Where--
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2447.279,2456.87,"If you're still on the issue of whether this is a matter of public concern, it is clearly something, number one, that cannot legally be punished or prohibited."
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2480.891,2481.845,--Many of which were meant.
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2481.845,2482.423,--Huh?
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2482.423,2484.499,Many of which were meant literally.
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2484.499,2490.544,"It may have been meant, but they were expressions, not, ""We're all for assassination""."
1986.85-2068,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.26,2504.899,"Well, then that takes it out of the context of favoring assassination?"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2504.899,2510.866,I do believe it takes it out of the context of favoring assassination as such.
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.975,2517.786,Is what you're saying that anybody who favors assassinating someone is disapproving that person?
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2520.021,2521.16,--That's right.
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.16,2525.018,--But the two aren't coextensive.
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2531.984,2532.547,Of course you can.
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.341,2538.701,No.
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2539.17,2540.449,And it cannot be--
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2540.449,2544.23,"--It isn't a political statement, if you want the person's assassination."
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2544.23,2548.885,"--Well, certainly in the context here, it was a political statement."
1986.85-2068,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.587,2595.337,Yes.
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2610.567,2611.161,There was no finding--
1986.85-2068,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.161,2615.611,"--and interpreted it that she really meant it, and that she really wished the President would be killed."
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2615.611,2635.339,"--She was expressing at most a hope that if it happened again... she was not urging assassination, she was not threatening it herself most certainly... she was stating her opposition to the President's policies in this extreme and immoderate form,"
1986.85-2068,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2637.196,2647.005,"Well, the Court of Appeals said that the record supports the District Court's conclusion that McPherson expressed an actual wish for the assassination of the President."
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2647.005,2647.552,That is correct.
1986.85-2068,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.871,2674.635,"Well, we judge the case as though she really meant it and she really had the wish."
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2681.1,2683.647,"--Well, there's no question that--"
1986.85-2068,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2683.647,2683.912,Isn't that right?
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2683.912,2684.49,--That is right.
1986.85-2068,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.519,2695.222,Protected her from being fired?
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2695.222,2700.735,"--That gets us to the Pickering/Connick balancing test, I think."
1986.85-2068,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2700.735,2707.279,"We don't have to go that far, that she intended to kill the President?"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2707.279,2717.542,"I don't believe you have to... I think it is clear this was political hyperbole, and you are obliged, I think, to examine it yourself."
1986.85-2068,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2805.555,2807.445,Do you think Watts is still good law?
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2807.445,2810.866,"I would hope Watts is still good law, Justice."
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2873.107,2874.997,"Well, it wasn't really private."
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2878.668,2881.838,It happened to get overheard by one person; that's quite right.
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.838,2886.103,"--By Captain LeVrier, who was offended by it, and it might have offended other co-workers."
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,2888.008,2899.177,"That's what I... I believe I'll show in a moment, Justice Scalia, she was not fired on the ground that it offended anyone else, or that it affected discipline or morale in the office."
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3014.028,3027.241,"--Well, if you rely on that, then you are conceding that she reaffirmed in the discussion with Rankin, not only that she had said it, but that she meant it, because that's what that testimony refers to?"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3028.927,3039.033,"What the District Court found is by word or deed... The District Court never found, as I think Justice O'Connor pointed out earlier, that she said, ""Yes, I meant it""."
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3039.033,3039.33,No.
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3042.111,3042.58,That's his testimony.
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.58,3043.142,--That's his testimony.
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3043.142,3043.626,That's right.
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3043.626,3046.282,"If you rely on it, you have to accept it for the good and the bad."
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3046.282,3050.234,"I rely on it to... Well, the District Court made its findings."
1986.85-2068,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3107.479,3112.29,"Mr. Cutler, this was a probationary employee."
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3158.584,3175.391,"Well, to begin with, Perry against Sindermann holds even for employees lacking tenure... I believe that's a teacher's case... that there is an economic expectation even for probationary employees."
1986.85-2068,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3205.363,3220.201,"My question is whether speech on a matter of public concern can evidence character traits of the employee that would justify the employer from saying,"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3226.572,3250.016,"--I would say, Justice O'Connor, that it is a very dangerous power to grant just on the distinction between the probationary employee and the employee or this person, let us say, a month later after her probationary status was over."
1986.85-2068,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3324.16,3343.246,"Can they be fired because they exhibit character traits and an inability to reason adequately to serve in the job of public employment, even though that judgment is made in part by speech that could be protected?"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3343.246,3354.383,"If it is made on the basis of their suitability to hold the particular job that they are doing, I would say yes."
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3376.342,3381.652,"What about a secretary in the clerk's office out here who, you know, says that?"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3383.902,3392.149,"--Well, I would think you would at least deliberate, Justice Scalia, and learn the full text of the conversation and have something, for example, in the area--"
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3392.149,3393.774,"If it comes up in the same kind of a conversation, do you think that--"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3393.774,3405.675,"--It may very well be that this Court is a place of confidential... it certainly is a confidential place which takes you out of this line of cases, and you might be free to do it there."
1986.85-2068,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.877,3412.501,"--Well, Mr. Cutler--"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3412.501,3414.187,Suppose the janitor in the court had said it.
1986.85-2068,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3414.187,3428.136,"--This lady was on probation, but if she were hired permanently, wouldn't sooner or later she perform the other duties of a deputy constable, like serving process and--"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3428.136,3429.04,I doubt it very much.
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3583.247,3587.34,"--Most of those cases involve criminal sanctions, however, rather than--"
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3587.34,3587.73,Some.
1986.85-2068,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3587.73,3590.964,--what kind of employees a public employer must retain.
1986.85-2068,2,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,3590.964,3601.445,"Some, like American Communications Workers against Dowd, just involve simply loss of a union position and nothing more."
