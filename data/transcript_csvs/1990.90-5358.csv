1990.90-5358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.657,"We'll hear now in argument No. 90-5358, Thomas Braxton v. The United States."
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,11.5,14.712,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,94.553,99.116,How is the Government... how does the Government's factual proffer come up in this case?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,102.499,113.264,It came up in the extremely ordinary fashion of turning to the Government at the appropriate time during the Rule 11 inquiry and asking for the factual basis for the plea.
1990.90-5358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.314,175.255,I don't really get exactly... perhaps you should be more explicit about it.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,175.255,176.377,About how that happened?
1990.90-5358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.377,179.92,"Well, was the door open when he fired the shots?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,179.92,181.65,The door had a chain guard on it.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.536,208.658,But none were fired before the door was kicked open?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,208.658,210.387,None were fired before the door was kicked open.
1990.90-5358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,215.452,217.433,So he intended to assault the door?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,217.433,224.278,"Well, I think it's clear he intended to assault the marshals by this act to frighten them away... to say, I am not going back to the mental hospital."
1990.90-5358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.071,266.354,"Mr. Cribari, based on the facts that were admitted at the plea hearing, could the sentencing judge have imposed the same sentence by enhancing the sentence under the guidelines and reach the same result that he reached here?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,266.354,273.57,"--Justice O'Connor, I think it's certainly possible, but what's at issue is the manner of doing it."
1990.90-5358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.361,281.885,But on these facts he could have achieved the same result by another mechanism.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,281.885,284.366,"I hesitate to say, categorically, yes."
1990.90-5358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.338,315.807,"Well, if you were correct on the proposition that you bring to us, at the very least I suppose we should remand to let the trial judge determine if the same sentence should be imposed on another basis."
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,315.807,318.579,"--We would happily take that hearing, Your Honor."
1990.90-5358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.887,341.875,"Now, would you tell us what the Sentencing Guidelines Commission's position is at present on the interpretation of this provision?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,341.875,343.475,This stipulation provision?
1990.90-5358,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.475,343.986,Yes.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,343.986,348.139,"Your Honor, I think the sentencing guidelines interpretation is fairly clear."
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.183,381.82,"Mr. Cribari, does... has the Sentencing Commission taken any... after issuing the guidelines, do they take positions on their interpretation of what they've issued?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,404.195,405.005,They do.
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.022,415.463,And what if they do?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,424.449,434.065,"--Well, I think the Commission take the position that these would clarifying amendments which would be effective at the time anyone would be sentenced under them and would have no retroactive effect in--"
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.065,436.126,Would not be retro--
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,436.126,441.669,"--Well, if it's a clarifying amendment, all it's doing is making more clear what once was the case."
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.669,443.159,--So it would have a retroactive effect?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,443.159,444.501,Excuse me; Your Honor?
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.501,445.873,So it would have a retroactive effect?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,445.873,447.834,It would have a retroactive effect in the sense that--
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.834,448.635,But would not be retroactive?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,449.974,455.578,"--Well, Your Honor, I think it would have a retroactive offense... effect in the sense that it is making clear what has always been the case."
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.147,466.935,What--
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,470.327,494.003,"The Commission's amendment reads as follows, and it's extremely short: proposed amendment to 1B1.2, regard... which regards stipulations to more serious offense should be amended to provide expressly that such stipulation must be part of a formal plea agreement."
1990.90-5358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,494.003,497.736,And that is what it is considering but has not acted upon?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,497.736,499.747,That is what it is soliciting comment on doing.
1990.90-5358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.747,501.699,Is this a formal plea agreement?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,501.699,504.061,"There was no plea agreement in this case, Your Honor."
1990.90-5358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,505.881,511.434,"Does formal plea agreement mean written, in your view?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,511.434,521.652,"Well, I think the better practice is written, and I think the rules... at least the local rules of the district court in Maryland would require in the felony situation that we have a written agreement."
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.067,552.611,"Mr. Cribari, am I correct that if the Commission adopts what they have proposed to adopt, your client would... would win?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,553.722,554.654,That's accurate.
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.883,564.718,"Now, what if... what if we... what if we find against your client, and then the Commission adopts what it has proposed to adopt?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,564.718,576.697,"--Your Honor, that puts me in the awkward position of saying perhaps my client then should file some kind of 2255 alleging my ineffectiveness for not foreseeing that that would be the case for him."
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.697,581.311,"Oh, but you think we would win though?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,581.311,595.92,"Well, I... you would have a situation where the Commission will have changed the guidelines, or... sorry... where the Commission will have clarified guidelines in a way opposite to what this Court could do in this case."
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.325,603.094,"Well, why not--"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,603.094,605.605,But if the Commission's adoption would be a clarifying amendment--
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,605.605,610.41,--Why not treat the Commission in such a situation like we had... treat Congress?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,614.852,626.88,"--Well, certainly the Commission... if this Court found a... in the Government's favor in this case... the Commission could enact the guideline or reenact the guideline or amend the guideline to make it consistent with my position."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.681,632.643,He goes to jail.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,632.643,635.215,"Well, he's already there, and I think he stays there."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.215,635.836,Uh-huh.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,635.836,645.122,"And I don't think he gets the benefit of... of the Commission's amending a guideline once this Court concludes this case against him, if it were to do that."
1990.90-5358,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,657.23,664.185,"Counsel, does... was there any attempt to take this Court en banc in the Fourth Circuit?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,664.185,666.186,"--There was not, Your Honor."
1990.90-5358,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,709.895,711.627,"Well, you've got a divided vote here."
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,714.718,716.178,"Well, it would have, Your Honor."
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.037,735.46,Do we give special weight to those courts that have members of the Commission on them?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,737.052,738.862,"Well, Your Honor, I... we tried that in Mistretta I think."
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.862,739.233,"--Yes, I see."
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,739.233,741.794,And... and it was not particularly availing.
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.047,764.919,Could I ask the inverse situation of the question I asked before?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,783.673,784.464,Then--
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.464,789.447,"Would that apply retroactively to your client, and he would deprived of the victory that we have given him?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,789.447,790.518,"--No, I don't think so at all."
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,790.518,792.258,So it's sort of a one-way street.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,792.258,794.04,At that point I think it is.
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.402,817.185,"Well, you do agree they should be treated like Congress and not like an agency?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,818.315,819.006,"Well, they are laws."
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,819.006,820.158,--not just interpreting their guidelines.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,822.118,823.18,They are not?
1990.90-5358,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.18,825.51,They are not just interpreting a guideline the way an agency does.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,828.782,835.026,"To the extent that they issue a new guideline, they... I mean, there's a period where they would have to be... could be vetoed and so forth."
1990.90-5358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,840.79,844.102,"Well, do you have to concede that what they are doing is a clarification?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,844.102,846.403,For my case I do not.
1990.90-5358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,847.923,852.628,"I mean, why can't you argue it to this... to us, well, this would be a new guideline?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,852.628,854.479,"--Well, we could."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,876.213,884.138,"Well, of course there's... what's the time table for the Commission to act?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,884.138,891.955,"I think comment is due by... I think it's by May 1st, and there would be amendments probably in June."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.587,898.457,It's possible we might wait for them.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,898.457,899.459,It's very possible.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,900.33,901.459,Do you suggest we do?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,904.782,911.156,"Your Honor, given... given the legislative history and Judge Wilkins' comments, I... it would not trouble me if the Court waited for that amendment."
1990.90-5358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.61,988.728,"Well, when you say that a stipulation is a word of art meaning an agreement between the Government and the defendant, do you mean that it can't be entered into by attorneys?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,988.728,991.291,"Well, the... the attorneys representing the parties could certainly do it."
1990.90-5358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,994.682,999.657,So what... what then is your point when you say that it's an agreement between the defendant and the Government?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,999.657,1017.158,"--My point is that without a formal agreement between the parties or between the lawyers representing the parties, the Government should not be a position of coming to court, making its factual proffer, having a defendant acknowledge, that's what I did for purposes of what I want to plead guilty to, and then find out he stipulated to greater offense conduct."
1990.90-5358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1017.158,1028.986,"You say that what happened here with the Government making a proffer for the voluntariness purposes, the judge asking the defendant if he agreed, he says that is not an agreement between the parties."
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1028.986,1032.679,"No, not after the parties discussed plea agreements and rejected them."
1990.90-5358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1048.298,1048.779,"Well, how--"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1048.779,1050.969,The only agreement was that the Government would do what it wants to do.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.969,1058.285,"--I don't suppose if there... if there had been a plea agreement in this case, what... what do you think it would have been about?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1076.056,1077.286,I think if would be very different.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.529,1082.281,Yes--
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1082.281,1083.56,--Mr. Braxton could not have--
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.56,1094.138,"--I know, but what if Mr. Braxton said, I'm not pleading guilty to the... either in the agreement or in open court, he says, I didn't plead guilty to attempted murder."
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1095.357,1095.948,"--Then, in fact--"
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.948,1099.912,I do not... I do not agree that I committed it.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1099.912,1104.584,--Then either that would be a violation of a plea agreement or that... there would be no plea agreement.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1105.916,1107.148,Why would that be a violation of the plea agreement?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1107.148,1122.376,"Because if the... the plea agreement... assuming the plea agreement had proceeded... excuse me... assuming the plea agreement represented the Government's position in this case, there would have been a stipulation to conduct that established the greater offense of attempted murder that would have been required in the plea agreement."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.376,1128.981,"I know, but the plea agreement probably would have required the Government to dismiss the attempted murder charge."
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1128.981,1132.633,In return for the defendant's agreement that he committed an attempted murder.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.633,1133.194,Yes.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1133.194,1136.815,"Without that quid pro quo, the plea agreement would have broken down."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.474,1148.095,Yes.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1148.095,1149.403,And we would be where we are.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.403,1150.074,It's a red herring then.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1152.757,1153.578,Not in this case.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.699,1208.022,"Well, if the... if the court had proceeded to achieve this result by another way, would you be making your same argument that... that the stipulate... or the agreement as to these facts would not justify the court in enhancing the sentence?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1208.022,1208.603,No.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1208.603,1211.575,Would you say there still would have to be a formal stipulation?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1211.575,1213.495,"No, I would not be making this argument."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.403,1277.639,But you're saying... choosing the baseline is a... would be affirmed unless it was clearly erroneous?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1277.639,1280.049,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.04,1283.683,"Well, do you agree with that?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1285.844,1298.182,"--Well, if it's a question of fact, I have to agree with it, because the Fourth Circuit's standard is that questions of... determinations of fact will be given great deference and will be overturned only if clearly erroneous."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.182,1299.301,"Yeah, surely."
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1303.875,1307.686,That's what should be involved because choosing the baseline is very simple.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.488,1341.58,"xxx view of that, that doesn't sound like a question of fact."
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1343.099,1355.117,"Well, what the Fourth Circuit determined was that since the base offense level set in this case was based upon a stipulation, it's really just a finding of fact."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.794,1365.866,"--Okay, go ahead."
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1365.866,1373.613,I think the appellate review of departures is a significant difference from appellate review of base offense levels.
1990.90-5358,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1395.415,1404.682,I take it there's a difference as to whether or not the elements of the offense were established by the facts that were conceded.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1404.682,1410.085,"Well, I think that's... that's a great help in this case for the defense."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.977,1479.381,"Well, the... did the Government... I suppose the Government could have tried you for attempted murder... tried your client?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1479.381,1480.122,Absolutely.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.914,1483.204,Yes.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1490.458,1492.101,That's exactly right.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.101,1495.142,But the Government dismissed it?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1495.142,1496.943,The Government got the attempted murder sentence.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.666,1499.414,"Yes, well--"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1499.414,1500.205,But it should not have.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.205,1501.347,--But anyway it dismissed it.
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1501.347,1502.055,It did.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1502.055,1503.427,When?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1503.427,1504.739,After sentencing.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.983,1519.998,So did you anticipate that... that you were going... that you'd plead guilty to assault and then were going to stand trial for attempted murder?
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1519.998,1524.741,"I anticipated that was a possible outcome, because the only other alternative was to go to trial on everything."
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.958,1591.024,"You don't think it would be enough then in this case I... if the... if the judge said, I would like your stipulation of these facts to be made formally?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1591.024,1592.826,We would have said we're not doing that.
1990.90-5358,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.935,1614.729,"Well, let's just assume that you... that you said, okay, judge, I'm... put it in writing and I'll sign it."
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1624.947,1630.73,"--We would not have signed that, because we could not stipulate to the facts of attempted murder because Mr. Braxton denied he committed an attempted murder."
1990.90-5358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.169,1678.72,"Do you wish to reserve the balance of your time, Mr. Cribari?"
1990.90-5358,0,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,1678.72,1679.031,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-5358,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.031,1679.522,Very well.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1681.484,1692.592,The guidelines provide defendants who want to plead guilty two ways to respond to the Government's factual proffer.
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.976,1705.448,"When... when you say to respond to the Government's factual proffer, what stage of the proceedings are you talking about?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1708.189,1715.395,"--Yes, sir, Rule 11, basically the satisfaction of the requirement in Rule 11(f) that there be a factual basis for the plea."
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.389,1741.602,"Well, why do the guidelines have anything to do with a proffer for a Rule 11 purpose?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1741.602,1747.296,--The guidelines don't have any... don't dictate the procedure at a Rule 11 hearing.
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1756.131,1761.615,"Well, I... I don't... I didn't see anything in the guidelines about what a defendant did at a Rule 11 hearing."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1761.615,1771.002,"--With respect, I think guide... the language of guideline 1B1.2 does have that effect, and in particular the proviso."
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1778.498,1778.899,Is that--
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1778.899,1781.008,--of conviction except in one case.
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.891,1802.373,--It says... it says a plea containing a stipulation that's specifically established.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1802.373,1802.633,--Right.
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.627,1810.999,You... I... I think you're assuming something when you bring Rule 11 in there.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1810.999,1813.51,--Well--
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.51,1815.703,"I mean... well, go ahead."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1815.703,1816.451,--Okay.
1990.90-5358,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1853.757,1868.256,"Mr. Marzen, if the Sentencing Guidelines Commission were to adopt its proposed revision to the guidelines, would you be making... taking the same position in this case?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1868.256,1873.96,"--If the Sentencing Commission required a plea agreement, we would not."
1990.90-5358,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1876.741,1880.134,Is it clear that that is what they are proposing to adopt?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1880.134,1882.015,"--No, and that's the second--"
1990.90-5358,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1882.015,1882.345,No?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1882.345,1883.447,--part I'd like to say.
1990.90-5358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2008.98,2024.001,"Mr. Marzen, why did the stipulation, using it in your sense, the statement of facts that the Government had proffered, why did that, within the meaning of the guidelines, specifically establish the more serious offense?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2029.313,2030.532,I think it is.
1990.90-5358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.672,2105.074,How do you suppose he missed?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2105.074,2108.456,"--You know, he must have been a horrible shot, Justice Stevens."
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.986,2113.279,But your theory is he... he did aim at him and failed to hit him?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2113.279,2114.18,"--Yes, because--"
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2114.18,2115.86,And that's clear beyond a reasonable doubt?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2121.814,2125.457,"--I think... I think it must... it must be a must find, if you will."
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.018,2129.501,And he must find that he was a poor marksman rather than he did not intend to hit him?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2129.501,2140.237,"--Yes, and in this case the district court, as a matter of fact, found that the facts compelled a finding of attempted murder and that finding by the district court was upheld on a... on appeal."
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.817,2145.719,"Well, but a finding is really quite different than an agreement or stipulation, isn't it?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2152.224,2159.119,"--I don't think so, and I think again the language of guideline... the... specifically the proviso provides the answer to your question."
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.459,2178.502,"Well, it doesn't... nothing like... he never agreed that he intended to kill."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2181.204,2184.236,"--Well, it's more than--"
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.236,2187.697,You say you don't aim at somebody without intending to kill them.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2194.951,2196.113,--True.
1990.90-5358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2218.738,2225.621,"Well, suppose you had this... the concession... we won't call it a stipulation... the concession that you had here with one added element."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2235.369,2240.492,I don't think that would change the result in this case because it doesn't change the agreement to the historical facts.
1990.90-5358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2253.592,2257.463,"Well, that's a rather odd... odd reading of specifically establish a defense."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2263.437,2264.188,--Well--
1990.90-5358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2264.188,2267.77,"And you say, well, what you've said specifically establishes this."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2267.77,2276.486,--I think it's important the language you quote says specifically establish and not... and it does not say stipulate to the offense.
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.532,2292.636,But what does specifically establish a more serious offense mean if it doesn't mean stipulate to the elements of the offense?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2292.636,2294.649,It means either... that's exactly right.
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2298.271,2302.183,But those are... those are... are they the same thing... the facts or the elements?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2302.183,2303.395,"Yes, Chief Justice."
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.825,2341.459,"Well, would the... as I understand your opponent, it wouldn't have... unless it was the plea... formal plea agreement, it wouldn't have done him any good... it wouldn't have done the Government any good even if he... you had included in your statement of facts that he intended to kill and he agreed to that."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2344.781,2348.664,That's a... that is a correct interpretation of their position.
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.403,2382.516,Is there any difference between stipulation and admission?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2382.516,2384.536,For this purpose?
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2386.129,2388.449,"Well, wasn't there an admission in this case?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2388.449,2389.961,"--There was indeed, Justice Marshall."
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2390.259,2391.931,"Well, why do you need a stipulation?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2391.931,2394.933,"--They're the same thing, Justice Marshall."
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.227,2402.197,"So, in that point you agree with the petitioner?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2402.197,2412.405,"--That's absolutely right, that the definition of a stipulation, according to Black's Law Dictionary, the ordinary definition, is the name, quote,"
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2434.788,2441.714,The Government's factual proffer leaves you short on the element of... on the issue of intent.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2450.139,2458.605,"Justice Rehnquist, if it was just a deduction... if it was just something that a jury would be permitted to conclude, it is not enough."
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.016,2476.336,Which one--
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2479.378,2483.822,--You don't have to indulge the assumption that Mr. Braxton is a poor marksman.
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.933,2509.498,"Well, how do you... how do you fire through an open doorway and still have the marshal standing behind the door?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2520.975,2522.875,"Yes, sir, Justice White."
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.875,2525.857,"Well, then... and then they weren't fired through an open doorway?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2525.857,2527.73,"Well, actually--"
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.73,2529.861,They hit the door after it was open.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2529.861,2531.073,--There are two points here.
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.275,2563.932,"Well, if the door... if the shots hit the door where he said it did, the door... the door certainly opened awfully fast if the bullets hit where he says they hit."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2563.932,2566.166,--It's... it's true.
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.166,2573.061,They hit on the side of the door that before it was opened the officers were standing behind.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2573.061,2574.25,The first bullet did.
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.835,2587.12,After it was... after it was open and it was on the outside of the door?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2587.12,2593.103,--The record doesn't establish whether the second shot hit on what was the inside door of the apartment or the outside.
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.016,2603.239,"Well, the second one must have."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2608.164,2614.598,Because the record also shows... shows that the door was kicked open the first time with such force that it snapped shut.
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.557,2616.819,"Ah, yes."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2616.819,2620.532,--the proffer indicated that the deputy had to kick it open a second time.
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.532,2624.152,"Well, in that event, certainly the... the bullet wasn't fired through an open doorway."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2624.793,2632.857,"Well, when the marshal kicked open the door the second time, the... the initial proffer anyway was that the Government... that another shot was fired."
1990.90-5358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2642.695,2649.129,"Did the district court advise this defendant of the elements of count 1, which was attempted murder?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2649.129,2650.8,"--No, he did not."
1990.90-5358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2650.8,2661.879,And did he advise the defendant of the baseline offense level for attempted murder?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2661.879,2678.408,"No, the proffer was given at the Rule 11 hearing, Justice Kennedy, and the Rule 11 now requires that one advise... that the judge advise the defendant that the guidelines apply but not the specific range or any of the particular points."
1990.90-5358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2678.408,2682.67,But he didn't advise him of the elements of attempted murder--
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2682.67,2683.672,That's--
1990.90-5358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2683.672,2692.538,"--so he had no real basis to know that he was stipulating to attempted murder, because he wasn't... at least under Rule 11 because he wasn't advised of the elements of that offense."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2692.538,2694.859,--I think I see where you're driving.
1990.90-5358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2699.824,2702.385,"Well, that's the whole purpose of this... of this rule, isn't it?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2709.428,2710.87,That's right.
1990.90-5358,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2736.706,2746.352,"Well, I think the sophisticated counsel might have been very interested to know that the judge was going to consider the higher baseline offense, and that was never advised in open court until the sentence was pronounced."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2746.352,2753.148,"It was never advised that he would, but defense counsel was certainly on notice that he could."
1990.90-5358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.071,2845.617,"Mr. Marzen, suppose we took no action on this case or suppose we found in your favor and the Guidelines Commission later adopted an amendment that would favor the defendant here, would... would that amendment be able to be applied to the defendant, or is this the end of the road?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2845.617,2852.733,I think the answer turns on whether there is... this case is still kicking around the courts.
1990.90-5358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2873.686,2876.067,"Well, what do you mean by kicking out?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2885.904,2886.856,--That would be the end of it.
1990.90-5358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.286,2905.197,2255.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2920.446,2923.168,I--
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2923.168,2928.752,"And furthermore, I can prove it, because now the Sentencing Commission has interpreted it's own rule."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2928.752,2941.631,--I must confess... confess I'm not sure that under 2255 that you're... the defendant is entitled to the benefit of every procedural updating of a sentencing guideline.
1990.90-5358,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.033,2948.784,"Well, suppose the... suppose the... suppose the Sentencing Commission hadn't done anything at all."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2958.822,2959.963,--Not to my knowledge.
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2972.539,2974.162,Rule 35 one year?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,2974.162,2975.491,Yes.
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3001.538,3002.88,Contendere.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3002.88,3004.76,--contendere... I apologize.
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3020.352,3028.987,"Well, in petitioner [inaudible] argue that that the phrase containing a stipulation is a clause modifying the earlier clause?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3028.987,3035.512,"--The word containing I think is consistent with the... yes, it does modify the word ""plea""."
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3059.227,3063.729,You say the plea of guilty itself doesn't have to contain it?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3063.729,3071.855,"--No, the plea of guilty does have to contain it, but the plea includes more than just the formal guilty, not guilty, or nolo contendere."
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3078.889,3080.611,That is a stipulation?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3080.611,3081.891,"--Yes, sir."
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3081.891,3085.023,A stipulation between the Government and the defendant?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3085.023,3087.545,Yes.
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3088.446,3091.859,It seems like a unilateral act in many ways.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3091.859,3101.015,"--Well, it's a... it is... it should be a unilateral act in that it should be coming clean with what criminal conduct you did."
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3101.015,3104.077,"But then if it's a unilateral act, how can it be an agreement?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3104.077,3106.989,"You... oh, I see."
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3132.866,3137.396,How is an agreement to be guilty a stipulation?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3140.378,3142.831,"Well, Justice Marshall, it's usually more--"
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3142.831,3145.102,Can one party stipulate?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3145.102,3148.535,--No.
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3149.795,3151.467,"But in this case, yes."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3153.078,3161.345,"--Well, in... for purposes of the proviso, the stipulation has benefits for the Government and benefits for the defendant."
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3161.345,3162.514,"For purposes of conviction, it's okay."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3162.514,3176.035,"Well, if you want to view it in contractual terms, it's sort of like a... the... there's sort of a unilateral contract where you... where you specifically give out an offer without anyone specific--"
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3176.035,3176.333,I can't help it.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3178.085,3190.864,"--Well, I don't think it's a trap, because the defendant knows that if he provides a factual basis for the plea that establishes a more serious offense that certain sentencing consequences will attach."
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3219.963,3223.013,"Well, why didn't he stipulate if he knew all of this?"
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3223.013,3229.056,Two reasons... to achieve a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3245.599,3246.81,But this didn't come up then.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3248.451,3249.66,Well--
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3249.66,3252.612,"It didn't come up when he, quote, ""stipulated"", end quote."
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3252.612,3256.215,"--That's true, and as my answer to that, Justice--"
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3256.215,3257.176,It came up later on.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3257.176,3258.705,"--Yes, that's... that's true."
1990.90-5358,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3258.705,3260.819,And I'd be awful wary about this now.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3272.707,3274.247,"Yes, it was, Justice Stevens."
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.247,3274.527,--after the colloquy.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3286.596,3289.798,Had the recommendation of using the attempted murder guideline?
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3289.798,3290.068,Yes.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3290.068,3292.759,Yes.
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3334.808,3336.267,This i.e. is what he said or what you're saying?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3336.267,3337.629,"I'm sorry, the alienation is mine."
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3337.629,3338.268,I see.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3338.268,3339.049,Everything up to the i.e.--
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3339.049,3339.56,Okay.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3339.56,3340.811,--Comma--
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3340.811,3342.0,It's rather an important i.e.--
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3342.331,3347.384,"--Yes, it would make my job a lot easier if it were in there."
1990.90-5358,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3349.497,3351.597,Maybe I'd better follow along in the text here.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3351.948,3364.447,"--Well, Justice Scalia, if you want to follow me, it's at page 22 of the joint appendix... the first sentence in the second paragraph beginning on that page."
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3380.747,3382.617,And then what's the next sentence?
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3385.799,3386.32,Yes.
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3386.821,3391.393,Which hardly suggests that he thought you didn't have to depart upward if you thought he tried to murder the marshals.
1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3391.393,3397.627,--I read that sentence as expanding on the subordinate clause in the second part of the first sentence.
1990.90-5358,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3397.627,3399.049,I see.

1990.90-5358,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,3430.478,3431.42,No.
1990.90-5358,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3431.42,3434.572,"Thank you, Mr. Marzen."

1990.90-5358,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3468.343,3477.319,You... have you preserved that point or did you first raise it in your reply brief... namely that this stipulation did not specifically establish a more serious offense.
1990.90-5358,2,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,3477.99,3479.112,"--Well, I think that's preserved from the beginning."

1990.90-5358,2,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,3509.569,3512.491,"Yes, Your Honor, because... if I may answer the question."
1990.90-5358,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3530.183,3545.013,"Mr. Cribari, are there instances other than for raising the base offense level in which a client would want to stipulate that he committed a greater offense?"
1990.90-5358,2,41130,stephen_j_cribari,,3559.472,3569.179,He might stipulate he committed an offense if he were sure he were not going to have a sentencing damage for it for purposes of acknowledging full criminal conduct.
1990.90-5358,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3579.678,3579.918,I understand.
