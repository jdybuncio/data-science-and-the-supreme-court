1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,63.823,66.625,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1986.86-246,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.218,213.039,"Mr. McKay, does any State presently have such a law in effect?"
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,213.039,217.824,"Your Honor, there are no mandatory death penalties currently on the books today."
1986.86-246,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,223.561,258.25,"Do you... you think that there could, in theory, be some extenuating circumstances in one of these cases, for example, when the penalty... when the facts show a felony murder situation, for example, where the individual found guilty of murder did not actually do the killing?"
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,258.25,264.072,"Well, Your Honor, if we're talking about the predicate offense that created the life sentence in the first place--"
1986.86-246,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.072,276.479,"No, I'm talking about the murder for which the defendant is being tried after he's previously been put in prison for life."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,276.479,282.099,"--Well, first of all, under the Nevada statute and under the facts of this case, that's not what occurred."
1986.86-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,305.132,307.416,"General McKay, you say a narrowly defined category."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,323.343,324.26,"--Yes, Your honor."
1986.86-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,324.26,331.597,"So the legislature never singled out this subcategory and said, we want a death penalty in this subcategory only."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,331.597,337.918,"The legislature singled out three or four categories, that is correct, as seriously aggravating crimes."
1986.86-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,345.774,354.779,"And the Nevada legislature has never reexamined the question of whether this subcategory should be treated differently from the other subcategories, such as killing a police officer?"
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,354.779,356.981,"No, the Nevada legislature has not done that."
1986.86-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.293,376.561,"While I've got you interrupted, can I ask you one other question?"
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,393.67,401.526,"In this particular case, Your Honor, I believe that that could occur under Nevada law, as it exists today."
1986.86-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,407.914,409.199,I understand that.
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,409.199,423.024,So we believe that the statute as defined and applied in this case is qualitatively different than any other class of eligibility that could possibly exist.
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,448.891,453.145,What do the other states do?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,459.965,463.917,"--Currently the other states do the same thing as the State of Nevada, Justice Marshall, and they provide--"
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,463.917,468.321,"I thought you said there was only one of these, and that was Nevada."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,471.356,475.741,--The other states provide for the bifurcated proceeding.
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,475.741,478.426,"Well, why doesn't Nevada do the same?"
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,478.426,480.128,"Nevada does the same today, Your Honor."
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,483.43,485.699,"So what are we dealing with, a single case?"
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,485.699,489.984,"--Yes, you're dealing with... with one individual who was charged--"
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,489.984,490.468,One case.
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,490.468,493.103,--One case.
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,493.103,495.638,And you just want to kill one man?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,495.638,496.238,We want--
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,496.238,500.792,"You just want to kill one man, is that correct?"
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,500.792,506.178,--We want to uphold the integrity of our criminal justice system in the State of Nevada.
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,506.178,508.596,xxx and you can never kill another one.
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,508.596,509.748,Not according to the--
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,509.748,511.332,Under those circumstances.
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,511.332,511.981,--That is correct.
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,517.985,519.736,Of your own legislature?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,519.736,522.722,That is correct.
1986.86-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.417,854.701,What was the last thing you said?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,856.369,860.321,--He was not precluded from introducing any evidence of any kind--
1986.86-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,860.321,861.405,--Including mitigating?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,861.405,862.94,"--Including mitigating, that is correct."
1986.86-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.94,865.725,What use would the mitigating circumstances be?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,865.725,867.142,"Well, the mitigating circumstances--"
1986.86-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.142,869.594,You can't acquit on the basis of a mitigating circumstance.
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,869.594,871.296,"--No, but could... there were lesser--"
1986.86-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.296,874.081,"So I mean, it's like saying he could have sung songs or something."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,877.2,886.138,"--As far as this Court's later holding, that in bifurcated proceedings of aggravating versus mitigating, the answer to your question is, yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,886.138,891.792,So it's really irrelevant that mitigating evidence was allowed in.
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,891.792,892.192,Well--
1986.86-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.192,894.192,"It was allowed in, but it couldn't be used for anything?"
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,894.192,900.665,"--Only to reduce a potential verdict, because there were lesser included offenses at the time."
1986.86-246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,900.665,907.152,"Well, to make the jury sympathize with the defendant, which I suppose what mitigating evidence is used for in every case."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,907.152,910.021,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.021,916.425,"But in other cases, if you sympathize with the defendant you can do something about it by recommending a lesser sentence."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,919.127,922.512,That is correct.
1986.86-246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.512,928.066,xxx did the jury know that the penalty was mandatory?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,928.066,929.083,"Yes, Your Honor, they did."
1986.86-246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.083,932.101,They were instructed that way?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,935.887,938.772,I am trying to recall what the jury instructions were.
1986.86-246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,942.057,943.374,But you think they knew?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,943.374,944.224,"No, I don't know."
1986.86-246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,944.224,944.926,All right.
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,944.926,947.276,"No, sir."
1986.86-246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.276,956.382,So this was a single... single proceeding in which the issue of guilt and the issue of penalty was determined by the jury?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,958.917,962.553,"Just the issue of guilt, because then the sentence was mandatory if he--"
1986.86-246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,962.553,969.724,"So the judge says, you know, the jury having returned a verdict of guilty, I know sentence you to death."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,971.326,973.793,"--Essentially, that is what has occurred, yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.182,989.038,"Well, during the selection of the jury were there any questions about jurors being opposed to the death penalty?"
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,989.038,991.99,"--I believe that there were, Your Honor, yes."
1986.86-246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.99,996.525,Thank you.
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,996.525,1007.082,"After the State post-conviction proceedings were unsuccessful, the respondent commenced Federal habeas corpus proceedings in a Federal district court for the District of Nevada."

1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1194.421,1195.923,--Pardon?
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1195.923,1198.625,And was committed before 1977?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1198.625,1201.008,"Yes, sir, and was committed prior to 1977."
1986.86-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1201.008,1203.077,"Well, that's one of the other conditions."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1203.077,1204.226,"Yes, sir."

1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1208.23,1209.197,That is correct.
1986.86-246,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1211.432,1215.551,"It so happens, he was not the triggerman in the other one?"
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1215.551,1224.173,"In 1958, he was not the triggerman for that first degree murder conviction, no, not for the predicate offense."

1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1251.224,1254.509,"--Eddings v. Oklahoma, Your Honor."
1986.86-246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1254.509,1262.496,"It didn't... it didn't save this particular category of murders, did it?"
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1262.496,1266.317,"Well, but it... I would submit that it didn't have to say this particular categories of murders."
1986.86-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1297.419,1309.31,"General McKay, you... in your presentation you pointed out that on collateral review in Nevada, as I understand it, he was given an opportunity to show mitigating circumstances, and he came up with nothing."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1342.031,1344.498,"Your Honor, yes, it is our position that would be irrelevant."
1986.86-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.164,1371.8,But your view is that that's because you're pretty sure he's going to kill in 1988.
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1379.821,1380.523,It would still be irrelevant.
1986.86-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1380.523,1382.439,You don't have to rely on the killing in 1988?
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1382.439,1383.858,"No, that is correct."
1986.86-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1386.393,1388.677,"You really don't need it for your case, if you're right."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1388.677,1391.245,"--That is correct, Your Honor."

1986.86-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.841,1410.343,"Well, that's not what you told me earlier, General."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1414.377,1418.112,"--Well, depending on the order of the Court, that is correct; depending on the fashion of the order."
1986.86-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.548,1424.868,"Under Nevada law, he would be subject to resentencing and getting the death penalty again."
1986.86-246,0,21266,d_brian_mckay,,1428.154,1428.637,--That's correct.

1986.86-246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.068,1562.121,You're using opinion polls to prove what?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1562.121,1566.923,--That people at that point in time did not favor mandatory death penalty statutes.
1986.86-246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.923,1571.827,"And how does that factor into the constitutional equation, these opinion polls?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1571.827,1580.231,"This Court has recognized that there are several ways of guaging or using as a barometer, how the people have felt."
1986.86-246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1587.703,1590.555,And how do the opinion polls factor into that?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1590.555,1592.455,"--Well, that's what I'm leading at."
1986.86-246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.478,1600.695,But that's why I asked you the question.
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1617.439,1636.334,"--I would submit to the Court that there is a long history in this country of abhorrence with mandatory death penalties; that the history of this country has demonstrated that, over the years, we have... if the death penalty is to be imposed, that it be at least somewhat discretionary, and now it's guided discretion."
1986.86-246,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1660.635,1672.007,"Mr. Markoff, am I not correct that in some of the Furman opinions, mandatory death sentence statutes were forecast, as a result of Furman?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1672.007,1674.826,They were forecast.

1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1726.577,1728.279,Woodson came after Furman.

1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1732.231,1732.564,Okay.
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.564,1734.516,--as to the earlier state of the law.
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1774.657,1784.699,"I submit that we were... we didn't have them all repealed by '63, we were certainly going that direction in having them all repealed until the Furman decision came out."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.257,1826.026,Mr. Markoff--
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1826.026,1826.492,Yes.
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.492,1837.048,"--what's distinctive about this case is, in all of our other cases, we've essentially said to the states, you can't put the individual to death."
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1865.517,1866.484,"That isn't correct, I submit."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.484,1867.936,"Well, what would it be?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1867.936,1884.046,"The best way to guage the punishment that Mr. Shuman is continuing to suffer at this point in time is by simply looking at the case on which he was originally sentenced in 1958, where he was given life without the possibility of parole."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.472,1900.639,That's water over the dam.
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1909.161,1909.644,That's precisely--
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.644,1911.363,--if the death penalty is not imposed here?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1911.363,1918.85,"--That is precisely what I am referring to, The codefendant was released in 1977 on parole."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.229,1937.864,What does without possibility of parole mean in Nevada anyway?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1937.864,1938.997,That's a good question.
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.856,1972.854,"xxx whatever exception there was in our cases, saving this... saving this possibility just doesn't apply in this case, because this isn't a sentence to life without parole?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,1972.854,1975.806,But that's exactly what the situation is.
1986.86-246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2004.539,2011.812,"What sentence would the jury impose if he's retried under the bifurcated system, if it doesn't Impose the death penalty?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2020.249,2022.618,I don't know.
1986.86-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.526,2039.579,"But your point is, even if they don't mean it the second time, it is punishment that's greater than he would otherwise suffer?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2039.579,2040.479,"Yes, and it already has been."
1986.86-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.479,2046.733,"And in support of that, you rely on the fact that his codefendant in the '58 trial is actually on parole."
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2048.685,2051.304,I don't believe it does.
1986.86-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.304,2054.839,"It seems to me it's a rather important fact, and I'm wondering why it isn't in the record."
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2054.839,2059.291,"I submit that it is an important fact, but it never came up in the lower court hearing."
1986.86-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.945,2074.484,"Well, is there any Nevada law of which we could take judicial notice to support your submission today, as I understand it, that life without possibility of parole in Nevada does not really mean that?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2082.322,2084.875,"--Off the top of my head, sir, I don't know."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.875,2086.125,"It's not in your brief either, is it?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2086.125,2087.06,"No, it's not."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2087.06,2091.512,"Well, gee, this is an awfully important thing to drop on us right now, isn't it?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2091.512,2093.481,"I submit it is important, yes, sir."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2093.481,2101.151,"And you can't suggest where we might look to, you know, to establish that without parole in Nevada doesn't mean without parole?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2101.151,2104.17,"Well, it's a matter which is up before the Court."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.17,2110.241,Have you been talking to Rex Lee about--
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2110.241,2117.763,I submit that it is a matter... the sentence which is imposed upon an individual remains life without the parole until the Parole Board changes it.
1986.86-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.399,2126.452,--But isn't there even a Nevada statute that gives the Parole Board the authority to do this?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2129.904,2131.52,"--It's a Western way, I suppose."
1986.86-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2131.52,2138.426,"Mr. Markoff, could you submit something writing to this Court to substantiate your statement here today?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2138.426,2139.676,I would be more than happy to.
1986.86-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2139.676,2142.212,I wonder why you didn't address that in your brief?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2142.212,2157.305,"Because we... responding to the state's arguments, what we saw in our response didn't really... or this particular type of a fact or a matter was not directly responsive to what they were representing."
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.305,2169.779,"Well, the state has represented to us that this sentence to life without possibility of parole was the very kind of a situation that was saved in our opinion."
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2173.533,2181.003,"Well, perhaps if life without the possibility of parole meant life without the possibility of parole, it might come within that exception."
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2182.122,2188.026,How long had your client been in prison before he committed this offense?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2188.026,2191.061,The '75 conviction?
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.667,2204.052,And how about his codefendant?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2204.052,2207.42,"His codefendant was released in 1977, according--"
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.42,2210.439,And he was subject to the identical sentence?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2210.439,2213.991,"--As far as I know, yes."
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.991,2218.359,"And was that just an ordinary parole, or was it because of health or what?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2218.359,2221.061,I have no further facts on which--
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.061,2231.001,Do you know of any other person who has ever been released who has been subject to a sentence like that?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2231.001,2232.536,--I'm sure there's plenty of them that have been.
1986.86-246,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2239.023,2241.909,"Mr. Markoff, I want to be sure of one thing."
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2253.282,2254.366,It is possible.
1986.86-246,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2272.511,2276.065,So he still may end up by being executed?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2276.065,2278.482,It's possible.
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.594,2334.818,"Mr. Markoff, now why don't you answer my earlier question on the assumption that life imprisonment without parole really means life imprisonment without parole, okay?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2361.921,2362.404,No.
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.371,2379.882,"Well, what penalty could be... the man is in prison for life without possibility of parole already, and you're... you're asserting that the Constitution requires that the jury be given an opportunity to say, yes, you incinerated the man in the cell next door, but no penalty whatever?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2379.882,2385.101,"--No, the possible penalty he'd be subject to would be life without parole consecutive to the one he's already doing."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.101,2389.719,"Oh, you mean when he comes back?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2394.04,2395.907,"Well, the way it works, apparently--"
1986.86-246,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2395.907,2398.492,Do you have jury sentencing in Nevada?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2398.492,2399.309,--Currently?
1986.86-246,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2399.309,2399.944,Yes.
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2399.944,2405.396,The current system is one of having a bifurcated system with mitigating factors being presented.
1986.86-246,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2405.396,2407.014,"By the jury, not the judge."
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2407.014,2409.632,"To the jury, yes, and they make the decision."
1986.86-246,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2409.632,2416.053,"Is that true all throughout your criminal system, jury sentencing, as in most of the Southern states?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2416.053,2422.707,"No, sometimes there's a three-judge panel that could be involved in a particular case."
1986.86-246,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2422.707,2424.559,Suppose somebody is up for robbery; he's convicted.
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2426.428,2432.582,"Normally the judge, who has a range of years from which he can pick."
1986.86-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2432.582,2437.2,But then... just to be sure I understand... the jury participates only in capital cases in the sentencing?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2437.2,2440.669,"Right, that's correct."
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.073,2453.578,xxx factors should have been presented in this particular case to the judge?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2453.578,2457.63,"--In this particular case, it would be to the jury, if it was a jury trial."
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.63,2465.303,"Well, but I know, in the mandatory... under the mandatory statute, the jury had nothing to do with the sentence?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2465.303,2466.353,"Well, that's correct."
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.688,2477.861,So you're saying that this statute must... that the Constitution required the jury to do the sentencing?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2477.861,2484.865,"--The jury, under the old system in Nevada, had nothing to say but guilty or innocent, one or the other."
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.168,2499.707,"But you are... you don't suggest that the jury... that the Constitution requires the jury to do the sentencing, do you?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2499.707,2501.226,"--No, I'm not."
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.226,2510.182,"So it would satisfy your argument, suppose, if the judge had the discretion to consider mitigating circumstances?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2510.182,2515.986,"We are asking for something very minimal, and that's just the opportunity to present something at the hearing."
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.986,2520.521,And so the judge would have had the discretion not to impose any penalty at all?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2520.521,2522.473,Perhaps.
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.942,2526.794,"Well, not perhaps."
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2536.482,2538.767,That's basically it.
1986.86-246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2591.902,2593.452,"Well, how old was he in '73?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2593.452,2594.854,Eighteen... in '73?
1986.86-246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2594.854,2595.621,Yes.
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2595.621,2598.906,I think he was 38.
1986.86-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2603.358,2618.784,Does the imposition of a second death sentence under these... a second sentence of life without possibility of parole in Nevada have any collateral consequences within the prison?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2629.123,2634.96,I'm not aware whether solitary confinement as part of the statutory scheme would be available.
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2642.649,2644.116,"Well, only if he is a considered a danger."
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2655.741,2660.361,"No, but perhaps wardens... they have what they often call administrative segregation."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2660.361,2661.628,"--Oh, if he's dangerous."
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2684.858,2685.81,"Well, I would imagine that--"
1986.86-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2685.81,2688.026,"Mr. Markoff, do you know the rules of the penitentiary?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2688.026,2689.278,--Not in any detail.
1986.86-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2689.278,2692.23,I'm just wondering what this--
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2692.23,2695.916,"All I know is from a general perspective, and that's--"
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.916,2700.07,"--Well, you're not asserting that the warden has any authority to do that?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2700.07,2701.686,"--Not in terms of punishment, perhaps."
1986.86-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2703.855,2705.672,"Well, but that isn't really the example here."
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2721.983,2723.935,They might have a basis for differentiating between them.
1986.86-246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.855,2738.259,"Could the warden put him in a fireproof cell, do you think?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2738.259,2739.877,I suppose he could.
1986.86-246,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2739.877,2746.698,I'm still confused by all this talk about a second life sentence without parole.
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2752.434,2754.134,It is a possibility.
1986.86-246,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2754.134,2756.386,Isn't that the major risk that you're running--
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2756.386,2758.672,"It is a major risk, yes."
1986.86-246,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2758.672,2763.207,--Then why all this talk about a second life sentence without parole?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2763.207,2774.615,"Because that's another option that's available if a jury is to hear, or the sentencer whoever it may be, is to hear mitigating factors on behalf of this person."
1986.86-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2791.31,2804.736,"Well, do you concede that if the Ninth Circuit is affirmed, that the death sentence could be imposed for this particular individual, lawfully?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2804.736,2810.288,Depending on the facts as they were to be presented at a hearing.
1986.86-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2818.394,2819.211,What do you mean by that?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2831.22,2835.588,--We think that is one of the options that is available to the Court.
1986.86-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2835.588,2837.374,Is your answer yes or no?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2837.374,2840.659,Yes.
1986.86-246,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2840.659,2846.896,"Did not the district court, in its conclusion, say that the case would be remanded for resentencing?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2846.896,2849.598,That's what District Judge Reed did do.
1986.86-246,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2849.598,2851.398,That would be under the new statute?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2851.398,2853.633,"As I read it, that's correct."
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.633,2858.621,What was the... I guess I could look it up... but what was the precise remand?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2869.493,2883.336,"It is further ordered that said Ramond Wallace Shuman is discharged and released from confinement on account of his sentence pronounced in case No. 33-259, unless the State within 120 days of this date orders, initiates, and completes a lawful resentencing proceeding in accordance with this order."
1986.86-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.336,2888.056,You mean he's going to be released from his sentence of life without parole?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2888.056,2895.627,"No, no, the death sentence which had been imposed at that time."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.787,2939.239,What mitigation did you introduce?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2951.714,2953.916,"That's certainly a possibility, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.916,2956.2,It's the only possibility other than death.
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2956.2,2957.217,Uh-huh.
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.217,2961.402,And what mitigating evidence did you seek to introduce?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2961.402,2963.854,We did not seek to introduce anything.
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.127,2978.614,"No, but he's complaining about the inability of the jury to consider mitigating evidence."
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2981.316,2984.352,--None was proffered because it wasn't permitted.
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2984.352,2987.72,"In his habeas proceeding, what did he bring forward?"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,2993.624,2998.111,"Well, the fact is that that was not really the issue that was being litigated at the time."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3010.085,3015.989,"Well, still, on habeas, you'd expect him to come forward and say, you know, had I had the opportunity, what I would have said is--"
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,3015.989,3017.941,Well--
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3017.941,3021.143,--You would expect him to point to some mitigating evidence that existed.
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,3021.143,3028.214,"--Well, I'm pointing to some of them right here, and the fact that the codefendant was released, for instance, ten years ago; that life without parole doesn't mean life without parole."
1986.86-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3028.214,3031.016,That's mitigating evidence on his part?
1986.86-246,1,36300,m_daniel_markoff,,3031.016,3034.285,"No, no, it's mitigating evidence as to why the death penalty shouldn't be imposed."
1986.86-246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3227.243,3228.962,"Thank you, Mr. Markoff."
1986.86-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3233.68,3238.484,Would you start off by telling us about this parole business?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3238.484,3241.77,"Yes, sir, that's the first thing, Your Honor, I was going to do."
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3262.266,3263.766,How did this codefendant get out?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3263.766,3268.837,"--This codefendant, I suspect, being imprisoned for 20 years, made an application to the pardons board."
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.789,3274.305,"Well, why did the pardon board... oh, the pardon--"
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3274.305,3274.888,--The pardons board.
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3274.888,3275.271,--He was pardoned?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3276.938,3278.007,"Yes, sir."
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3278.007,3278.39,By the executive?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3278.39,3279.423,"Yes, sir."
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3279.423,3279.973,I see.
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3279.973,3288.129,"The parole board has no authority under Nevada law, did not then, does not now, to reduce a life without sentence."
1986.86-246,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3288.129,3292.767,"Do you know this as fact, or is that your supposition of what happened?"
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3292.767,3296.718,That is my... oh as to what happened to--
1986.86-246,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3296.718,3297.084,The codefendant.
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3297.084,3299.086,--It is my supposition that that is what happened.
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3299.086,3303.455,"Well, you say that's all that could have happened."
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3306.24,3309.109,"The fact of the pardon, Your Honor, we can find that out."
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.18,3314.613,"Well, whoever it was."
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3314.613,3315.346,"Yes, sir, we can."
1986.86-246,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3315.346,3317.082,Do you know that he's out?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3317.082,3318.398,"Yes, we know that he's out."
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.398,3319.9,And you can tell us why he's out?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3319.9,3321.05,Yes.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3321.05,3328.523,Is there any official material that tells us how often this sort of relief is granted to prisoners under this sentence?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3328.523,3332.725,I'm not sure if the pardons board has those statistics Your Honor.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3334.677,3338.212,Are their decisions officially reported in any publication?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3338.212,3340.497,--They are not officially reported in any publication.
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3352.221,3357.19,"Well, do the... do inmates, I suppose, just apply for a pardon, don't they?"
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3357.19,3358.042,"Yes, they do."
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.042,3359.108,And do they get a hearing?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3359.108,3360.658,"Yes, they do."
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.658,3362.244,And do they have a right to a hearing?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3362.244,3365.446,"They have an absolute right, yes, they do, under--"
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.446,3369.348,So that it's sort of like asking for parole?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3369.348,3375.135,--It is asking for... it is a clemency proceeding that is not a matter of right.
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3375.135,3379.389,"Well, I know, but if he's guilty, he certainly isn't going to have that right very long."
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3379.389,3380.606,That is correct.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3380.606,3382.908,"General McKay, do you serve on that board."
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3382.908,3383.974,Yes.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3383.974,3388.912,"And just within the last year, how many favorable rulings have you made in cases like this?"
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3388.912,3392.613,Reducing a life without to a life with.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3397.917,3399.785,But there has been at least one other one?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3399.785,3402.571,I can't tell you for sure if it's been within the last year.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3404.387,3406.623,"Well say, take five years, how often does it happen?"
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3408.891,3412.26,"From life without to life with, yes, it's probably happened one or two times."
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3412.26,3412.843,Each year?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3412.843,3416.479,"No, since I've served on the board in that five year period."
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3416.479,3423.501,So this codefendant is really quite exceptional when he got this relief?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3423.501,3427.537,"I can't tell you statistically, Your Honor, if that is the case."
1986.86-246,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3427.537,3433.873,"And you don't know, in the one or two times it's happened since you've been on the board, you don't remember why?"
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3439.76,3443.196,I'm just... I just can't answer that question for sure.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3448.498,3454.468,I take it an additional option would be to reduce it something even further.
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3454.468,3455.004,That is correct.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3455.004,3457.637,Does that happen once in awhile?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3457.637,3461.491,"Again, without looking at the statistics, I can't tell... I cannot tell you from my own knowledge."
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3461.491,3462.241,"Well, let me put it this way."
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3466.192,3468.061,They do not have a statutory right to a hearing.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3468.061,3469.361,"Under your rules, they have a right?"
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3469.361,3471.929,"Under the policy of the board, they are entitled to a hearing."
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3471.929,3475.065,Roughly how many of these hearings have you had in the last five years?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3475.065,3475.75,Two... ten.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3475.75,3477.017,Pardon me?
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3477.017,3477.6,Ten.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3478.702,3479.852,"Two a year, I see."
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3481.821,3485.856,"No, there are anywhere from three to seven applicants on the average."
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3485.856,3491.36,"So in two hearings there might be 15 a year, 10 or 15 people."
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3491.36,3491.693,That is correct.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.693,3495.145,"So over five years, there would be 60 or 70 people might have these hearings."
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3503.268,3504.668,We're just talking about life without.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3504.668,3505.186,--Yes.
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3505.186,3508.738,There are not very many life withouts that come on before the pardons board.
1986.86-246,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3508.738,3510.371,I see.
1986.86-246,2,21266,d_brian_mckay,,3510.371,3515.875,"It covers any type of... any type of clemency is the purpose of the board, and this is just one particular area."
1986.86-246,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3584.437,3585.637,"Thank you, General McKay."
