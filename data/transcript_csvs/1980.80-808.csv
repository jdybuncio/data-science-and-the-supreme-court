1980.80-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.174,We'll hear arguments next in United States v. Turkette.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,60.005,63.323,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-808,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.644,151.048,"Well the First Circuit theory really was that these people were so totally illegal that they had to be acquitted, wasn't it?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,151.048,152.164,I think that's correct.
1980.80-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,155.883,164.022,Or was it that they were so well organized in their enterprise that--
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,164.022,175.33,I believe the holding of the Court below was that enterprises that are entirely and completely illegal are not within the scope of the principal anti racketeering statute in the federal criminal code.
1980.80-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,246.01,255.916,"--Under the First Circuit theory, on which side of the line would fall an enterprise that had an apparently legitimate front, that is, a truck line, or whatever, but was--"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,255.916,257.518,"Well, I think that's difficult to--"
1980.80-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,257.518,269.041,"--was engaged 75 percent or 90 percent in shooting for hire, killing for hire, arson for hire and extortion and loan sharking."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,271.827,283.635,"--I don't think one knows with certainty, because the meaning of the terms legitimate and illegitimate are by no means self evident, and neither the statute nor the legislative history offer any guidance on the meaning of those terms."
1980.80-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,295.443,296.093,You think that's irrelevant?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,299.328,304.399,"--We do, because we think both ""legitimate"" and ""illegitimate"" are within the statute."
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,321.291,324.126,"In any event, it's common ground there has to be an enterprise."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,324.126,325.728,It is common ground that there has to be an enterprise.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,325.728,329.114,"And enterprise is defined in the statute how, where is it?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,329.114,335.418,"Relevant here, enterprise is defined as an entity consisting of a group of individuals associated in fact."
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,339.805,341.855,A corporation would be an enterprise.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,341.855,343.388,A corporation would also be an enterprise.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,343.388,343.971,Or a corporate association.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,343.971,344.555,A labor union would.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.273,347.557,Where is the statutory definition?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,347.557,351.827,It's in Section 1961(4) which is reprinted in our Appendix to the petition.
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,351.827,353.893,Thank you.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,375.608,377.825,"Well, if I understand the question correctly I believe there is."
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,382.862,393.987,"Well no, what I'm trying to get at is what distinguishes a group of persons who commit a pattern of racketeering activities, that is, two predicate acts from an illegal enterprise?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,393.987,412.832,"The enterprise is an entity looking to the common meaning of the word associate, and Congress used the word associate in the definition of entity, we think that means that the group of individuals had to join together to form a confederacy or a union for some common purpose or overall objective."
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,428.924,434.228,What do you think the statute means when it says enterprise includes any individual?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,434.228,440.132,"--I believe what that means is that an individual may be an enterprise, and--"
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,440.132,445.017,So one person could be prosecuted under RICO?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,445.017,446.786,--I think that is conceivable.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.786,450.187,If he were carrying on an illegitimate... the illegitimate business of bank robbery?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,450.187,454.072,"Let me say that is not at issue in this case, and as far as I know, the government has never brought a case--"
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,454.072,457.408,Under the statutory definition do you submit that he could?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,457.408,463.812,"--I believe he could; if the person were engaged in a sole proprietorship of crime rather than a partnership in crime, it seems to me--"
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.812,468.747,If he were an individual entrepreneur bank robber he could be prosecuted under RICO?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,469.382,470.632,"--In some circumstances, for example--"
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,470.632,471.282,Well what circumstances?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,471.282,473.884,--if he held himself out as being engaged in the business--
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,473.884,474.401,"No, he's not holding himself out."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,475.903,479.421,"--And he does it repeatedly, using a similar plan."
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,480.237,483.039,What's this got to do with a similar plan?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,488.027,488.577,--If two people--
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,488.577,491.429,--enterprise includes any individual this says.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,491.429,492.579,--That's correct.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,492.579,501.687,"And that means that any person who is a repetitive offender can be prosecuted under RICO, does it?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,501.687,503.47,"Well, I think not necessarily."
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,508.107,511.726,"When I say can be prosecuted under RICO, I mean not necessarily."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,511.726,512.193,--Yes.
1980.80-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.335,531.289,So any professional criminal in the sense that this is his business--
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,531.289,532.522,This is an organized criminal enterprise.
1980.80-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.522,534.591,--is a criminal enterprise for purposes of RICO.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,535.724,541.045,You can organize in the sense that you engage in a conduct in an organized ant recurring--
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,541.045,543.764,Well an individual operates individually--
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,543.764,544.28,--That's right.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,544.28,545.966,--not through an organization.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,545.966,547.666,That is correct in some circumstances.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,547.666,548.918,"Well in every circumstance, isn't it?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,548.918,550.401,"If the individual is acting alone, that's right."
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,550.401,555.322,"Well, an enterprise includes any individual this says."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,555.322,556.005,That's correct.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,558.723,560.09,He's included.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,560.09,561.408,--That is correct.
1980.80-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.408,566.443,But he violates 1962(c) when he commits two bank robberies.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,566.443,575.216,"No, I think that if he commits two bank robberies that are in the language used in the legislative history, sporadic or isolated, he commits the one year and five years later, bearing no relationship."
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,575.216,577.335,And in the meantime he's a bank clerk.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,577.335,578.52,For example.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,580.57,581.555,Where does the statute exempt?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,581.555,583.389,That's a different problem.
1980.80-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.389,587.074,"Say he commits two bank robberies, one on February 1st, one on March 1st."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,590.328,591.128,It might well violate--
1980.80-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.128,593.613,"Under 1962(c), isn't that directly covered?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,593.613,595.397,--It might well violate the statute.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,603.518,611.924,"Well I just wonder then, upon... your argument rests upon the statutory definition of enterprise, and enterprise includes any individual."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,611.924,614.193,"It does, and it also includes a group of individuals associating--"
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,614.193,616.46,"Well it includes any individual, and--"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,616.46,617.745,--The statute does provide that.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,617.745,620.964,"--And therefore, and yet the government has never utilized that against an individual?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,620.964,622.899,"To the best of my knowledge, they have not--"
1980.80-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.899,627.284,"Well the statute does define an enterprise as any individual, doesn't it?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,627.284,627.884,--It does.
1980.80-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.553,647.797,"Well then certainly you could, I suppose, one person could infiltrate another individual, I mean, if you couldn't be prosecuted for your own activities you could subvert an individual proprietorship of another."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,647.797,652.465,"--You might be able to, and that might fall within either subsections (a) or (b), depending on the method of infiltration."
1980.80-808,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.465,655.551,Kind of like the aliens?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,655.551,660.121,I'm sorry?
1980.80-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,660.121,667.859,"After your answers to my colleagues' questions, I get back to the question I asked you, Mr. Levy."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,687.088,693.826,The fact that a group of individuals commit two illegal acts does not ipso facto establish a violation of the statute.
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,703.282,709.036,"Well I know, but you've already told us an individual may be an enterprise, a group of persons committing two predicate acts may be an enterprise."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,709.036,710.302,"--They may be, but they are not necessarily."
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,710.302,719.125,"Well then I still ask you what... how are either of those distinguished from ""an illegal enterprise""?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,721.944,723.345,Perhaps I didn't understand the question.
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,739.405,754.631,"Well of course, what I'm getting at is, the First Circuit as I read their opinion, had the idea that to include an illegal enterprise within 1962(c) would make that section internally redundant."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,754.631,757.45,"--That was the suggestion of the First Circuit, that's correct."
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,757.45,765.688,What I'm just trying to find out is is that idea wholly without merit?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,765.688,772.559,We believe it is without merit; that there is nothing that makes the provisions redundant or internally inconsistent.
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,810.301,817.055,"Incidentally, while I have you interrupted, Mr. Levy, looking at 1961(4), what's the meaning of"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,823.409,835.517,Well I think the second clause of 1961(4) was designed to expand the reach of the word enterprise to include entities that are not in contemplation of law a separate and definable--
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,835.517,836.483,Can you illustrate that?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,836.483,838.435,"--Well a union would be one example, I think."
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,838.435,843.039,"Well, no, they say... expressly a union... what's"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,846.49,855.796,"Well I think if you had some informal group of individuals who formed a civic association or a bridge club or something like that, there would be no entity in the legal sense."
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,855.796,857.865,"This even reaches bridge clubs, RICO?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,857.865,858.882,Excuse me?
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,858.882,860.865,"This even reaches bridge clubs, does it?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,860.865,866.136,Not necessarily; they would still have to commit a pattern of racketeering activities and I assume most bridge players would not do that.
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,868.754,873.44,But even as my brother White just suggested what if they play for money?
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,873.44,875.158,--And that were a violation of state law?
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,875.158,876.76,Yes.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,876.76,878.71,It's conceivable that the statute--
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,878.71,881.262,"The bridge club might be prosecuted, under RICO?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,881.262,884.714,--Just as a large scale gambling syndicate would be.
1980.80-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.348,887.882,"Just like it might be prosecuted now, under state law?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,887.882,889.151,"--It might be, or under the travel act, or the--"
1980.80-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,889.151,890.367,Playing for money.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,890.367,892.203,--I think that's right.
1980.80-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,892.203,902.009,"Well, I suppose what is commonly called the Mafia is not a corporation or an association, but it would be covered here?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,902.009,917.835,"I think that's absolutely correct, and I think that's... certainly incongruous to think that Congress in passing the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act didn't mean to take into account the Cosa Nostra or the Mafia in the prohibitions of the Act."
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,960.681,971.971,"Well, it's not that they wished them to be immune from prosecution, but they... Congress might rationally have thought entirely illegitimate businesses are already prohibited by other criminal laws."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,971.971,975.59,"I don't doubt that Congress could have drafted the statute in many ways, but I think there's--"
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,975.59,984.529,"It wouldn't have been totally irrational for Congress to say well, since those are covered by existing laws, the new law will try to reach something else."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,984.529,989.783,"--By definition, any prosecution under RICO has to involve the violation of some other statutes."
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,995.921,1011.363,"And because of its primary concern, and the legislative history is certainly replete with this, that the primary concern of Congress... this doesn't totally undercut your argument at all... was, the infiltration of legitimate business by organized crime."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1011.363,1014.165,--Nobody doubts that that was a principal concern of Congress.
1980.80-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1017.8,1028.992,"But your point is, the Mafia which is, does not purport to be a legitimate business, would be covered if their whole objective and stated purpose was illegal?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1028.992,1031.492,"That's right, that would not be covered under the decision of the court below."
1980.80-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1031.492,1035.579,"That is, arson for hire, murder for hire, or kidnapping for hire?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1035.579,1037.029,That's correct.
1980.80-808,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.242,1078.056,"Mr. Levy, there are a number of kind of ambiguous phrases in the briefs and so on, yet as you pointed out illegitimate and legitimate... pose questions in the brief of what is organized crime as opposed to unorganized crime?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1078.056,1079.341,Or perhaps disorganized crime?
1980.80-808,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1079.341,1080.341,Or disorganized crime.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1080.341,1082.377,The statute and the legislative history don't define that.
1980.80-808,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1098.886,1101.188,"Well, what's racketeering?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1101.188,1109.642,"--The statute offers the definition of what Congress meant by racketeering, and those are the enumerated statutes found in 1961 Subsection 1."
1980.80-808,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1115.779,1119.4,"For buying protection, and that sort of thing?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1119.4,1122.635,"--Well I think it had in mind those things, but it didn't by any means limit itself to that."

1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1257.84,1258.456,--Excuse me?
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1258.456,1259.556,--Two men robbed a bakery.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1259.556,1260.39,"A bakery, yes sir."
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1260.39,1266.829,"They never see one another for another eight years and then they run into one another and they decide, let's go ahead and rob another one."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1272.048,1272.9,I think not.
1980.80-808,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1297.115,1316.293,"But how about 1961 Subsection 5, where it defines pattern of racketeering activity as at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this Chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years, including any period of imprisonment."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1327.751,1328.251,--Exactly so.
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1330.37,1332.722,But the enterprise element would not be.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1332.722,1333.572,--That's exactly right.
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1333.572,1340.075,"What would have to be, I gather, the two would... on the occasion of the first robbery, let's go into the business of robbery."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1341.558,1342.041,That--
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1342.041,1343.76,That then would be an enterprise.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1343.76,1344.177,--That's right.
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1344.91,1354.066,"But the hypothetical I gave you, they were just isolated acts with no agreement between them to make this a regular pattern of living."
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1354.066,1355.001,--That's correct.
1980.80-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1355.001,1356.685,Let's take another one.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1386.154,1387.372,"I think it would be, yes."
1980.80-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1388.172,1392.091,"Whether there's one, two or ten, it's an enterprise, is that right?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1392.091,1392.693,I think that's correct.
1980.80-808,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1403.232,1405.984,Well then in that bridge example we were talking about earlier.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1410.855,1414.34,"--I think they would, although I don't mean to suggest that bridge clubs would be--"

1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1419.71,1420.093,--That's correct.
1980.80-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.295,1423.262,But your argument does.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1448.797,1453.949,--I don't believe this case would be any different if the word individual in the definition of enterprise had been omitted.
1980.80-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.949,1454.684,I think your case would be a little easier.
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1454.684,1455.467,Excuse me?
1980.80-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1455.467,1458.985,"Well, it's a difference of opinion... don't you think your case might be a little easier?"
1980.80-808,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1458.985,1474.012,"I don't believe our case would since it involved a group of individuals and more than 50 drug store burglaries, for example, and by no means the single individual or a sporadic and isolated pattern of crime."
1980.80-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1540.806,1543.241,"Very well, Mr. Levy."
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,1546.11,1551.662,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1659.484,1665.12,"Well let's accept that it does all those things, what do you say it can't do?"
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,1665.12,1666.353,Sir?
1980.80-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1666.353,1669.139,What do you say that it can't do?
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,1671.807,1683.115,"What I say, Mr. Chief Justice, is what RICO was designed to do was to be used like a scalpel, rather than a meat cleaver."
1980.80-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1699.125,1708.08,"Well are you saying there must be a legitimate business involved, and then there is some illegitimate penetration of that, is that it?"
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,1708.08,1708.713,Yes sir.
1980.80-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1709.463,1712.865,It would have to be totally illegitimate from the outset?
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,1712.865,1723.49,"--No sir, not under, the definition, and under the precise restricted purpose that Congress had in enacting this one section."
1980.80-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1783.962,1793.586,"Mr. Wall, why does your distinction between victim and criminal enterprise itself necessarily answer our problem?"
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,1813.231,1821.837,"--There are other titles within the Organized Crime Act, and other specific statutes that take care of that particular problem."
1980.80-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.837,1827.34,What takes care of the takeover problem other than 1962(b)?
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,1830.275,1837.446,"What I'm suggesting, sir, is that that is a simple extortion that could be handled under another statute."
1980.80-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1837.446,1845.602,"Well maybe it wasn't an extortion, maybe it was just a... using whatever these racketeering activities as defined in the statute are, just to take over an illegal enterprise?"
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,1861.481,1893.952,"Well, the reason that analogy is helpful is that if we follow the Elliott definition and say that all illegal enterprises are included, then we have no cohesive thought to apply the conspiracy concept to."
1980.80-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.802,1965.898,"Well, as long as you've lost your train of thought for a moment, the word enterprise as contained in the definitional section of the statute doesn't make any distinction between legal and illegal entities, does it?"
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,1965.898,1970.868,"It does, Your Honor, I suggest... Mr. Justice, if you look at the statute--"
1980.80-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1970.868,1989.329,"I'm talking about 1961(4) where it says enterprise includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal entity and any union or group of individuals associated in fact, although not a legal entity."
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,1989.329,1995.9,"--Yes sir, it does make a distinction as the First Circuit and other courts in dissenting opinions have pointed out."
1980.80-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2029.055,2045.85,"In the hypothetical I put to your friend about the individual, just one man, who goes around to the... a dozen pharmacies and says you sell me 500 units of cocaine every week, or your windows will be broken."
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2056.474,2065.913,"I say that that, the RICO statute, this section, was not directed at that activity, and that has been the problem of many a--"

1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2085.074,2103.003,--They weren't because... because they stated that with this particular title they were directing the protection to the victims of... interstate businesses that were victims of organized criminal activity.

1980.80-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2144.063,2151.919,"Mr. Wall, would you say the loners who engage in this activity are not covered by RICO?"
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2156.454,2158.073,"In what activity, now?"
1980.80-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2158.073,2160.508,Extortion of the druggist.
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2167.762,2168.995,That's absolutely correct.
1980.80-808,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2168.995,2170.381,It's illegal activity.
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2170.381,2172.499,"It's illegal activity, there has to be--"
1980.80-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2172.499,2177.117,"I was just starting with the first category, I was going to take you through the rest of them."
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2177.117,2177.617,--The loner--
1980.80-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2177.617,2180.402,Is it not covered if it's illegal from its inception?
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2180.402,2192.16,"--If the loner in the first instance, by robbing the drug store intends only to rob the drugstore, he's not covered."
1980.80-808,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2219.463,2222.246,"Then the enterprise is the drugstore, it's not the individual?"
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2222.246,2225.367,--That's correct.
1980.80-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.816,2260.79,"In your ejusdem argument, or argument under the definition, you assume as I understand it, the first listed things like partnership, corporation, association, would necessarily be legitimate."
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2277.466,2284.087,"That, sir, was precisely the reason that liberal construction provision was submitted, I suggest."
1980.80-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2319.929,2324.047,"But not if it's a wholly illegal business, you don't broadly construe it then?"
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2324.047,2325.097,No sir.
1980.80-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.097,2328.851,Even though it's a victim?
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2328.851,2331.301,Anderson says that they would.
1980.80-808,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2344.844,2363.038,"I don't see, personally, I don't see how urging us to apply broad principles and broad construction to criminal statutes helps a defendant."
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2364.557,2368.359,"Well, Mr. Justice, I'm not suggesting that."
1980.80-808,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2387.62,2391.688,You apply one part of it liberally and the other part--
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2391.688,2404.963,"--One part liberal to the definition as to who is an enterprise, who is a legal enterprise, because as somewhere in the legislative history was mentioned, organized crime may form all kinds of different ways to get around this."
1980.80-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2434.748,2443.754,--But you're not observing Congress' admonition that organized crime may find all sorts of ways to get around these definitions.
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2443.754,2447.806,"I am, Your Honor, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-808,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2598.888,2625.739,"Mr. Wall, I gather from what you said much earlier, you read 1962(c) as addressed to a situation in which some employee or somebody associated with a legitimate enterprise, sets about conducting that legitimate enterprise in business through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2629.809,2632.994,Yes sir.
1980.80-808,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2632.994,2636.446,Is there anything in the legislative history to support that very narrow reading?
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2636.446,2639.131,Yes sir.
1980.80-808,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2642.917,2654.341,This is all part of your basic argument that Congress was more interested in protecting a victim from--
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2654.341,2655.558,--Than getting the wrongdoer--
1980.80-808,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2655.558,2656.81,--infiltration or otherwise--
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2656.81,2657.71,--Title 10.
1980.80-808,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2670.636,2680.942,--What's collection of unlawful debt?
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2680.942,2682.627,"A gambling debt, I assume."
1980.80-808,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2682.627,2684.694,Or usurious debts?
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2684.694,2686.829,"Or usurious, yes sir."
1980.80-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2686.829,2693.533,Certainly in 1962... goes after some variety of criminal behavior?
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2701.756,2710.443,It's to create a criminal... a... to focus in on the protection of the victim; that's precisely the purpose of 1962.
1980.80-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2710.443,2714.164,"But 1962 also makes criminal some conduct, does it not?"
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2714.164,2715.114,It certainly does.
1980.80-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2729.706,2734.977,So it isn't as if it were just kind of a reparation statute or a victim of crime statute.
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2739.295,2740.231,Right.
1980.80-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2742.031,2743.749,"I mean, how do you square your previous statement--"
1980.80-808,1,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,2743.749,2744.399,"Well, excuse me."
