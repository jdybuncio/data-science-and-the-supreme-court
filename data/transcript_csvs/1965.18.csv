1965.18,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.904,"International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of America, AFL-CIO, Petitioner, versus Russell Scofield et al."
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,33.465,35.234,May it please the Court.
1965.18,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,202.438,205.648,Was -- they sought to review that precise order?
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,205.648,208.915,"Yes sir, the precise order is --"
1965.18,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,208.915,211.128,It was -- it wasn't on any collateral phase?
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,211.128,214.246,"No sir, they wanted an order saying in so finding."
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,271.052,273.856,Did anybody oppose intervention on the Court of Appeals?
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,273.856,276.045,"There was a rather mix up, if Your Honor please."
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,292.066,293.035,"They're not here, are they?"
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,293.035,296.192,They're not here Your Honor either by brief or oral argument.
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,296.192,300.064,And they were not of course -- they were not parties in the Court of Appeals really?
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,300.064,302.607,"They are -- yes, they're the -- they're the appellant."
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,302.607,303.505,"Yes, they are the appellant."
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,303.505,306.674,"They are the appellant in the Court of Appeals, but there -- and the Board is (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,306.674,308.201,And the petitioner that is.
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,308.201,309.96,They're the petitioner in the Court of Appeals.
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,312.42,313.165,And you the intervener (Voice Overlap) --
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,313.165,317.822,"-- the Board said fine, but they said -- they told us later they did oppose it."
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,330.521,333.401,Is there any explanation as to why they're not here in this Court?
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,333.401,335.407,Not to my knowledge.
1965.18,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,339.878,341.694,The Court of Appeals wrote no opinion?
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,341.694,343.176,No sir.
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,343.176,343.626,So this is --
1965.18,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,343.626,344.543,Not in this case.
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,344.543,345.597,So this case isn't --
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,345.597,345.686,It's not --
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,345.686,346.774,-- it's really being litigated here?
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,346.774,351.22,I'm only wanting to tell you about it because I want to show you later the other case is the same.
1965.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,378.528,384.706,"Well, Mr. Rauh then, then I gather, you insist if it's due process problem, that you're entitled to right."
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,387.003,397.158,"That is correct, Your Honor and we feel that this Court should -- in its opinion, made clear that on the request for intervention, we should be permitted in and it's not a matter of discussion."
1965.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,402.167,406.991,"Well, is it supervisory or is it due process?"
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,408.939,411.6,"Well, I guess it's both, Your Honor, I believe."
1965.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,411.6,418.246,"Oh no, I would suppose if it was a supervisory, there might be a consideration of discretion."
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,419.748,420.436,It might be and then --
1965.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,420.436,421.34,-- the due process.
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,421.34,425.929,"It might be when you are -- actually, I don't -- it may be just a matter of semantics between us."
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,497.223,504.923,"Mr. Rauh, this legislation has been on the books a good many years now and what did the courts done in this first case which you say is (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,504.923,512.077,"In most cases that, in all -- in most cases, they have allowed intervention, as a matter fact, the Government's brief called this aberrational."
1965.18,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,550.663,551.52,Mr. Rauh --
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,551.52,552.421,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1965.18,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,552.421,560.205,"Excuse me, what about the procedural problem here, it worries me somewhat."
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,577.584,584.57,"Yes, Your Honor, which was granted last year, last term."
1965.18,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,584.57,591.024,"And it's your -- your I suppose confident of course, it's your position that that's a correct way to review this."
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,591.024,611.544,"Yes, Your Honor, although we had considered adding a possibility of a common law read under the all writ clause but we thought that you did have this power and apparently, the Court agreed when it did grant certiorari, that under 1254 (1), it is a proper ground here."
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,612.05,618.936,"Do you think there's any question at all about the -- since this isn't litigated, there's no need to raise a question, but --"
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,618.936,619.102,Well --
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,619.102,624.327,"Mr. Justice Fortas' suggestion raises a jurisdictional question which is always open of course, and is there any --"
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,624.327,631.916,"It's litigated in Number 53, it could be raised in 53, if the Government disagreed with us, they had the right to raise it at 53, which they have not done."
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,631.916,636.585,Is there any question about the time within which you filed a motion for reconsideration by a full hearing?
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,636.585,637.358,"Oh, no sir."
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,640.568,640.607,Right.
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,640.607,642.128,-- all of these things.
1965.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.627,645.081,"Yes, I know."
1965.18,0,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,645.081,649.228,This was a matter of days in all of these things.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2894.457,2899.133,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3030.995,3033.13,You mean the complaint is in his name?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3033.13,3035.084,The complaint is in his name and he --
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3035.084,3038.557,And that he controls the litigation before the Board.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3038.557,3049.155,"He controls the litigation in toto and his employer, the Federal Government pays for it in toto."
1965.18,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3068.615,3069.617,What page is that?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3069.617,3092.206,"It's on page 42 of our brief Mr. Justice Black, that says but nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the Board or its designated agent from limiting any party to participate in the proceedings to the extent of his interest only."
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3106.126,3110.829,"Well, suppose he -- he'd been -- he filed a charge to the General Counsel."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3110.829,3111.651,General Counsel.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3111.651,3113.55,The General Counsel issued the complaint.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.55,3114.088,Yes sir.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3114.088,3118.613,It goes to litigation before the Board and the Board dismisses the charge.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3118.613,3119.582,Yes sir.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3119.582,3122.57,Does he have a standing or may he go to the Court of Appeals.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3122.57,3124.276,If they dismiss the charge --
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3124.276,3124.287,Yes.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3124.287,3125.051,Yes sir.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3125.051,3125.75,He may.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3125.75,3126.316,Sure.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3126.316,3126.783,He then makes --
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3126.783,3128.357,He's an aggrieved party.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3128.357,3133.196,"So to that extent, he's a party, he may go to the Court of Appeals on a petition."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3133.196,3143.224,"The reason he goes to the Court of Appeals is as it has been said, in some of the cases, I think rather loosely becomes a private Attorney General because it's the only way it will go up."
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3146.245,3147.627,I don't go much for those labels.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3148.321,3148.682,Yes sir.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3148.682,3151.55,"-- he has a statutory right, does he not?"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3151.55,3151.834,Yes sir.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3151.834,3157.635,"He goes to the Court of Appeals on a petition and there he is the one who initiates the proceedings in the Court of Appeals, isn't it?"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3157.635,3161.441,But he has that by the statute itself.
1965.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3168.342,3171.288,He has that right because he's an aggrieved party here (Voice Overlap) --
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3171.288,3174.097,And the statute is the aggrieved party the right.
1965.18,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3174.097,3177.729,"In fact, the statutes says that an aggrieved person --"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3177.729,3177.867,Person --
1965.18,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3177.867,3178.783,-- so the statute doesn't help up us --
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3178.783,3178.858,Yes sir.
1965.18,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3178.858,3179.735,-- very much to the issue.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3189.215,3201.744,"We also would like to point out that from the beginning of this, the General Counsel and the Board can settle anything at any time."
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3244.482,3268.064,"Mr. Solicitor, before you get to this may I just ask, is it the Government's position that in circumstances of this kind, we ought to say that he should never be allowed in the Court of Appeals or merely that he has no right to get into the Court of Appeals but that the Courts of Appeals have discretion to let him in if they want to which is it?"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3268.064,3272.243,"I think we take the position, he certainly does not have the right."
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3283.654,3291.717,"In other words, that we should say that he neither has the right nor is there any discretion in the Courts of Appeals, no matter what the circumstance is?"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3291.717,3300.188,"I would, Mr. Justice Brennan, I'm worried about your second point because there haven't been any instances that I know of, there's such the --"
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3300.188,3300.621,Well --
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3300.621,3302.253,There is a type of one act --
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3302.253,3303.955,"Well, I haven't seen these cases but --"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3303.955,3310.204,"Well, I can tell you, I'd say that -- most of them, there are many that are not cited that aren't reported but --"
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3310.204,3316.235,"There were five cited here in the petition in -- I guess this is 18, is it?"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3316.235,3317.961,"Yes sir, we have some cited in ours too."
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3317.961,3331.759,"Without illuminating opinions of court rules in most circuits that denied intervention to the charging party, but intervention has occasionally been allowed, and then the citations, two from the District of Columbia, and two from the Seventh Circuit, one from the Eighth Circuit."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3331.759,3331.898,Well --
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3331.898,3332.852,I haven't read those cases.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3333.424,3334.094,Yes sir.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3357.655,3373.317,"But are you urging on us if I may come back to it, that we should say that the charging party in this circumstance should never be allowed in notwithstanding the Court of Appeals in particular situation, it may feel that discretion should be exercised."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3373.317,3380.585,"Well, I come back to intervention more or less the classical intervention is discretionary."
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3380.585,3381.499,That's right.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3381.499,3393.589,"The intervention as a matter of right is really not intervention, you have made a party, and I frankly would hate to take away from the Court of Appeals the right in the proper case."
1965.18,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3685.86,3687.639,What was the case you're reading from?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3690.301,3693.55,Mine Workers versus Eagle-Picher.
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3700.623,3706.612,"General, I don't understand why you're basing your concern about that case."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3711.409,3711.494,"Yes, sir."
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3711.494,3712.245,-- is that right?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3712.245,3713.106,Yes sir.
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3713.106,3725.593,"Now, do you dispute the proposition that once the Union has intervened, that has all the rights of the party in the Court of Appeals."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3725.593,3730.446,"Well, at that stage, I am not certain."
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3748.443,3761.775,"Well, I thought you're position was that the Court of Appeals should -- the discretionary power of the Court of Appeals to allow or disallow intervention in these situations should be recognized."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3761.775,3769.303,Providing there are special circumstances which might have been in this case.
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3769.303,3769.696,May I ask you --
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3769.696,3772.948,I just don't want to block the door on that special circumstance case.
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3772.948,3776.775,"Yes, may I ask you a further question here."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3792.222,3793.867,Yes sir.
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3793.867,3803.562,"-- does that require a order of the Court of Appeals, that it's a settlement on the case, does it require the order of the Court of Appeals?"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3803.562,3808.035,"Well, I can only say from experience on the Court."
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3818.691,3821.627,"But then, the panel of the court has agreed and asked --"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3821.627,3821.656,Yes.
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3821.656,3822.788,-- and sent an order.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3822.788,3824.539,"Without any exception, without any exception."
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3824.539,3825.825,What I don't understand.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3864.498,3866.977,"Oh, I think actually they could."
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3871.812,3872.47,"Yes, what I'm --"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3872.47,3874.862,-- discussions subject to this Court is pretty broad.
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3874.862,3891.14,"What I'm trying to get at is whether the position of the United States here and the Board is really an objection to the right, the asserted right of the Labor Union and Mr. Rauh's case to be heard number one."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3900.842,3908.083,"Well, my objection and the Board's objection is that he has no right."
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3921.122,3921.386,I want --
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3921.386,3926.906,We entered the fact that there are some money going to go to worker or what have you?
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3931.093,3934.438,"Mr. General, I want to make my question very clear."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3934.438,3935.368,I'm sorry.
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3935.368,3936.22,No.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3955.834,3956.788,If he's a party.
1965.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3956.788,3978.976,"Now, is that really the fact or is it the fact that all the Union would have in Mr. Rauh's case, would be the right to be heard, before the Court of Appeals to state its objections if they have any to the settlement, and then perhaps the right to petition in this Court's certiorari."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3978.976,4003.66,"Mr. Justice Fortas, I am afraid, I'm not hedging but I think it's a combination that we take the position that this private party has no right in the proceedings for any purpose as a party and the reason for that is because the entire weight of the Government is moving."
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4029.142,4040.445,Let's take a proceeding in the Court of Appeals and the Board and the respondents decide to settle.And the Union has been allowed to intervene in the Court of Appeals.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4050.917,4055.023,"I don't know of any, do they?"
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4055.023,4062.758,"It seemed to me, if the case was settled, then the consequences, I suppose, is the dismissal of the enforcement proceeding, isn't it?"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4062.758,4067.243,The only settlement that I have run across had been where two parties have signed.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4069.707,4072.251,"Well, I'm a little puzzled."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4084.174,4100.377,"Well, as to settlement, I don't know what the rule would be if two parties settle a case involving three parties."
1965.18,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4100.377,4114.082,"Suppose (Inaudible) -- you think the third party could go to the court and say, “They're settling my case, they've given away my claim, and I do not want you to permit this case to be dismissed,“ if he is a party."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4114.082,4114.479,I should think he would.
1965.18,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4114.479,4115.813,Is that what you argue?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4115.813,4118.102,I should think he would.
1965.18,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4150.029,4151.939,"It down the basic issue here, isn't it?"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4151.939,4152.515,That's it.
1965.18,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4152.515,4155.234,Whether or not it is just the public's interest.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4167.951,4168.716,Well I --
1965.18,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4168.716,4178.912,"-- whether we -- whether we can find something in the statute that says that, as far as I'm concerned, part of the statute that says that he has a right to have -- be heard."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4178.912,4199.724,"Well, I'm relying on the opinion of Chief Justice Hughes who points out how he went through the legislative history and he has the citations there and, of course also, rely on my favorite author, among the Court of Appeals' judges, Judge Friendly and he found a case who also went into it."
1965.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4223.072,4235.403,"Well General, if the proceeding only deals with public rights by this statute to say that any injured party could appeal."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4235.403,4243.665,"It's because as the cases we have cited, it gives the private party the public -- private attorney-general point."
1965.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4261.163,4270.489,Well -- but the injured person would be pursuing a private right with me rather than the public right --
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4270.489,4270.825,Right.
1965.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4270.825,4273.216,-- and would be controlling that situation?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4273.216,4277.72,"Yes sir, but that's why the Court says that in that instance, he's not a private individual."
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4375.441,4376.944,May I ask Mr. Solicitor.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4376.944,4377.673,"Yes, Justice Brennan."
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4377.673,4386.572,Has there been any effort to get Congress to amend the Act along the lines of Section 8 of the Hobbs Act?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4386.572,4389.328,Not that I know of at that court.
1965.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4397.32,4403.569,I mean even after that Blue Ribbon panel said this ought to be done.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4403.569,4427.45,"Well, I would like to say that on that -- the only thing I could say about that is that Professor Cox who wrote the -- who made the original study when he became Solicitor General Cox, approved the position that the Government took in these particular cases."
1965.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4453.637,4484.756,"Well, General I'm still -- I'm still bothered by this problem if -- when the statute says that any injured party may appeal and that an injured party does appeal, does the Court of Appeals determine only public rights, or does it perceive to determine on the record, the private rights of the parties in the case?"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4484.756,4488.905,The scheme of the statute is their public rights.
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4532.166,4532.432,"Well then, Mr. Solicitor --"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4532.432,4536.458,"-- not as to whether A, B, C gets a hundred bucks."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4536.458,4579.723,"Mr. Solicitor, let's concede for the moment that there are public rights involved, and that the issue before the Court of Appeals is a matter of public right, does it necessarily follow that therefore intervention in the Court of Appeals should not be allowed by that court to aid in the consideration of whatever the public right might be, it doesn't have to be a private right to permit intervention in a manner -- I suppose there is a public right involved when a charging party, a charged party is successful, and he's permitted to intervene there although where I suppose we're dealing with the public right."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4579.723,4581.465,"Yes, but he loses something."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4581.465,4592.895,"Well, he may, but it's a -- but it doesn't become a private right just be in one case and a public right in another."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4592.895,4595.156,"Well, I don't know."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4636.606,4640.91,But they want what a -- what a successful respondent gets.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4640.91,4648.831,"Yes, they -- no sir, they want to argue in addition to what General Counsel is going to argue."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4648.831,4650.887,"Well that's true, that's true."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4650.887,4655.221,"Well, what could they have in addition to what General Counsel has?"
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4672.678,4674.57,"Well, this is really getting down to it then, isn't it?"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4684.465,4685.465,Or whether he could --
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4685.465,4686.654,Is that the question?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4686.654,4693.674,"Yes sir, whether he could in his own personal interest --"
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4693.674,4696.716,Do any more than the General Counsel would?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4696.716,4700.352,"Well, take for example the petition for certiorari."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4700.352,4701.487,Yes.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4701.487,4715.215,"Now, if the Board loses, the Board, on the advice of the General Counsel decides whether or not they're going to apply for certiorari."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4734.483,4741.408,"But it was suggested that just because he became a party, he don't have all the rights of the party, that might be one of them that didn't have."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4741.408,4749.174,"Well, it would be very difficult under the supervisory power of this Court could go into that very great detail."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4749.174,4750.693,Yes.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4750.693,4770.274,"And I think the -- well, to sum up, I think number one, this Court should make it quite it clear that there is no right to intervene as a party, and as to whether or not the Court wants to leave the Court of Appeals with some discretion."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4772.06,4785.63,"Well, don't you think, isn't it -- in 18 as your position that this ought to be a matter of discretion rather than a right about the -- about the -- you think the successful respondent ought to be allowed to intervene in the Court of Appeals?"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4785.63,4790.437,"Well I'm worried about that case where -- well, to put it simply the --"
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4790.437,4796.964,Do you think that's a matter of right or a matter of discretion similar to -- I take it from your footnote --
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4796.964,4797.713,Right.
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4797.713,4801.897,"-- in your brief, that you think it's by analogy that 24 (b) in the District Court."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4801.897,4803.383,Right.
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4809.259,4810.097,The new appellate rules?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4810.097,4819.771,"The new appellate rules, they follow the general rule which doesn't intend to give anybody any right to intervene, just a general language that's in most of the Courts of Appeals."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4819.771,4821.352,Does it deal with intervention?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4821.352,4825.668,"Just that it is in the regular rules of the courts, the individual Courts of Appeals."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4825.668,4827.114,"What does it say, just the intervention (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4827.114,4834.7,"No, the party may intervene by filing this, this, and this and leave them to the whole jurisdiction, I mean discretion to the Court."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4834.7,4836.379,So it is a discretionary matter?
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4836.379,4837.043,Yes.
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4846.415,4846.579,Yes.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4846.579,4848.493,And there's a real good solid --
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4848.493,4848.761,Yes.
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4848.761,4849.364,-- issue there.
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4860.07,4872.139,"Well, I take it 18 then if the court have reversed this -- the Court of Appeals, we would do so in terms of an abuse of discretion."
1965.18,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4872.139,4874.488,"I think so, yes sir."
1965.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4880.808,4882.682,Yes.
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5213.626,5215.762,May it please the Court.
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5287.541,5289.445,"Mr. Rauh, I think you know about that yet."
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5294.572,5295.731,"No, it's split."
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5296.983,5298.34,Within the Board?
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5298.34,5299.338,"No, not at the Board, they think --"
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5299.338,5303.073,"I say at the board level, do you know that you're -- that you can't do anything about bargains."
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5303.073,5307.856,"That's right, but the Marine Engineers' case in the Third Circuit appears to indicate it's not valid now, but I'm not going to --"
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5307.856,5308.826,Even at the board level?
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5308.826,5309.198,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5309.198,5309.721,I see.
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5309.721,5313.047,All these settlement cases are at the board level.
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5319.596,5324.075,So you suppose I could anticipate what your position would be if we said you had the right to intervene?
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5324.075,5325.201,"Well, I'm not certain."
1965.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5402.895,5405.755,I know -- of course there's no question as I -- as I understand it.
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5415.468,5415.572,Certainly.
1965.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5415.572,5416.447,There are no appeal at all.
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5416.447,5416.675,Certainly.
1965.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5416.675,5417.813,-- the charging party -- that's the end of the line.
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5417.813,5419.456,"Absolutely, absolutely."
1965.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5419.456,5430.791,"Now, how much -- and I'm asking this for information, Mr. Rauh, I just need to know, how much actually control of the proceedings before the Board, does the General Counsel have or is designated?"
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5435.045,5442.172,"Well, we call our own witnesses, we cross-examine their witnesses."
1965.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5442.172,5443.474,Thiers -- who's theirs?
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5444.733,5450.493,"Yes, we cross-examine both the Board witnesses and the respondent's witnesses."
1965.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5477.101,5481.533,"And it's done (Voice Overlap) it's been my impression and as I have said this is informational, this isn't --"
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5481.533,5483.613,We have a full right to get subpoenas on --
1965.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5483.613,5488.253,"But my impressions that the General Counsel ran a show in there, insofar as the proceedings --"
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5488.253,5490.742,I don't see that I would use the word 'ran the show'.
1965.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5571.072,5574.205,I didn't -- I hope I didn't indicate what you indicated there.
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5574.205,5576.779,"No, but I want to make clear that that is the difference."
1965.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5576.779,5577.796,That's my indication.
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5577.796,5582.715,"Yes, Your Honor, there is a difference and I want to come to the difference."
1965.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5651.499,5679.824,"Mr. Rauh, excuse me, did I correctly understand you to say, just now that where the Labor Board and the other party, let me say, agree on a settlement compromise that the Court of Appeals has the power to approve that settlement despite the opposition in your case, of your Union."
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5679.824,5685.96,"Oh, I have no question if they have the power to approve it, despite our opposition."
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5685.96,5691.18,"If there's a settlement, what involves the Court of Appeals in the approval of the settlement?"
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5691.18,5691.411,Well they have always taken --
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5691.411,5692.997,I understand --
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5692.997,5695.001,-- all settlements have gone to the Court of Appeals.
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5706.296,5707.92,You mean the proceeding is not --
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5707.92,5708.247,"Well, the proceeding --"
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5708.247,5712.224,-- dismissed without prior approval of the Court of Appeals?
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5712.224,5719.237,"Well, I don't know if the procedure is here but it may be that if we try to dismiss this case, we'd have to ask the Court's permission, and I think it's the same way."
1965.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5719.237,5721.851,"Well yes, but do you submit the terms of the settlement?"

1965.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5726.348,5727.498,That's what entered by the --
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5727.498,5728.837,"Yes, I think that's correct."
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5734.505,5735.849,Absolutely.
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5735.849,5759.068,"-- call your attention to number 18 blue, it's at page 40 of our brief, Footnote 32 deals with Section 10 (l) which was put in to the law in 47 which I believe is a very clear analogy in the statute to where private intervention is required even though --"
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5759.068,5773.318,"Mr. Rauh I must say, if you suggest that that's what happens here, I've never known that to happen here, when the parties settle and they ask us to dismiss under the Rule 60, I've never looked at the terms of settlement, to decide whether the --"
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5773.318,5774.739,"No, I think you had a right to it, Your Honor."
1965.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5774.739,5775.832,You don't even submit them.
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5775.832,5776.954,Yes.
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5776.954,5778.371,But that happens in the Court of Appeals?
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5778.371,5779.103,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5782.411,5784.14,Was there -- is there any reason for that?
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5784.14,5784.374,Yes sir.
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5784.374,5786.754,-- is there any rule or statute or anything else to the problem?

1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5788.639,5795.416,"Well, once you're in the Court of Appeals, as far as I know when you dismiss any case, the Court has a right, it's a consent."
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5801.099,5805.77,But this -- this suggest that there has to be approval of the terms of the settlement
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5805.77,5806.771,Well I --
1965.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5806.771,5806.94,That's new to me.
1965.18,2,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,5806.94,5809.538,I think that may be the theoretical.
1965.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5809.538,5811.75,But do you actually submit the terms to the court --
