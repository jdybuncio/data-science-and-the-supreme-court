1977.76-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.913,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Number 76-419 Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power versus Natural Resources Defense Council and the consolidated case, Consumer's power Number 76-528."
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,22.591,26.513,Mr. Chief Justice and May It Please the Court.
1977.76-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,164.264,185.362,"Now before you proceed Mr. Dignan, may I ask you a question, the respondents say in their supplemental statement of facts that your client Vermont Yankee has now been granted an operating license, and at the time to seek review of that license has expired without petition for review being filed, is that correct?"
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,185.362,197.262,"Mr. Justice Stewart, we held an operating license, but that operating license at this time is good for 18 months only to what the duration of the so called interim rule which the commission has adopted."
1977.76-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,211.973,214.558,But when you came out of the Court of Appeals you had nothing.
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,214.558,217.925,We came out of the Court of Appeals we had a remand of the decision authorizing a license.
1977.76-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,217.925,219.716,And now you have a license.
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,219.716,228.211,Now we have a license which license is given to us under the interim rule which self destructs in 18 months therefore --
1977.76-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,228.211,230.139,And at the end of 18 months?
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,230.139,240.769,"The question then will be, whether or not there is a new rule in place as to whether Vermont Yankee's license would continue, or whether the commission takes some other action."
1977.76-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.358,416.476,By exceeded you mean there was more than adequate complaince.
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,416.476,418.202,That is our view Mr. Justice Stewart.
1977.76-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.202,421.613,And that you say was the Court of Appeals' view?
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,421.613,429.354,"Well, the Court of Appeals said that we exceeded the requirements of Section 553, but that that was not enough to comply with the act."
1977.76-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,647.635,657.437,"You would concede, would you not Mr. Dignan that there's some ambiguity in the opinion of the Court of Appeals particularly when viewed in the light of the concurring."
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,657.437,665.038,I would be less than candid with this court if I did not admit that this opinion admits of different readings by different people.
1977.76-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,685.616,688.751,In order to have sufficient ventilation and sufficient dialogue.
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,688.751,711.5,"If ventilation even be a requirement, ventilation in this opinion to me is one of those catchy words that is about find its way in to American Jurisprudence and I think it should not be allowed to because I don't know how to construct this ventilator, and I'm not sure that anyone at an agency will know precisely how to construct this ventilator."
1977.76-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,711.5,717.963,But you would certainly think it's the agency's job to construct it I gather rather then a court.
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,717.963,721.579,No I think it's -- the ventilator has been constructed by the congress Mr. Justice.
1977.76-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,721.579,729.828,I know but you wouldn't think that the agency broke the law by going through the procedures it went through here for the rule making.
1977.76-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.2,737.686,Yeah well it -– more then that it went farther you say.
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,737.686,743.595,"That is correct, and therefore this is why we think this decision is an error."
1977.76-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,743.595,757.22,"Mr. Dignan, supposing that the court should conclude that you're right on the procedural issue but that the record was the inadequate on the question waste disposal, what should the court do?"
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,757.22,773.681,"In so far as my client is concerned Mr. Justice, I think a remand with a direction to affirm the Vermont Yankee decision is in order certainly, because my client's right to that license I suggest does not depend on valid rule."
1977.76-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,810.686,815.746,"And agency suddenly doesn't have to marshal its own evidence under a notice and comment per se, does it?"
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,817.894,831.719,"I believe that is correct Mr. Justice it is not required to marshal it and it is not required to answer every single statement that is made to it either by somebody outside the agency, and I think that that is another danger in this decision."
1977.76-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,843.869,851.362,"Well, has the agency has done anything, since the Court of Appeals opinion to effect the adequacy of this record?"
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,851.362,858.154,What the agency has done is hold a Interim rule proceeding which really consisted of a further literature search.
1977.76-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,889.829,906.186,"Well, we agreed with you on the procedures but then there is the question of the adequacy of the record and there is a further proceeding going on now in the Court of Appeals with respect to the validity of interim rule."
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,906.186,914.642,A petition for review has been filed and at the request of the petitioners in that case is being held in advance until this court acts.
1977.76-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,914.642,924.851,Why should we address ourselves to a situation that no longer exists?
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,930.947,935.769,"As far as Vermont Yankee is concerned of course Mr. Justice White, it is precisely this record."
1977.76-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.769,940.74,"Well, you say that because you say the rule has no impact on your case."
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,940.74,941.938,That is my belief.
1977.76-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.341,964.419,Let's suppose it that tomorrow the Court of Appeals upheld the interim rule.
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,964.419,967.719,The Court of Appeals will not speak on the interim rule until this court speaks --
1977.76-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,967.719,972.403,"I understand that, I suppose it did and it upheld the interim rule."
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,972.403,979.603,"That would solve the problem, but I must say I consider that highly unlikely, because the interim rule is on the same procedures as the rule that –"
1977.76-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,979.603,997.196,"All right, but let's assume that the procedural matters were-- suppose that Court of Appeals were told that their procedural approach to the case was wrong."
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,997.196,1000.247,Then that would be this court's--
1977.76-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.247,1008.517,Do you suggest necessarily that Court of Appeals would find the record and the case now before it inadequate?
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,1008.517,1015.591,"No, I think if this court instructed the Court of Appeals that its procedures were wrong, the result would be that they would uphold the interim rule."
1977.76-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.591,1016.531,That's what I thought.
1977.76-419,0,42615,thomas_g_dignan,,1016.531,1022.272,"But maybe I misunderstood you Mr. Justice, I thought you were assuming this court did not speak on the subject."
1977.76-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1025.223,1026.04,Very well.
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1029.215,1031.778,Mr. Chief Justice and May it Please the Court.
1977.76-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1120.141,1128.943,"Mr. Wallace, do you know without reference to record when Vermont Yankee's license was originally issued?"
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1128.943,1129.907,The operating license?
1977.76-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1129.907,1132.092,Yes.
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1132.092,1137.854,"I believe, it's 1972, is that correct?"
1977.76-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1147.9,1152.281,How can that affect Vermont Yankee's license that was issued in ‘72?
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1152.281,1154.009,"Well, as a matter of fact it did not."
1977.76-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1187.933,1198.519,"What would happen and if the court, we have not granted Certiorari and the Court of Appeals had been left standing, would that have had some effect on Vermont Yankee's 1972 license?"
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1198.519,1201.918,"Well, the Court of Appeals set aside the grant of the license."
1977.76-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.918,1202.752,On what ground?
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1202.752,1211.399,On the ground that it had been done without taking into account waste reprocessing and disposal.
1977.76-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.399,1219.547,"Is there a statutory limitations period on the time to appeal from the grant of license, such as those granted in ‘72?"
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1219.547,1260.315,"Well, I am sure there is, but no one to my knowledge contended that the setting aside of the license was untimely here, it was part of the Court of Appeals order, there is a portion of the opinion devoted to setting aside the license as well as a portion devoted to setting aside the rule and what the Court of Appeals held was that it was proper to proceed under a valid rule and to take account of this environmental factor which after all is a generic factor."
1977.76-419,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1420.398,1423.022,"Mr. Wallace, can I interrupt with a question?"
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1428.11,1430.121,We have not taken a position on that.
1977.76-419,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1430.121,1433.733,But don't you have to take a position in order to tell us what the reverse would affirm?
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1433.733,1445.72,"Well, as we really think from our standpoint it no longer matters, we don't see any reason why the Court need make that determination."
1977.76-419,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1458.347,1475.441,"Don't we have to decide the case though, don't we either have to affirm or reverse and if agree with you and with Vermont Yankee on the procedural question, don't we necessarily have either to decide it or dismiss the writ is improperly granted, one of the two, I mean, we have to act, we can't just it's an academic problem."
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1475.441,1514.984,"That is correct, but for purposes of Vermont Yankee's application, we've already applied the interim rule and are intending complete our rule-making proceedings and to apply the permanent rule to Vermont Yankee, so that, that aspect of the case is no longer of concern to the commission's procedures and I think the commission would have the authority to proceed that way regardless of whether this court were to disagree with the Court of Appeals about the adequacy of the record."
1977.76-419,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1514.984,1522.241,"Except that if we reverse the Court of Appeals, you won't need any further proceedings in the Vermont Yankee case, because 40 year license will be in effect."
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1522.241,1525.197,"We wont need them, but we are going to proceed with them."
1977.76-419,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1525.197,1533.035,"Well, but how could you proceed with them with respect to Vermont Yankee, they have got their license, won't they just stay home and not come to your hearings?"
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1533.035,1547.233,The commission does have the authority to apply the interim rule existing licenses when issues have been raised about the fuel cycle effects on the environment with respect to them.
1977.76-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1547.233,1549.404,Where does that authority come from?
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1549.404,1556.289,"Well, that I would have to refer to the statutory authority."
1977.76-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1556.289,1571.504,"So supposing you have a license, say a 40 year license, version 1965 and no ground of authority to the commission in terms to reopen for this reason, do you say the commission can just reopen and reconsider the license, without any mandate --"
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1571.504,1575.174,"Well, it has not attempted to do so, it has not attempted to do so."
1977.76-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1575.174,1576.865,But you just said it could.
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1577.201,1582.417,It has the authority with respect to this one because it's still being contested.
1977.76-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1582.417,1591.123,"Well, but it's 72 license and the time for contesting may well have expired before any proceedings were brought."
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1591.123,1631.465,"Well, should that issue be raised, the commission would have to address it, we just have not, we have not, we are planning to go ahead with the rule-making proceeding that's now underway and as I say, the interim rule is based on a much more substantial evidentiary survey devoted entirely to waste management, and disposal and reprocessing issues, than was the basis of the rule, that the Court of Appeals set aside and which is no longer in effect as far as the commission is concerned."
1977.76-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1631.465,1634.893,What's the date of that flash document?
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1634.893,1639.55,Of the commission's interim rule?
1977.76-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1644.423,1649.128,Which state and the sequence.
1977.76-419,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1649.128,1656.541,"Well, 77, I am told, it's relatively recent and it's to be in effect for 18 months."
1977.76-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1915.014,1926.362,Very well Mr. Wallace.
1977.76-419,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,1927.262,1929.48,Mr. Chief Justice and May it Please the Court.
1977.76-419,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2219.75,2233.911,"Mr. Horsky, somewhere along the line of these procedures wasn't the point made that one of the customers, Dow Chemical would no longer need the power to be supplied by this?"
1977.76-419,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,2233.911,2249.192,"There is-- well, at one point during the course of the proceedings, a motion was made to reopen the hearing on the ground that the contract arrangements between Dow and consumers had been modified."
1977.76-419,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2263.842,2269.819,"And chronologically when was that done, by the same time it considered these 17 --"
1977.76-419,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,2269.819,2276.054,"All I can say is that since that time, there have been no substantial changes in the Dow consumer relationship."
1977.76-419,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2677.778,2679.863,This is an adjudicatory hearing.
1977.76-419,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,2679.863,2699.093,"This is an adjudicatory, oh yes, full adjudicatory hearing, full discovery, full cross-examination and very lengthy and the decision by the Appeal Board is in turn subject to review by the commission itself as was the case in this on the NEPA issue."
1977.76-419,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2796.887,2799.29,Very well Mr. Horsky.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2804.246,2810.398,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it Please the Court."
1977.76-419,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.882,2908.605,"Speaking of foreseeing long-run consequences Mr. Ayres it's your brief I belief that bears the clerk stamp of November 26, the supplemental statement of facts?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2908.605,2911.052,"Yes, it's the supplemental statement of facts."
1977.76-419,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.052,2914.342,Is there any reason why that came in so late?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2914.342,2927.682,"Well, there was a great deal of thought given to whether that issue should be raised and I am afraid I accept some blame for having not provided that material to the court earlier."
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2939.553,2951.007,"Just before you leave that supplemental statement of facts, you state that the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station has now been granted a full term operating license."
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2955.222,2966.817,"Well, I think if you look at the opinion by the commission in this case, you'll see that their position is first that the Vermont Yankee should have a license under the interim rule."
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2966.817,2968.392,"Right, which has been 18 months from --"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2968.392,2987.546,"Yes and second that had this case come before them in 1971, they would have come to the same conclusion because essentially, the fact the plant was built and operating, essentially because of the cost involved."
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2987.546,2991.805,Well they did come to the same conclusion for a 40 year license pack in 1973.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,2991.805,2995.26,But they did that in the absence of any consideration of waste issues at all.
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3028.849,3040.1,"Well that's all the Vermont Yankee wanted and they have got it, if they do have a 40 year license, but the fact is they have a license under the Interim rule which is an 18 months rule."
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3040.1,3079.975,"Well there maybe some room for interpretation there and we of course did not make any statement or position when we brought this to the court's attention, but we think it's clear if one looks at the reasoning there and also at the rule that's being proposed as a final rule, which is essentially the same as the interim rule and which again is essentially the same as the rules that was under review in this case, that Vermont Yankee's license is free and clear and frankly from the position of those parties, who challenged it in the beginning, my clients, we have no quarrel with that."
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3100.728,3104.447,Proceedings of the rule making and not the licensing.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3104.447,3104.998,Right.
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3114.985,3118.834,Why do you bring it up now?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3118.834,3121.576,Why do we bring up Vermont Yankee?
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3121.576,3130.174,"No, the fact that they already had this addition interim license, you say it doesn't mean anything."
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3130.174,3132.626,"No it does mean something, we think it means that there are --"
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3132.626,3136.24,It means that he lost the 40 and got a 18 month.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3136.24,3142.846,But they are I think assured on the basis that reasoning of holding that license also.
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3142.846,3146.784,You mean that 18 month is as good as 40.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3146.784,3150.963,"Given the reasoning in this opinion and given the direction the commission is going, yes it is."
1977.76-419,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3150.963,3151.146,You mean there is --
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3151.146,3153.839,"Well, how in the world can you say that?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3157.916,3171.814,"They brought -- you have to recall, this proceeding has been going on now for six years, it arose when Vermont Yankee sought an operating license and the parties who are now the respondents before you --"
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3171.814,3173.114,1969.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3173.114,3190.135,"1970, well, 69 perhaps when they started -- the parties went before the commission to ask that the commission address the environmental effects of the waste disposal and reprocessing of the waste from this plant."
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3235.137,3241.978,And now you go back to the licensing that's the 72 bond right or 69 bond?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3241.978,3246.557,The Court of Appeals had before it whether Vermont Yankee's license was properly granted.
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3246.557,3255.382,"I am asking the result of the Court of Appeals decision in this case, you go back to the licensing point, if I am correct?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3255.382,3257.24,"Well, let me clarify slightly."
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3269.384,3273.289,"Well if it took nine years before, why would it take that long now?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3273.289,3274.546,"Well, it didn't take nine years."
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3274.546,3277.84,How long did it took from ‘72 to '71?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3277.84,3285.762,The Commission undertook the rule making involved in this in this case in 1972.
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3285.762,3288.308,But the case was started in ‘69.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3288.308,3295.15,No the case that involved -- the case involves Vermont Yankee was started in 1971.
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3295.15,3295.654,In '71?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3295.654,3297.14,71.
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3297.865,3299.931,Now it's 77.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3299.931,3308.659,"That case has taken this long only because the commission has gone through a separate rule making proceeding, has complicated the issues."
1977.76-419,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3308.659,3310.133,"Well, couldn't they do it again?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3310.133,3320.167,"Well, but the -- the Vermont Yankee license has been remanded handing the commissions take a serious look at the waste disposal issues."
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3320.167,3329.655,"Your position then is that your client did appeal from the actual granting of the license in '72, within the 60 day period."
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3329.655,3355.482,"There is no question about that, there is no issue about that at all, but because of the commission's reversal of position, it's decision that waste disposal issues were valid issues to be considered and its subsequent proceedings, two separate cases came before the Court of Appeals on essentially the same general issues, and the one which you have accepted cert on is the one that involves Vermont Yankee's license."
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3383.63,3391.305,If we uphold the rulemaking proceeding does it necessarily follow that Vermont Yankee's license is also valid?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3391.305,3392.592,No it does not.
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3392.592,3393.779,Why not?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3393.779,3406.17,"Well, Vermont Yankee's license was held invalid because the commission gave no consideration whatever to the environmental impact of the waste that would be produced at that plant."
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3450.141,3462.389,"The Court of Appeal set it back and the commission did consider inaptly or not properly in your view though, well, waste production in a rulemaking proceeding."
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3462.389,3470.626,"No, they were separate and unrelated until they came before the court at the same time."
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3536.355,3544.698,But wasn't the commission's determination in the rulemaking proceeding that Vermont Yankee's license should be continued to be valid?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3544.698,3549.497,"No, the rulemaking proceedings was conducted completely separately from the Vermont Yankee proceeding."
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3549.497,3554.796,"Well, what's the commission's present position as you understand on the validity of Vermont Yankee's license?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3554.796,3576.654,"That I think the commission's present position is stated in the opinion which I provided to you last week which grants Vermont Yankee its license based on this interim rule, but clearly indicates also that the commission's view is that Vermont Yankee is grandfather and as I said my client is not concerned that that should occur."
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3576.654,3587.832,And you say if it hadn't been for the subsequent presumed Vermont Yankee wouldn't have any license at all even though we were to reverse the Court of Appeals?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3587.832,3588.249,I am sorry!
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3588.924,3598.209,"You say, if they weren't for this subsequent proceeding in July of this year, that Vermont Yankee wouldn't have any license?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3598.209,3610.467,"That's right, the Court of Appeals decision is that Vermont Yankee license must be remanded pending an adequate investigation and then lying out on the public record of the waste issues."
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3610.467,3617.578,"Yes but if we reverse the Court of Appeals, Vermont Yankee would have the license that it was given in 1973 –"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3617.578,3618.584,"Let's be clear, there are two –"
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3618.584,3619.101,-- for years.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3619.101,3620.14,-- there are two decisions.
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3624.88,3628.434,And Vermont Yankee has its license that it was given years ago.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3628.434,3636.39,Yes that decision could be made and -- essentially on grandfather grounds.
1977.76-419,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3636.39,3644.809,It could be made on a verity of different -- in any event if the Court of Appeals was reversed in the Vermont Yankee case then Vermont Yankee has the license that was originally accorded.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3644.809,3645.29,That's correct.
1977.76-419,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3648.646,3650.898,You have no objection to that.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3650.898,3653.691,We have no objection to Vermont Yankee is having a license.
1977.76-419,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3653.691,3659.416,I mean you have no objection of our reversal and reinstating the Vermont Yankee license?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3659.416,3664.749,No we have great deal of objection to your reversal.[Attempt to Laughter]
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3714.482,3721.646,These issues are the -- what the environmental effect of the so called backend part of the nuclear cycle?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3721.646,3739.128,"There are two basic issues; one is that it had been assumed that – that the fuel, the spent fuel from nuclear reactors would be reprocessed and plutonium would be extracted from that fuel to be used in turn as fuel for future reactors."
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3817.574,3823.92,And Commission what's happening so far is that a so called temporary storage of a 100 years.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3823.92,3827.468,"Well no such temporary storage is occurring either, Your Honor."
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3861.205,3869.448,Because the issue is -- that's all a matter of under the law of separate and subsequent licensing?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3869.448,3877.459,"Well the Commission's view is that they can look because this issue occurs in every plant, they will look at the issue once generically."
1977.76-419,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3877.459,3882.659,"Make a rule and produce which -- which incorporates a curve, right?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3882.659,3887.283,"-- which incorporates a table of figures essentially, yes."
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3905.87,3920.227,"Do you say that NAPA, preparation of NAPA statement requires an adjudicatory hearing or that say or that the licensing issue requires an adjudicatory hearing?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3920.227,3922.133,The Commission prepares an –
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3922.133,3925.015,"I was curious on what you said, what your position --"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3925.015,3933.071,Well that I'll say that -- The Commission ordinarily prepares an environmental impact statement for each plant.
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3951.83,3954.413,You think that's required by statue?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3954.413,3963.326,No what I am saying is that the Commission is -- in conveying generic rule making proceeding they have restricted those rights.
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3972.746,3983.693,You think you need anything as open to the public as rule making for the preparation of a NAPA statement if you're not us doing a separate adjudication?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3983.693,3983.886,Yeah.
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3990.301,3992.366,What's your authority for that in this Court?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,3992.366,3996.366,"Well, I think if one looks at the pages of the record --"
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3996.366,4007.225,"I mean what your authority, decisional authority from this Court that preparation of any NAPA statement must confirm at least with a rule making standards of the APA?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4007.225,4010.41,Your Honor that's not the proposition that I would support.
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4041.876,4044.279,Which case from this Court your relying on?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4044.279,4052.817,"Well, I think it's been stated in the Kleppe case as well as the other NAPA cases that have come before the Court."
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4052.817,4055.272,Any particular ones by name?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4055.272,4063.02,I think that the Kleppe case is sufficient.
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4099.823,4104.902,But the APA says there are two different ways you can go about conducting hearings.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4119.501,4125.792,I think I have a different view on what's -- what the NEPA statement's position is than that suggests.
1977.76-419,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4138.8,4139.769,What --
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4139.769,4142.258,What your authority for that?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4142.258,4144.776,I think that's in the case law of NEPA.
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4144.776,4147.426,Well for the – for the case law from this Court?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4147.426,4149.578,This Court and the lower courts.
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4149.578,4151.497,"What from this Court, Kleppe?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4151.497,4154.448,I think so yes.
1977.76-419,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4259.109,4266.586,You feel the Court of Appeals more adequately divined the state of world opinion than the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4266.586,4282.294,No I think the Court of Appeals did divine that the Commission had failed to address the kind of major concerns which the petitioners – I am sorry the respondents and others raised to them in the rule making and the Commission essentially failed to address them.
1977.76-419,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4306.487,4326.762,Somewhere in here and I don't know whether it's in your brief Mr. Ayres or in the Court of Appeals' opinion there is a suggestion that there had to be an exhaustive study of all other alternative methods.
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4331.417,4334.455,I don't know whether it's –
1977.76-419,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4334.455,4335.28,You mean –
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4335.28,4336.182,I am not sure whether –
1977.76-419,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4336.182,4337.321,Do you make an argument?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4337.321,4355.465,"Well I think yes, the notion certainly is that the alternative means of dealing with the problem need to be explored and they are, clearly many of them are as the Commission admits are not yet seen in full because they are still hypothetical."
1977.76-419,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4389.149,4396.389,Do you say that the act specifically requires that the Commission do what you are suggesting?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4396.389,4405.583,We think -- yes the act does ask specifically that alternatives be explored and also that the –
1977.76-419,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4405.583,4408.644,Explored to what extent?
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4408.644,4414.312,To evaluate – well there is case law on the question of to what extent –
1977.76-419,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4414.312,4421.056,"You are not suggesting that there was no consideration given to alternative methods at all, are you?"
1977.76-419,3,38553,richard_e_ayres,,4421.056,4422.081,"Yes, I am."
1977.76-419,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4457.725,4463.647,Very well.
1977.76-419,4,35621,myron_m_cherry,,4465.454,4468.182,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1977.76-419,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4531.309,4538.826,"When you are talking about us, you are talking about the non federal respondents in 76-528?"
1977.76-419,4,35621,myron_m_cherry,,4538.826,4539.336,That is correct.
1977.76-419,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4539.336,4541.201,And who are they?
1977.76-419,4,35621,myron_m_cherry,,4541.201,4548.423,That involves two cases Mr. Justice.
1977.76-419,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4585.374,4592.011,"Nelson Isham is a person, a businessman or is somebody who lives in the area."
1977.76-419,4,35621,myron_m_cherry,,4592.011,4606.253,"Yes Mr. Justice Brennan he is, Mr. Justice Stewart, pardon me he is a man who lives in the area and who I believe owns a motel –"
1977.76-419,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4606.253,4610.247,And the others are various environmental groups --
1977.76-419,4,35621,myron_m_cherry,,4610.247,4634.807,"Well the citizen groups Mr. Justice involved not only people who live in the community and are very concerned about development of that particular community who, many of them work for Dow Chemical, but they also comprise local representatives of national organizations along with the Sierra Club."
1977.76-419,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4815.677,4818.392,How much of that is ((Inaudible)
1977.76-419,4,35621,myron_m_cherry,,4818.392,4819.746,How much of what Mr. Justice Marshall?
1977.76-419,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4819.746,4822.236,Of what's going on in right now?
1977.76-419,4,35621,myron_m_cherry,,4822.236,4823.051,"Well, we have --"
1977.76-419,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4823.051,4825.467,How much of that is before --
1977.76-419,4,35621,myron_m_cherry,,4825.467,4832.892,"Well, it is not before you Mr. Justice Marshall in the sense that you are being asked to look at that record."
