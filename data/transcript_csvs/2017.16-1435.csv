2017.16-1435,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.08,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 16-1435, Minnesota Voters Alliance versus Mansky. Mr. Breemer."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,7.08,21.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Minnesota's statute bans all conventional political expression on apparel to prevent a smaller class of material that can already be regulated under other election statutes."
2017.16-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,41.84,42.6,Which -- which are those -- which are the --
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,42.6,55.96,"I was just going to ask you -- I was just going to ask you, those examples you gave, in your view, could be prohibited by a properly drawn statute? Moveon.org and so forth you say could be prohibited under a properly drawn statute?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,55.96,57.52,They can -- they are prohibited.
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,58.52,64.72,Could they be prohibited under a statute that was more narrowly drawn?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,64.72,65.88,"No, I do not think they could."
2017.16-1435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,75.44,75.88,Do you think more --
2017.16-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,75.88,89.04,"Could you clarify the procedural posture of this case? I gather the first time around you went to the Eighth Circuit and they rejected the facial challenge, but they sent it back on as-applied."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,101.88,103.92,"It's solely a facial challenge, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,122.48,139.68,"Do you -- do you think, Mr. Breemer, that a statute could target only electoral speech, in other words, ""Clinton for President,"" ""Trump for President,"" that sort of thing? Could a statute say that that speech cannot be worn in the polling place?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,139.68,142.68,"Yes, a statute does say that."
2017.16-1435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,144.76,145.36,"No, I know."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,154.52,160.6,"Yes, Your Honor, it's a very close call, but it's not one that this Court has to make in this particular case."
2017.16-1435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,160.6,163.52,"I know, but I'm just asking your view."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,163.52,173.36,"I honestly don't know, Your Honor, whether that -- that line is so close, but the statute here, the first sentence, already prohibits that material, and it's unchallenged, that particular sentence here."
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,192.28,195.56,"Well, but it -- but it's important for us if -- we're going to have to write an opinion on this."
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,198.36,200.8,What about political buttons?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,200.8,201.12,Anything that --
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.12,204.4,"""Vote -- Vote for X"" or ""Vote for Y"" and they're both on the ballot."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,204.4,206.28,Correct.
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,210.28,212.84,We're asking about a hypothetical case.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,218.88,222.24,"No, I don't think it would be."
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,223.88,224.36,All right.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,224.36,232.72,"Because of the passive and non-disruptive nature of the speech, people simply wearing that type of clothing as they go in and out of the polling place --"
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,232.72,236.08,So you're -- you're telling us to overrule Burson?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,236.08,237.68,"No, Your Honor, I'm not saying that at all."
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,237.68,242.64,Burson basically said the opposite of what you're saying.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,242.64,243.04,"Well, it's --"
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,243.04,244.4,Directly and completely.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,244.4,252.16,"Well, as we read Burson, it didn't deal with the passive wearing of a -- any kind of apparel, campaign or more general political apparel."
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,256.08,264.76,"That's the line you're drawing? Because someone puts something on instead of handing it around, that's the line you want us to draw?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,264.76,266.12,"Well, that's part of the line."
2017.16-1435,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,274.2,275.0,Mr. -- Mr. Breemer --
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,275.0,275.76,Yes.
2017.16-1435,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,275.76,294.44,"-- passive versus active sounds a lot like the act/omission distinction, and that has proven to be one of the most slippery concepts in all of law. Is it an act to put on a button or is it an omission to not speak about what's on the button? A T-shirt, you say, is passive."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,307.0,310.6,"Well, what I'm suggesting, Your Honor, is that the line is already policed."
2017.16-1435,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,326.68,334.56,"They -- they talk about other interests, like decorum and dignity, and those aren't addressed by the other statutes."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,334.56,345.84,"No, they're not -- well, they are addressed by Section 2 -- 204C.06, Your Honor, which prohibits disorderly conduct and interference --"
2017.16-1435,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,345.84,351.76,"Well, there's a difference between interference with someone's right to vote or disorderly conduct and -- and decorum."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,356.92,359.12,"Yes, it probably would, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,377.24,424.2,"Well, you -- you say that, but I wonder if the state can make an opposite determination and say, you know, for however many months we've had this, you know, maybe bitter, sharp, political campaign going on, and maybe, just before you cast your vote, you should be able to have a time for some quiet reflection or to do that important civic obligation in peace and quiet without being bombarded by another campaign display. And it -- you know, you say these are -- it's passive but not active, but, you know, a picture can be worth a thousand words, and people's apparel can convey very strong and shocking images that maybe the state can decide that, just before you cast your vote, you should have at least a moment free of all the Sturm und Drang of the campaign."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,424.2,428.8,That -- that's true. And there are legitimate interests in the polling place.
2017.16-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.0,440.24,"But you've answered -- you've answered that it's already covered, but it's no good."
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,440.24,441.56,You've said it's no good.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,441.56,442.84,"Excuse me, I'm sorry."
2017.16-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,443.04,448.96,"You said the coverage was no good, that you could not cover."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,448.96,450.48,"If I'm -- yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,459.76,461.44,"Well, you're pressured to come --"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,461.44,462.76,But the statute here goes far beyond that.
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,462.76,467.08,-- you're pressured to come up with a workable rule to guide us when we write this decision.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,467.08,467.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,467.72,483.24,"And you're -- you're telling, in response to the Chief Justice, basically, that the state's interest in -- in -- in decorum and solemnity and the dignity of the voting process cannot be protected by rules relating to buttons and apparel."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,483.24,492.6,"I'm saying, Your Honor, that it -- it's not reasonably protected in this instance because it sweeps in so much material that's not reasonably related to those interests -- interests."
2017.16-1435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,492.6,526.16,"Well, suppose we think that it would be a different case and that a state could have a law that prohibits the wearing of buttons or any other -- or attire that contains the name of a candidate or refers to a ballot issue or the name of a political party that has candidates running for office in that election. If we thought that that would be consistent with the First Amendment, would that doom your case or would you still have additional arguments?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,526.16,533.64,"No, that -- Your Honor, that is one place where you can draw the line. And if the line is drawn there, this statute still fails."
2017.16-1435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,536.96,540.12,"And -- and what would be the justification for that line, in your view?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,540.12,541.44,"Well, the justification for --"
2017.16-1435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,541.44,555.04,"In other words, why would we put one -- all the materials that Justice Alito talked about on one side of the line and all the materials that you think a state cannot restrict on the other side of the line? In your view, what's the difference?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,555.04,572.32,"I think that you could arguably conclude that that type of apparel is reasonably related to the government's legitimate interest in preventing undue influence in polling places, but shirts that simply say AFL-CIO, Chamber of Congress, NAACP, those are not related to the government's interests in --"
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,572.32,576.08,How about issues on the ballot?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,576.08,576.76,"Yes, Your Honor, I would -- that would be --"
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,576.76,577.48,All right.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,595.16,597.64,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe it could, because the connection is so --"
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,597.64,603.6,I think your adversary says they can because it's a political issue display.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,603.6,604.28,That's correct.
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,604.96,608.6,And that's where you say they can't?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,608.6,608.84,No.
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,609.2,612.36,Even though that's on the ballot?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,612.36,617.8,A fiscal issue? I think the connection would be too attenuated because then you could extrapolate forever.
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,617.8,618.32,To you.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,623.48,634.84,"I think a -- yes, I do think a reasonable observer would not see generalized political apparel as an influencing towards something on the ballot."
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,643.8,644.4,Can you --
2017.16-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,644.4,676.44,"But they have a statute that covered one thing that is in this case, it's not hypothetical, it doesn't have to do with an issue on the ballot, but the ""Please ID Me,"" the ""Please ID Me"" button, which was challenged and then you chose not to pursue that. But what is your position on that? Could a legitimately challenged statute stop you from having the ""Please ID Me"" button?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,676.44,677.04,"Yes, it could."
2017.16-1435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,726.28,741.44,"It -- it just is a little bit hard, Mr. Breemer, to evaluate an argument of overbreadth unless we have a clear view from you as to how far you think a state could go. So I'm not sure that you've given us that view."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,758.64,759.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,781.84,800.08,"Well, if -- if the Court is concerned about preserving the dignity and the decorum and the solemnity of the voting process, and the statute is as difficult as you say, isn't that an argument for allowing good faith determination on a case-by-case basis by the polling officials?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,800.08,804.84,"No, I wouldn't say that, Your Honor, because, in the meantime, free speech would be chilled."
2017.16-1435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,829.68,841.28,"If -- if that were where we drew the line, I mean, what -- what would be encompassed in advocacy material? Would it be only things that named a candidate's name?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,841.28,848.76,"Your Honor, I think it would be anything that said for or against a candidate or an issue directly on the ballot."
2017.16-1435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,848.76,850.92,"How about if it said ""Resist""?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,850.92,856.28,"I think that would be constitutionally permitted, and should be, and -- and generalized slogans --"
2017.16-1435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,856.28,859.04,"""Make America Great Again""?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,859.04,862.36,"That type of slogan, too, I think that should be constitutionally permissible."
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,876.88,887.72,"Why should there be speech inside the election booth at all, or inside the -- what you call the election room? Let's -- let's say that it's a small room."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,892.28,897.56,"Your Honor, because the First Amendment doesn't stop at the polling place door, even -- even if it's a non --"
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,897.56,899.32,That's one of the questions in the case.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,901.64,904.68,"""Jews for Jesus,"" Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,904.68,906.52,Was it an airport?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,906.52,907.28,It was an airport.
2017.16-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,911.76,930.48,"Justice Kennedy asked the question, could a state say that the polling place is off limits to any kind of advocacy or promotion of any point of view?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,930.48,935.28,"A state could say that, yes, Your Honor, and Minnesota has said that. I'm sorry if I misunderstood."
2017.16-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,976.8,987.96,So what -- what do you put in what the state can do in addition to vote for candidate X or vote against proposition Y?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,987.96,993.44,"As a bright-line rule, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't see any other feasible bright line."
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1004.04,1011.48,"You took the position that ""Me Too"" -- ""Please ID Me"" wasn't intimidating."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1011.48,1012.28,"No, Your Honor, I don't think I --"
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1012.28,1018.72,"Or that it was free speech that should not be stifled, correct? Are you changing your mind on that now?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1018.72,1019.04,No.
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1027.16,1029.32,So there's always line-drawing.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1058.16,1065.64,"I think the -- the -- the reason is that the First Amendment continues, as I mentioned before, continues to apply in polling places."
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1067.28,1068.0,It does.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1073.24,1073.56,Correct.
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1074.12,1075.6,So it's not all that's being --
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1075.6,1078.32,There -- there's an --
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1078.32,1092.32,"I mean, I suspect that on a military base we would say it would be okay for the Army to say on military grounds we're not going to permit political speech."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1092.32,1105.68,"Well, I'm not quite sure about that, Your Honor, because, in Greer, in the Greer decision, the Court said that conventional political speech would not be banned. This Court has never upheld a prohibition on political speech as broad as this."
2017.16-1435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1106.4,1112.52,Have we ever said that it would be permissible to ban all political speech on military ground?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1112.52,1113.2,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1139.2,1145.16,Because there was not a state interest that would permit it?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1145.16,1146.2,"Well, that's -- that's correct."
2017.16-1435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1146.96,1158.68,"It wasn't a state interest, but here there is a state interest that was recognized in Burson as being quite important and very legitimate?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1158.68,1161.52,"It's true, they are important interests, and -- and we don't deny that."
2017.16-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1166.4,1167.28,You're -- you're --
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1167.28,1194.56,"-- of political expression that doesn't have a reasonable connection to those particular interests, like simply wearing a shirt that identifies an organization that has political views or a hat or any other sort of apparel that simply identifies the wearer's personal beliefs. A lot of this material is not worn as advocacy or to influence but simply as self-expression on the day of election when people want to express their own political views when everyone is talking about them and -- and wear them in."
2017.16-1435,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1217.0,1252.72,"What about the -- the concern about coordination? You know, whatever the group is, you know, a big employer, the union, teachers, whatever, say we're all going to show up and we're all going to have, you know, these -- these buttons on or whatever, and maybe you're a member of the group and you don't agree with the position and you'll feel some pressure to transform your speech from what you really would like to say or you wouldn't like to say anything about it, yet you're going to be identified; because you don't have our button, you're not doing what you should be doing to support the group."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1252.72,1253.4,"Yes, Your Honor."

2017.16-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1283.52,1284.0,As-applied under what?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1284.0,1285.44,-- speech and conduct.
2017.16-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1285.44,1288.32,Under what? You have to have a statute to apply.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1288.32,1288.96,Yes.
2017.16-1435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1332.24,1336.08,How many other states have laws that go as far as Minnesota's?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1336.08,1341.36,"Your Honor, we believe -- nine is our estimate."
2017.16-1435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1350.52,1361.84,And what has been the experience of these other cases -- these other states? Have they had brawls in the -- in the polling place? Have they had disturbances in the polling place?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1361.84,1369.64,"No, Your Honor, there's no evidence of -- of disruption either in Minnesota or these other states caused by simply wearing --"
2017.16-1435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1369.64,1373.92,"Well, the states that don't have laws that go as far as Minnesota's, what -- what has been the record there?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1373.92,1376.88,"As far as I know, Your Honor -- it's not in this record."
2017.16-1435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1402.52,1412.36,And does the record show how many officials would be making these determinations at a general election in Minnesota and how they're selected?
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1412.36,1414.0,"The polling officials, Your Honor?"
2017.16-1435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1414.0,1415.36,"Yeah, the polling officials."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1415.36,1418.16,"They're selected from the parties, various parties."
2017.16-1435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1428.36,1429.84,So they're selected by the parties.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1443.08,1448.32,"What happens at that point, Your Honor, is, yes, that's -- that's a final decision in -- in this respect."
2017.16-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1453.96,1462.72,"But if the other -- the other election judge says I disagree, then what happens?"
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1462.72,1474.64,"Then I -- I think they would call the head judge, Your Honor, and there would be a decision -- head election judge and there would be a decision being made. And in the meantime, there would be a disruption going on in the polling place because apparel is being policed."
2017.16-1435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1474.64,1475.0,And who --
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1475.0,1475.68,"And, again --"
2017.16-1435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1475.68,1476.24,I'm sorry.
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1480.44,1483.2,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't know the answer to that question."
2017.16-1435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1484.2,1485.72,"Well, I'll ask -- I guess I'll ask the state."
2017.16-1435,0,62961,j_david_breemer,,1499.76,1500.96,I don't know.
2017.16-1435,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1537.4,1551.4,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rogan."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1551.4,1559.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Minnesota's restriction on speech in the polling place does not violate the First Amendment."
2017.16-1435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1595.28,1599.92,It does reach quite a bit beyond what I think a reasonable observer would think is necessary.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1608.68,1618.16,"Your Honor, the -- the -- the test that Minnesota has is what a reasonable observer would understand is advocating electoral choices."
2017.16-1435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1622.4,1623.24,"Well, you can see it."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1626.96,1647.52,"Certainly, yes, Your Honor, I do -- I do think that that causes the -- the problems and is constitutionally proscribable, and it's for the reasons that -- that you discussed, which is the intimidation that it -- that can occur is not just based on the plain meaning of what is -- what the apparel says, that it's somehow intimidating on its own."
2017.16-1435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1677.16,1678.96,"Well, I don't know if I discuss the issues."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1713.32,1757.64,"Certainly, Your Honor, and -- and I think -- I think Burson recognized that order and decorum can be called into question by simply wearing campaign material. All that Minnesota's law does is extend that line to political material. And it's for the exact same reasons. It's that when you have a campaign that's gone on for months, and we end up at the Election Day in the polling place where we've asked people to come forward to exercise their right to vote, that is a place where we want to ensure that there's order and decorum so that there is the solemnity that goes with voting. And having people identify themselves with a pin that is a campaign or a political message on it reasonably could lead to disruption."
2017.16-1435,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1758.6,1785.44,"How would -- how would -- well, how far does -- does this go? The -- the clear case is a pin that says ""Vote For Candidate X."" But we're told by the Petitioner that you can't wear a pin saying ""Me Too,"" you can't wear a pin saying ""ACLU Defends Free Speech""?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1785.44,1803.64,"Your Honor, the -- the line that we have drawn is campaign material plus political material, with the definition of political material being reasonably related -- a reasonable person would understand that the message that's being delivered is one regarding electoral choices in the polling place. And so --"
2017.16-1435,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1803.64,1809.12,"So where -- where does that limitation come in, electoral choices in the polling place?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1809.12,1825.32,"Your Honor, it comes from the definition of political, which is in an Election Day -- Election Day electioneering statute, and from the definition of political purpose, which is in the statute which describes -- that uses the word ""political"" to mean influencing voting in an election."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1825.32,1832.4,"The problem is that so many things have political connotations, and the connotations are in the eye of the beholder."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1902.12,1908.08,"So, Your Honor, the -- I think the -- the answer is that it has two components to it."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1931.52,1931.8,Yeah.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1940.32,1960.64,"Well, Your Honor, the political has a -- has a plain meaning in our statute based on that it -- it's influencing elections. What I -- all that I'm describing is that something that is political, for example, that is known to only a few people but is clearly political, is not going to be something that's going to be reasonably understood by voters in the polling place."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1960.64,1966.16,How about a shirt with a rainbow flag? Would that be permitted?
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1966.16,1978.4,"A shirt with a rainbow flag? No, it would -- yes, it would be -- it would be permitted unless there was -- unless there was an issue on the ballot that -- that related somehow to -- to gay rights."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1978.4,1985.12,"How about a shirt that says ""Parkland Strong""?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1985.12,1987.0,"No, that would -- that would be -- that would be allowed."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1988.2,1992.32,Even though gun control would very likely be an issue?
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1992.32,1993.44,To the extent --
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1993.44,1996.72,I bet some candidate would raise an issue about gun control.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,1996.72,2002.6,"Your Honor, the -- the -- the line that we're drawing is one that is -- is related to electoral choices in a --"
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2002.6,2005.72,"Well, what's the answer to this question? You're a polling official."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2009.44,2010.88,The -- the Parkland?
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2010.88,2011.32,Yeah.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2011.32,2019.44,"I -- I think -- I think today that I -- that would be -- if -- if that was in Minnesota, and it was ""Parkland Strong,"" I -- I would say that that would be allowed in, that there's not --"
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2019.44,2019.76,Okay.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2022.0,2024.88,"An NRA shirt? Today, in Minnesota, no, it would not, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2027.44,2032.52,How about a shirt with the text of the Second Amendment?
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2032.52,2036.16,"Your Honor, I -- I -- I think that that could be viewed as political, that that -- that would be -- that would be --"
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2036.16,2039.88,How about the First Amendment? (Laughter.)
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2039.88,2043.4,"No, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't think the First Amendment."
2017.16-1435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2043.88,2047.92,"No -- no -- no what, that it would be covered or wouldn't be allowed?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2047.92,2048.6,It would be allowed.
2017.16-1435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2048.6,2049.12,It would be?
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2049.12,2049.52,It would be.
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2055.84,2057.72,"Yeah, well, this is the problem."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2060.24,2066.08,"No, Your Honor, I don't think that that would be under -- under our statute."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2066.72,2068.32,"How about ""All Lives Matter""?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2068.32,2076.16,"That could be, Your Honor -- that could be -- that could be perceived as political."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2084.96,2088.64,"How about an ""I Miss Bill"" shirt? (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2088.64,2089.92,"I'm sorry, Your Honor? I didn't --"
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2089.92,2095.76,"An ""I Miss Bill,"" or to make it bipartisan, a ""Reagan/Bush '84"" shirt?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2095.76,2097.36,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that that's political."
2017.16-1435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.36,2163.28,"You can do this too, I guess, with the -- can't you, with the need in state-run hospitals to restrict conversation in certain areas to medical matters, the need in law schools or other schools to restrict conversation in the class to the subject that is being taught, including politics, the need in -- I don't know, you make it up, but I -- because that's what we're doing, that's what I'm doing, and I can think of many, many instances where thousands, perhaps millions, of people have to have the authority to operate a standard to restrict the speech to the subject that's at hand. And so, if, in fact, we are trying to have a place where a person has reflective thought for a moment after the hurly-burly of the campaign, this problem will inevitably arise. One way of correcting mistakes is through as-applied challenges after the event. So my question is, how does that work?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2163.28,2165.56,"How does an as-applied challenge work, Your Honor?"
2017.16-1435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.56,2171.92,Suppose in the examples that you've heard there were mistakes made.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2197.48,2206.56,The -- the -- what -- what occurs if there is speech that is pro -- proscribable is the election judge will ask the person to cover it up.
2017.16-1435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2241.88,2279.16,"How -- but the -- I guess the issue is, how do you know if a mistake has been made? You know, if someone makes a judgment and it's challenged, how do you know a mistake's been made? I mean, there's -- the question -- the concern, of course, it's what the case could be largely about, is whether or not there are standards that can be applied in a reasonable way. And it's not a question really of review in an as-applied or other challenge to see if there's been a mistake, unless the courts are going to be in the position of deciding all of those -- those questions."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2279.16,2284.36,"Your Honor, I think the history of Minnesota's statute shows that we have a workable definition."
2017.16-1435,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2301.48,2315.6,"Do you know how often, Mr. Rogan, people are asked to cover things up? I mean, do people know about this statute and act accordingly, or do you often find, is it, you know, every other voter is wearing something? What -- what -- or something in between?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2315.6,2322.8,"It -- it -- it is -- it is for the most part complied with, that Minnesotans understand that they're not allowed to wear political or campaign material at the polling places."
2017.16-1435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.8,2327.92,So let's continue on this because I -- I'm finding it useful.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2367.72,2374.12,There -- there isn't any -- any statute in Minnesota that allows somebody to change an official record of what happened.
2017.16-1435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2377.6,2383.32,"They bring an APA action or, you know -- saying that this was unreasonable and improper listed."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2383.32,2384.56,"Certainly, Your Honor. Certainly."
2017.16-1435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2384.56,2386.96,"So they could get a judge to do it, you think?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2386.96,2387.16,Yes.
2017.16-1435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2387.16,2390.76,But it's never happened because it's never been a problem.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2391.52,2392.52,"Yes, that's -- that's the answer."
2017.16-1435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2392.52,2392.76,Okay.
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2392.76,2400.32,"I mean, people go to vote after work, before work, in the middle of doing chores for the day, taking kids to school."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2438.2,2438.48,Your Honor --
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2438.48,2440.4,"That's the situation, right?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2440.4,2461.04,"Your Honor, the -- if -- if the individual wore in a campaign shirt or a political shirt, they would be asked to cover it up or, if it was a button, to remove it. And there is no evidence in Minnesota, and certainly in the record, and no evidence at all that we -- that there -- that this has been a problem, that we've had people show up and say, I don't have any other way to -- to move forward except to -- to --"
2017.16-1435,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2461.04,2469.04,"Is there -- is there any evidence -- usually, in First Amendment cases, we're concerned about overbreadth because of the chilling effect that's often undocumented."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2498.8,2506.4,"Your Honor, I think the premise of your question is -- is -- is Minnesota's use of the word ""political."" And there are 11 states that use the word ""political."""
2017.16-1435,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2506.4,2507.08,"Okay, 11."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2530.44,2538.88,"Your Honor, the -- the -- the forum analysis would indicate that the burden on the state is only to show reasonableness and that -- that our statute must --"
2017.16-1435,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2538.88,2544.0,What evidence do we have? What record is there? What facts can you point to?
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2544.0,2554.04,"Your Honor, it's the history of elections that was sufficient in Burson to show that wearing campaign material would have a detrimental effect on the polling place."
2017.16-1435,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2554.04,2566.12,"Again, Burson was electioneering, a different statute, and you're asking us to go a step further than Burson. And I'm just wondering what -- what do you have? And if the answer is nothing further than Burson, that's fine; that's an answer."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2566.12,2571.96,"Your Honor, the -- the -- the evidence that we have is the same as what was in Burson."
2017.16-1435,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2594.04,2598.96,"Political speech beyond solicitation for candidates or things on the ballot, right?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2598.96,2599.2,Yes --
2017.16-1435,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2599.2,2599.48,Okay.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2599.48,2604.16,-- beyond expressed advocacy that is -- that would be defined as -- as campaign speech.
2017.16-1435,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2676.48,2703.92,"Mr. Rogan, could you explain that for me a little bit more? Because, I mean, there are clearly some places where we think -- you know, the courtroom is a good example, where we don't want anybody to be wearing buttons or wearing shirts of -- of the kind that you're talking about. But why should a polling place be that sort of place? In other words, you talk about the decorum, the solemnity."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2713.84,2715.56,"So for two reasons, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2791.56,2791.72,You --
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2791.72,2792.4,-- who now wonders --
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2792.4,2805.16,You exacerbate that problem by opening up the possibility of similarly partisan or seemingly partisan applications of your very broad statute.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2805.16,2811.56,"Your Honor, there is no evidence of any viewpoint discrimination in Minnesota in its 100 years."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2841.12,2841.48,All right.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2859.2,2860.32,They --
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2860.32,2866.92,A Democrat -- a Democratic judge intervenes and then you have a -- you have an argument between these two judges?
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2866.92,2876.4,"Your Honor, what -- what would happen in that instance is -- is either the person would -- would cover it up or there -- or there could be a discussion to say I don't -- this isn't political and I want to talk to the head election judge."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2878.08,2879.76,And who's the head election judge?
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2879.76,2899.6,"The head election judge is a judge who's selected by the city clerk because they are -- they -- they have more training and -- and usually they've been an election judge for -- for a long period of time so that they're familiar with all the processes. And I think, you know, one of the things that -- that -- that I think is important to understand is election judges have discretion to make a lot of different decisions in polling places."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2968.92,2998.28,"Let me ask you about one of the interests that you assert in your brief, and this is on page 46 of your brief. ""A voter could well feel confused or intimidated if she walked into a polling place and discovered that every other voter held the opposite point of view on any number of controversial political issues related to electoral choices, as evidenced by the political messages displayed on other voters' apparel."" Do you think that's a compelling state interest? Do you think that's even a legitimate state interest?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,2998.28,3047.32,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it's -- I think it's a legitimate state interest in a polling place to prohibit material that is going to make one voter feel singled out, that -- that they could feel that they are not welcome in that polling place because they don't hold the same political views as everybody else. And, ultimately, it could lead to the type of subtle intimidation that Burson found could be -- could be found just by wearing a vote for, pick your candidate. The -- the -- the interests of making sure that the polling place doesn't have political material is the exact same interest that this Court found was sufficient to prohibit campaign material. And I think to -- to go back to the -- the question of line-drawing, line-drawing happens every single time when there's a content-based restriction."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3062.8,3071.04,Now how would an as-applied challenge work on -- on Election Day? You're not going to have an as-applied challenge when somebody goes to vote.
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3071.04,3103.8,"Your Honor, the -- the -- the as-applied challenge could happen the way it happened in this case, where somebody brings a lawsuit, but -- but in -- in the -- in the case where somebody wears material, they either -- they -- they can continue to wear it, as -- as the Petitioners did here, and then go into an -- an administrative process and say it's not political, I -- I have a right to wear this. So there's -- there's an easy way for somebody who believes that the material that they're wearing is not political to have an administrative review of that if they believe that the -- that the election judges are acting inappropriately."
2017.16-1435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3103.8,3124.08,"That -- that suggests to me that your interests might not be terribly strong if someone's about to break the law and you say, okay, go ahead, but, you know, we're going to write your name down and, you know, you might -- in other words, your interests -- you've emphasized several times the lack of, you know, nothing terribly bad happens to you when you do this."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3127.92,3128.76,Your Honor --
2017.16-1435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3128.76,3138.6,"Aren't you worried -- if you're not worried about intimidation, why do you let somebody go in with a button that violates your -- your policy, or why is the only thing you do is write his name down?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3138.6,3145.28,"Your Honor, the -- the enforcement of this statute is done primarily by election judges telling people to cover up the material."
2017.16-1435,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3150.84,3154.52,Are those election officials inside the room?
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3154.52,3154.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3154.92,3158.92,"In other words, there's the voting booth and the table where you give your registration."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3164.44,3168.84,"No, Your Honor, it happens -- it happens right in the same room."
2017.16-1435,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3168.84,3172.28,"Well, it seems to me that's more disruptive than wearing the shirt."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3172.28,3176.44,"Your Honor, Minnesota hasn't found it to be disruptive, that it's -- that it's a quick conversation, and it --"
2017.16-1435,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3176.44,3180.52,"Well, we're -- we're -- we're trying to understand how this thing works."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3180.52,3181.6,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3181.6,3186.76,"And we just said that -- you say a quick conversation, then the other judge comes over, then the intervening judge."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3192.92,3199.0,"Your Honor, if -- if there was -- if there was such a discussion as that, what would happen is it would -- they would take it to a different -- a different area to talk about that."
2017.16-1435,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3199.0,3207.92,"Mr. Rogan, I assume that the real work of this statute is being done by the fact that people know about it and so people just don't wear these things for the most part."
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3223.08,3223.88,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3263.12,3277.44,"Suppose a group of people want to make a statement about a political issue, not a political candidate but a political issue, and they say we're going to do that by wearing all white on Election Day when we go to the polls. Would that be allowed?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3277.44,3281.2,"Under the statute, yes. It's not a political badge, button, or insignia."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3282.64,3286.24,That doesn't express a view on a political issue?
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3286.24,3292.28,"It -- under -- it -- it might -- it might express a view on a political issue, but it's not a political badge, button, or insignia."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3310.36,3315.96,"So, if a shirt has ""#metoo"" that would be allowed or not allowed?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3315.96,3318.08,"Your Honor, that would be -- that -- that would be an insignia."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3323.88,3324.92,So if people want --
2017.16-1435,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3324.92,3327.2,How do we determine if it's an issue?
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3327.2,3328.0,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't --"
2017.16-1435,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3328.0,3331.04,How do we know if it's an issue?
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3331.04,3336.0,"We know it from -- from the campaigns that have -- that have occurred, that this is not done in a vacuum."
2017.16-1435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3356.0,3366.32,"So -- so, if a group said, well, okay, we're not going to be able to wear our -- our ""Me Too"" shirt, but we're going to convey the same message by wearing all white, that would be okay?"
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3366.32,3369.68,"Your Honor, that -- under our statute, I -- I don't believe that would be a political insignia."
2017.16-1435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3369.68,3372.64,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.16-1435,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3372.64,3375.52,Maybe you should make it broader. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1435,1,62962,daniel_rogan,,3375.52,3380.12,"May I, Your Honor? Your Honor, I think constitutionally we could."
2017.16-1435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3392.6,3398.88,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Breemer, you have four minutes remaining."
2017.16-1435,2,62961,j_david_breemer,,3398.88,3422.04,"The statute does affect millions of people that go to the polls in Minnesota, at polling places, absentee ballot locations throughout the state for 46 days prior to the election, and so what you just heard, I believe, is that there's going to be an effect of chilling all this legitimate speech, Me Too, Resist, Black Lives Matter, American Legion, Americans For Tax Reform, and the list goes on."
2017.16-1435,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3422.44,3435.04,But we were just told by Respondent that it has to be connected to an electoral choice in that election.
2017.16-1435,2,62961,j_david_breemer,,3435.04,3435.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3474.68,3482.0,Do you have any proof? You have one person who says that this process delayed him five hours.
2017.16-1435,2,62961,j_david_breemer,,3507.12,3511.2,"I think you have to look at the evidence in the record, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3534.12,3534.56,I'm sorry.
2017.16-1435,2,62961,j_david_breemer,,3558.6,3560.12,That's true.
2017.16-1435,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3566.04,3566.32,But -- but --
2017.16-1435,2,62961,j_david_breemer,,3566.32,3567.56,"It wasn't just the buttons, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3567.56,3590.04,"-- how many incidences involving the examples that Justice Alito raised have been reported, of people -- in Minnesota, of people wearing a button like an organizational -- Chamber of Commerce?"
2017.16-1435,2,62961,j_david_breemer,,3590.04,3601.04,"We don't -- we don't have record evidence of a button that would say that, but we do have record evidence of slogans like ""Don't Tread On Me,"" ""Liberty,"" that type of thing, with the Tea Party."
2017.16-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3606.2,3606.52,Right.
2017.16-1435,2,62961,j_david_breemer,,3673.56,3674.24,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1435,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3696.44,3697.6,"Thank you, counsel."
