1993.92-1750,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.888,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-1750, John C. Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc.--"
1993.92-1750,0,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,57.519,61.343,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.639,174.926,"Mr. Sidle, of course, this Court has to face up the Christiansburg case, where virtually identical language on attorney's fees was interpreted to suggest that we don't grant attorney's fees under it as respondents--"
1993.92-1750,0,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,174.926,175.266,But the Christiansburg--
1993.92-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.266,185.452,--so I think really we need to face up to what differences there are that would compel a different result here.
1993.92-1750,0,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,185.452,190.106,"--Well, I think there's dramatic differences between civil rights cases and copyright cases."
1993.92-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.09,214.46,"Well, do you think Christiansburg was correctly decided?"
1993.92-1750,0,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,214.46,224.898,"--Christiansburg was correctly decided in the civil rights context, but I don't think this Court can carry over from the civil rights context to the commercial context of the copyright law area."
1993.92-1750,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.898,227.039,"Well, you say civil rights context."
1993.92-1750,0,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,231.531,232.783,I think they are special.
1993.92-1750,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.514,234.303,What's your authority for that?
1993.92-1750,0,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,234.303,237.936,--I think just a general principle that Congress--
1993.92-1750,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.936,239.989,What's your authority from this Court?
1993.92-1750,0,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,239.989,245.001,"--Well, I don't know that I can say there's any particular authority from this Court because it hasn't faced that issue."
1993.92-1750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,301.248,306.222,"Mr. Sidle, will you remind us where the language showed up first, because it is identical language?"
1993.92-1750,0,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,306.222,310.013,The language showed up first in the Copyright Act.
1993.92-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,397.502,400.614,"Mr. Sidle, isn't it true that in 190... this statute was enacted in 1909."
1993.92-1750,0,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,402.016,402.787,Yes.
1993.92-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,402.787,409.273,"And at that time, isn't it fair to assume that the typical case Congress was thinking about was sort of a garden variety infringement suit, or something?"
1993.92-1750,0,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,409.273,415.465,"I think if we're looking back to 1909, the proper thing... the proper motive to project on Congress was that it was adopting the British Rule."
1993.92-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,427.852,435.558,"But to argue for the British Rule, that statute has been on the books for 87 years, or whatever it is, and nobody's ever adopted the British Rule."
1993.92-1750,0,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,435.558,448.106,"--When you say, nobody's ever adopted the British Rule, we cite the Lewys case in our brief which says that that's what Congress did, and that's one of the pre-1976 act cases that Fantasy relies upon as authority that there was a dual standard."
1993.92-1750,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1161.179,1166.523,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1185.998,1190.753,"Well, that's the question we granted certiorari on, Mr. Robbins."
1993.92-1750,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1190.753,1206.263,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that the way the question was formulated was, should there be a dual standard and should the defendant receive its fees pursuant to a standard that says, do you get fees only when they're objectively unreasonable?"
1993.92-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1222.125,1226.587,"Certainly, the Ninth Circuit opinion gives one the impression that they thought that's what they were doing..."
1993.92-1750,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1241.848,1242.289,--Yes.
1993.92-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.372,1283.585,"Well, that's the question we granted certiorari on, that we took the case to decide."
1993.92-1750,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1283.585,1290.33,"--Well, Your Honor, I'm prepared and happy to address the question of what standard should apply to prevailing plaintiffs."
1993.92-1750,2,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,2853.31,2856.411,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.92-1750,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2941.58,2944.84,"Well, how was it interpreted before that language was adopted?"
1993.92-1750,2,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,2944.84,2946.392,The patent cases?
1993.92-1750,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2946.392,2947.381,Yes.
1993.92-1750,2,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,2947.381,2959.219,"It's even-handed, and that's what we're asking for, is an even-handed standard, and I think Justice Ginsburg's point is well-taken, that Congress decided to change the patent law to make it only exceptional circumstances."
1993.92-1750,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2965.183,2969.326,"No, but they argued it had been so construed up until... I mean, even before the language went in the statute."
1993.92-1750,2,33997,kenneth_i_sidle,,2969.326,2980.933,"--But that, I submit, is... and I also submit, despite the analogy of patent law being closer to copyright than civil rights cases, I think there are also some unique considerations in copyright cases."
1993.92-1750,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3126.72,3128.152,"Thank you, Mr. Sidle."
