2005.04-980,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.329,We'll hear argument next in Brown vs. Sanders.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,15.331,15.971,Thank you.
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,98.506,104.913,"Isn't the difficulty with that argument that that, at least, is not the way the jury was instructed in this case?"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,132.966,135.169,They're instructed in the language of the statute.
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,140.234,140.765,As such.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,141.53,141.905,So that--
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,141.905,143.39,"--it calls them special circumstances, right?"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,143.39,144.328,--Correct.
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,144.328,144.703,Yeah.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,144.703,160.769,"But it's not reasonably likely that the jury would have understood that to mean that they should accord any special weight to the title of special circumstances, apart from the overall umbrella of the--"
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,160.769,161.707,Well--
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,161.707,162.395,--special circumstances that--
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,162.395,187.072,"--well, that may be an argument for the way we have looked at special circumstances, is as something... as factors that do carry a special weight, but I don't see any reason to differentiate the instruction to consider special circumstances here from the instructions in law to consider eligibility factors in other States, which we have called ""weighing"" States."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,187.072,194.996,"--Well, in ""weighing"" States, the eligibility factors form the primary aggravation for the jury to consider at sentencing."
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,206.169,206.497,"Well, I--"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,206.497,208.138,--sentencing factors--
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,208.138,211.936,"--I know what you're saying, because, in California, you've got a long list of other things, and you're entirely right."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,243.239,244.536,--There's two differences between that.
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,256.93,257.915,I thought in--
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,257.915,258.384,--that through--
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,258.384,261.384,--I thought in Mississippi they could take into consideration other facts.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,261.384,264.776,"--Well, they couldn't at the time of Clemons and Stringer."
2005.04-980,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,299.002,304.628,"So, you would say Clemons should come out the other way, given the current state of the Mississippi statute?"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,304.628,316.411,"--It depends how else the aggravating factors are, or what kind of a role the aggravating factors play now under the Mississippi statute."
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,328.664,363.078,"Well, I suppose the reason behind this distinction... and it's, in a sense, artificial, because we made it up... I suppose the reason is that, in the ""weighing"" State, the concern is that if there is an ineligible... or an invalid factor in the eligibility determination, it carries over with the degree of force and weight... it's almost... it's a presumption that the jury is liable to treat it... or, at least the jury is liable to treat it as such."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,381.894,382.926,It's... that is a--
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,382.926,384.254,Am I right that the special--
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,384.254,384.879,--That's what it says.
2005.04-980,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,427.67,434.859,"See, I'm not... this is a fairly complex area."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,434.859,436.781,--I'd agree.
2005.04-980,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,436.781,454.067,"And, as I understand, at this moment... and I hope you'll correct me if I'm wrong... in a ""weighing"" State, we look at the aggravating side, and there seem, let's say, to be three factors that you could take into account and weigh them against all the mitigation."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,548.15,600.207,"In California... well, first of all, if this is new jurisprudence to you, or unfamiliar, the critical difference is that most States, and most of this Court's jurisprudence, uses the term ""aggravating factor"" and ""eligibility factor"" interchangeably, because in most States, and particularly in the ""weighing"" States, ""aggravating factor"" is the eligibility factor that makes the defendant eligible for death, but it's also the sole, or primary, factor that the jury is to take into consideration on the side militating in favor of death."
2005.04-980,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,616.524,619.556,"They're not totally different, because one of them is special circumstances."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,619.556,621.963,"--Well, one part of one of them."
2005.04-980,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,625.651,634.433,"And it distinguishes those from circumstances of the crime, and then it... then it says, ""and special circumstances""."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,643.624,672.864,"--The way that California has interpreted that... in fact, there is a case that's cited in these briefs, People versus Cain, and Morris... which is on our merits brief, in page 27, and in our reply brief, on page 6... where a defendant in California argued that that reference to ""special circumstances"" ought to be excised from the direction to the jury of what they're to consider at sentencing."
2005.04-980,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.228,700.088,"It is, indeed, very complicated, Ms. Kirkland."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,708.169,715.108,All of this jurisprudence is based on the eighth amendment requirement--
2005.04-980,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.108,716.873,That says?
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,716.873,718.358,"--that says that,"
2005.04-980,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.765,723.781,Is that what the eighth amendment says?
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,723.781,729.47,--That's the way the eighth amendment has been interpreted in its application of cruel and unusual--
2005.04-980,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.47,731.579,Cruel and unusual punishments are forbidden.
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,733.33,736.159,"And may I ask you a question about the California statute, if I may, please?"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,774.855,779.606,"--That factor was held invalid, but what--"
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.606,784.888,"So, they were... they were directed to take into... they ""shall"" take into account an invalid factor."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,784.888,787.233,"--Well, yes."
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.721,810.535,"No, but the... number 14 clearly is not mitigating."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,810.535,811.347,--No.
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,848.323,848.932,All of the evidence--
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,848.932,849.932,--description of the crime--
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.932,871.828,"--Would you agree, though, that, if you had a separate sentencing jury, one that did not have all the evidence, and that jury was instructed that at the guilt phase a determination has been... that has... it has been found that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, and so forth, that that finding might tip the scales in favor of imposing the death penalty?"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,871.828,874.531,"--I don't think so, Your Honor, since that--"
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.531,878.172,"Because the underlying facts are already before the jury, and they can make their own judgment about them."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,878.172,878.454,--Right.
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.833,916.227,"See, one of the... one of the things that concerns me about this case... unlike Zant, most of the cases in which we have found the label of aggravating... immaterial... or findings like prior criminal histories... robbery, or something like... but whenever a pejorative factor of this kind has been found, we've generally found it did tilt the scales a little bit on the... on the... in favor of death."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,921.182,921.635,"Well, but--"
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.635,922.402,--circumstance.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,922.402,924.198,"--but Clemons is a ""weighing"" State, where those--"
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,924.198,925.387,I understand.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,925.387,928.59,--aggravating or eligibility factors are at the core of the sentencing decision.
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,933.482,934.575,Are there any--
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,934.575,934.982,--the lynchpin of it.
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,934.982,940.998,"--cases in which we have held a fact of... a finding of the fact of this kind was irrelevant, was harmless?"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,944.203,948.656,"Well, in ""weighing"" States, that's true, but--"
2005.04-980,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,948.656,961.3,"Ms. Kirkland, assume for a moment... I know you don't agree, but assume that the court, or a majority of it, were to hold that California appears to be a ""weighing"" State."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1003.559,1004.215,--No.
2005.04-980,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1008.028,1008.669,Why?
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1008.669,1011.108,"--in this instance, and that's because what happens--"
2005.04-980,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1011.108,1013.42,Wasn't that the pre AEDPA standard?
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1013.42,1015.156,"--Yes, that's the pre AEDPA standard, and--"
2005.04-980,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1015.156,1016.297,"So, why wouldn't that apply?"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1016.297,1030.174,"--Because, in this... if California were a ""weighing"" State... and therefore, the Clemons ruled applied... in the first instance, the State court has the opportunity to cure the error."
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1049.898,1051.835,In this case--
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1051.835,1053.898,--I have one background question.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1092.579,1093.985,Do we--
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1093.985,1094.97,Or am I missing--
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1094.97,1095.407,--assume that the
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1097.798,1098.361,--Yes.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1098.361,1104.503,"Yes, it... we assume that, because, in this case, the California Supreme Court held that to be invalid."
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1106.894,1109.003,Invalid as a matter of Federal law?
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1109.003,1111.066,--It's invalid as a matter of State law.
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1111.066,1111.582,Okay.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1111.582,1122.397,"So, the... California's holding on"
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1124.898,1135.244,"So, now we have an extra layer of complexity, because something that's been held unconstitutional under State law is said to skew the weighing, if it is weighing, as a matter of Federal law."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1135.244,1137.806,"Yes, it can be looked at--"
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1137.806,1138.135,All right.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1138.135,1138.76,--that way.
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1169.032,1169.579,Was it--
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1169.579,1171.939,--it held it invalid under California law--
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1171.939,1176.8,--was it this case in which the Supreme Court of California made the definitive interpretation--
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1176.8,1177.05,--No.
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1177.05,1177.644,--that this is... what was--
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1177.644,1180.332,"That case is Engert, which is--"
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1180.332,1181.769,--Engert.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1182.785,1183.333,--It's in--
2005.04-980,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.333,1185.973,What did... what did the California Supreme Court hold?
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1208.385,1212.12,--The Engert case specifically held that the
2005.04-980,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.2,1222.497,"--So, if I think something is"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1230.437,1230.719,--Correct.
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1243.127,1246.424,"Well, of course, this goes to a question, really, for the respondent."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1261.303,1261.866,Yes.
2005.04-980,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1261.866,1266.835,"Counsel, I was confused by your answer to Justice O'Connor's question."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1277.697,1280.822,In this case--
2005.04-980,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1280.822,1283.651,Assuming you'd... we'd--
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1283.651,1284.073,--Yeah.
2005.04-980,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1284.526,1285.277,--you lose on the first question.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1285.277,1286.074,"--California is a ""weighing"" State--"
2005.04-980,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1286.074,1286.574,Yeah.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1286.574,1305.766,"--then the first step is for this Court... as the ninth circuit did, is to look at whether California performed a proper Clemons review, which is that the appellate court looks to see whether there is a principled and complete harmless error review."
2005.04-980,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1311.641,1315.33,I would have thought that that might have collapsed into the Brecht analysis.

2005.04-980,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1333.912,1340.539,"In other words, you said that the error was harmless under Chapman, the higher standard--"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1340.539,1341.226,Yes.
2005.04-980,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1341.226,1344.32,--and that the California court so ruled.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1356.808,1357.23,That's correct.
2005.04-980,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1357.23,1366.013,"So the... so the second question, once we get past weighing, is whether California, in fact, did do what Chapman said."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1367.076,1388.753,"That's correct, that they not only have to have applied the appropriate standards... that is, the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard, which is the same as California's ""reasonable possibility"" standard... they not only have cried... applied the correct standard, but they have to have done so in a principled and complete way so the reviewing court can make sure that they've actually cured the error."
2005.04-980,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1388.753,1389.237,"Well, the problem--"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1389.237,1389.55,And--
2005.04-980,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1389.55,1395.754,--here is that the California Supreme Court decision is rather skimpy once you get to harmless error.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1395.754,1402.208,"--Well, we think that their analysis of the error was fairly complete."

2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1451.312,1451.828,--Right.
2005.04-980,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1451.828,1456.158,"--the defendant, instead of on the prosecutor for the harmless error inquiry?"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1456.158,1470.457,"We think that the burden of proof argument is illusory here, that the way that these things are analyzed, just as they were in this very case, is that it's the court who performs the analysis, and there's no discussion of which side has to prove what."
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1478.333,1478.991,Maybe--
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1478.991,1479.444,--of the case.
2005.04-980,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1479.444,1489.555,"--so, in this... or, weren't there previous California cases... or, again, correct me if I'm wrong... where California says the reasonable possibility test requires the defendant to establish that the error was prejudicial?"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1491.462,1499.573,"Well, the California... the California Supreme Court has said that ""reasonable possibility"" and ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" are the same thing."

2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1516.608,1517.389,--no placement of burden.
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1517.389,1522.328,--don't we assume that the court follows California law on the... on the burden?
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1527.752,1529.189,No.
2005.04-980,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1533.768,1535.503,I know there is no discussion of burden.
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1551.069,1559.883,"--Well, I don't think it's fair to assume that in this instance, since burden didn't play any role in this, that there was... neither side had any burden."

2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1580.496,1588.419,"--Because the word ""weigh"" isn't the talisman for the process that the jury goes through."
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.633,1638.009,"And the term ""concluding that it does outweigh"" is something different from ""weighing""."
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1638.009,1640.9,"No, it's the same process."
2005.04-980,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1656.295,1657.841,"Well, I think--"
2005.04-980,0,31266,jane_n_kirkland,,1657.841,1659.811,I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
2005.04-980,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1659.811,1660.436,"Thank you, Ms. Kirkland."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,1661.248,1667.968,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1749.018,1752.925,But it's not... it's prefaced by circumstances of the crime.
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,1752.925,1753.487,I--
2005.04-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.487,1756.363,"And this State, and other States, can determine,"
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,1779.134,1786.463,"--Well, no, I think it's not, and I think it's very consistent with what we see in Mississippi."
2005.04-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1820.126,1824.128,"Of course, it's... it's invalid only because it's too vague for eligibility."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,1827.706,1830.253,I don't think that distinction holds up.
2005.04-980,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1960.438,1960.907,Why is--
2005.04-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.907,1964.83,"Ms. Rivkind, I really don't understand what harm is done here."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2047.083,2051.458,I think the harm is... there is harm.
2005.04-980,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2081.184,2085.059,--But the... but the evidence supporting them was perfectly admissible.
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2093.639,2096.264,"--I have two responses, Your Honor."
2005.04-980,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2143.244,2146.51,"Okay, but aren't we in, sort of, the converse situation here?"
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2178.829,2189.238,"--My argument is that the ""special circumstance"" finding, itself, is the invalid aggravating factor on death's side of the scale."
2005.04-980,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2191.535,2193.473,But that's what I thought I was trying to say.
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2195.098,2195.473,--No.
2005.04-980,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2195.473,2197.005,"--time to correct me, if I am."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2197.005,2203.163,"No, the... the jury could consider the facts of the crime, as in Mississippi."
2005.04-980,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2238.155,2255.487,"Are you saying... because this can get pretty complex... simply, that because special circumstances are a discreet category, that, in effect, what went... what the court is instructing is double counting that factor?"
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2274.429,2280.883,"I think it's more than that, because I... I think if... the harm is--"
2005.04-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.883,2281.211,I hope so.
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2282.383,2289.103,"--It is more than that, because we have to think of how the jury is understanding this."
2005.04-980,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2293.073,2295.45,"Well, didn't the California Supreme Court answer that in--"
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2295.45,2295.825,--Yes.
2005.04-980,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2295.825,2297.215,--its Bacigalupo--
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2297.215,2297.824,No.
2005.04-980,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2297.824,2306.561,"--decision, where, as I read it, it says juries don't give special circumstances any extra weight in considering all the variety of factors listed in the statute?"
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2306.561,2309.123,I don't read Bacigalupo as saying that.
2005.04-980,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2341.255,2362.651,"The word ""special circumstances"" is ambiguous, because it might refer to something in the world, in which case it's about evidence, or it might refer to something in the law, in which case it's a statement by a prosecutor to look at some of this evidence and give it some special weight."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2401.925,2402.957,--That is correct.
2005.04-980,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2402.957,2403.222,Fine.
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2479.801,2486.787,"Your Honor, if I were able to write on a clean slate, that is the rule I would propose."
2005.04-980,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2524.733,2541.798,"Then we would not have this crossword puzzle, which probably only five people in the United States understand, and the worst thing that would happen would be, you'd always conduct harmless error analysis, and thus, if Justice Scalia is right about it, you would lose, and if... because it would be harmless... and if he's wrong about it, you'd win."
2005.04-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2541.798,2543.595,Assuming--
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2543.595,2544.205,--I think... I--
2005.04-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.205,2549.629,--assuming the district court does the... the district court in the ninth circuit does the harmless error analysis correctly.
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2549.629,2550.973,--And--
2005.04-980,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2552.442,2558.912,"But isn't it the California Supreme Court that has to do the harmless error, in the first instance?"
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2593.091,2603.734,"--Your Honor, I think we first need to distinguish between the lack of a formal mitigation case and the absence of mitigating factors."
2005.04-980,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2647.135,2647.603,"Well, what were those?"
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2649.057,2650.197,"So, I think there was a--"
2005.04-980,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2650.197,2656.183,"--Yes, but what were the mitigating factors from the evidence presented at the guilt phase?"
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2656.183,2670.451,"--The main mitigating evidence was a powerful mitigating factor which went to the personal culpability of Mr. Sanders, and that was that the prosecutor, in his closing guilt phase argument, told the jury,"
2005.04-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2713.883,2716.525,I've never heard that described as a mitigating factor before.
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2731.59,2748.031,"--I think it is mitigating, and the fact that there is a question about one of the people, perhaps the accomplice, which very well could have been Mr. Sanders, wanting to leave before the murder occurred was basis enough to give the jury pause."
2005.04-980,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2759.112,2764.003,"But now you're getting into what has sometimes been called ""residual doubt""."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2792.494,2794.698,--You mean in the trial court.
2005.04-980,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2794.698,2796.041,At any time.
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2796.041,2800.323,"No, in the... in the ninth circuit, residual doubt was argued."
2005.04-980,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2801.495,2804.981,"But in the trial court, it wasn't, because that's when it would count."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2804.981,2814.874,"--No, in the trial part, nothing was argued, because trial counsel acquiesced to Mr. Sanders' request that there be no penalty defense."
2005.04-980,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2827.595,2832.909,Didn't... wasn't there a statement that he was indifferent between death and life imprisonment?
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2832.909,2837.613,It... there was a statement that he did not want either penalty.
2005.04-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2837.613,2859.351,"Do you... do you defend that the difference in... our distinction between balancing and nonbalancing... or, pardon me, ""weighing"" and ""nonweighing"" States... your answer to Justice Breyer indicates the... that you would not be disconsolate if we jettisoned the whole... the whole distinction."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2870.385,2873.527,"Well, I don't... I don't think that's odd."
2005.04-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2900.673,2906.315,"But it is within the contours of the Constitution if, in a ""nonweighing"" State, the same evidence could be considered."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2906.315,2916.895,"--But it... I don't... again, I don't think it's a question of evidence, I think it's a question of what are those factors that are being put in... on... in death's side of the scale, and how are they being balanced--"
2005.04-980,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2916.895,2930.976,"Yeah, and I can imagine, in ""nonweighing"" State, a prosecutor banging on and on, at the eligibility stage, on factor X, and really fixing that in the mind of the jury, and it turns out that factor X is not an aggravator."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2966.64,2970.391,--In terms of the rule of--
2005.04-980,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2970.391,2970.875,Yeah.
2005.04-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2978.846,2981.033,--He wants to know whether you would like to be thrown--
2005.04-980,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2981.033,2981.33,yeah.
2005.04-980,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2981.33,2982.252,"--into the ""Breyer"" patch."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,2985.191,2988.536,--I... I'd like harmless error analysis.
2005.04-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3006.399,3006.883,In that--

2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,3030.78,3033.373,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, I don't... I didn't--"

2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,3034.499,3034.749,--get the question.
2005.04-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3034.749,3043.703,"--Well, we have the rule, already, that if there is an invalid eligibility factor and it's a ""weighing"" State, that there's... that the process is defective."
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,3051.612,3058.441,"I think if we had... well, I first would like to clarify something you said."
2005.04-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3086.761,3094.809,But that was the whole basis... correct me if I'm wrong... for the ninth circuit's case in your... ninth circuit decision in your favor in this case.

2005.04-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3097.184,3098.59,--is an accurate description of--

2005.04-980,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3124.049,3135.161,--I was just asking if we can import the same formal rule we now have and reach... and... if we don't consider the same things in harmless error analysis.
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,3135.161,3137.177,"--Well, I think they would be."
2005.04-980,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3155.651,3156.369,But it--

2005.04-980,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.132,3215.273,But in... would you clarify something?
2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,3235.151,3238.183,"--No, I think if it's invalid for one, it's invalid for the other."

2005.04-980,1,37273,nina_rivkind,,3297.447,3304.4,"Well, the eighth amendment, as this Court said in Tuilaepa, does apply to the selection factors."

I want to throw you a suggestion... isn't the answer to that problem that anything may be considered as mitigating evidence, but a mitigating factor is a conclusion that evidence has a certain significance, and not everything may be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor?"
