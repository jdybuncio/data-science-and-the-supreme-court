1993.92-74,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.018,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-74, Department of Revenue of Oregon v. ACF Industries."
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,26.409,30.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,74.84,82.646,"Now, Ms. Linder, we are concerned here only with subsection (4), is that correct?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,86.878,91.021,"Justice O'Connor, the precise question is the meaning of subsection (4)."
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.933,94.154,All right.
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,101.839,103.1,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.1,108.352,"All right, now, what other tax does that mean?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,114.317,116.687,Our position is that's exactly what it means.
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.687,117.738,That's how you read it?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,117.738,118.087,Yes.
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.087,125.664,So it would cover sales taxes and gross receipts taxes and income taxes?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,125.664,128.024,"That, the question of--"
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.024,128.255,Yes?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,130.305,130.765,"--Your Honor, that's an open question."
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.765,132.268,"Well, why wouldn't it?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,137.983,141.445,Taken as a matter of plain language it certainly suggests that.
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.1,155.162,But you agree that the plain language would suggest it would cover all these other taxes?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,155.162,160.005,"--As a matter of pure plain language, sitting along in that section, yes, Your Honor, we would agree with that."
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.456,188.464,"Well, but there was certainly some indication in the legislative history that gross receipts taxes and so forth were in the minds of the drafters of that provision."
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,188.464,193.087,And we believe that's exactly what that provision was intended to reach.
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.428,200.921,But the language would certainly reach sales and income and other taxes.
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,200.921,204.494,The language would seem to sweep more broadly in the provision itself.
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.494,209.429,"Well, if it did then how do you view the discrimination?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,213.5,216.653,"I believe that's our opponent's argument, Your Honor."
1993.92-74,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,217.904,243.871,"But if it doesn't reach that far, if the and other language is qualified, and if it's qualified in terms of the statute, then doesn't that mean that it's plausible that another tax means a property tax that is equalized so far as assessment and rate but has differential exemptions?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,266.655,291.202,"Justice Kennedy, if I understand the point of the question correctly, I think my answer is that if we were looking at some other tax on property, other than a generally applicable ad valorem property tax, that was reached under subsection (b)(4), you might, the question then would be other exemptions from that tax, I would think, and what Congress would mean in terms of exemptions from that same tax."
1993.92-74,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.502,337.383,That's because it says another tax.
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,337.383,337.743,--That's right.
1993.92-74,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.743,350.78,"But then why do you shy away from the logical, what seems to me logical definition of another tax in your response to Justice O'Connor's question, which was some other tax other than an ad valorem property tax?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,350.78,355.386,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't mean to shy away from that at all."
1993.92-74,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,375.558,380.089,And you say we don't have to answer it here because what you're talking about is an ad valorem property tax?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,380.089,380.51,Precisely.
1993.92-74,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,402.516,405.909,"Ms. Linder, you use the word general ad valorem property tax."
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,407.959,408.56,It does not.
1993.92-74,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,408.56,425.77,"What would the situation be in your view if all other taxpayers in the state paid a gross receipts tax, an income tax, a sales tax, several taxes, but none of them paid an ad valorem tax except the railroads, so it was a special ad valorem tax?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,427.401,436.107,"Justice Stevens, my first answer to it is you could test it under subsection (b)(4)."
1993.92-74,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,450.805,456.82,There would be no discrimination because everybody who is assessed an ad valorem tax would pay at the same rate and the same amount.
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,458.863,461.153,--But at that point--
1993.92-74,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,461.153,463.264,But you don't know whether you think that would violate the statute or not?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,463.264,468.888,--I do not know whether it is a discriminatory tax at that point.
1993.92-74,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,475.073,479.096,You think Congress intended to include the word general even though it doesn't appear in the statute?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,479.096,480.886,Yes.
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,480.886,492.212,But you say that that hypothetical tax would not violate subsections (1) through (3) because of the definition that allows exemptions?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,492.212,499.138,"Justice O'Connor, that hypothetical tax simply doesn't fit the model contained in subsections (1) through (3)."
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,542.187,549.962,Is it typical that all states have personal property taxes on commercial and industrial property?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,549.962,553.385,"Justice O'Connor, it is typical, yes."
1993.92-74,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,553.385,557.546,And is it typical that these schemes have exemptions?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,557.546,562.942,"Justice O'Connor, I know of no state that does not."
1993.92-74,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,585.675,613.181,"Ms. Linder, how do you answer the argument that under your view you couldn't have property B taxed at a lower rate than railroad property, that would be barred, but you could have a total exemption of property B, and that would be okay?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,624.49,627.721,"Justice Ginsburg, that is exactly our reading of the statute."
1993.92-74,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.759,725.127,And you say that's reflected in 11503(a)(4) which defines property to be only property that is subject to a property tax?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,725.127,726.298,"Justice Scalia, yes."
1993.92-74,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,742.551,745.032,You said that every state has some exemptions.
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,755.126,763.582,"Justice Kennedy, my understanding is that the more common model is that there is not a broad classification system in most states."
1993.92-74,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,857.606,872.843,"Ms. Linder, what is your view of the district court, the district court held for Oregon but it recognized the possibility of de facto discrimination, which I took to mean if it turned out that they were really exempting everything except railroad property?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,872.843,884.183,"That is, Justice Ginsburg, that is what the district court assumed was one of the possible things it might have to test for under subsection (b)(4)."
1993.92-74,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,884.183,893.407,But I take it that your reading of subsection (b)(4) wouldn't even leave room for that because you say it just has no office with respect to this very same tax.
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,893.407,897.161,That is correct to a point.
1993.92-74,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.344,967.655,"Ms. Linder, I don't understand where you get this up to a point."
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,971.599,972.89,Justice Scalia--
1993.92-74,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.89,978.845,"Is it up to a point, past a certain point it will not, no longer be the general system that Congress had in mind?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1028.748,1039.874,"--I do get it out of the text, but I want to emphasize that we are talking about something so different than what we were talking about in Oregon, that it wouldn't look anything like what Oregon is."
1993.92-74,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.874,1041.594,"Let's concede that, but how do you get it out of the text?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1059.226,1065.781,I would agree I should adopt that position wholeheartedly--
1993.92-74,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.781,1067.283,But you can't bring yourself to do it.
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1067.283,1073.526,"--I have difficulty bringing myself to do it, Your Honor, because... and again this is text-based."
1993.92-74,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.37,1113.181,I don't care what was contemplated.
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1114.944,1118.634,And I'm talking about text and structure when I say that.
1993.92-74,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.634,1120.176,--Okay.
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1129.202,1131.094,"Justice Stevens, no."
1993.92-74,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.191,1159.271,"You get the impression from the court of appeals description of what went on in the district court that you would have agreed that if there had been an exemption of over 50 percent of property in the state that then there would have been a violation, and you in fact argue it was only 30 percent whereas they said it was 67 percent."
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1159.271,1163.304,"--Justice Stevens, the Ninth Circuit statement on that was incorrect."
1993.92-74,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1163.304,1163.624,I see.
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1163.624,1177.273,"What we said to the Ninth Circuit about that was even assuming that the test is what they say it is, if you put the numbers together the way we thought was accurate they didn't get to 50 percent."
1993.92-74,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1177.273,1186.91,And that was to put personal property tax and real property tax in different categories for purposes of the comparison?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1186.91,1187.181,That's right.
1993.92-74,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1190.643,1193.935,Do you agree that that is a correct methodology?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1193.935,1194.596,"--No, we don't."
1993.92-74,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1196.146,1198.627,You think personal and real property should be lumped together in one category?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1198.627,1198.987,--Yes.
1993.92-74,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1198.987,1201.919,What is your textual basis for that in this case?
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1201.919,1203.241,There are two.
1993.92-74,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1277.758,1295.179,"Of course even in that case your language of the fourth, article (d) here refers simply to discrimination against a carrier, which would imply that in effect it's the composite bottom line that you're concerned with on discrimination."
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1296.521,1297.811,I would agree.
1993.92-74,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.811,1304.956,"That subsection (c) you referred to, it demonstrates that this is not a finely crafted piece of legislation, doesn't it?"
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1304.956,1308.29,"Justice Scalia, it demonstrates that very well."
1993.92-74,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.29,1318.574,Because it says you can't get relief for anything except discrimination by variable assessment.
1993.92-74,0,43632,virginia_l_linder,,1318.574,1320.036,That's exactly what it says.
1993.92-74,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1330.034,1332.425,"Very well, Ms. Linder."
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1335.106,1340.74,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-74,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.33,1444.938,"Mr. Jones, the Government, as I understand it, agrees with the railroads on the scope of section (4), but says, contrary to the railroads, that every differentiation is not a discrimination."
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1450.733,1460.357,"Well, the Equal Protection Clause under this Court's decision in Lehnhausen in 1972 doesn't give the railroads very much at all."
1993.92-74,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1502.825,1514.784,"So you think Congress set up kind of a new kind of equal protection analysis different from the courts, the Constitution, and it was just to be developed on a case-by-case basis?"
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1514.784,1516.056,They set up a standard.
1993.92-74,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1523.219,1526.291,As strict scrutiny for railroads.
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1526.291,1536.559,"No, sir, I don't think it's strict scrutiny, but I do think that it's statutory specific scrutiny."
1993.92-74,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1536.559,1540.039,Does it include disparate impact?
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1540.039,1547.185,"I'm not sure if I can answer that in the abstract, but I, let me see if I can answer your question this way."
1993.92-74,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1577.895,1582.298,They certainly can't rebut it if it falls under (1) through (3).
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1582.298,1589.384,If it falls under (1) through (3) you don't have to decide whether it's discriminatory.
1993.92-74,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1604.102,1606.806,What do you compare it to?
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1613.319,1614.13,Yes.
1993.92-74,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1614.13,1616.053,What is it you're comparing?
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1616.053,1620.234,"Well, what you're comparing is the difference in treatment between the two types of property."
1993.92-74,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1664.243,1679.653,"But as the railroads point out, the property, the motor vehicle tax may be $10 a vehicle, which is hardly comparable to the kind of tax rates that is imposed on the property tax generally."
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1679.653,1682.925,I agree with your statement in the abstract.
1993.92-74,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1721.29,1742.134,"Mr. Jones, I don't, I really have no idea what, how to measure the kind of discrimination you're talking about under the first three portions, and when I'm confronted with a statute like this I am inclined to give it the meaning that will least confuse the Federal courts for the next 50 years, and if Congress wants to be more precise they can."
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1758.383,1763.576,"I'm not sure which part of that question you want me to address, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-74,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.576,1773.875,"Address why the state's solution isn't the simplest, the one that puts less strain on the Federal courts and less fosters litigation into the indefinite future."
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1773.875,1777.627,"With all respect, Justice Scalia--"
1993.92-74,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1777.627,1781.889,"Whereas you come up with some test that I don't know how to figure out, when you decide there are too many exemptions or not."
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1781.889,1793.158,"--With all respect, Justice Scalia, I am not familiar with any canon of statutory interpretation whose objective is to avoid litigation of this kind of an issue."
1993.92-74,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.367,1797.749,"Well, we're certainly in the field of restricting state action."
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1806.365,1816.263,In the Piedmont case in 1932 this Court said that national transportation legislation is remedial legislation which should be broadly interpreted.
1993.92-74,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.073,1822.166,What is not remedial legislation in your estimation?
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1825.028,1827.56,--I am not sure.
1993.92-74,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.511,1835.974,"Why would Congress ever pass legislation that wasn't remedial, remedying something?"
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1835.974,1840.426,--I'm not sure if I can answer why they would ever do it.
1993.92-74,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1857.67,1861.26,Don't all statutes displace pre-existing or non-existing law?
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1862.672,1866.844,"What these types of statutes do is they... well, there are two types."
1993.92-74,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1894.543,1897.625,"Mr. Jones, you said it doesn't mean what it means in equal protection."
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1918.177,1932.107,"--Business inventories would be exempt... if business inventories are exempt, if they are a type of property that railroads would normally own then it's not discriminatory to exempt it."
1993.92-74,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1937.151,1940.722,Business inventory is exempt from this tax.
1993.92-74,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1946.957,1950.529,Absent a justification it is discriminatory.
1993.92-74,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1962.397,1964.099,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1966.3,1970.351,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-74,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1985.622,1991.415,Does the word Mr. Phillips?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1991.415,1994.678,"Only in the context of the stipulation, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-74,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2015.742,2019.725,"So nothing in this case turns upon the meaning of the word ""fully"" in the stipulation?"
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2019.725,2022.807,Not as the case comes to this Court at this particular point.
1993.92-74,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2087.228,2098.567,"Mr. Phillips, in applying subsections 1 through 3 we look to the definition, do we, of commercial and industrial property?"
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2098.567,2099.678,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-74,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2099.678,2108.344,And the phrase subject to a property tax levy means that under (1) through (3) the state can have an exemption scheme?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2108.344,2109.853,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-74,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2112.755,2116.818,And that's why your clients did not bring their cause of action under (1) through (3)?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2116.818,2118.298,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-74,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2128.135,2134.72,"But it is a bit odd, then, when you come to (b)(4) to think that a state can't have exemptions."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2134.72,2135.86,I think what you--
1993.92-74,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2135.86,2139.793,It just seems anomalous at the bottom line.
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2139.793,2142.484,--Not if you put it in the context of the precise language of (b)(4).
1993.92-74,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2153.791,2156.165,"Well, now it says another tax that discriminates."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2156.165,2157.243,"I understand that, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-74,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2157.243,2159.895,Do you think that means something different than any other tax?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2159.895,2172.624,"No, it has to mean the exact same as any other tax because the change is not to have any substantive effect, but the actual language adopted by Congress is actually any other tax and that's the language that ought to control in terms of the--"
1993.92-74,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2172.624,2175.436,"Well then where did impose another tax, where did that language come from?"
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2175.436,2179.938,"--That comes from the original language as well, Justice, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-74,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.938,2190.047,"Well, surely if the language we're dealing with says impose another tax that doesn't mean exactly the same thing as if it said any other tax."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2190.047,2200.593,"Well, to the extent that it means something different from that, Mr. Chief Justice, you would apply the any other tax language because that's what this Court said in Burlington Northern and that's what Congress said it wanted to have happen."
1993.92-74,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2215.982,2218.144,Why did you say that was so in the Burlington case?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2218.144,2222.207,Because that is what Congress indicated when it allowed the recodification in 1978.
1993.92-74,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2230.492,2241.818,"Mr. Phillips, why isn't the most natural reading of that language to refer to any tax other than an ad valorem property tax?"
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2241.818,2247.504,I think the most natural reading of that language is to refer to any other tax that discriminates.
1993.92-74,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2279.514,2283.007,So much so that it essentially eclipses the other.
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2295.204,2303.891,"Well, except that (1) through (3) identify precise definitions of objectively identifiable discriminations that the statute prohibits."
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2308.584,2313.817,"But neither does it to say any other discrimination, which is the way you're using it."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2313.817,2318.07,I think that's the most natural way to understand the particular language that Congress chose because--
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2318.07,2340.795,"Well, certainly the easiest way to understand the language Congress chose is to take the indication of (1) through (3) as being examples of the discrimination that it referred to in the preamble sentence of (b) and to assume that indeed the discriminations that it is referring to are the same kinds of discriminations, in other words the statute in fact does define discrimination by example."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2350.242,2377.379,"--I would have understood the way you argued that, Justice Souther, for exactly the opposite proposition, which is that it clearly must mean that the state is not in a position where it can sit back and exempt all of the other property of the state, leaving only the railroads out there exposed to discrimination, and find a way to argue that that's nevertheless not a treatment that results in discrimination against the railroads."
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2377.379,2378.438,"Well, that's not the point."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2404.715,2412.131,"Well, I'm sure that's true as well, but it seems to me at least an odd approach to the language of the statute to guarantee that it will be self-defeating."
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2412.131,2419.225,Is it so odd when you start with the proposition that the statute is to begin with an exception to the Tax Injunction Act?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2419.225,2425.79,"Well, it's interesting in that regard because the states historically have now taken diametrically opposed views of what this language means precisely."
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2482.967,2488.57,"But you can't take that view, I take it you would agree, solely as an inference from the text itself."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2496.034,2499.918,Every court of appeals that has addressed this issue--
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2499.918,2501.06,Do you agree with that?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2501.06,2519.333,"--Well, no, I have some difficulty with that, Justice Souter, because every court of appeals that has addressed this issue, has read that language, has inferred from that language that it is a catch-all provision and that it really means any additional taxes that discrimination over and above the ones that are objectively identified in (b)(1) through (b)(3)."
1993.92-74,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2531.387,2535.541,Is your position essentially that this is a most favored taxpayer clause?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2543.205,2546.719,"No, Justice Ginsburg, that is not the position of the carlines in this case."
1993.92-74,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.697,2579.95,Why not 33-1/3 percent or 66-2/3?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2579.95,2582.972,I have no trouble with 66-2/3.
1993.92-74,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2582.972,2583.182,I know that.
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2591.519,2617.093,"That is the exact same number, Justice Scalia, that Congress would have you pluck out of the air in applying the (b)(3) provision, because if you have 50 percent of the personal property taxed at one rate, or let's say 50 plus a little, and 49 percent taxed another rate, the statute requires that the railroad property be taxed at the lower rate, or whatever the majority rate is."
1993.92-74,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2624.33,2632.244,"Well, it seems to me when they wanted numbers they stated numbers, as indicated in the later provision where they say there has to be a 5 percent differential."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2658.551,2659.092,Because--
1993.92-74,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.092,2667.177,"So that whatever constitutes discrimination on the part of another tax, total exemption of some category is not it."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2667.177,2670.789,"--There is no textual basis for that, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2673.641,2675.203,There is a textual basis.
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2705.281,2713.93,"--Except that the comparison is that there's no language of discriminate that comes out of (b)(1) through (b)(3), first of all, and second of all--"
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2713.93,2719.022,Isn't the structure of (1) through (3) to exemplify the discriminations?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2719.022,2721.414,--But (b)(4) also exemplifies the discrimination.
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2723.233,2724.955,"Well, it doesn't exemplify, it doesn't give an example."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2743.887,2749.731,Except that the purpose of it is not to make comparisons to property.
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2765.571,2767.632,"The carrier language doesn't, but the discrimination language still may."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2767.632,2789.688,"The difficulty I have with your argument, Justice Souter, is you still are dealing... I don't see how you get to the point where you say I can take all of the property of the state out of the personal property tax base except the railroads, and that's not a tax that results in discrimination against the railroads, against the rail carriers."
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2789.688,2794.74,It depends on whether you're going to redefine the word discrimination or not.
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2832.156,2833.396,I have two thoughts about that.
1993.92-74,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2899.279,2907.424,How do the courts of appeals explain the use of the word (4)?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2907.424,2912.457,"They view the ""other"" as referring to other forms of discrimination, so that it's any other tax that discriminates."
1993.92-74,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2912.457,2913.929,Even though it modifies the word tax?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2913.929,2915.489,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-74,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2984.605,2990.338,Suppose the relief that the Court ordered in the case was that you would simply get a 67 percent credit?
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2993.781,2996.994,"Our position is that does not eliminate the discrimination, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-74,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3028.263,3036.758,"Well, you're put, under the formula where you get a 67 percent credit, you are put in the same position as all other taxpayers in the state."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3036.758,3042.973,"Technically you're certainly not, because what you've done is you have created three different categories of taxation."
1993.92-74,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3067.469,3071.51,Well then if the 50 percent threshold is reached you do get a most favored nation type treatment.
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3071.51,3080.947,"That's correct, because that's the only way to insure that we consistently are treated like the majority of the other property, which we think was a significant value that undergirds the statute."
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3102.481,3126.388,"Mr. Phillips, with respect to the way you calculate the relevant percentage, given the fact that subsection (d) refers to discrimination against rail carriers without reference to specific classes of property or kinds of tax, why shouldn't you aggregate all of the property to get in effect a composite rate, in which case instead of 67 percent you would get, I guess what, 30 something percent in this case?"
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3126.388,3128.388,I'm not exactly sure how the numbers would play out.
1993.92-74,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3128.388,3133.691,"In any case, why isn't it a bottom line analysis as opposed to a class-by-class analysis?"
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3133.691,3134.763,There are two answers to that.
1993.92-74,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3225.301,3228.634,"(b)(4) does use the word discriminate, where (1), (2), and (3) don't."
1993.92-74,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3228.634,3230.426,"--That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-74,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3266.05,3267.218,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
1993.92-74,3,43632,virginia_l_linder,,3269.56,3274.425,I've only a couple of points to make.
1993.92-74,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3395.654,3396.284,"Thank you, Ms. Linder."
