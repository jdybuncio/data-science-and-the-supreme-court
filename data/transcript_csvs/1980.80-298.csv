1980.80-298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.285,We'll hear arguments next in Monroe v. Standard Oil.
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,53.385,57.503,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-298,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,325.026,333.716,"Do you have suggestions, Mr. Horowitz, how do you think the employer should accommodate to satisfy his obligation under the statute?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,333.716,336.199,"You mean, on these specific facts?"
1980.80-298,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,339.218,340.62,"All right, let's start with these."
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,340.62,352.943,"Okay, well, first of all, we don't think the actual means of accommodation is really an issue in this case because the record reveals that the employer made no effort to make any arrangements."
1980.80-298,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,370.905,373.171,"Suppose that's tried and that doesn't work, then what?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,375.107,381.361,"In other words, it's impossible for the employer to accommodate in that sense?"
1980.80-298,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,381.361,384.629,At least by that method he can't accommodate him.
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,384.629,390.967,"Well, we would also suggest that he should have taken account of these obligations in the schedule itself."
1980.80-298,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,401.09,403.876,So that he works five days other than the weekend?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,403.876,407.661,Only in the week that he has the reserve obligations.
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,411.446,426.306,"But under your theory, every time that a worker is dissatisfied with the employer's effort to accommodate, it would be a question that would have to be resolved in court, whether there had been good faith effort to accommodate him."
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,426.306,429.658,"Well, it's not a question of whether he's dissatisfied with the accommodation."
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,440.232,452.373,"But you say that it's a very flexible type of thing, that the employer does not have to--"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,452.373,459.796,I don't mean to suggest that the courts... the courts are not going to be overrun by cases now deciding what's reasonable accommodation.
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,490.648,495.469,"--And you've also got seven days a week, 24 hours a day, scheduling."
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,495.469,506.341,"--Yes, but the reservist is going to be there for five days, so it's not clear that there's any difficulty in scheduling him for those five days."
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,506.341,513.431,"Well, did the employer treat this reservist like he treated other employees who wanted to be away?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,513.431,514.881,That's right.
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,519.918,526.321,"So your submission is that he's not entitled to do that, that he... that the statute puts a--"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,526.321,526.404,--That's right.
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,531.273,540.062,"--It requires him to treat the reservists more favorably than others, including more favorably with respect to absences?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,540.062,544.033,--I don't think it's a question of treating the reservist more favorably.
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.299,546.816,That's what I just asked you.
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,546.816,553.054,--What we contend is that the employer has to give special treatment to the absences.
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.088,555.321,All right.
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,558.606,566.196,--It's not permitted to treat an absence for reserve duty as if it was any other sort of absence.
1980.80-298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,578.984,588.376,"Are you saying that this statute is comparable to what some states have, with special provisions made for people called for jury service?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,594.595,595.479,I think it's in the same ball park.
1980.80-298,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,616.859,626.964,"Are the problems of accommodation, Mr. Horowitz, any different under this statute than under those statutes that the Congress has enacted requiring accommodation of religious preferences?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,626.964,643.742,"Well, I think it's quite different than under Title VII, because the situation under Title VII, it's a complete anti-discrimination statute that intends to prohibit discrimination against all groups of employees, religious being one."
1980.80-298,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,655.467,656.267,More required here?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,660.87,663.322,"Well, I think the accommodation is just statutorily based."
1980.80-298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,663.322,668.441,Is that why you don't see TWA v. Hardison as being in your way?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,668.441,672.928,"Well, we think that TWA v. Hardison really has very little to do with this case."
1980.80-298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.861,674.394,Is that the reason?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,674.394,675.561,"--Well, for several reasons."
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.053,715.838,"The statute doesn't say anything about rescheduling, does it?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,715.838,717.623,No.
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.623,721.509,"It does give him, certainly, something other employees don't have."
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,741.655,743.488,"Well, there are two different sections that apply to reservists."
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.217,762.569,No question about that being violated?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,762.569,764.069,No question about that being violated here.
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.271,795.04,The right to work 40 hours?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,795.04,797.659,Yes.
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.592,803.479,"Where is the right, where's that in, the source of any right to work 40 hours a week?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,803.479,810.3,The right to work 40 hours a week is based on the employer's practice at this particular refinery.
1980.80-298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,810.3,812.919,"Well, that's what he was employed for."
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,818.155,824.476,This is a right that is granted to employees.
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.534,838.819,"Yes, but who guaranteed him the right to work 40 hours a week?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,838.819,842.104,The right is guaranteed by the employer.
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,843.171,845.306,Where was that guaranteed him?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,845.306,847.258,--By custom and practice at the refinery.
1980.80-298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,850.21,852.644,"Well, is it a question of a guarantee, counsel?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,867.236,872.123,He's denied meaningful right to work 40 hours a week because of his reserve status.
1980.80-298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.031,887.383,May I ask you a question about your distinction of the Hardison case now?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,925.108,928.977,"--Okay, we're not asking for the reservist to be given a preference."
1980.80-298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.171,949.723,"Well, he's getting more than equal treatment, if other employees have to take some undesirable work."
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,954.527,963.05,"--No, we absolutely concede that he's not entitled to work fewer weekends than the other employees, although it has to be recognized that he is--"
1980.80-298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.05,972.906,"So your point is that if the company could rearrange the schedules in a way that didn't put any other employee in any worse position than they're in under the normal scheduling, that then he has the right to reschedule?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,972.906,976.858,"--Yes, that's clear, as far as it goes; I'm not sure."
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.858,994.319,"What if there are two employees; this man goes off to reserve duty and the employer says, fine, I'll reschedule, I'll try to work it out, and he does, and then a man comes to him and says, I understand so and so is getting off for reserve duty and gets rescheduled."
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1020.986,1022.338,"Well, I think you've put your finger on it."
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1022.338,1024.188,"He certainly is being favored, isn't he?"
1980.80-298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1024.188,1027.623,"Well, has Congress made any provision for going fishing?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1027.623,1030.925,"Well, he's not being favored, because he doesn't have the right to go fishing either."
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.864,1044.001,"Well, all right, so you do say that it is a special treatment, that the Act does give him special treatment."
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1044.001,1047.553,It requires the employer to treat his absences differently.
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.553,1056.809,The statute is not satisfied by treating the reservist like everyone else?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1056.809,1059.861,Not satisfied by treating his absences like other absences.
1980.80-298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1066.95,1073.287,Is it fundamentally different from the situation of a man who's gone to Korea or Vietnam or wherever?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1082.293,1084.578,"No, that's the precise analogy."
1980.80-298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.017,1096.183,There's no argument about that.
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1103.937,1113.127,"What if this statute had been in effect at the time of the Korean War when, let's say, someone like Ted Williams was called back into the service?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1123.767,1124.484,--Clearly not.
1980.80-298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1147.764,1149.466,"Mr. Horowitz, is there any--"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1149.466,1151.068,"Excuse me, Justice Blackmun."
1980.80-298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1153.435,1157.822,"--Is there any union presence in this case, in the background?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1157.822,1161.84,"Well, there's no official union presence."
1980.80-298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1183.622,1185.839,Maybe I should ask my question of your opposition.
1980.80-298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1185.839,1191.11,Wouldn't... can I assume that Standard Oil has a union?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1191.11,1193.895,That Standard Oil is unionized?
1980.80-298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1193.895,1194.762,Yes.
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1194.762,1196.53,I think we can assume that; yes.
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1270.494,1299.061,"Mr. Horowitz, supposing that this man had a two-week summer duty and when he came back from it he gets paid so much for being in the reserves, he couldn't claim the complete wages that he would have received, but he made a claim against the employer for the difference between what he got paid by the Government for his reserve duty and what he would have made had he stayed at the plant and worked?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1299.061,1305.917,"We said in our brief, there is no basis for such a claim, unless there is some other employment benefit I'm not aware of."
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1324.813,1336.271,"And if it's seasonal employment and his reserve duty occurs during the season, he has no claim?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1341.507,1345.226,I'm not sure exactly what situation you're talking about.
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1459.233,1483.45,"What if the rule were that there's a one-month vacation for all employees, and the vacation for A-to-M employees is July and the vacation for N-to-Z employees is August, and some have scheduled, say, refresher teaching courses, some have scheduled vacations with their families, some have scheduled any number of things."
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1495.925,1502.412,"You're suggesting this one month reserve duty falls in July, for example, and that's when he's scheduled for vacation?"
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1502.412,1503.095,Yes.
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1503.095,1512.284,I'm not sure what employment benefit he's being denied if his reserve duty comes out on his vacation.
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1517.771,1524.777,"Well, supposing his reserve duty comes in August, and he wants a vacation, but he's also a member of the reserves?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1524.777,1532.614,"Well, he can't... well, let me backtrack."
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1533.248,1534.766,You wouldn't regard the reserve duty as vacation?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1534.766,1546.274,"--That doesn't even really raise the issue, I think, that's presented here, because Section 2024(d) guarantees him a leave of absence and guarantees that he can come back with his vacation intact."
1980.80-298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1546.274,1549.225,But it doesn't guarantee that he will be paid during that time?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1549.225,1551.444,"No, that's right; it doesn't guarantee that he'll be paid."
1980.80-298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.563,1562.133,"Well, your question would be comparable if he wanted to work during August when they scheduled him for vacation, and he had to go to the reserves in July."
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1571.139,1574.275,"All right, assuming that it can be accommodated, now--"
1980.80-298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.275,1577.127,And how do you tell whether it can be accommodated?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1581.781,1582.564,"--Well, I think that's right."
1980.80-298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.236,1599.592,"But isn't it true, as Justice White suggests, that the statute is therefore giving him something no other employee has?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1599.592,1599.958,Right.
1980.80-298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1599.958,1604.829,He's got a right to some kind of special consideration at the time the work schedule is prepared?
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1604.829,1608.014,He just has a right to the same benefit--
1980.80-298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.014,1620.756,"I'm saying that he's the only one in the store who can say, I want to take my vacation in July, or I'm the only one in the store who says, even though my name begins with A, I want to have my first and third with the N?"
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1620.756,1624.041,--He can't say that I want to have my first and third... the same as any other employee.
1980.80-298,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1633.915,1636.7,"He says it's not that he wants to have, he's entitled to have; that's your argument."
1980.80-298,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1636.7,1641.752,Congress has guaranteed him these employment benefits to the extent that if they can be accommodated.
1980.80-298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1644.204,1651.543,Very well.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1657.864,1661.832,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1759.062,1762.431,"Mr. McAuliffe, could I interrupt with a question, because it affects the argument right here?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1793.167,1800.973,"Well, first, in response to the first part of your question, this schedule itself is set forth in the joint appendix and was part of the stipulation, and you can--"
1980.80-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1800.973,1803.591,Is this the one at page 29?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1803.591,1805.324,--Pages 29 through 39.
1980.80-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1806.293,1806.76,"Oh, I see."
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1806.76,1813.03,"--If you go through the rotation scheme in there, you will find it works out on the average to seven weekends off per year."
1980.80-298,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1833.444,1834.128,But against his will?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1834.128,1836.313,--That's correct.
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1837.196,1841.484,"All voluntary trades have been exhausted in this case, haven't they?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1841.484,1843.184,"--That's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1980.80-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1854.041,1856.809,He can change... I still don't think you've answered my question.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1875.521,1881.609,"Given the facts we have in this case, that could be done, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.80-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.128,1910.211,"Right, and you may have more than one service too."
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1910.211,1915.598,So you might be able to accomplish it by juggling the days around.
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.932,1922.252,Which would mean other employees would have to work fewer weekend days?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1922.252,1926.454,"--No, no, I wasn't suggesting that at all."
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.454,1946.2,"Well, if he works more weekend days than would be normal and the company only needs a total of X weekend days, I'm not saying that other employees wouldn't welcome the opportunity to work fewer weekend days?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1946.2,1951.771,"Mr. Justice White, I do not mean to say he'd be working more days."
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.204,1958.258,"There might be two in January and none in February, instead of one in each month?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1958.258,1965.995,"The total number during the course of the year could be set up so that the number of days, enough days, would be the same."
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1966.614,1974.701,But in your admissions you say that the defendant took no steps to provide plaintiff with substituted work hours.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1982.355,1984.39,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.39,1990.211,"Do you think that's in keeping with the statute, to, make no effort?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,1990.211,1998.632,I think it's in keeping with the statute when you look at the provisions of the statute and at the workplaces of this facility.
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2008.772,2009.372,"This is the admission,"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2018.695,2020.813,"--That's correct, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2020.813,2021.863,And no means no.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2021.863,2025.115,And we contend that that--
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2025.115,2028.936,Did you even ask if somebody wanted to take this man's place?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2028.936,2039.109,--The steps that were taken were the steps taken under the collective bargaining agreement calling for voluntary exchanges.
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.394,2049.082,"Well, under the collective agreement the man has to take the steps, the worker has to make the steps."
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2049.082,2050.216,"Yes, that's correct."
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2050.216,2052.451,So it still means that the defendant did nothing.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2052.451,2057.086,"That's true, Mr. Justice Marshall, and we contend that there was no obligation."
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2057.086,2062.14,"And I would assume, I could assume there were ten million people waiting there to do it, if they'd just ask."
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2062.14,2066.442,I missed... I'm sorry.
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2066.442,2068.644,"Well, you can't dispute it."
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2068.644,2072.782,"I mean, that word ""no"" is awfully--"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2072.782,2088.374,What we see at issue in this case is the problem of reconciling the problems of somebody who is in effect holding two different jobs.
1980.80-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2100.782,2110.538,"Are you suggesting that a reservist in this setting is just like some fellow who is moonlighting, working for a Seven-Eleven store or?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2110.538,2113.49,"Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2113.49,2116.858,"Congress singled out this one category of people, didn't it?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2116.858,2123.679,Congress has and Congress has enacted very specific accommodation requirements that--
1980.80-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2123.679,2127.714,"They did that to encourage people to go into the military reserve, did they not?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2130.85,2132.635,"--I assume that they did, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.635,2133.118,You assume it.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2134.986,2135.603,"No, I don't think so."
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.961,2147.461,And you suggest that this isn't one of them?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2147.461,2149.394,"That's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.182,2195.208,"Well, Mr. McAuliffe, when you grant him a leave of absence, which you agree you have to do without firing him... he can be away from work, and he won't be paid under your submission, but he can't be fired for being away?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2195.208,2197.025,"That's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.025,2198.31,"Well, what do you do when he's away?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2198.31,2200.394,When he is away?
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.394,2203.179,Under your position.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2209.451,2214.319,"While he's away, you fill the job on a temporary basis and that can be done--"
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.319,2214.853,How do you do it?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2219.307,2221.675,--There are two methods that were used at this workplace.
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.221,2241.671,And you're paying him but not the fellow who's away?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2241.671,2242.173,--That's correct.
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.961,2252.378,And that would cost you money?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2252.378,2254.813,That would cost premium pay; time and a half.
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.765,2292.152,"So, you have a way of it not costing you any money to accommodate yourself to the leave of absence?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2299.175,2300.225,That's correct.
1980.80-298,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2305.746,2325.659,"But in any event, Mr. McAuliffe, as I understand your submission, it is that all that Congress required you to do was (a) let him have a leave of absence, and (b) on his return give him what the statute expressly identifies, namely, restore seniority, status, pay, and vacation."
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2329.444,2337.031,"Well, that's correct, Mr. Justice Brennan, because the right to seniority that is protected is a very broad right."
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.031,2340.067,"Yes, I know, you have to... but that isn't involved here?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2340.067,2341.769,There's no contention here.
1980.80-298,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2341.769,2346.489,"He comes back with the same seniority as if he'd not taken a leave of absence, under the statute, doesn't he?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2346.489,2347.739,"Yes, that's correct, and--"
1980.80-298,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2347.739,2353.31,"Incidentally, that's the same wording that's appeared in some of these veterans return statutes."
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2353.31,2369.569,"--The wording is precisely the same with one difference, and that is that provisions relating to reservists also use the word ""vacation"", because there's a specific protection for the reservist that he cannot be charged any vacation time--"
1980.80-298,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2369.569,2380.21,"Well, my question was going to be, haven't we had some of our cases under the veterans return statutes that have interpreted this wording a little more broadly than you submit?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2383.846,2384.429,--I don't believe so.
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2453.84,2458.477,And the Court of Appeals said that all that was required was that he be treated exactly like everybody else.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2458.477,2459.61,That's correct.
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.61,2461.512,That's what they said over and over again.
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2461.512,2463.798,"Well, for this purpose; for this particular purpose."
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2467.0,2484.212,"No, the Court of Appeals, the passage which Mr. Justice Marshall was reciting refers to the version of the statute upon which the Government relies, and the Court of Appeals reads that as requiring neutral treatment."
1980.80-298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2484.212,2492.299,Why did Congress pass the most recent amendment to the Veterans Reemployment Act?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2492.299,2509.243,"Congress passed this because when they first enacted the reinstatement protection for reservist in 1960 they left a gap in protection, when you compare that to the protection they had already provided for the regular military."
1980.80-298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.212,2594.433,"Dumped, in effect, after a pro forma compliance with the statute?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2594.433,2595.133,That's correct.
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.062,2645.116,"If you must do what the Government says, I take it you'll be doing more than the collective bargaining agreement calls for?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2645.116,2647.234,"That's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1980.80-298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.234,2651.186,But would it violate the collective bargaining agreement for you to do what the Government says?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2651.186,2656.757,I think the best answer I can give you to that question is that it probably would and I answer--
1980.80-298,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2656.757,2658.876,At least the union will probably say so.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2658.876,2666.696,--The facts are that the scheduling practice that has been followed under the agreement is the one that's set forth in the record.
1980.80-298,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2681.622,2683.872,And is the union in here?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2683.872,2684.622,"--Yes, sir."
1980.80-298,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2688.574,2690.359,"No, but is the union in the litigation?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2692.276,0.0,"--No, they are not."
1980.80-298,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2693.492,2694.976,They're not very concerned about it then?
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2694.976,2697.076,It's in all the findings.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2697.076,2701.713,"--Well, there is... the union is not a party to this litigation."
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2701.713,2703.13,"Not a party, but it's in the findings."
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2703.13,2706.248,I suspect that--
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2706.248,2719.174,"Well, if you paid a union worker a single salary for a double salary job, wouldn't it be a violation of the union contract?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2719.174,2720.807,--It certainly would be.
1980.80-298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2720.807,2721.793,I should think so.
1980.80-298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2724.578,2743.54,"Well, couldn't the company have at least undertaken on its own to have solicited other employees to see if they wanted to take this man's place while he was at camp, rather than leaving it totally up to him?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2743.54,2747.509,It could have been done.
1980.80-298,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2770.94,2777.796,"Mr. McAuliffe, does the record show how many persons are employed at the Lima plant?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2777.796,2785.8,"At the time in question, approximately, I think it's 561 employees at this time."
1980.80-298,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2785.8,2790.521,Does it show how many reservists are employed?
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2790.521,2798.175,The record is silent on that question other than to note this one petitioner involved is a member of the reserves.
1980.80-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2798.175,2811.434,"If it had been 100, for example, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that someone would put that in evidence as distinguished from five or ten?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2811.434,2814.284,"Yes, it certainly would be."
1980.80-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2814.284,2820.956,"To try to accommodate 100 reservists would be perhaps a bit of a problem, wouldn't it?"
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2820.956,2831.912,"Well, you run into the answer I gave to Mr. Justice Stevens before, what will work in the case of one employee won't work as you get, get more and more, perhaps, more and more employees involved."
1980.80-298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2841.703,2842.853,Excuse me.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2844.769,2845.053,"--Yes, sir."
1980.80-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2845.053,2846.555,I was just going to ask you this one question.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2857.863,2860.413,"No, I do not, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.80-298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2860.413,2863.065,Seems to me your position really is inconsistent with the 5th Circuit's holding.
1980.80-298,1,38179,paul_s_mcauliffe,,2863.065,2872.171,I think the 5th Circuit holding was incorrect and also that the logic that it followed in getting to that holding was incorrect.
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3102.419,3103.569,I have a couple of points.
1980.80-298,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3103.569,3116.579,"Mr. Horowitz, the Government's position is that only reasonable efforts to accommodate the needs of a reservist are required under the statute."
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3140.444,3141.677,That's correct.
1980.80-298,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3158.006,3163.524,"Well, it seems to me your argument as suggested by my brother Powell is a little bit inconsistent with the statute."
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3169.528,3172.214,"--No, the statute imposed a duty on the employer."
1980.80-298,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3172.214,3173.916,--It seems to give absolute entitlements.
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3173.916,3175.349,An absolute duty; that's right.
1980.80-298,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3175.349,3178.652,And therefore the requirement is an absolute duty.
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3178.652,3179.785,There's an absolute duty.
1980.80-298,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3179.785,3182.737,If the statute means what you say it means.
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3182.737,3191.843,"Well, in another portion of the statute the Congress made clear in 2021(a) that it did not require the employer to take unreasonable measures."
1980.80-298,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3193.976,3195.628,"Well, no, it doesn't--"
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3197.997,3198.53,This is at the end.
1980.80-298,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3216.541,3231.568,"But here, if the petitioner is entitled to 40 hours a week, he's entitled to 40 hours a week, and not entitled simply to his employer's making reasonable efforts to see to it that he has 40 hours."
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3231.568,3234.086,"--He's entitled to 40 hours a week, to work 40 hours a week."
1980.80-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3239.074,3243.276,Is there anybody else in that plant entitled to 40 hours a week?
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3243.276,3244.978,Everybody's entitled to 40 hours a week.
1980.80-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3244.978,3249.263,"Well, it isn't impossible, it isn't impossible to give him his 40 hours."
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3249.263,3251.215,"Not in this case, it's not impossible."
1980.80-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.215,3253.432,"Well, I know, but it wouldn't be in any case, would it?"
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3253.432,3254.417,"Sure, it's impossible--"
1980.80-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3254.417,3257.119,All the employer would have to do is to pay overtime.
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3257.119,3262.939,"--No, if he's gone for the whole week, it's impossible to schedule him to work 40 hours during that week."
1980.80-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3262.939,3266.391,"I know, but if he's gone on weekends, you can assign somebody else to work for him."
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3271.093,3276.497,"But that's not giving him... the employment benefit is the right to work, not the right to be paid for not working."
1980.80-298,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.834,3286.721,"So, he has the right to work 40 hours and not just the right to a leave?"
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3286.721,3288.088,That's right.
1980.80-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3324.511,3333.349,"Aren't you yourself, as my brother Stewart suggested, construing it more narrowly than it's literally written?"
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3333.349,3339.853,--The statute has to be construed in line with what we think Congress's intent would be.
1980.80-298,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3363.786,3365.738,"Mr. Horowitz, may I ask you one question?"
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3387.501,3395.155,"In other words, if he has a two-week vacation with pay, generally, and then he takes these two weeks off on reserve duty."
1980.80-298,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3403.511,3406.213,Let me see if I understand you.
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3415.084,3417.853,Yes; assuming that.
1980.80-298,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3417.853,0.0,"Is a reservist entitled, in addition to that, to take off two additional weeks to fulfill his reserve requirements--"
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3425.774,0.0,Yes.
1980.80-298,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3426.557,3427.49,--Without pay.
1980.80-298,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3427.49,3428.976,"Well, he gets paid as a reservist."
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3428.976,3431.576,Some pay.
1980.80-298,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3431.576,3434.261,"He gets pay on his weekends as a reservist, but not from this--"
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3434.261,3435.88,He doesn't get... it doesn't go; it's not the same pay.
1980.80-298,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3435.88,3437.998,--The result is he may be away a month?
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3437.998,3440.95,"He may be away a total of a month, yes."
1980.80-298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3442.867,3459.078,"Mr. Horiwitz, when Congress enacted this statute and its amendments, did it confide its administration to the Department of Defense or Department of Labor, or did it not confide it to any of the administrative departments?"
1980.80-298,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3459.078,3463.88,"--Well, I mean, the veterans reemployment or the statutes in general are administered by the Department of Labor."
1980.80-298,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3463.88,3466.499,"Thank you, gentlemen."
