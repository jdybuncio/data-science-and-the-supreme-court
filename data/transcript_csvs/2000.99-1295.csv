2000.99-1295,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.239,We will hear argument first this morning on number 99-1295 David A. Gitlitz versus the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,11.8,25.228,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, As a result of the position taken by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on the brief before this Court, the issue the Court needs to decide is a limited one."
2000.99-1295,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,122.016,125.445,"Well, I think your argument under the statute is a strong one."
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,144.124,166.514,"It may well be consistent with the restructuring of the Internal Revenue Code in 1954, in which Congress said very broadly in Section 61 that gross income includes all income from whatever source derived, and listed specific items, some 15 of those, and one of them is income from subsection 12."
2000.99-1295,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,180.438,191.908,"What I am asking is why would Congress allow you to use income that you don't pay tax on, to increase the basis and then which would allow you to deduct additional unrelated losses?"
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,191.908,197.49,"--Well, first of all, because this statute clearly says that--"
2000.99-1295,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.49,199.394,I know that's position number one.
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,201.825,217.49,"--There's a reason for it is that in the final analysis, the basis reflects the shareholder's equity in the corporation, roughly speaking, and the shareholder gets equity in the corporation by contributing capital."
2000.99-1295,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,248.039,264.048,"Mr. Hallett, it seems that the Subchapter S shareholder is the only solvent entity who could take advantage of this."
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,305.595,317.439,"I think what... they clearly did that in 1984 when the Congress said that in the case of an S corporation, the amount is excluded if there's insolvency at the corporation level."
2000.99-1295,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.932,364.537,"But it wasn't that way up until... and yet, in 1982... well, let me put it this way, Do you recognize that if the 1982 law was still in place, the government should win?"
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,364.537,372.146,"Well, it would depend on whether or not my clients the shareholders were insolvent."
2000.99-1295,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,377.769,384.252,"Yes, but in this case where we have very solvent shareholders and an insolvent Subchapter S corporation."
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,384.252,396.99,"This particular case, if the law would have remained as it was in 1982, then if the shareholder were solvent he would not be able to exclude the amount from gross income."
2000.99-1295,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.99,401.981,So it was the change in '84?
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,401.981,404.037,It was a change in 1984.
2000.99-1295,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,404.037,419.136,"And so we would look to a reason for that change if we are trying to understand, as Justice Kennedy asked, whether there might be something other than the words of the statute going for the position you are taking?"
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,419.136,420.347,That is true.
2000.99-1295,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.706,450.301,"Mr. Hallett, is it invariably the case that this comes as a windfall to the solvent shareholder?"
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,457.0,463.971,"Well, it's not the case that it's a windfall."
2000.99-1295,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.067,470.979,Accept my characterization of it as a windfall.
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,485.591,500.18,"Well, certainly if you view a benefit excluding the debt discharge amount from gross income, then if the attribute deduction provisions come into play, you could view that as a recapture of the benefit in the future."
2000.99-1295,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.18,506.903,"Well, suppose the corporation suddenly becomes solvent, its business picks up or in some new sort of business."
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,527.697,528.36,That's correct.
2000.99-1295,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.36,543.33,"So there, to answer Justice Scalia's question, there might be, I think there might be some instances in which this distortion, if we can call it that, or windfall, does even itself out?"
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,543.33,544.468,That's correct.
2000.99-1295,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,561.001,566.519,"So it isn't always a windfall or distortion, accepting those characterizations?"
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,566.519,567.841,It's not always a windfall.
2000.99-1295,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,567.841,570.838,And I guess this was in Justice Kennedy's question.
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,581.756,583.285,That's correct.
2000.99-1295,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.285,591.006,"Going back to your very initial point about Section 108, if Section 108 had read,"
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,599.882,608.118,"Well, I don't think so because it... it would still presuppose that the item is income."
2000.99-1295,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,609.305,609.686,No.
2000.99-1295,0,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,615.731,616.702,--Yes.
2000.99-1295,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1657.521,1661.947,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2000.99-1295,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1695.062,1715.337,"Mr. Jones, would you clarify whether you are indeed walking away from the rationale of the Tenth Circuit which was not about the characterization of this as income, but was a timing question, as I understand it."
2000.99-1295,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1715.337,1724.462,"The timing question, we don't think the timing question ever arises in this case, nor has it ever properly arisen in any of the other cases."
2000.99-1295,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1724.462,1730.666,But you did argue the theory that the Tenth Circuit accepted; you argued it in the Court of Appeals.
2000.99-1295,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1730.666,1734.701,"Actually, I believe the Tenth Circuit developed that theory on its own."
2000.99-1295,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1770.288,1785.403,"To put Justice Ginsburg's question another way, if you do not prevail on your argument that it's not income, I take it you don't ask us to accept a backup position that reflects the view of the Circuit on timing."
2000.99-1295,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1785.403,1800.023,"If the Court were to disagree with our basic contentions, then you would be faced with a problem... then as a Court the problem would be that you have the clear history of the statute that says this is not to be treated as income."
2000.99-1295,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1811.249,1812.403,"No, we don't think it's a problem."
2000.99-1295,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1829.701,1847.577,"It is an appropriate resolution of the problem if you reach it, and the reason that is so, is that 1336(d)(2) requires the losses, the suspended losses from the prior year, to be brought into the corporation in the year of the discharge."
2000.99-1295,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1849.037,1851.761,1336 or 66?
2000.99-1295,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1851.761,1853.938,--1366(d)(2).
2000.99-1295,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1853.938,1858.889,"Now Mr. Jones, we've got some 20 pages in the appendix of statutory sections."
2000.99-1295,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1863.378,1885.042,On Page 53 of the petition appendix.
2000.99-1295,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1911.09,1923.101,"But Mr. Jones, isn't that antithetical to the... is it in 1017 the general timing rule that you take this in the next year, not in the year of the--"
2000.99-1295,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1923.101,1925.19,--It is a different treatment of suspended losses.
2000.99-1295,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1950.255,1962.196,"--If you think that the timing rule is changed here, it's surprising that you didn't make any suggestion of that in your brief."
2000.99-1295,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1962.196,2005.096,"Well, I think that it's... I wouldn't call it a fall back argument but I would call it not a correct way to analyze the basic problem that we have in this case, which is that the courts have glossed over the question of whether this has ever been regarded as an item of income, and in particular whether Congress intended it to be treated as such, when the history of the statute says as clearly as it could that Congress accepted the 80 year old position of the Treasury and the judicial insolvency exception, did not regard this as an item of income, said that it was to be applied to reduce tax attributes and then in the words of both the House and Senate reports, has no further tax consequences."
2000.99-1295,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2005.096,2010.911,Let me see if I can get you to focus precisely on the point I'm trying to understand.
2000.99-1295,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2038.455,2041.454,I think it... I wouldn't quite put it that way.
2000.99-1295,2,21016,darrell_d_hallett,,3501.891,3511.581,"With respect to Victor and Eustice Treatise, what it actually says is that COD income of an insolvent debtor is not gross income."
2000.99-1295,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3620.042,3624.042,"Thank you, Mr. Hallett. The case is submitted."
