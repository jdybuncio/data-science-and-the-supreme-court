1993.92-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.772,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-1292, Luther R. Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.--"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,11.689,15.01,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1292,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,60.705,62.24,How do you define parody?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,62.24,66.942,A parody imitates and ridicules.
1993.92-1292,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,71.476,73.512,So it has to poke fun at the original work.
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,73.512,74.428,--Not necessarily.
1993.92-1292,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,90.605,100.663,"So that any time someone takes a melodic line and substitutes new lyrics, that is permitted so long as it is making fun of something else in society."
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,100.663,110.934,"As long as... yes, Justice Kennedy, as long as it is making fun of something else in society or the original, because that is the purpose of parody."
1993.92-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.934,115.802,"Well, Mr. Rogow, that's a little broader than it needs to be, isn't it, for this case?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,115.802,116.552,For this case--
1993.92-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.552,120.004,Don't we have a situation here where it's making fun of the original?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,120.004,121.52,"--We do, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.539,134.43,"And I would have thought that maybe Harper & Row, the case we had here a few years ago, refused to recognize a fair use exception even for political commentary."
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,149.606,151.022,--Justice--
1993.92-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.022,152.891,I mean that's... that's a pretty big step to take.
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,152.891,159.211,"--Justice O'Connor, for this case it is true that the parody in this case only poked fun at the original."
1993.92-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.641,194.016,"So it's your position that a parody should be found to be a fair use when it... when the lyrics poke fun at the original, but the music is the same?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,194.016,195.301,One... yes.
1993.92-1292,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.14,248.984,"Mr. Rogow, could you explain to me why... why criticism either of the original song or, as your position states, of almost anything using the original song, is to be encouraged more than, let's say, patriotism?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,258.457,270.265,"It is, although one can encourage patriotism without necessarily borrowing the music from another tune, although historically we have borrowed from other tunes to have patriotic songs."
1993.92-1292,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,270.265,275.717,"Well, but one can criticize other things without borrowing the music from a tune."
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,284.255,287.79,For this case I can limit it to exactly these facts.
1993.92-1292,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.79,294.127,And so are... but let's assume the more general proposition that you were trying to establish.
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,295.677,312.37,"That as long as the parody is commenting critically upon society, be it cultural, be it social... the social aspect of society, be it political, the use of the tune would still fall within the definition of criticism, which has to have some breathing room."
1993.92-1292,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.37,315.572,But why encourage... you can criticize society in many ways.
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,326.278,331.415,Because sometimes taking that tune conveys to the listener something extra.
1993.92-1292,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.95,335.217,My tune is very effective.
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,340.853,344.721,"--But the tune... Justice Scalia, the tune can go with the parody."
1993.92-1292,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.32,371.72,Is patriotism useful?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,371.72,384.778,"Yes, it is useful, but pure patriotism without making the political comment, critical comment, is not embraced within 107, although I'm not saying it isn't something worthwhile of protection."
1993.92-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.241,412.261,"Well, certainly the copyright states suggest that there's a strong public interest in protecting the copyright holder."
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,420.034,424.086,"--It is a mixed interest, really, on the copyright holder's side."
1993.92-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.566,446.316,"Yeah, I don't... I don't doubt for a minute what you say the statute says."
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,461.278,463.461,"I agree, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,477.22,487.159,"Mr. Rogow, you started out by defining parody, and that first step, I think the Sixth Circuit, even if grudgingly, took and said, yes, this falls within parody."
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,493.713,496.213,"--I'm not, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,496.213,505.169,"So what in the... since the Fifth Circuit... the Sixth Circuit agreed with you that we are dealing here with parody, where did the Sixth Circuit go wrong?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,505.169,512.174,"By applying a presumption that if it is a commercial parody, then it is presumptively harmful to the market."
1993.92-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,516.792,519.578,But there's language in our cases that say exactly that.
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,533.338,535.004,"That is our position, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,535.004,537.24,"Now, what is the market that we should look at."
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,549.681,558.787,"You... that is what you look at, Justice O'Connor; would it supplant the demand for the original work in many or... or multiple venues, not just a single venue?"
1993.92-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,569.594,573.379,And what were the findings of the district court as to that in this case?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,573.379,576.414,That it did not adversely effect the market.
1993.92-1292,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,581.366,581.985,Did--
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,585.37,586.153,It did not.
1993.92-1292,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,599.178,601.044,So does this mean that parody cannot be too successful?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,601.044,601.761,--No.
1993.92-1292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,612.751,614.084,But just the market--
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,638.449,642.001,"Justice Souter, I don't have any difficulty with a broad definition of the market."
1993.92-1292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,670.921,672.921,May I just interrupt you though before you get to the four factors?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,685.228,688.513,--This case was decided on summary judgment on the affidavits.
1993.92-1292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,688.513,688.863,"Oh, that's right, yes."
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,688.863,690.363,On the affidavits that were submitted.
1993.92-1292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,690.363,692.279,So there was nothing in the affidavits on which that could have been based.
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,692.279,696.267,There was nothing in the affidavits from Acuff-Rose which created a genuine issue as to material fact--
1993.92-1292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,696.267,696.417,Material fact.
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,696.417,698.517,--About impairment of their market.
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,749.363,758.302,"Mr. Rogow, I take it from what you said that you would suspend the commercial aspect of it, if we're going down this list of factors, and kind of fold that into the last factor?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,772.394,775.096,"Justice Ginsburg, it... it has both."
1993.92-1292,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,866.868,873.538,"Have we ever said that that's not just the single most important factor, but the absolutely determinative factor?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,873.538,876.14,"You have not in the two cases, Sony and Harper & Row."
1993.92-1292,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.14,887.781,Then how can you... then how can you assert that... that the summary judgment question was automatically determined if there was not enough evidence on that one factor?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,891.566,893.518,"You're right, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1292,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.207,905.673,I understand.
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,916.931,918.614,"No, that alone cannot be."
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,938.025,939.408,Was there cross-motions for summary judgment?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,939.408,940.293,--They were not.
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,959.254,968.194,"Well, why... why was it appropriate not to afford an opportunity to have that issue developed at trial?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,968.194,979.585,"--Because Acuff-Rose failed to put forward any evidence in affidavit form that created a genuine issue as to material fact on the important factors: parody, number one."
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,985.905,989.79,"Well, let's concentrate on this last factor which, under your analysis, is the most critical."
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,997.212,1007.485,"Only if the party opposing the motion for summary judgment had put in affidavits which were sufficient to create a genuine issue as to material doubt on that fact, but they were not put in."
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1016.09,1020.792,Wasn't there... wasn't there a suggestion that the copyright holder might want to exploit... exploit a rap market?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1020.792,1038.002,"At page 321 of the Joint Appendix there is an affidavit that was filed after the judgment was entered, although the district judge allowed the record to be supplemented, of Mr. Flowers who is a licensing agent for Acuff-Rose."
1993.92-1292,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.167,1076.896,"Mr. Rogow, my problem is this; I don't see how your... one is entitled to summary judgment if the legal issue in the case is to be decided by a six factor test, if the other party happens to have produced no evidence on one of the six factors?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1087.269,1100.327,"Justice Scalia, this Court has said that fair use is a mixed question of fact and law, and on the record in this case what we have is no evidence on any of the four factors that created genuine issues as to material fact."
1993.92-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1116.939,1117.989,Is fair use an affirmative defense?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1117.989,1118.74,It is.
1993.92-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1118.74,1126.561,"So the burden of negating fair use in a motion for summary judgment, then, is on the person claiming the fair use?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1126.561,1133.417,The ultimate burden is to show fair use as the affirmative defense as these factors unfold.
1993.92-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1174.911,1177.494,"And what is the presumption you're talking about, the bubble bursting?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1177.494,1185.481,"The presumption is what the Sixth Circuit relied upon, language drawn from this Court's cases in Harper & Row, that there is a presumption of harm."
1993.92-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1185.481,1185.848,That's not--
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1185.848,1186.181,That's right.
1993.92-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1199.37,1204.94,"--Well, it seems to me if your view prevails, the judgment of the Sixth Circuit ought to be reversed."
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1215.545,1219.263,"--And that burden was met, Mr. Chief Justice, by our affidavits."
1993.92-1292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1234.34,1237.475,"Mr. Rogow, I'm... there's something I may not understand."
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1258.304,1271.362,My client's duty in raising the affirmative defense was to put on evidence that a reasonable person or jury could listen to and believe and conclude there was no material impairment of the market.
1993.92-1292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1277.814,1289.855,"But the market to which you... you referred, I take it, in your affidavits, was simply the market for the original song in the... in the fashion, the genre in which it was originally recorded, right?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1289.855,1290.824,"That is correct, Justice Souter."
1993.92-1292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1290.824,1295.091,"It didn't address the question of a market for derivative works at all, is that correct?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1295.091,1296.007,It did not.
1993.92-1292,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1304.344,1312.998,"Well, it may not have created a genuine issue, but it still, on the ultimate legal question, left a relevant point black, didn't it?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1312.998,1323.321,"--But if... but if there is no attempt by the plaintiff, really, to fill in that blank and to make that a disputed issue of fact, then the district court could give summary judgment."
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1323.321,1331.975,The plaintiff opposed summary judgment and I'm not clear now on your position about whose burden this fourth factor is.
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1345.335,1346.435,"I am, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1356.457,1361.694,"And what was... what was your evidence with respect to the derivative market, to rap works?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1361.694,1368.931,--There was nothing that specifically addressed a derivative market for rap works.
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1369.614,1373.502,Suppose there would be another rap version of this composition.
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1376.954,1379.906,--Not if it was not a parody.
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1390.011,1401.819,"Different lyrics, some variation in the musical presentation, whose copyright... would that infringe anyone's copyright at this stage, suppose there were another version?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1401.819,1405.854,--It would make out a prima facie case for the plaintiff of copyright infringement.
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1408.056,1408.873,Which plaintiff?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1427.085,1427.601,--Of the parody.
1993.92-1292,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1440.456,1445.177,Does Campbell have a copyright in the parody?
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1445.177,1451.248,"--He has a copyright on the album, which would include, presumably, the parody."
1993.92-1292,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1451.248,1473.196,"Is the underlying theory of your case that if there is a market to be exploited, in this case 280,000 copies, and it can be exploited best through a parody, that it is essentially fair that the person who creates the parody receives 100 percent of the profit?"
1993.92-1292,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1473.196,1474.029,No.
1993.92-1292,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1513.653,1517.205,"Thank you, Mr. Rogow."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1518.974,1524.509,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1579.06,1580.761,"That was in dictum, wasn't it?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1581.678,1586.248,"That was in dictum in... yes, it was in dictum in each of the cases."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1706.836,1711.038,"Well, we do have... we do take this case on the assumption on that there was a parody."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1711.038,1711.721,And I'm accepting that.
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1711.721,1712.504,You dispute that.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1716.022,1717.056,"I want to leave with that, yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1717.056,1717.439,Yes.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1717.439,1722.36,But they took the music not just for parody.
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1775.523,1779.975,"Well, now, just let's stop a moment and inquire."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1797.2,1797.769,--Yes.
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1797.769,1798.769,It's perfectly commercial.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1798.769,1800.019,"Yes, it can be a fair use."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1800.019,1806.173,"They have to rely, in part, on what was said in the original that he's... he's criticizing and writing about."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1806.173,1806.756,"Right, but in the... correct."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1814.143,1818.231,And the market might be quite different for the critical work.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1820.647,1821.397,--Yes.
1993.92-1292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1831.669,1832.169,"Wait a minute, I didn't quite get it."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1833.253,1837.073,"The Salinger letters case, the Second Circuit in the Southern District."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.128,1876.365,"Well, that sounds like... that sounds like an argument that it shouldn't have been held to be a parody because too much was taken, and I thought we had gotten over that."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1876.365,1878.65,"--No, we... well, if that's, Your Honor."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1878.65,1881.686,I thought we had accepted the fact that this was a parody.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1881.686,1884.519,"Your Honor, you can have a parody that takes too much."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1914.971,1920.041,Why isn't... why isn't a parody of the whole thing more persuasive than just a few phrases?
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,1928.231,1933.033,"--That's because, Your Honor, I think we have to go back and do some balancing."
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.653,2045.503,"They did, of course, offer to pay for it, didn't they?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2045.503,2046.036,Yes.
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.036,2048.788,So to the... and why didn't you accept the offer?
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2048.788,2052.592,"Your Honor, we did not think that was the best vehicle for exploiting the market."
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.592,2056.293,"You really wanted to prevent this... you really wanted to prevent this music from being distributed at all, as I understand the complaint."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2056.293,2061.161,"Your Honor, my client... as part of the... as part of the marketability of the copyrighted work, you have to have the right to say no."
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.161,2061.911,I understand.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2061.911,2068.351,"And if it is not a fair use, we had a right to say no, that this wasn't the way to best exploit the rap market."
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2068.351,2072.219,"If you prevail... if you prevail, would it be an adequate remedy to just give you royalties for the amount of their sales?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2072.219,2077.623,"Your Honor, I think that would be creating a kind of compulsory license which doesn't exist in this case."
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2077.623,2092.882,"Mr. Rosdeitcher, you... you cited Judge LaValle, and you that's an idea that he put forward, that it... even if this were found to be taking too much and therefore an infringement, it doesn't follow like the night the day that you would be entitled to stop it, does it?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2092.882,2094.317,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2094.317,2108.892,"It doesn't follow from the fact... even if a court held that this parody took too much and that, looking at the four factors, you win and you establish infringement."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2130.675,2136.162,"Your Honor, I'd be... I'd be very reluctant to follow down... follow Judge LaValle all the way down that path for this reason."
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2139.114,2141.314,You take the sweet but not the bitter from him.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2141.314,2141.731,--Yes.
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.732,2146.701,And why is that so?
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2146.701,2147.617,And that is because--
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2147.617,2148.553,Why do you find his thinking--
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2148.553,2149.803,--The reason... I'm sorry.
1993.92-1292,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.525,2186.059,"--Mr. Rosdeitcher, I assume you would have given a license if they had offered you enough money for it."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2189.844,2191.094,That's entirely possible.
1993.92-1292,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.094,2194.563,--Willing to pay you enough to induce you to give over the song to that use.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2194.563,2195.748,That is entirely possible.
1993.92-1292,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.7,2205.187,"Now we're talking money here, and they didn't give you what you thought was enough to make that worthwhile, so--"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2205.187,2205.854,Yes.
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.854,2208.388,"--I thought the record was otherwise, that you gave them a flat no, you weren't--"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2208.388,2209.921,We gave them a flat... we gave them a flat no.
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2210.504,2210.737,--You weren't willing to negotiate.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2210.737,2216.408,--That the fact that in this case my client gave them a flat no doesn't mean that somebody else won't bargain.
1993.92-1292,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2219.193,2223.229,"Nothing in the record shows you knew that they were going to sell 248,000 copies."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2223.229,2229.633,The record... what the record shows... and I think this is helpful to my notion of exploitation of the underlying work.
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.075,2405.109,It seems to me it would have... if they'd been deceptive and had not revealed the true author.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2415.149,2420.786,"Except for this, there's... I won't dwell on this too much, but there is something disingenuous about this letter."
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2433.546,2436.063,"--They attached a check, didn't they, in fact?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2436.063,2436.563,Pardon?
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2436.563,2437.313,Wasn't there a check?
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2437.313,2438.513,Later on.
1993.92-1292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2460.593,2461.11,Wasn't--
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2464.526,2464.71,I'm sorry.
1993.92-1292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.145,2466.412,They did deposit.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2466.895,2470.014,"I'm so used to purported and allegedlies, that I'm--"
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2470.014,2476.084,"Mr. Rosdeitcher, am I wrong in remembering that in one of the cases that you referred to, the Rear Window case."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2476.084,2476.651,--Yes.
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2476.651,2482.155,"Wasn't that a case where there was no injunction, there was damages but no injunction?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2482.155,2484.774,"Your Honor, I just don't recall."
1993.92-1292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2571.212,2579.568,"Mr. Rosdeitcher, in the... I presume there were reviews in various periodicals of the rap version?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2581.918,2584.02,"--The record... unfortunately, the record doesn't show any of that, Your Honor--"
1993.92-1292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2584.02,2590.007,I'd be curious to know whether it was recognized in those reviews as a parody or just another rap or music.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2590.007,2598.613,"--Your Honor, I... if I can go off the record, I originally bought this record when I was in the running for coming onto this case."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2619.076,2625.43,"Well, counsel, do we look to the market for the original work and whether that's supplanted?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2625.43,2625.98,--No.
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2625.98,2628.132,Do you agree that that's what we look to?
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2628.132,2631.834,"No, if you define original work as the original Roy Orbison recording."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2633.301,2634.203,And all its derivatives.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2634.203,2636.553,--And all it's... if you look at all of its derivatives--
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2636.553,2639.237,We don't look at the market for parodies.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2639.237,2640.606,--You look at the market.
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2802.724,2822.619,"Counsel, the district court, it seems to me, found that the 2 Live Crew version was a parody and that Acuff-Rose could still market a rap version, that it wasn't affecting that."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2822.619,2824.221,"Well, he applied the wrong standard."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2860.644,2863.596,"Well, do you think that a commercial use can ever be a fair use?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2863.596,2867.797,"--Yes, some commercial uses can be fair uses."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2868.463,2888.608,"If we think the Sixth Circuit didn't give enough room at the joints, so to speak, for dealing with the commercial nature so that it's a factor, but it isn't the be all and end all, you still have to weigh it, what should we do here, send it back?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2888.608,2890.042,"--No, you should affirm the judgment."
1993.92-1292,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2903.081,2913.27,"Well, I guess we could also say they were... they fell off on putting total stress on the commercial use and we think they ought to take another look."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2913.27,2915.52,"Can I come back to this commercial use now, then."
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2958.929,2962.298,May I ask you one question there about the similarity of the two works and so forth?
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2968.535,2969.118,--Yes.
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.118,2970.785,It did change the melody.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2970.785,2971.57,It changed it--
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.57,2972.453,But it didn't entirely supplant it.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2972.453,2979.724,--It changed it but it... it effected... it created a record which would compete with any rap version we would create.
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2980.843,2987.58,"What would you say if another group used a rap version but didn't change the words at all, but changed it from rock to rap?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,2992.465,2992.815,--Probably.
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.351,3004.036,"But as long as there's a parody element in it, it can't be, is that it?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,3004.036,3005.003,"Well, it could be parody."
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3015.011,3015.494,I understand.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,3020.296,3021.081,--Yes.
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.081,3023.783,And it seems to me... I'm not quite clear on where the line between--
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,3023.783,3025.833,Let me tell you... let me tell you why I think--
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3025.833,3028.318,--Does compulsory license include words or just music?
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,3028.318,3029.251,"--Yes, yes, because the--"
1993.92-1292,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.251,3034.305,"Just changing the words would... would destroy it, whether you changed it to make it a parody or not."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,3037.357,3037.657,--Yes.
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3050.065,3051.481,But it has... but it has to be fundamental change.
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,3051.481,3051.765,Yes.
1993.92-1292,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3052.315,3055.45,"But you can't change... just leave out the ""Oh"" from ""Oh, Pretty Woman"", that wouldn't be enough?"
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,3055.45,3055.969,"--No, no."
1993.92-1292,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3092.058,3093.224,"You didn't ask for it in the district court, did you?"

1993.92-1292,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3238.661,3245.232,"In your example, I think it was Aerosmith progressed or regressed to rap."
1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,3245.232,3245.748,Yes.

1993.92-1292,1,41975,sidney_s_rosdeitcher,,3255.956,3257.606,It could be.
1993.92-1292,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3273.882,3275.182,"Thank you, Mr. Rosdeitcher."

1993.92-1292,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3354.563,3357.599,"You're making money from their music, if he's right about that... about that premise."
1993.92-1292,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3357.599,3359.615,--And there's... there's no reason to think that he is right.
1993.92-1292,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3383.547,3388.618,"You mean it would be a different case if they had packaged this as a separate tape with only the Oh, Pretty Woman on it?"
1993.92-1292,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3388.618,3390.819,Not... not necessarily.
1993.92-1292,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3431.324,3433.859,Don't they simply have to show that there was someone to whom they could license it?
1993.92-1292,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3433.859,3434.977,--And they could--
1993.92-1292,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3434.977,3437.31,So they don't have to have a license holder nearby.
1993.92-1292,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3440.762,3449.368,"--They do need to show, as in Harper & Row v. Nation, that there is some meaningful likelihood that there is someone to whom they would license this."
1993.92-1292,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3451.253,3455.806,"Or you needed to you... I thought you conceded last time around that there wasn't such a thing, that this is your burden."
1993.92-1292,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3462.877,3463.71,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1292,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3484.873,3486.856,Let me ask just one very brief question.
1993.92-1292,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3489.575,3489.841,No.
1993.92-1292,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3489.841,3490.277,You don't.
1993.92-1292,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,3490.277,3490.827,No.
1993.92-1292,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3490.827,3492.243,"Thank you, Mr. Rogow."
