2012.11-1347,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.07,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-1347, Chafin v. Chafin."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,7.137,11.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,61.538,63.673,Why would it make any difference?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,79.683,80.785,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,107.685,109.135,"--Now, I don't understand that."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,110.97,111.404,--Yes.
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,111.404,116.291,So how would these six months be satisfied?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,116.291,121.612,"It would toll because the child, we would argue, is wrongfully in Scotland based upon an errant district court--"
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,121.612,127.164,But you can argue that on the basis of the vacation of the district court's Hague Convention order.
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,135.336,141.907,--Except for the fact that there is an error in the determination of habitual residence.
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,159.485,166.057,But you don't have -- you don't have the individual -- the residence -- habitual residence determination because it's been wiped out.
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,166.057,168.591,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,183.852,184.785,Wouldn't the Alabama--
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,184.785,188.47,What you're saying is the return of the child essentially back to Alabama.
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,188.47,189.839,Bring the child back.
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,190.389,201.212,"And so once the child is back in Alabama, that's the remedy, then the State court would be seized of jurisdiction sufficient then to determine the habitual residence."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,201.212,201.964,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,201.964,207.032,"Whatever the State -- well, presumably the child only comes back if you win."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,207.032,207.551,Yes.
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,207.551,215.972,"So presuming you win, the child would come back, and the Alabama courts could then seize the custody determination."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,215.972,216.29,Right.
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.924,221.709,--And the Alabama court would not have jurisdiction if the child had been wrongfully removed?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,221.709,223.478,--The Alabama--
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.478,224.144,Is that what you're saying?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,224.144,224.578,--No.
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.135,236.218,"Wait, wait, wait."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,238.67,239.453,"--Yes, sir."
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,239.453,247.943,So there's -- there's nothing which says that this child -- this child's habitual residence was -- was in the U.K.--
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,247.943,248.809,"Yes, sir."
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.975,267.287,"--That being the case, the only question is will the Alabama court proceed, even -- assuming that it finds the child's habitual residence was in Alabama, would it proceed even if the child had been taken out of the jurisdiction, and I understand that it would."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,267.287,272.055,"If there never had been a district court determination in the first place, certainly--"
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,272.055,272.924,There hasn't been.
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,275.626,290.017,"--The posture below is that the Eleventh Circuit vacated the opinion in February; but, as recently as July of this year, the Alabama Supreme Court said, well, since the matter was determined moot, then only the divorce can proceed."
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.271,296.04,"Well, that's bad law."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,303.544,304.644,"--Yes, sir."
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,305.412,312.899,Was their reasoning that the child was initially removed properly because there had been an order permitting the mother to go?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,312.899,313.432,--Yes.
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,313.432,315.334,So it was a lawful removal at that moment.
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,315.334,316.703,"At that moment, yes."
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,317.519,325.357,"And what they're saying is, since the case is moot, nothing has vacated the order, but it didn't make her action illegal?"
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,325.357,326.475,--Correct.
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,335.831,350.34,"When you say bring the child back, there's an impediment to that because now this court in Scotland has told her don't -- the child stays here."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,359.53,360.396,--The mother--
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,360.396,367.569,"So if she -- she -- if she -- the mother comes back into the United States, she's committing a criminal offense."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,367.569,369.702,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,381.327,384.329,But what about the order of the court in Scotland?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,384.329,388.8,"--The order of the court in Scotland, we would refer to on a State level as being a standing order."
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,407.761,409.296,It's a stand-still order there.
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,409.296,409.646,Yes.
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,409.646,422.604,"How long has the child been -- now since the return pursuant to the Federal court's order, how long has the child been residing in Scotland?"
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,422.604,426.441,"October 13th of last year, I believe, so approximately 14 months now."
2012.11-1347,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,426.441,430.96,What if the Alabama courts were to conduct a custody proceeding?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,438.482,440.332,The Alabama courts--
2012.11-1347,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,440.332,444.552,"And if they did that, wouldn't they defer to the Scottish courts for custody determination?"
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,444.552,445.852,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think so."
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,463.948,468.835,"Counsel, there is a judgment against your client, isn't there, for $94,000 or so?"
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,468.835,469.668,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,469.668,471.787,Could you break down that figure?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,471.787,485.296,"The lion's share of it is attorney's fees, but, also, within the Hague, there is a mandatory provision for costs; not just costs of court, but the costs of mother's flying over here from Scotland, staying here for approximately a week and a rental car."
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,490.265,490.815,So--
2012.11-1347,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,490.815,497.187,So have the State proceedings been dismissed?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,498.787,501.239,"Neither, Your Honor."
2012.11-1347,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,518.95,525.188,So it would be your position that the Alabama courts still have jurisdiction over the child and the mother?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,525.188,528.306,"Certainly, if the Eleventh Circuit reverses, yes, sir."
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,529.04,538.531,"--Counsel, that cost that you have to pay for the mother, even though the case was mooted, that judgment is still outstanding for the moneys you have to pay?"
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,538.531,539.481,"It still is, Your Honor."
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,539.481,542.733,"If you win on this appeal, is that wiped out?"
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,542.733,544.602,We believe that it is.
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,561.713,563.096,Is that done in a separate judgment?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,563.729,565.998,"--It's a separate order, same case."
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,565.998,573.169,--And is there any problem about the time to appeal from that having run?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,573.169,577.139,"We don't think so, but, again, that's not the thrust of our case."
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,585.412,597.719,"But as far as mootness is concerned, if you have not appealed from that order and the time has run from your appeal, you can't rely on that to avoid mootness."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,597.719,602.171,"Your Honor, I believe I understand your question, and I -- and I think you're correct."
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,611.444,613.829,"Counsel, what's -- what happens--"
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.829,614.346,I don't understand your answer.
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,614.346,615.264,I'm sorry.
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.264,617.264,What is your -- I don't understand that answer.
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,630.358,631.941,"No, sir."
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,632.56,634.376,"Well, that's -- that's what I thought the question was."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,634.376,635.594,--I apologize.
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,646.9,650.152,"Well, then -- then, retain your tunnel vision."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,659.377,665.031,"--We agree with the government's position that it keeps this case alive, and it is not moot."
2012.11-1347,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,669.983,689.496,"Well, if you -- if you could take an appeal and got a reversal of the decision -- of the order removing the child to -- allowing the child to be removed to Scotland, wouldn't that undermine the -- the judgment for costs?"
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,699.935,701.704,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.643,716.714,"Well, I mean, that's lovely, but -- so you are saying that you don't have to appeal that separately; is that what you're saying?"
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,716.714,723.133,"I'm saying I trust that that is the resolution of this; but, again, our focus is on the child, not costs."
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.133,724.735,But you've got to answer my question.
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,724.735,725.135,Yeah.
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.135,728.437,Do you have to appeal that separately or not?
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,745.399,761.908,"Your Honor, I think that it is correct that if the -- the basis for the award is removed, then the award is removed; but, if the basis for the award remains, then it would be difficult to assert that there is some reason to appeal that award."
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.229,768.681,I think you're saying it doesn't have to be appealed separately.
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,768.681,769.514,Yes.
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,771.231,775.168,"--Can you tell me what's happening, what is the status?"
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,784.274,791.012,The Scottish court has no need to determine habitual residence because that was determined by the district court.
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,791.012,796.416,"But that order has been vacated, so can they revisit that question is really the -- the issue."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,796.416,803.252,I don't -- they wouldn't revisit within the context of a Hague proceeding unless a Hague proceeding were brought there.
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,811.591,813.543,"But you could bring a Hague proceeding there, right?"
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,813.543,815.745,We could bring a Hague proceeding there.
2012.11-1347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,815.745,823.082,"You could say, you know, there having been no decision in the United States, we want you to decide what habitual residence is, and we think it's in the United States."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,823.599,824.684,We could do that.
2012.11-1347,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,846.197,852.501,"I thought you said that that time period was tolled, the period that she was in Scotland would be tolled."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,852.501,857.238,"From a United States perspective, more specifically an Alabama perspective, yes."
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,857.905,863.142,"But in Scotland, it's -- it would be a custody proceeding."
2012.11-1347,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,874.582,879.651,"And at the Hague, it's what was it then."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,879.651,880.285,Yes.
2012.11-1347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,898.797,908.854,"But that was only for determining the Hague Convention; and, if the Hague Convention is out of it, then there is a custody proceeding."
2012.11-1347,0,36293,michael_e_manely,,917.193,918.776,--Yes.
2012.11-1347,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,927.382,928.332,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,940.806,944.525,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.037,992.322,But we don't know it'll make a difference without answering those questions.
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,992.322,992.955,"Well, I'm glad--"
2012.11-1347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.955,997.059,"I mean, you want us to -- to say it may make a difference, and that's enough, right?"
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,997.059,1002.63,"--Well, this Court has said that as long as there's any possibility of effectual relief, that the case is not moot."
2012.11-1347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1003.046,1004.246,"Well, you should put it that way, then."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1008.2,1010.084,--That's what I would say is that you don't have to know.
2012.11-1347,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1036.951,1044.29,"Ms. Saharsky, not to -- I mean, the whole object of the Hague Convention is to stop this shuttling the child back and forth."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1077.344,1077.811,Yes.
2012.11-1347,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1096.842,1106.531,"And would you go further and say that if a stay is not in place, that that still does not deprive the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to resolve the case on the merits?"
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1106.531,1107.048,Yes.
2012.11-1347,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1124.825,1137.217,"You agree that the ideal -- the ideal procedure would be, and I quite agree, that you have a very fast track stay pending appeal and an expedited appeal."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1145.839,1163.2,"Well, we think that just under the normal court appellate rules, that that effectively is what happens using the American stay standard for a four factor test; not that there would be a stay in every case, but, when the showing, the appropriate four factor showing is made for a stay, that then a stay would be appropriate, and an expedited appeal would be appropriate."
2012.11-1347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.717,1165.152,"Well, that's lovely, but there wasn't a stay here."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1169.704,1170.64,--That's exactly right.
2012.11-1347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1170.64,1173.19,And do we even know that a stay would have been appropriate here?
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1173.19,1177.627,"Well, the district court denied a stay, and petitioner did not go to the court of appeals, so we don't know--"
2012.11-1347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1177.627,1179.329,So presumably a stay would not have been appropriate.
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1179.329,1185.566,"--Well, then, if that's the case, but -- but it -- but this decision actually went to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals reversed on the merits."
2012.11-1347,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1196.421,1206.813,"But we wouldn't go back to what shouldn't have happened, that is, the district judge applying the four factor test -- or did the district -- there was an application for a stay."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1207.779,1208.313,Yes.
2012.11-1347,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1214.567,1216.085,Could I ask a question?
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1230.262,1231.262,That's exactly right.
2012.11-1347,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1240.667,1241.05,All right.
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1259.531,1265.268,"We don't think the Convention addresses that; but, the district court could make that determination using its equitable discretion."
2012.11-1347,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1265.268,1269.554,"So we just don't know what the court's going to do, but some form of relief is possible."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1271.089,1273.707,That is exactly -- that is exactly our position.
2012.11-1347,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1280.277,1285.848,"But they have the power, if they choose it, but they don't have to choose it; that's the bottom line, correct?"
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1285.848,1286.998,--That's exactly right.
2012.11-1347,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1299.439,1322.438,"Are you aware of -- I happen to be because I know this area very well -- the English courts have an amici filed with us yesterday, and they are sort of sensibly keeping track of what we're doing and trying to adjust their proceedings accordingly and in the manner they think is most helpful to us."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1332.044,1335.948,"--Well, in the Convention, there is kind of two aspects of this."
2012.11-1347,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1352.808,1353.493,And it's required.
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1355.193,1356.093,--There is a whole system for that.
2012.11-1347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.339,1376.223,"Counsel, all that's very nice."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1378.758,1387.297,"--Well, the question is just what -- what might happen in this case in terms of if there would be competing court orders or whether the courts would -- what the courts would do in response to each other."
2012.11-1347,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1410.996,1415.733,"Counsel, do you agree with your -- with the Petitioner, just reading a sentence from its brief, that"
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1420.452,1431.76,"--Well, we -- we think that the Court essentially said that in Knox, that it said -- that asked whether there is a possibility of relief, if the question is one of literal impossibility, we don't think that the Court needs to ask--"
2012.11-1347,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1431.76,1441.931,"What this Court -- Court has always said, if it's an Article 3 inquiry under standing, and it said that it's not supported by injury that is speculative or conjectural."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1450.304,1459.143,"--Well, I think the Court has made those comments more in the context of the standing inquiry at the beginning of a case, as opposed to the mootness inquiry after a case has gone on for a while, and the burdens there are different."
2012.11-1347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.855,1478.056,"Well, the burden is different, but I don't agree that the standard changes."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1483.294,1483.777,--Right.
2012.11-1347,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1508.843,1522.502,"So do you think it's -- I mean, I know you've got a laundry list of things, but, as I understand it, you think it's enough that if the Court issues an opinion, the Scottish court might do something as a result of that?"
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1522.502,1531.691,"--Well, I think that the Court issuing an opinion has effects in America, regardless of what happens in Scotland, because you have a declaratory judgment that sets out the rights of the parties."
2012.11-1347,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1531.691,1538.595,"I thought one of the arguments, maybe it was the Petitioner's and not yours, was that one reason it wasn't moot is because the Scottish courts might look at the case differently."
2012.11-1347,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1538.595,1541.63,"Well, that's -- I think it's a set of interrelated reasons."
2012.11-1347,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1554.787,1555.404,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1564.076,1566.512,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1347,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1583.371,1585.989,Why can't they order the mother to come back with the child?
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1590.293,1593.245,"--Which -- well, they can't, first."
2012.11-1347,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1594.795,1595.312,Why not?
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1604.97,1611.207,"Well, the case did end because there is one remedy, and one remedy only, in this treaty, and that is return."
2012.11-1347,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1611.207,1611.841,That doesn't matter.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1628.002,1628.552,No.
2012.11-1347,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1639.274,1652.618,"You are suggesting that the Convention deprives a party, after the remedy's been ordered and effected, of the right to appeal; not because of mootness, but because the Convention takes away a fundamental right to appeal?"
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1652.618,1652.818,--No.
2012.11-1347,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1659.371,1673.881,"You're not going to suggest all those countries that permit appeals explicitly and stop removals until appeals are finished, that those -- that those those treaty -- contracting treaty parties are breaching the Convention, are you?"
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1673.881,1674.564,--No.
2012.11-1347,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.322,1715.358,"One thing -- one thing the Court can do is give him back $94,000."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1715.358,1716.81,"No, it cannot."
2012.11-1347,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1719.11,1726.266,"He has no -- his ability to challenge the propriety of the order that he pay $94,000 is gone?"
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1726.266,1743.96,"--It's gone in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, because in the Joint Appendix, pages 16 and 17, you'll see -- I believe it's docket entry 52 on page 16, an appeal was taken off those fees."
2012.11-1347,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1767.343,1777.099,"Well, except he might have assumed that the issue of fees would still be alive if the Eleventh Circuit ruled on the merits."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1777.099,1778.265,Right.
2012.11-1347,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1778.716,1782.335,And he -- he was just trying to have a single appeal.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1782.335,1783.052,--Right.
2012.11-1347,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1798.345,1803.166,"Well, appellate courts all the time have issues where they apply different standards to multiple issues in the case."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1803.166,1803.632,--Right.
2012.11-1347,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1822.393,1825.512,"Well, that of course -- on your premise that's right."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1834.72,1855.884,"Well, the premise, though, is based in the purpose of this treaty, because back in the '70s before this treaty, Justice Kennedy, there was chaos, and in fact the government is suggesting we should go back to possibly competing custody orders between Scotland and Alabama, but--"
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.884,1863.537,I don't think that's -- you've won a judgment in lower court that says that the habitual residence of the child is Scotland.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1921.159,1928.663,"--With -- Justice Breyer, with respect to the lower court's opinion, there is, as Justice Ginsburg said there is no opinion."
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1930.215,1931.982,I'm assuming they win.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,1985.935,1995.457,"--Justice Breyer, the sheriff in Airdrie would say, why are you handing me a finding about what habitual residence was 2 years ago?"
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.563,2010.384,Or -- then argument as to why they shouldn't give in to this hypothetical American judgment.
2012.11-1347,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2024.16,2024.826,You're -- I think you're -- you're--
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2024.826,2025.893,Am I right or wrong?
2012.11-1347,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2027.095,2037.118,"--We -- we have a brief in -- in the case telling us that the question Justice Breyer is posing, would they look at it; they would say it's irrelevant."
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2037.118,2037.668,They would?
2012.11-1347,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2037.668,2045.557,Because what her habitual residence was then doesn't matter one whit to us.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2060.917,2063.119,"Justice Ginsburg, that's correct."
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.001,2066.32,"Well, thank you for Justice Ginsburg's answer."
2012.11-1347,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.172,2071.974,"I thought he had said the same thing, that the reason--"
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.974,2075.159,"I was there, but I didn't understand it as fully, and now, I do."
2012.11-1347,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.159,2075.526,"--Well, good."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2076.376,2077.111,--Justice Breyer--
2012.11-1347,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2077.111,2085.282,But I am -- I am quite surprised that you would say that prior residence can never bear on present residence.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2106.464,2112.451,"--Well, with respect to custody law versus Hague law, Justice Kennedy, there -- there is a difference."
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2121.057,2124.426,"Unless there is some accommodation here, what worries me is this."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2190.451,2202.509,"But, Justice Breyer, if -- we say, as you know, you can't have conditional returns, but you can have, with respect to stays, there is a panoply of different types of stays."
2012.11-1347,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2204.961,2206.58,"Counsel, that -- that actually is not accurate."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2219.888,2220.638,--Justice--
2012.11-1347,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2220.638,2237.099,"I happen to think that one could argue that returning back to the court that had -- was making the decision after an appeal is raised, that that's an inherent condition of a return order."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2241.634,2244.686,"--We don't -- we don't agree with that, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-1347,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2260.048,2260.348,No.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2281.794,2283.996,Those would be limited undertakings.
2012.11-1347,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2300.606,2305.744,"Mr. Cullen -- Mr. Cullen, it's often true in international litigation that enforcement is very difficult."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2344.552,2350.605,"Justice Kagan, not to state the obvious, but this is different because it's a child."
2012.11-1347,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2354.926,2366.234,"Well, it's different -- that might be -- it's certainly different in terms of the interests at stake, and that might be a very good reason for Congress to step in and try to fix this system so that you don't have children shuttling back and forth."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2371.369,2379.125,"Well, what is different is -- and I need to answer the question -- two Justices have asked me about these stays, and I need to answer that so I can answer your question."
2012.11-1347,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2409.744,2413.715,"Well, that's not quite fair to say we haven't decided whether we're going to appeal."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2425.606,2426.039,No.
2012.11-1347,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2431.842,2436.228,"Well, that's out of respect to the district judge, who's just issued a ruling on the merits."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2442.548,2443.484,Right.
2012.11-1347,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2474.319,2491.881,"It seems to me, and I may be taking the opposite position from one of my colleagues, but the -- the best thing is to hold things up briefly, so that the child doesn't go overseas and then have to be brought back, particularly if you have situations where there can be an expeditious appeal."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2507.141,2521.167,"No, we don't agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice, because that doesn't take account of the four factors any district court judge is supposed to exercise in her discretion in determining whether a stay should be granted or not."
2012.11-1347,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2521.167,2526.554,"Well, again, you're just assuming that the district judge is right, but that's the whole issue."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2537.01,2546.802,"Justice Kennedy, no, what we're doing is we are following the letter and the text of the convention and the implementing legislation in this country."
2012.11-1347,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.465,2590.747,"So are you arguing that the effect of the statute implementing the treaty, which uses “ forthwith ” and all of this, is to, in effect, require that unless there is a motion for a stay pending, the decision of the trial court be carried out?"
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2590.747,2592.747,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1347,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.747,2601.102,You -- you think the -- the mere word “ forthwith ” in the statute is enough to alter our normal process of appeal.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2601.102,2606.023,"It's the -- as a treaty, it's the supreme law of the land."
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2617.148,2636.025,"But I can't -- I don't understand why you want a treaty where the best interests of the child is what's at issue, and you interpret it in a way that the court of one nation with the child where you have parents from both nations pays no attention at all to what courts in other nations are saying."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2676.686,2683.84,"Justice Breyer, it's not that we enter into these communications and agreements with any country."
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2715.411,2717.679,I trust Scotland to do the right thing.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2726.619,2729.987,"But it doesn't matter, Justice Breyer, because there's been a vacatur."
2012.11-1347,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2764.66,2765.777,"Excuse me, can I just--"
2012.11-1347,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2765.777,2770.481,"Mr. Cullen, may I ask, I'm trying to figure out what exactly your argument is."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2811.539,2816.093,"Justice Kagan, I'm going to take your third non-offered offer."
2012.11-1347,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2827.401,2828.335,I don't understand--
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2828.335,2837.19,--Because -- because Article 3 says we have to be able to grant some effectual relief in the judicial process.
2012.11-1347,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2851.45,2867.912,"Well, then you seem to be saying that if the -- if the law does not permit the issuance of a particular kind of order, and that's what the plaintiff is seeking -- or that's what the appellant is seeking, then the case is moot."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2871.514,2878.517,--It is a mootness question because it goes -- it's not -- it goes to the heart of Constitutional mootness.
2012.11-1347,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2902.449,2908.703,"Mr. Cullen, are you saying that the -- under the treaty, there can be no rereturn order?"
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2917.709,2919.76,--There can be no rereturn.
2012.11-1347,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2926.164,2929.2,--And there could be no rereturn by the terms of the treaty.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,2934.104,2941.508,"Well, it is -- it is very textual, which is, of course, what surprised us so much in the government's position in this case."
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2991.607,3002.581,"It does equate but now you've got me -- I think I'm on the same wavelength, and I think it was back just as well, let me see because Justice Ginsburg, I see the point of her answer now."
2012.11-1347,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.225,3043.558,I thought that's what you were saying.
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3043.558,3045.26,"If that's the point -- yes, that is the point."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3046.293,3050.129,--I would say it is the point because the Convention says it's the point.
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.129,3055.949,"--Well, the Convention doesn't know whether it's 18 months or 6 months or what counts as habitual residence, does it?"
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3055.949,3062.437,The Convention says you look to the place where the child was located immediately prior to the--
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3062.437,3077.649,"That's true but you have to decide whether that's the habitual residence, and it seems to me that you're adding a factual thing, that what happened in 18 months earlier has nothing to do with whether the child is now an habitual resident of Scotland."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3101.68,3105.632,"--Well, habitual residence being fact and law--"
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3105.632,3105.899,Yes.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3106.849,3107.284,--Right?
2012.11-1347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3107.284,3107.901,Yours is fact.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3110.37,3130.264,"You look to 1895, you look to the Mills decision, and the Mills decision that tells you, under Article 3, a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live and the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in their -- if the live issue of habitual residence 18 months ago is dead."
2012.11-1347,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3130.264,3148.661,"So everything turns, under your view, on whether or not the district court gives the losing party the 48-hour stay or whether the mother in this case decides to stay in the United States until the U.S. proceedings are done."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3170.324,3173.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, we don't agree, and here's why."
2012.11-1347,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3186.62,3188.02,"No, no."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3192.857,3195.726,--And it's -- right.
2012.11-1347,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3195.726,3205.831,"And, you know, most -- not most, but many district judges don't like to immediately say after they have issued a decision, well, there is a good likelihood that I'm wrong, and therefore, I'll issue a stay."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3223.459,3233.582,"It is all over once -- once the doors close on that plane and that child arrives back in Scotland, unless the plane turns round and comes back again, it is all over."
2012.11-1347,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3233.582,3246.824,"Well, if I understand your answer to Justice Kagan, your argument is dependent on the proposition that under the Convention that once the child has left this country, a U.S. court no longer has any power to order the child to come back; is that right?"
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3246.824,3247.691,"Yes, Justice Alito."
2012.11-1347,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3247.691,3257.364,And I don't see where that was decided either by the court in this case or in the Beckier case that the Eleventh Circuit panel here cited.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3264.72,3270.44,"Well, the Beckier case goes to Mills and relies on Church of Scientology and Mills--"
2012.11-1347,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3270.44,3270.774,"No, no."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3289.937,3301.226,"--Well, this is the -- this is what makes constitutional mootness uncomfortable because it's an answer that Justices and judges typically don't want to hear."
2012.11-1347,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3319.355,3329.812,"If the Convention said explicitly that a court in this country or whatever other sending countries involved could order the child back, this case would not be moot; is that correct?"
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3329.812,3331.93,Yes.
2012.11-1347,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3331.93,3341.453,"And you -- but you say that the Convention, in effect, says exactly the opposite; once the child leaves, there can't be an order requiring their return."
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3341.453,3341.886,Right.
2012.11-1347,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3362.2,3363.167,--But asking is not enough.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3363.167,3364.401,"--Well, ask--"
2012.11-1347,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3364.401,3368.27,Because the mother can get on the plane the moment she hears that someone's asked.
2012.11-1347,2,41180,stephen_j_cullen,,3368.27,3379.411,"--The mother can get on the plane when she is allowed to get on the plane, and in this particular case, probably because she had to come in under humanitarian parole, there was considerable urgency in this case."
2012.11-1347,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3398.807,3399.909,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3402.111,3403.777,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.11-1347,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3430.594,3439.967,"Well, what he says is that after 18 months in Scotland, the Scottish court will decide where is the habitual residence of the child."
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3479.777,3480.744,I think that may well be his argument.
2012.11-1347,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3489.049,3491.834,But that was the purpose of the Convention was to cut that out.
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3540.082,3542.517,--Your Honor--
2012.11-1347,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3542.517,3545.886,--What is the incidence of re-return under the Hague Convention?
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3545.886,3549.438,"--There no cases because we don't run into this problem, quite frankly."
2012.11-1347,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3561.396,3562.781,Isn't there a Spanish case?
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3562.781,3563.348,I'm sorry?
2012.11-1347,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3563.348,3564.55,Isn't there a Spanish case?
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3564.55,3567.333,There is a Scottish custody case pending--
2012.11-1347,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3567.333,3569.251,"Not a Scottish; Spain, a case from Spain."
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3569.251,3570.953,"--A Spain -- a Spanish case, yes, Your Honor, there is."
2012.11-1347,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3570.953,3572.77,"Where the child was, in fact, returned when--"
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3572.77,3581.992,"The child was sent to Poland based upon the trial court's decision in that case, and the child returned from Poland based upon the supreme court of Spain's decision in that case."
2012.11-1347,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3583.944,3591.45,"Was the child returned, or was it just a decision that the appeal could not be avoided?"
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3593.584,3597.521,"--Well, I don't know ultimately if the child was returned from Poland, so much as the supreme court--"
2012.11-1347,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3597.521,3605.794,"That's -- see, that's the whole problem is that you -- you're going to have rival decrees of two countries, which is what -- exactly what the convention was meant to avoid."
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3605.794,3607.194,--Except that we never have.
2012.11-1347,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3621.636,3630.742,"--Counsel, there is an amici brief here that says that the Scottish courts will not pay attention to the habitual residence of a child at the time of the removal."
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3642.467,3644.335,"That's my reading of it as well, Your Honor."
2012.11-1347,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3644.335,3648.971,That that -- so that proposition is not as settled as the amici suggests?
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3648.971,3650.037,Correct.
2012.11-1347,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3672.152,3675.104,"Well, that sounds awfully speculative and conjectural."
2012.11-1347,3,36293,michael_e_manely,,3682.71,3694.351,"--The concrete injury has to do with the habitual residence determination in the district court, which switches if the appellate court reverses and grants habitual residence here and orders the child be brought back."
2012.11-1347,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3695.051,3695.817,"Thank you, counsel."
