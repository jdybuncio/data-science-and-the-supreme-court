1980.80-608,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.522,We will hear arguments first this morning in United States Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations.
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,17.36,21.496,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,68.644,72.112,And that's true even though the box is privately owned?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,72.112,74.814,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.80-608,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,74.814,76.75,"The box is privately owned, isn't it?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,76.75,92.01,"Well, in general, the boxes are furnished by the mail customer but the Postal Service regulations require the furnishing of an appropriate receptacle for the receipt of mail as a condition to the delivery of mail--"
1980.80-608,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,92.01,93.41,At the customer's expense?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,93.41,94.462,--At the customer's expense.
1980.80-608,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,118.76,119.993,And who pays for those?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,119.993,127.349,The Postal Service will pay for those letter boxes because there occasionally have been disputes as to whether the builder or the homeowners or whoever--
1980.80-608,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,127.349,129.583,And the Postal Service has the keys?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,129.583,131.135,--The Postal Service has the keys; that's correct.
1980.80-608,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,131.135,132.635,And the owner does not have the keys?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,132.635,133.387,Excuse me?
1980.80-608,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,133.387,135.287,The owner does not have a key to the back of it.
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,136.305,136.772,Right.
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,143.825,148.179,"And these cluster boxes have to be lockable, do they not?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,148.179,148.912,That's correct.
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,148.912,149.796,There has to be a key on them?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,151.214,151.548,That's right.
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,153.114,157.252,"Well, now, what about those that you can just pull open?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,162.522,163.072,Well--
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,163.072,164.339,They don't have locks on them.
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,164.339,165.122,"--No, they don't."
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,165.122,168.426,Everyone drops newspapers and everything else in them.
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,168.426,175.597,"Well, under the statute, other persons are not permitted to deposit other materials into those boxes."
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,175.597,176.697,Even in those?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,178.249,178.799,That's correct.
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,183.869,187.071,"Well, what are non lockable bins or troughs under that regulation?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,187.071,191.689,"--Well, the non lockable bins and troughs are really a very narrow category of situations."
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,228.314,235.035,"Therefore, I take it, a civic association that drops a leaflet on that trough or table doesn't violate the statute?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,235.035,235.535,That's correct.
1980.80-608,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,247.16,261.936,"I believe that a person may go into almost any hardware store and buy a metal box which has imprinted on it in some way, usually by relief, U.S. Mail> [""]."
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,270.958,271.341,Right.
1980.80-608,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,291.605,293.757,But this statute doesn't apply to those?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,293.757,294.641,--Excuse me?
1980.80-608,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,294.641,296.226,This statute doesn't apply to those?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,296.226,296.643,"Yes, it does."
1980.80-608,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,307.416,308.833,Even though it's not locked?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,308.833,310.268,Even though it's not locked.
1980.80-608,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,311.018,313.087,"Well, what's the reason for that?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,313.087,324.878,"Well, the reports on the statute when it was enacted in 1934... that's when it was adopted... specify several reasons."
1980.80-608,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,372.109,381.815,"Suppose you've got two doors side by side, one has a ""mail box"" on it like the Chief Justice was talking about, and the other has a mail slot."
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,382.782,385.584,The statute does not extend to mail slots.
1980.80-608,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,385.584,388.152,"Well, I'm asking, what would the difference be?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,399.176,408.616,"Well, I think one practical difference is that there is really no receptacle, no equivalent of a mailbox when something is put through the slot."
1980.80-608,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,409.949,411.084,The receptacle is the home.
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,411.084,411.668,That's right.
1980.80-608,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,414.686,417.438,"The slot is just an aperture in the door, isn't it?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,417.438,418.305,"--Yes, exactly."
1980.80-608,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,428.195,431.314,Isn't there another factor?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,456.313,458.082,With a mail box or a slot?
1980.80-608,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,458.682,462.467,You can't do it if it's inside the slot.
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,465.469,465.853,--Right.
1980.80-608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.245,485.249,Would not the revenue protection rationale apply equally to the door slots?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,485.249,521.489,"--It could conceivably but this statute has to be considered against, for this purpose, the private express statutes which have... Traditionally the Postal Service has had a monopoly in the areas where it operates since the 1790s, but these private express statutes allow other persons, as I mentioned, to deliver their own mail, and the carrier can deliver, the private carrier can carry the mail and the mail slot provides a reasonable way for the delivery of the mail."
1980.80-608,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,522.039,524.541,"In any event, we don't have an equal protection claim in this case, do we?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,524.541,525.526,"--No, we don't."
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,563.665,565.784,"Now, there's one other thing, Mr. Kneedler, I gather."
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,570.905,572.288,That's correct.
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,572.288,574.207,Without having stamped it?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,574.207,574.79,Without--
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,574.79,578.309,"Which I gather would not include pornographic material, for example?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,582.029,588.1,"--Well, I would think on... perhaps on a literal reading of the statute."
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,592.118,597.488,"Well, I know, but isn't there a definition in the statute of what constitutes mailable matter?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,597.488,597.988,Right.
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,598.538,600.29,And it says pornography is not mailable matter.
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,600.29,601.374,--That is correct.
1980.80-608,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,601.374,607.078,So I gather you can drop that in without violating this statute at least.
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,607.578,609.98,"Yes, I would... well, I suppose that's correct."
1980.80-608,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,613.248,619.069,You might have to get a declaratory judgment from some court before you knew whether it was pornographic material or not.
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,639.365,640.901,"--Well, if it's mailed it would not be."
1980.80-608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,645.869,649.021,Is the recipient of this illegal mail guilty of any offense?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,649.021,651.223,No.
1980.80-608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,661.731,664.883,If it's simply brought by a carrier and stuck in the box?
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,664.883,665.883,"--You mean, by private carrier?"
1980.80-608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,665.883,666.3,Yes.
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,666.3,666.6,Yes.
1980.80-608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.219,681.826,"Even if the owner says to the carrier, please put it in the box, it's raining, and he... the consent of the owner doesn't make any difference to the violation?"
1980.80-608,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,681.826,682.676,That's correct.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1641.979,1645.599,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1650.885,1660.259,Do you think you have a First Amendment right to... does anyone have a First Amendment right to walk into a private property and open the door and put something behind the screen door?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1660.259,1671.514,"--We don't believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that the rights that we seek to assert permit us to invade anybody's sacred rights of privacy."
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1689.043,1696.899,Must the homeowner put a no trespassing sign up in order to preserve his right to privacy?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1696.899,1700.534,"I think, with respect to the mailbox, the answer is yes, <Mister> [= Mr.] Chief Justice."
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.534,1706.205,"Under Village of Schaumberg, I would think, even under circulars, he would have to, wouldn't he?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1706.205,1706.822,That's correct.
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.756,1711.091,Or under most state trespass laws.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1711.091,1712.658,"That's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.658,1714.56,And Hynes v. Oradell.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1714.56,1715.793,Yes.
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.574,1765.609,Where is that in the appendix?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1765.609,1771.244,"--The statute is 18 USC, Section 1696."
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.317,1780.452,What color?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1780.452,1781.636,That's green.
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1800.197,1804.684,"May I ask, Mr. Hammer, that starts out with ""This Chapter""."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1806.936,1807.719,"--Yes, it is."
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1848.53,1854.934,Does that affirmatively appear in this record that those who made this distribution--
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1854.934,1856.75,--Are volunteers without?
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1856.75,1858.169,--Are volunteers without compensation?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1858.169,1859.769,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1859.769,1860.254,Where?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1860.254,1864.523,I believe that is in the Appendix.
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.786,1899.029,"Well, you can talk about the normal procedure for the Sawmill Valley Civic Association, presumably, but do you think you can speak uniformly of the civic associations for 50 states?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1899.029,1918.39,"Well, Mr. Justice, I believe that what we have tried to do in this action, even though we could not bring a class action for logistical purposes... the problems were too great, that the testimony of the civic representatives who testified in this case were not simply from Sawmill Valley or from Greenburgh."
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.644,1924.93,All over the country.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1924.93,1925.83,--Yes.
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1960.769,1962.703,"What do you mean, paid for?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1965.921,1967.64,They do it as a voluntary service to--
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.64,1968.923,Who does?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1968.923,1972.025,"--The members of the civic associations, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1972.025,1975.896,"Well, what if the executive secretary, the paid executive secretary of one of them did it?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1975.896,1981.281,"Well, then, Mr. Justice, the provisions of Section--"
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.281,1982.666,"Well, he's just on a salary."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1984.4,1990.656,"--That... it is possible that there could be, in an affluent area, there might be such a paid executive, although we--"
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1990.656,1996.158,An awful lot of civic associations have rather large staffs.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,1999.844,2006.998,"--It's a middle class area, Mr. Justice, and I might state that it has an average treasury that runs approximately 150."
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2012.752,2013.385,Is that in the record?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2013.385,2015.537,"Yes, it is, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2015.537,2024.293,The borough or township of Sawmill Valley is not below the poverty line?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2024.293,2036.118,"Mr. Justice, in the town of Greenburgh, which is within, the Sawmill Valley is included within, there are upper income areas, there are middle income areas, and there are lower income areas."
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2053.479,2056.848,"Mr. Hammer, who is E Payson Clark, Jr.?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2056.848,2063.568,"E Payson Clark, Jr., Mr. Justice, is sitting here at the counsel table."
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2067.572,2076.344,"Well, the reason I ask, I notice at page 38 of the transcript, there's his testimony."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2123.14,2124.842,"--Well, thank you, Mr. Justice for--"
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2124.842,2127.277,"Well, I know the youngsters get paid though, don't they?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2127.277,2128.21,"--That's true, they might."
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.3,2137.283,Is that the only testimony we have?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2138.502,2158.48,"No, Mr. Justice Brennan, there are testimony from other civic representatives, not all of which is included in the Joint Appendix, but all of which is obviously included in the trial transcript, from other civic associations, in other areas, that people never receive any compensation of any material nature other than these de minimis payments, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.48,2163.05,--Has this argument ever been surfaced in this case before?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2163.05,2164.617,The question about payment?
1980.80-608,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2165.719,2167.771,The statutory issue.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2170.121,2172.323,"No, it was not."
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.412,2182.864,What relation does that have to the First Amendment?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2182.864,2183.797,That statute?
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2183.797,2184.231,No.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2185.899,2187.399,"It doesn't have any, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2187.399,2188.435,I don't think so.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2188.435,2197.457,It's just that I was attempting to give the Court a possible basis for determining this case on nonconstitutional grounds.
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2197.457,2205.21,"Well, are you saying that someone who is not paid for violating a statute doesn't violate it?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2205.21,2214.65,Because the private express statute exemptions state that a person may deliver if he receives no compensation.
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2224.522,2226.339,"Well, I suggest one thing, Mr. Hammer."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2242.883,2275.021,"Well, I understand that, Mr. Justice Brennan, but it would seem, as a matter of logic and common sense, that if it says, you may transport or convey, that would imply that you would have to convey it to the place where the homeowner may be likely to receive it, and the entire frame of testimony in this case was such that the only logical appropriate traditional historical place where homeowners could expect to receive these public interest civic distributions--"
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2275.021,2279.006,"I gather you agree you'd have a stronger argument if the word, ""nor deposit in mailboxes""--"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2279.006,2279.758,--That's true.
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.075,2296.283,"--What about if the utility company, the utility company hires a special messenger to deliver its bills, it would not violate the statute either under your view of--"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2296.283,2298.068,"Well, he would be compensated, Mr. Justice--"
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.068,2299.335,"--Well, the statute says,"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2306.59,2309.725,"--Yes, Mr. Justice, but I would have to read that as meaning--"
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.725,2310.842,I think you would.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2313.994,2321.6,"--Well, I would have to assume that the statutory intendment was to provide that this special messenger was to be compensated."
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.818,2327.154,"Well, that isn't what this statute says."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2327.154,2329.989,"Well, this statute is somewhat ambiguous."
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2352.452,2369.064,"Mr. Hammer, if the Federal Express or United Parcel Service delivering some piece of material... I suppose we can't use the word ""mail""... put it in one of these boxes, they'd be violating the statute, wouldn't they?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2369.064,2370.799,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2370.799,2372.299,"Well, aren't they direct competitors?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2376.537,2378.653,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would state this."
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2383.09,2383.54,Probably?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2395.614,2411.724,"--No, I think you're correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but I would state this, that we are dealing here not with commercial distributions but with the core First Amendment distributions of political, civic, and community minded information."
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2413.726,2430.004,"But your posture would be the same, I should think, on the First Amendment, if you wanted to be sure to get delivery and couldn't depend on the mail, the Postal Service, that you engaged United Parcel Service or Federal Express to make your deliveries for you."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2430.004,2432.171,"--In terms of reliability of delivery, yes."
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2435.006,2439.827,"And that's taking business away from the Postal Service and using one of their facilities, is it not?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2439.827,2440.827,--That's correct.
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2577.582,2579.851,What was the basis for that judicial notice?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2582.451,2588.155,"--Well, I wouldn't want to read into the minds of the trial court, Mr. Justice, but I would--"
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.155,2590.389,"I mean, what did he say?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2592.241,2594.474,"--Well, only in view of the fact that--"
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2594.474,2596.876,Or did it come out of the clear blue?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2596.876,2616.224,"--Well, I think Judge Conner gave it serious thought but he also based it on the testimony in the case, because he commented that people testified before him that for a period of many years they had been violating this statute, knowingly and out of necessity."
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2627.882,2629.515,"You say, ""of necessity""."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2631.066,2637.753,"Well, of necessity, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think turns on the question of dollars and cents."
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.303,2680.899,"Well, then, would you say that a person could take an unstamped letter to the Post Office and say, I have had kind of a bad year this year, I can't afford a stamp, but the First Amendment requires you to deliver it for me?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2680.899,2685.018,"No, Mr. Justice, I would not make that point and I would not submit that that is our point."
1980.80-608,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2685.018,2687.703,Because it doesn't follow inevitably.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2687.703,2691.805,We do not ask to utilize the postal facilities.
1980.80-608,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2691.805,2704.632,"Yes, but you are saying that financial status of your association is a factor to be determined relative to access to mailboxes."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2704.632,2723.543,"Not... I state that financial considerations are a crucial consideration, Mr. Justice Blackmun, in terms of considering whether this Court shall deprive individual citizens and civic groups of their only practical historical means of distribution."
1980.80-608,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2723.543,2731.965,"Well, therefore, if I am an indigent and cannot afford to buy a stamp, the mail should be carried free for me."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2731.965,2748.794,"That indigent individual can do as our civic appellees can do, he can... as we submit they should be able to do... he can take that distribution and deposit it in the recipient's mailbox if it is a public interest civic or political distribution."
1980.80-608,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2748.794,2755.03,"Even though his recipient lives in Chicago, which is west of the Hudson?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2761.968,2781.498,"Well, Mr. Justice, we were somewhat encumbered with the question of economics and logistics in proceeding to trial, but as I mentioned previously, there were affidavits on the previous summary judgment proceedings from a civic representative from the vicinity or Denver, Colorado."
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.565,2784.25,"That's the only one, that I mentioned."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2784.25,2785.434,--That was... yes.
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2786.919,2802.778,"Mr. Hammer, you suggested earlier that as a matter of legislative history, I thought you said, could be limited as a matter of interpretation and construction."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2806.697,2807.349,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2807.349,2808.365,Circulars.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2811.015,2811.567,Well--
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2811.567,2817.987,"Are you suggesting circulars ought to be limited to commercial advertisements and that sort of thing, is that it?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2817.987,2821.689,"--I think the answer to that, Mr. Justice Brennan, is, yes."
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2836.265,2845.288,"Well, of course, this is, deposit any mailable matter, and then such as... in other words, for example."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2845.988,2854.894,"--Well, that gets into the gist of generis concept, which I think leads to the same conclusion, Mr. Justice Brennan, that it should be commercial only."
1980.80-608,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2891.019,2893.402,How about election circulars?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2899.539,2904.843,"I believe that it has in a happenstantial fashion, Mr. Justice White."
1980.80-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2908.629,2917.3,"Well, your construction, in any event... if you win this case, there will be a good many other people besides civic associations that would benefit?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2917.3,2924.823,"--I would believe that all noncommercial public interest and civic oriented material, which would include certainly political candidates, because we--"
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2924.823,2927.392,How about commercial?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2933.096,2934.246,--Under Virginia Board?
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.352,2974.439,The statute certainly doesn't speak in terms of who can afford it and who can't.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,2974.439,2990.649,"--No, it does not, but but I believe that in construing a statute under the First Amendment, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we have to look... and we don't maintain that the statute is facially invalid... the statute, the Government argues, is content neutral."
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3016.349,3018.532,Let me take you back a moment.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3030.423,3032.273,"We are denied, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3032.273,3038.677,"Why can't you put it behind the screen door, put it on the porch, put it in a dozen other places?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3038.677,3073.6,"--Mr. Chief Justice, throughout the course of the trial and as a result of the remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, which asked the trial court to go into these questions, a great deal of the testimony, perhaps almost 90 percent of it, from the civic association side, was taken up with exploring these alternative devices, and civic experts from a great variety of areas, admittedly not west of the Hudson except in one case, showed that these other methods were not practicably feasible."
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3073.6,3079.787,"If the Twelve Apostles said black was white, no court has to believe it."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3084.924,3086.426,"Well, except--"
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3086.426,3093.996,"There are hot unlimited, but a dozen other places to make this delivery."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3093.996,3097.015,"--Two answers, I might submit, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3114.294,3118.096,Do you know of any other expert that only works on weekends?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3118.096,3123.682,"--Well, I believe probably judicial experts are forced to work on weekends."
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3123.682,3125.134,"I said, only on weekends?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3125.134,3125.951,Well--
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3125.951,3129.686,You said these people got their expertise on weekends.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3129.686,3137.775,"--Well, I meant, Mr. Justice, that the distributions of this type of material is generally done on weekends because--"
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3137.775,3143.029,Aren't you really asking for an exception to the statute?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3143.029,3145.881,"--No, no, Mr. Justice, except--"
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3145.881,3147.915,"Well, what do you call it?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3147.915,3153.519,--We state that noncommercial distributions are not covered by the statute.
1980.80-608,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3153.935,3158.439,"If that had been written into the statute, it would be all right?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3158.439,3160.023,"--I believe it is there, Your Honor."
1980.80-608,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3160.023,3169.33,"Neither that statutory issue nor the one that was mentioned at the start of your argument was considered at all, either by the district court or the court of appeals?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3169.33,3177.6,"The statutory construction issue, in terms of commercial noncommercial, was alluded to by the court of appeals in its decision on remand."
1980.80-608,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3181.238,3191.26,"And the only issue, the only question mentioned in the jurisdictional statement is the constitutional question, and that was the only question actually decided by the district court, wasn't it?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3191.26,3192.51,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.80-608,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3192.51,3220.063,"So, even if we thought there were a possibility of merit in either this question of statutory construction or in your earlier statutory issue, perhaps the appropriate thing for us to do would be, if we disagree with you on the constitutional question, to remand the case so that those statutory questions can be considered by the district court."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3221.079,3231.404,"That may well be, Mr. Justice Stewart, but I would certainly hope that this court would be able to provide the district court with some guidance, perhaps as to the construction of the statute."
1980.80-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.521,3251.232,"May I ask, on the construction point of 1696, I notice the next sentence of the statute after the one quoted in the amicus brief says that whenever more than 25 such letters or packets are conveyed or transmitted by such special messenger, the requirements of Section 500, Title 39, should be met."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3255.902,3258.171,--In some cases there might be.
1980.80-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3268.544,3276.2,"The exemption... but then the exemption would not necessarily... I don't know what Title 39, Section 500, is, do you know what?"
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3276.2,3278.066,"--I do not, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.80-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.066,3281.503,"So this is really a pretty new argument, then, isn't it?"

1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3286.688,3287.407,Brought by your clients?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3287.407,3287.923,--Yes.
1980.80-608,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3287.923,3288.44,For declaratory judgment?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3288.44,3289.473,For declaratory judgment.
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3289.473,3293.577,You didn't raise the statutory argument in your lower court argument?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3293.577,3298.095,"We raised the statutory construction argument, commercial as opposed to noncommercial."
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.095,3301.381,But not the statutory argument you've raised here?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3301.381,3304.049,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, not that one."

1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3367.458,3376.747,"Not when a statute has been the subject of wholesale violation for a period of 40 years or 45 years since its enactment, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3376.747,3378.597,What's your authority for that?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3378.597,3381.949,The authority for that is the testimony of the--
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3381.949,3383.701,I mean a case authority from this Court.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3387.27,3390.991,--There's... I don't believe there's anything in our brief to cover that.
1980.80-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3393.374,3395.959,"Well, I was asking for a case."
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3395.959,3400.696,"--I don't have one at my fingertips, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3400.696,3407.683,What you're suggesting is that if a statute isn't enforced some kind of a special doctrine of laches runs against the Government.
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3407.683,3413.837,I concede there is no doctrine of laches against the United States of America or even against the United States Postal Service.
1980.80-608,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3460.618,3466.072,This was not just a preliminary injunction that was entered by the district court?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3466.072,3469.307,"No, Mr. Justice Stewart, it was a permanent injunction that was entered."
1980.80-608,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3470.707,3474.575,And a finding on the merits that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to your client?
1980.80-608,1,30893,jon_h_hammer,,3474.575,3476.225,That's correct; that's correct.
1980.80-608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3476.225,3480.096,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Kneedler?"
1980.80-608,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3480.096,3482.229,"Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-608,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3521.223,3525.092,"Is the word ""letter"" defined as something with postage on it?"
1980.80-608,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3526.525,3533.363,"--These criminal statutes do not contain... they just refer to... well, ""letter"" is among several."
1980.80-608,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3534.28,3539.017,They don't differentiate between something that was carried in first class mail and something carried third or fourth.
1980.80-608,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3539.017,3539.617,"--It just says,"
1980.80-608,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3603.025,3607.996,"Well, that question hasn't been briefed and is brought up here for the first time in oral argument."
1980.80-608,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3611.048,3624.105,"--Mr. Justice Stewart, that was Footnote 4 on page 31a of our jurisdictional statement, and there the district court did reject those arguments."
1980.80-608,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3686.029,3686.879,Thank you gentlemen.
