1980.79-6853,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.07,We will hear arguments next in Webb v. Webb.
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,55.068,63.406,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,87.955,89.089,"Ms. Carden, before you go on?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,89.089,89.641,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,89.641,91.057,How are you here?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,91.057,92.507,Pardon?
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,92.507,93.859,How did you get here?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,96.061,96.945,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,112.654,114.506,Did you cite the Federal Constitution?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,114.506,130.349,"No, we did not cite the Federal Constitution although we felt and we continue to feel that full faith and credit is such a clear issue, there is no reference to it in the Georgia Constitution or any other statute, and since it was implicit that we were referring to the U. S. Constitution, that that was not necessary."
1980.79-6853,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,137.455,140.657,"Well, the Georgia Supreme Court didn't say a word about full faith and credit?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,140.657,154.481,"No, they didn't say a word about full faith and credit although they held that the Florida decree was a final decree and then continued on to say, nevertheless, it had no effect in preempting jurisdiction of the Georgia courts."
1980.79-6853,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,154.481,157.331,And you regard that as a disposition of the full faith and credit argument?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,157.331,161.635,"Yes, Your Honor, we feel that that completely disposes of the full faith and credit issue since they ignored the--"
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,161.635,163.337,"Now, you started to say that you raised it in your?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,163.337,166.705,"--Yes, we raised it in our enumerations of error to the Georgia Supreme Court."
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,166.705,167.589,And what form did that take?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,167.589,177.244,We requested that the trial court be found in error for failing to accord full faith and credit to the Florida decree.
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,177.244,179.179,Again any reference to the Constitution?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,179.179,179.479,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-6853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,179.479,196.474,Doesn't the Georgia Supreme Court rules of practice require that any assignment of error that's not supported by argument or case citation shall be deemed abandoned?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,196.474,207.347,There are some very specific rules to which I think the respondent was referring to that do deal with the raising of constitutional issues and the attack under the constitutionality of the statute.
1980.79-6853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.975,230.862,Are the briefs in the Georgia Supreme Court in the record somewhere?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,230.862,234.349,"Not the briefs, Your Honor, I don't believe."
1980.79-6853,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,238.801,248.507,I thought one of your major points was that the Georgia courts didn't follow the statute?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,248.507,270.689,"Below, Your Honor, we argued that... and I will get to this in more detail... that the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, which was applicable in both Florida and Georgia, also prohibited the Georgia court from assuming jurisdiction, but that was an independent ground from full faith and credit, because the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act is only--"
1980.79-6853,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.689,275.843,You didn't have a separate section in your brief in the Georgia Supreme Court arguing full faith and credit?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,275.843,276.526,"--No, we didn't, Your Honor."
1980.79-6853,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,276.526,278.628,You just argued the statutory question.
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,278.628,288.818,"We argued that on the basis of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, but also on the basis of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, that the trial court was in error."
1980.79-6853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.818,294.972,Did you cite the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution in your brief?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,294.972,295.888,"No, we did not, Your Honor."
1980.79-6853,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,367.484,369.203,Weren't there some intervening events?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,369.203,370.886,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6853,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,395.418,399.388,How did the Florida authorities get into the act in that interim?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,399.388,411.13,"Your Honor, we are totally uncertain because the only indication that we have that there was any problem at all was that of the respondent's testimony in the trial court of Berrien County."
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,420.069,424.104,"Incidentally, Ms. Carden, I gather the youngster is back with her mother now in Florida."
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,424.104,439.114,"Yes, Your Honor, in November of 1980 the respondent contacted the petitioner to pick up the minor child and the petitioner had had the minor child in Florida, although the respondent... pardon?"
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,439.114,440.982,What's there left to fight over?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,440.982,448.219,"Well, the respondent has specifically refused to agree to any kind of permanent custody disposition or modification."
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,448.219,450.854,But he's turned the child back to the mother?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,450.854,452.321,"That's correct, but he still--"
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,452.321,454.973,"Has he indicated that he wants the child back, ever?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,454.973,463.646,--He has refused to agree to any modification of custody or to give any written agreement which would give any kind of permanence to this relationship.
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,468.983,471.085,Did he say why he was surrendering the child?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,471.085,474.37,"No, Your Honor, I do not have any personal--"
1980.79-6853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.37,485.094,"Ms. Carden, in the absence of a violation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause in a case like this, there's no federal question for this court to consider, is there?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,485.094,485.761,--That's correct.
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,532.742,535.36,"Service was made on him in Georgia, was it?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,535.36,535.877,--That's correct.
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,539.729,541.912,"Who was the law enforced by, Georgia or Florida?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,541.912,544.431,"Yes, it was a Georgia law enforcement officer."
1980.79-6853,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,570.431,580.704,"Well, what is the real controversy that's remaining, as Mr. Justice Brennan suggested to you?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,580.704,584.424,"Well, of course, the legal custody of the child still remains."
1980.79-6853,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,584.424,587.376,"You want us to set aside the Florida decree, I take it?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,587.376,603.635,"Yes, Your Honor, that is our... for Mrs. Webb to now regain custody she would have to seek a modification, she would have to go back to the Court in Georgia, and since we have a pending proceeding that isn't possible at this time."
1980.79-6853,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,603.635,606.337,"Well, why not wait until that controversy arises?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,606.337,612.925,"Your Honor, the respondent right now has every right to go to the State of Florida to remove that child."
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,622.197,623.216,Can he do that under the new federal statute?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,623.216,632.572,"The new federal statute, the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, from everything I can determine is not effective until July 1, 1981."
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,810.437,819.143,When did the mother first acquaint the Georgia court with the action in Florida?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,819.143,829.101,"She filed her answer in March, 1979, and also at that time filed a motion to dismiss, and she informed the court at that time that there was a pending proceeding in Florida."
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,829.101,834.07,Had anything occurred in the Georgia proceeding up to that time?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,834.07,834.736,No; no.
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,839.124,850.181,"You mentioned earlier that the father had brought this proceeding in Georgia without informing the Georgia court of the pendency of the Florida proceeding, but as I now understand it that was of no significance."
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,850.181,855.316,"--No, except to indicate that he had not made that disclosure."
1980.79-6853,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,855.316,862.572,"Because, right after the completion of the Florida proceeding you then filed an answer which fully acquainted the Georgia court with everything that had happened in Florida?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,862.572,872.094,"We had filed an answer previously, but, of course, all we could alert the court to was that there was a pending Florida proceeding and ask them to decline jurisdiction and allow Florida to decide the entire matter."
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,922.543,933.668,"Ms. Carden, can you tell me why the Georgia Supreme Court didn't mention the words ""full faith or credit""?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,936.12,950.797,"I presume they thought that they didn't have to reach that issue because of the state grounds that they dealt with, but they did find that it was a final judgment of the State of Florida, and then they turned around in the next few sentences and said that that had no effect, or did not preempt jurisdiction."
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,950.797,953.498,"No, it started off by saving that the case was there"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,967.056,973.543,One of my enumerations of error was that the Georgia court just declined--
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,973.543,974.143,"Well, why did they just ignore it?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,976.328,983.149,"--I presume, Your Honor, that they thought they could make a decision on that ground alone and not deal with the full faith and credit issue."
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,984.851,991.354,"Did you say, full faith and credit of the U.S. Constitution in your brief?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,991.354,997.758,"No, we referred to the failure of the trial court to give full faith and credit to a final Florida judgment."
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,997.758,1000.11,You didn't cite any constitutional provisions?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1000.11,1002.243,"No, we didn't cite any constitutional provisions."
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1002.243,1012.585,So you want us to say you don't have to cite the Constitution in order to invoke this Court's limited jurisdiction?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1012.585,1021.107,"Your Honor, in many cases I think the failure to cite the U.S. Constitution would lead to confusing results."
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1021.107,1025.076,I'm eagerly waiting for you to give me the citation.
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1025.076,1031.046,"Well, in the cases dealing with due process, for instance, this Court has held that--"
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1031.046,1032.748,What case?
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1032.748,1039.152,--In cases dealing with due process this Court has held that a failure to specify which provision of the Constitution--
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1039.152,1041.02,One of the cases... you cite it.
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1041.02,1042.637,--Pardon?
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1042.637,1045.306,Please cite me one case that says that.
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1045.306,1052.745,That the failure to give the exact provision of the United States Constitution doesn't sufficiently raise a federal issue?
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1052.745,1053.678,"Yes, ma'am."
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1053.678,1069.438,"Well, I can cite to you cases which have held that if it is explicit in the entire record that the issue was appropriately raised, then this Court can decide the federal claim."
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1069.438,1081.495,"Was this case... well, where was the article of the Constitution of the United States raised in your case?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1082.061,1083.28,That's correct.
1980.79-6853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1103.075,1117.084,I suppose a state court can't simply evade a properly preserved federal question by writing an opinion saying that this case deals with a state law and simply treating state issues.
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1117.084,1129.576,"Well, that would be our feeling about the case because, of course, they did indicate, they recognized that the Florida judgment was final, had been rendered three weeks before, and yet then they went on and said, nevertheless, the Georgia court has jurisdiction."
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1135.98,1137.515,"Then, why didn't you cite it here?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1140.617,1144.252,"Well, we understood at that point that we did--"
1980.79-6853,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1144.252,1145.604,"Was this the first time you heard of it, eh?"
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1147.221,1147.788,"--No, Your Honor."
1980.79-6853,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1155.46,1178.575,"Of course, the whole thrust of the Uniform Act is to, as some point, to persuade some state to respect the judgment of another state, and so that, to call it, it might be perfectly natural to refer to the obligations under the Act as a full faith and credit obligation."
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1178.575,1191.383,"Well, of course, the Act specifically refers to itself as being a comity-based statute and does not of course have anything to do with anything related to full faith and credit in the United States Constitution."
1980.79-6853,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.383,1196.287,"Well, it attempts to convince a state it ought to give some respect to a judgment of another state."
1980.79-6853,0,35646,mary_r_carden,,1196.287,1201.94,"That's correct; as a matter of comity, by making laws more uniform in order to have it recognized."
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,1760.028,1766.782,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-6853,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.345,1789.297,"Well, you certainly didn't held us much in your response to the petition."
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,1789.297,1794.284,"Well, begging the Court's pardon, I personally didn't file that, in defense of myself."
1980.79-6853,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.284,1795.468,"Well, I know, but I say the state didn't."
1980.79-6853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1795.468,1798.753,We weren't alerted to the fact that--
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,1798.753,1805.24,"Well, of course, that's the main problem with this whole case is that nobody, none of the lawyers in the court below ever saw any of these issues."
1980.79-6853,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.013,1825.637,"--But the petition said that the issue had been raised, and we no longer require the filing of records with our petitions for certiorari, like we did historically."
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,1837.897,1840.663,"--Well, I thoroughly agree with Your Honor's observation."
1980.79-6853,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.401,1846.367,You're appointed by us?
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,1846.367,1848.019,--I was appointed by the Court after the case--
1980.79-6853,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.019,1848.619,Yes.
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,1848.619,1849.952,--arrived at this level.
1980.79-6853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.399,1959.44,"Here are two of your three justices dissenting from the disposition of the case, at Joint Appendix on page 53, and none of them refer to the Full Faith and Credit Clause."
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,1959.44,1959.523,Exactly.
1980.79-6853,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1966.677,1970.479,Why do you suppose your Supreme Court didn't cite it's own rule 45?
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,1970.479,1971.998,I have no idea.
1980.79-6853,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1988.69,1996.777,"While I have you interrupted, may I ask, Mr. Brown, what about the return by... he's your client now... of the child to the mother?"
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,1996.777,2003.866,"Your Honor, it's my understanding the child is not with the mother but the child is with the maternal grandmother."
1980.79-6853,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2026.279,2028.831,"Well, does the mother live with her mother?"
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2028.831,2029.765,"--No, she lives somewhere else."
1980.79-6853,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2048.729,2051.013,Did your client say why he didn't want to keep the child?
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2051.013,2052.663,"No, sir."
1980.79-6853,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2060.202,2061.352,But you just wonder what--
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2061.352,2063.154,He doesn't want his wife to have the child back.
1980.79-6853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.059,2174.809,--Where in your brief is that?
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2174.809,2188.819,"If Your Honor pleases, the Act was passed sort of at the 11th hour, and I don't think we even had a copy of it until after I filed the brief and the reason I'm mentioning it to you in oral argument is because it's not in the brief, to try to give the Court that information."
1980.79-6853,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2212.517,2221.623,"Ms. Carden has conceded... we wouldn't necessarily hold her to that... she has conceded that if the Act were in effect now, there would be no case at all."
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2239.167,2246.588,"With the Court's permission we would submit a supplemental brief on that point, if the Court desires."
1980.79-6853,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2250.825,2261.95,"Well, anyway, Mr. Brown, if there is a cullable possibility that the Act is in effect, I suppose what we'd do is send it back for reconsideration under the Act."
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2261.95,2273.073,"Well, I think you could look at the Act in connection with the principles of Bradley v. School Board of Richmond, as to whether you would apply an act which came into being while the case was on appeal."
1980.79-6853,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.073,2276.175,"But we wouldn't decide that in the first instance, probably."
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2276.175,2277.959,I don't see any need to do it.
1980.79-6853,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2340.967,2346.204,"Since you seem to have the matter well in the front of your mind, perhaps you can have that to us by the end of this week?"
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2346.204,2347.454,"All right, sir."
1980.79-6853,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2348.354,2349.822,It doesn't have to be printed.
1980.79-6853,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2349.822,2352.572,"No, this can be typewritten, I assure you."
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2352.572,2368.8,"Now, there's one other issue that was not adequately briefed that I want to call to the Court's attention and it has to do with a question of cooperation between the Florida and the Georgia courts and what Florida should have done."
1980.79-6853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.989,2385.911,We really have no jurisdiction to second guess the Georgia Supreme Court on the interpretation of the Uniform Act.
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2385.911,2396.017,"--Well, this provision has something to do, I think, with personal jurisdiction and how to go about handling the Act without triggering this type of question and causing it to come to this Court."
1980.79-6853,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.171,2482.223,"Mr. Brown, could they do that even now?"
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2497.418,2497.834,Certainly.
1980.79-6853,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2546.565,2554.005,"--If we followed your suggestion of a dismissal, there would be no holding of the Georgia court on any federal question."
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2554.005,2558.39,"Absolutely not, because the Georgia court never followed the federal question."
1980.79-6853,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2598.2,2602.751,"This is not a uniform act that the Congress consented to, is it?"
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2605.453,2606.403,"--No, sir."
1980.79-6853,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2606.403,2607.722,An interstate compact.
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2607.722,2609.924,It's just a uniform act--
1980.79-6853,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2609.924,2611.757,Among the states.
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2611.757,2643.578,"--Somebody lobbies in each legislature, and if they want to pass the thing they put it into effect, and that's exactly what Georgia has done and they didn't accept it on the basis of any mandatory full faith and credit type of compulsion, and the... Commissioners noted that, specifically to Section 12, which has to deal with the binding effect of res judicata, and Section 13 states that it's not intended to establish personal jurisdiction over a nonresident."
1980.79-6853,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2777.397,2779.865,The Act is not before us.
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2779.865,2782.131,--It certainly is not.
1980.79-6853,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2803.813,2807.182,Do you want us to get rid of full faith and credit?
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2807.182,2810.984,--Do I want you to get rid of full faith and credit?
1980.79-6853,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2810.984,2811.417,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2811.417,2815.538,"No, sir, I don't want you to apply it in this case."
1980.79-6853,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2816.471,2818.038,You'd just like them to raise it?
1980.79-6853,1,35545,manley_f_brown,,2818.038,2820.34,"Certainly, I certainly agree with that."
1980.79-6853,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2986.75,2988.183,"Thank you, counsel."
1980.79-6853,2,35646,mary_r_carden,,2991.918,2996.939,I'd just like to make a few remarks in response to Mr. Brown's comments.
1980.79-6853,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3103.725,3105.66,"Thank you, counsel."
