1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,13.515,14.795,May it please the Court.
1962.11,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,77.841,79.45,What was the sentence?
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,79.45,87.039,"Three of the petitioners got 30 days, two of them got 20 days and one of them received 15 days."
1962.11,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,125.506,129.134,"Mr. Greenberg, was that ordinance ever mentioned in the trial below?"
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,129.134,136.911,"No, it was not, Your Honor and we plan to discuss some of the problems and issues that that may present."
1962.11,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,253.99,254.621,How many?
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,259.192,259.665,I was --
1962.11,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,259.665,262.671,[Inaudible]
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,262.671,271.626,There are I think 15 or 16 cases in this Court at this time and I was about to say I particularly checked North Carolina because I thought the question might arise.
1962.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.64,305.637,There's a hundred -- 162 convictions?
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,305.637,311.933,"Some of them are convictions, some of them are stayed, even pending trials, some of them are in various stages of appeal, and so forth."
1962.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.952,315.663,162 separate prosecutions?
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,315.663,316.084,Yes.
1962.11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,319.594,322.463,"Now, wouldn't you say [Inaudible] restrictions, do you mean communities?"
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,322.463,325.271,"Counties and cities, yes."
1962.11,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,327.648,331.035,"Mr. Greenberg, do they have all ordinances involved, do you know?"
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,331.035,332.789,"No, they did not."
1962.11,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,349.039,353.602,Could I ask you -- I don't want to interrupt you.
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,357.08,359.994,Since 1940 so far I am able to tell.
1962.11,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,359.994,361.717,It was [Inaudible]?
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,361.717,364.957,Yes.
1962.11,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,406.29,412.255,Could the Durham ordinance before to make the so-called integrated lunch counter illegal?
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,412.255,413.464,I would think so Your Honor.
1962.11,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,594.8,601.344,"Well, didn't they know, Mr. Greenberg that Negroes were not served in these luncheon counters before this entry?"
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,607.161,607.777,"Yes, it was."
1962.11,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,623.519,630.165,You said that the record is not clear unless I misunderstood you as to who called the police.
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,630.165,631.829,Well the manager said --
1962.11,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,631.829,633.711,The manager said that he called them.
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,633.711,635.111,Well I -- I'm --
1962.11,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,635.111,636.465,Page 21.
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,636.465,637.504,I may be in error.
1962.11,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,637.504,641.201,"They refused to leave, that is according to petitioner until they were served --"
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,641.201,642.331,I fall -- that's correct.
1962.11,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,643.064,644.555,[Inaudible]
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,644.555,645.015,That's correct.
1962.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,726.251,730.011,"I am -- I want to be sure I understand the facts, specific facts."
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,738.322,739.056,Yes.
1962.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,739.056,745.773,"And then after the police arrived and in the presence of the police, the manager unambiguously told these people to leave."
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,745.773,747.079,That's correct.
1962.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.079,749.639,"And then it was the police, was it not, (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,749.639,750.527,Then the police told them --
1962.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,750.527,752.741,-- without a warrant and -- who arrested them.
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,752.741,758.738,"Then the police officer also told them to leave in the presence of the manager and when they did not leave, they were arrested."
1962.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,764.701,766.107,By the police and not by the manager?
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,766.107,766.343,Yes.
1962.11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,772.289,774.204,I think you are right --
1962.11,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,774.204,775.352,The manager signed the warrant.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,2929.062,2929.786,May it please this Court.
1962.11,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2929.786,2938.4,Mr. Moody.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,2938.4,2946.056,We don't think this is primarily a matter of segregation or a segregation case.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2967.781,2974.275,"In North Carolina, could a Negro get a room in a -- in an inn?"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,2974.275,2974.905,Could do what?
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2974.905,2979.006,A Negro get a room in an inn?
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,2979.006,2991.429,Our statute is a reenactment of the common law and that the innkeepers must take all proper customers who deport themselves with.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2991.429,2992.578,Well that that's -- those --
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,2992.578,2993.29,I think --
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2993.29,2997.995,Those are some wildcards in that deck you just dealt.[Laughter]
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,2997.995,2999.878,How was that?
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3001.476,3004.715,Proper -- you said proper persons who deport themselves well.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3004.715,3006.223,"Well, what I meant was people that --"
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3006.223,3007.978,That probably would exclude Negroes?
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3007.978,3008.553,No.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3013.202,3017.751,But does a custom goes far as to exclude Negroes from getting --
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3017.751,3026.758,"Well, I don't -- I think about the custom is, they just don't go to the hotels as far as I know and as for [Laughter] -- they go to their own hotels."
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3032.128,3039.455,But your private property argument as I read your brief would extend as much to the hotels as it would to the stores.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3039.455,3040.99,No sir.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3066.647,3074.937,What is the distinction between those common law enterprises that you talk about in a retail store?
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3077.273,3086.858,"Well, I don't -- the distinction is simply this that -- those rooms grow out separate and apart from stores and cafes and restaurants."
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3086.858,3095.193,"Yes, well, we're -- we're still growing up and I assume and the courts fashion these rules (Inaudible) that you talk about as a common law."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3095.193,3095.953,Yes it does.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3101.267,3110.054,It is a -- is a private property of a retail store more sacrosanct than private property of a motel or a hotel?
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3110.054,3113.205,"Well, I think they're all private property."
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3114.141,3117.608,"One that you can exclude, in others, you can't."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3117.608,3132.564,"I think a person and I think it's supported by authority all of when -- in other states, northern as well as southern, I say that a person who owns property can exclude people from interference or coming on that property if he wants to."
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3132.564,3136.976,Except to hotels and motels.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3136.976,3145.288,And I would put the old common law we've -- where common law state “the gristmills and the cabs”.
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3145.288,3151.649,"I suppose that if North Carolina wanted to abandon their common law with reference to inns, they could do it."
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3151.649,3155.228,"Well, that would depend on the Constitution of the United States, wouldn't it?"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3155.228,3156.568,How is that sir?
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3156.568,3160.774,You come back then to the Constitution of the United States.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3160.774,3161.702,"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't --"
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3161.702,3172.364,"Do you think the Constitution forbids a state, require the states that's why the -- all hotels to receive anybody to [Inaudible]?"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3172.364,3174.714,Do I think the Constitution requires that?
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3174.714,3175.19,Yes.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3177.931,3185.218,"Well, I think that as far as we've been – the way we've been driven by the common law."
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3187.605,3189.809,"We're getting pretty close to raising it right now, aren't we?[Laughter]"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3189.809,3191.915,Yes sir.
1962.11,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3218.038,3232.395,"Mr. Moody, could you tell us what the general effect in hotels or in motels [Inaudible] in your state?"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3232.395,3234.751,"No, sir I can't tell you one way or the other about it."
1962.11,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3234.751,3236.467,You would think they will not -- would you not?
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3236.467,3241.936,My idea is frankly that they -- that they have not.
1962.11,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3275.415,3295.698,You do not have a provision or common law sanction provided into the [Inaudible]
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3295.698,3304.955,"Mr. Justice Goldberg, I don't know of any case that I could point to or where any question has arisen at all."
1962.11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3444.248,3445.982,You're talking about the trespass statute?
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3445.982,3447.256,The trespass statute is --
1962.11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3447.256,3449.244,"How -- when did that first enacted, Mr. Moody?"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3449.244,3451.454,About 18 --
1962.11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3451.454,3452.587,About 100 years old or so?
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3452.587,3454.797,"Yes, it's 96 I believe to be exact."
1962.11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3455.947,3462.345,"95 years -- that's -- is this same statute, isn't it that was involved in a case in this Court, Wolfe against North Carolina."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3462.345,3475.232,"Wolfe against North Carolina was here, the same statute in Wolfe against North Carolina was here, has some aspects like the statute in Marsh against Alabama and of that nature."
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3476.067,3482.505,Your argument would be the same if the persons excluded were Jews.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3482.505,3486.517,"Yes, redheaded people or myself or anybody else."
1962.11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3522.626,3530.016,"In New York I think there's a -- at least one place where a bar, the Fillmore Bar, where women are excluded, only -- it's a men's bar."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3530.016,3538.559,"Yes, I think the -- I believe that's down in -- in the basement of that store or hotel, never have been there.[Laughter]"
1962.11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3538.559,3551.136,[Inaudible]
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3551.136,3551.601,No sir.
1962.11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3551.601,3552.045,[Inaudible]
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3552.045,3553.298,I do not.
1962.11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3555.73,3560.009,[Inaudible]
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3560.009,3560.601,No.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3607.486,3609.242,Are those cases on their way up here too?
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3609.242,3614.166,No sir. [Laughter] Those are not cases Your Honor.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3629.65,3640.029,"Well, some states left it to the utilities to determine how much they charge, that was under the guise of property rights."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3640.029,3647.376,"Yes sir, that's true, but if it is Your Honor's position that a restaurant is a public utility then I mean --"
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3647.376,3649.2,"I'm just inquiring, I --"
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3649.2,3657.558,"Suppose it is a public utility, does the Constitution make it a public utility under the statute being [Inaudible]?"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3657.558,3657.777,No.
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3659.509,3673.585,"Well, if you say the argument that's been raised in this Court that a public utility serves the public is that a constitutional rule that requires the public utility to serve everybody or is it the rule of law?"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3673.585,3678.934,"Well, I [Inaudible] rule now, I think in all -- in view of all of these cases where --"
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3678.934,3680.739,"Yes, that they can be regulated."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3680.739,3681.512,Yes sir.
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3681.512,3685.414,But do -- does the Constitution do it?
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3685.414,3703.947,"Well, if I understood the questions on all those line of cases like Morgan against West Virginia and the Bowman case in Alabama and all those, those were public utilities and it was -- it was a valid constitutional right to be segregating in the seating part of the -- on the buses."
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3703.947,3705.358,"Yes, that's state action."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3705.358,3706.623,Yes sir.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3706.623,3709.023,"Or putting the man in jail is state action, isn't it?"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3709.023,3712.708,"Yes, it is and we've -- they've been indicted."
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3743.683,3748.549,"As I understand it, you admit state action with reference to [Inaudible]"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3748.549,3749.498,I do.
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3749.498,3751.005,With reference to the conviction.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3751.005,3752.131,Yes sir.
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3752.131,3762.519,"What you claim is that the law is indicted because as you would argue the law, the property owner has a right."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3769.771,3770.441,I say that's --
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3770.441,3771.16,That's your argument.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,3771.16,3772.831,And I say that's the basic question.
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3779.737,3788.046,"Now, the Civil Rights Act which were passed would've protected that by legislation and this Court must stricken them down, would it?"

1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5287.911,5296.533,Then you would say that the State regulated that place in a way that offends the Fourteenth Amendment.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5296.533,5310.926,I would say that if you hold that a café is a business affected with the public interest that that thereby subjects it to -- into state control and the -- puts it in an area where the State is and there could be no discrimination.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5310.926,5320.11,"Oh, we have many cases and you are familiar with them where -- like the picketing cases, you don't need a statute of the State."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5333.92,5335.212,Yes it is.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5335.743,5337.401,So we've got the same question here.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5337.401,5338.786,It is but what right will --
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5338.786,5340.234,The power enforced of the Constitution (Voice Overlap) --
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5340.234,5343.603,What is the countervailing Mr. Justice Douglas?
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5358.955,5361.008,Equal protection.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5361.008,5363.028,It's never been established before that equal protection --
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5363.028,5363.561,"Well, that's --"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5363.561,5367.001,-- requires that he can go into any place he wants to or any café.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5367.001,5370.901,"That's -- I know, but that's the issue in the case and that's what we're (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5370.901,5372.159,"It has nothing -- I know, that's what we're here for."
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5372.159,5374.968,I want to correct your answer with reference to myself.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5374.968,5376.092,Yes sir.
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5376.092,5386.254,I have never agreed to an opinion yet that said that the Constitution forbids the State to keep people from watching around and around a place.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5403.88,5405.029,And so I -- and that is --
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5405.029,5411.011,"Well, we had a unanimous decision in the Thornhill case where we struck down --"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5411.011,5413.677,"Yes, but in Kovacs against Copper and --"
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5413.677,5415.1,On ambiguity.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5415.1,5420.866,"Giboney against Empire, in all those, you said that free speech couldn't be a cloak that -- to --"
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5420.866,5427.417,"But the Constitution doesn't need legislative implementation to have force and effect, does it?"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5427.417,5435.099,"The Fourteenth Amendment has direct -- it's directed that state action that -- I mean that's sine qua non, isn't it?"
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5435.099,5442.136,"Well, but the -- our case -- our reports are filled with decisions where's judicial action is sufficient."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5442.136,5442.397,Yes.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5449.238,5450.585,"Well, I know --"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5450.585,5452.547,There are no statutes here.
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5452.547,5452.941,I could understand --
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5452.941,5453.312,I don't --
1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5453.312,5466.935,"-- your argument better if you just keep yourself to the question, whether owner of property, the Constitution forbids an owner of the property to select his customers whether there's any provision of the Constitution that even say that."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5466.935,5471.463,I know of no provision that it -- that has nullified that right.
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5471.463,5472.518,Up to now?
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5472.518,5473.135,Yes sir.
1962.11,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5474.706,5476.632,Mr. Moody may I ask you if --
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5476.632,5478.111,Yes sir.
1962.11,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5478.111,5489.322,"-- what if any distinction you make between these two hypothetical cases in one the restaurant owner says, “I only want to deal with whites."
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5539.285,5540.045,No sir.
1962.11,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5540.045,5541.27,They're the same?
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5541.27,5549.692,If a man who owns property can admit to it under my theory and under the theory or -- of property rights that I'm trying to hold to --
1962.11,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5549.692,5549.94,Yes.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5549.94,5559.871,"-- he could meet partially all, none or any part he can reserve to himself with, the right to use and enjoy his own property."
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5559.871,5567.959,"And you could therefore if you're running utility, you could refuse to serve, hook up Negro homes with your electricity?"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5567.959,5573.287,"No sir, but I'm not conceding Mr. Justice Douglas that a café is a utility."
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5573.287,5575.756,"Well, isn't that the basic question?"
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5575.756,5578.338,"Well, I think it is."
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5581.262,5582.0,I don't see it --
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5582.0,5582.214,-- you take the (Voice Overlap) --
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5582.214,5591.375,I don't see any greater invasion of this sacred property right you're talking about in the -- in this case and in the utility case.
1962.11,1,39937,ralph_moody,,5591.375,5601.334,"Well, it's -- the -- my only view is that it's a part of a facet of economic life and its -- comes and goes it's not a public utility."
1962.11,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5608.864,5612.431,"That his prices have often being fixed by Government, haven't they?"

1962.11,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5668.341,5670.065,Which case have we decided?
