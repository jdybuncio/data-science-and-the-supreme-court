1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,13.552,17.536,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.111,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,203.865,209.1,I was reading (Inaudible)?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,209.1,209.664,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.111,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,209.664,212.653,(Inaudible) claim the issue -- how do they claim it?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,214.344,215.519,"No, Your Honor."
1964.111,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,218.434,220.747,You said that's the Supreme Court opinion explaining this?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,220.747,221.484,That's right.
1964.111,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,221.866,226.954,"Well, now -- that's what I have -- (Inaudible) state's constitution or the Federal Constitution?"
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,226.954,227.299,No.
1964.111,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,248.39,251.131,Don't you have equal protection in those words?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,251.131,252.467,"No, we do not sir."
1964.111,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,252.467,253.206,In your State Constitution?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,253.206,254.618,"No, we do not sir."
1964.111,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,266.707,273.076,As the equal protection jargon (Inaudible)?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,273.076,283.296,"It has in some cases Your Honor, but when the California Court has chosen to rest it on the California Constitution, it has said so with precision."
1964.111,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,298.468,301.428,(Inaudible) State Constitution or federal --
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,301.428,305.037,They -- but they said Equal Protection Clause.
1964.111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,327.592,343.486,"But in the McGilvery, they did point out that the California Constitution provision for equal operation of the laws has been construed equivalent -- in an equivalent manner to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,343.486,344.134,"Yes, sir, they have."
1964.111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.134,354.605,"So that the -- if the California Court had determined to do so here and followed its own logic, they could've decided this on state grounds."
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,354.605,355.87,They could have sir.
1964.111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,355.87,356.927,But you say they didn't?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,356.927,358.5,But they did not.
1964.111,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,359.113,364.069,You don't think this is a candidate for remand to that Court and tell us what they did?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,364.069,365.14,I beg your pardon sir.
1964.111,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,365.14,370.876,"Do you think this is a candidate for remand to that Court and tell us what they did, on what they've asked to this?"
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,370.876,382.254,"Your Honor, on petition for rehearing, we pointed out basic -- and concluded and made the conclusion that it was on the Federal Constitution."
1964.111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,457.344,467.909,"Well, if we took this case on the basis of the -- that it was a Federal Constitutional decision and decided it contrary to the California Court, reversed and remanded."
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,476.326,477.931,I don't know whether they would or not.
1964.111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.22,478.239,But they could.
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,478.239,479.317,-- have this in mind.
1964.111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,479.317,479.358,They could.
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,479.358,485.686,That it would make 42 other states happy Your Honor if you would determine on the United States' Constitution.
1964.111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.686,487.014,I understand that.
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,496.127,500.476,I think very clearly it would because they have -- in a measure equated.
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,821.309,830.211,"Mrs. Palmer, do you have a similar law concerning county hospitals contribution part or rallied to county hospitals?"
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,830.211,838.326,"The contribution for county hospitals Mr. Chief Justice is contribution, yes."
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,852.898,856.364,"But you don't have the same rules of admission there do you, that you have in the state?"
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,856.364,857.142,"Oh, yes."
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,859.371,861.553,"No, I didn't asked you what (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,861.553,871.481,"For the county hospitals, there is the rule that you can't -- that if you can pay in whole for your support, you cannot be admitted to a county hospital."
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,871.481,871.905,Yes.
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,871.905,875.069,(Inaudible) v. Bright and I don't have the citation.
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,889.72,897.369,Would the decision in this case affect the admissions and contributions to the county hospitals?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,897.369,916.358,"This has been raised in the Los Angeles Court, I believe, when the county counsel of Los Angeles County sought the contribution for state -- for county hospital care and the Kirchner decision was cited as being controlling."
1964.111,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1008.89,1018.547,"But whether it is or not, I gather your position really is, this is the type of problem that comes within the principles of (Inaudible) and that line of cases, isn't it?"
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1018.547,1027.136,That this is -- this is truly a matter of social philosophy which should remain with the legislature to deal with and not with the courts.
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1155.93,1164.399,"Certainly, as a matter of curiosity, what is the maximum amount the state does assess the relatives?"
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1164.399,1169.443,"Well, Your Honor it has increased over the last few years considerably."
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1169.784,1171.642,"Well, do you -- I mean, $20 a month."
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1172.828,1180.608,"And then it went to $40 and then it went $90 and then it went to $120, and to make a long story short, its now $309."
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1180.608,1181.549,$309.
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1181.549,1186.712,$309 and that's where the mentally ill not the mentality retarded.
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1219.291,1219.487,Yes.
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1223.233,1225.804,For the mentally retarded not the mentality ill.
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1225.804,1227.917,I see.
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1227.917,1239.05,I merely made that observation because of the one at the amicus curiea briefs on that point.
1964.111,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1239.05,1242.85,What determines that -- we're dealing here with the mentally ill?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1242.85,1242.935,"Yes, with the mentally ill."
1964.111,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1242.935,1243.301,(Inaudible)
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1246.013,1246.621,That's right Your Honor.
1964.111,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1246.621,1250.165,-- which is -- can be imposed on these relatives.
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1250.251,1250.478,Yes.
1964.111,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1250.478,1254.181,What determines whether or not the maximum should be imposed?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1259.264,1263.207,"Well, Your Honor, it used to be but it no longer is."
1964.111,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1263.207,1263.482,I know that in some cases --
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1263.482,1270.298,That they are going out to -- the average day now for new admittees is 70 days.
1964.111,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1270.298,1270.689,I know.
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1277.857,1283.555,There are Your Honor and the -- it's on the financial ability of the relatives.
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1299.16,1302.254,It would it be interesting if you may file in the department --
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1302.254,1302.77,Alright.
1964.111,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1320.071,1321.552,Depends upon how many other members of the family (Voice Overlap) --
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1321.552,1328.606,"How many other members of the family if they're college students, there educational program and all of that sort of thing."
1964.111,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1355.721,1358.58,That's in the discretion of the administration of this plan.
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1358.58,1364.013,In the discretion of the administration but there can be if the party refuses to pay.
1964.111,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1375.198,1384.419,As you already claim on this case that the -- as to the discriminatory administration of this plan?
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1384.419,1385.15,"No, Your Honor."
1964.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1391.877,1411.997,"There's just one more question about the estate that -- is that totally encumbered and not available for the maintenance of this patient and therefore, they must look to the relatives for contributions if any -- if anybody other than the estate is to pay the bill?"
1964.111,0,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,1411.997,1413.342,That is correct Your Honor.
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1511.041,1515.722,"Mr. Chief Justice, if pleases the Court."
1964.111,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1548.741,1553.568,Before the time that it was available for her keep?
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1553.568,1560.74,"Your Honor, I do not wish to interpret the words of the California Supreme Court."
1964.111,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1583.066,1591.682,"Well, I think you're almost obliged to interpret the California Supreme Court for us aren't you if the -- in --"
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1591.682,1593.439,"Well, I think Your Honor --"
1964.111,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1593.439,1596.065,Establish one thing or another.
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1610.398,1614.722,"The Supreme Court of California found that there's $11,000."
1964.111,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1668.518,1669.847,"Mr. Dougherty, may I?"
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1669.847,1671.648,"Yes, Mr. Stewart."
1964.111,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1671.648,1674.864,As I read what you've -- the language you've just referred us to.
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1682.025,1682.388,That's correct.
1964.111,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1682.388,1684.947,A recital as to the allegations of the pleading.
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1717.86,1723.902,"Well Mr. Justice Stewart, I don't think that the California is -- California Court is turning away from the fact."
1964.111,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1729.292,1742.048,"Well, then the big question doesn't arise under California law, if there's enough fund to your California law -- the -- in the estate and the -- of the property of the person in the hospital then these other question doesn't arise, does it?"
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1742.048,1743.561,"Which other question are you referring to, Your Honor?"
1964.111,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.561,1751.232,The question which I thought we granted this case to hear and which I thought the California Supreme Court decided.
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1760.576,1762.192,"Your Honor, I think this."
1964.111,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1889.88,1909.551,"Mr. Dougherty, is it your theory that a state is without constitutional power under the Federal Constitution that require a child to contribute or to care of a parent if the parent has any estate, is that your theory?"
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1909.551,1909.875,"But Your Honor, it said --"
1964.111,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1909.875,1913.409,"Because in other words, that the estate must be exhausted."
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1913.409,1913.668,I did not --
1964.111,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1913.668,1917.025,But that's the -- what the Constitution requires?
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1917.025,1918.549,That is the petitioner's statement.
1964.111,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1919.713,1921.78,Would you state what yours is?
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,1921.78,1924.942,My statement would be this Your Honor.
1964.111,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.284,1995.183,You're bringing in to this case what I didn't think is here at all and I asked your Brother -- your Sister an argument as to whether or not there was any claim of a discriminatory administration of this program and I understood that you say no.
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,2007.527,2008.134,I see this.
1964.111,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2078.203,2080.328,That -- and what's that from your brief in the --

1964.111,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2122.285,2129.1,I'm looking at the petition for certiorari on this Court which states two questions.
1964.111,1,15794,alan_a_dougherty,,2145.221,2159.557,"Now, the question presented in the petition for certiorari Your Honor, struck me with such surprise that in my reply to this petition and my reply is on the file."

1964.111,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3492.385,3497.205,"Mrs. Palmer, may I ask you a question along that same line."
1964.111,2,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,3497.205,3497.472,Certainly Your Honor.
1964.111,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3497.472,3506.235,"It's your contention that this $11, 000 is not available for the future care of this patient."
1964.111,2,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,3506.235,3506.383,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.111,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3506.383,3515.736,"Now, if it were available -- if that money were available for that purpose, will you still be here?"
1964.111,2,22953,elizabeth_palmer,,3515.736,3517.086,Would I still be here?
