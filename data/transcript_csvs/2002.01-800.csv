2002.01-800,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.975,"We'll hear argument next in No. 01-800, Karen Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,32.073,37.195,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-800,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.901,234.457,"It seems to me that some of the language in First Options, which the respondent relies on cuts against your case."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,235.935,245.833,"Well, first of all, First Options is a case in which there was a question about whether an arbitration agreement existed, which is not the case here."
2002.01-800,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.234,286.524,"The respondents here, of course, argue that because of the not to be submitted clause, the 6 years, that limits the scope of the... of the arbitration agreement."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,286.524,311.614,"The... the respondent, of course, is... is referring to rule 10304, which says that... that disputes which arose out of transactions or events more than 6 years prior are not eligible for submission to arbitration."
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.797,328.511,"Well, so is 10324 which you're relying on."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,333.048,334.225,"Exactly, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-800,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,434.562,448.34,"--Is... is that your criterion, that... that... the... on... on the question of what... arbitrability turns on the question, do you get in front of the particular person or tribunal at all as opposed to how long do you stay when you get there?"
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,463.815,467.479,"--That... that is one point, Justice Souter."
2002.01-800,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.677,557.177,--definition of the domain of arbitrability?
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,578.927,585.135,"Justice Ginsburg, our... our definition of arbitrability I think has to be broader than that."
2002.01-800,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,591.28,595.312,"Well, the question that doesn't go to the arbitrator... you're saying this one does."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,628.292,642.826,"--It's a hard question for me to get my hands around, Justice Ginsburg, but there... there is no question that in the first instance the court has to decide whether a claim is... is arbitrable."
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,658.188,658.756,"Well, now--"
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,658.756,659.478,I don't think--
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.478,670.652,--this... this is a contract matter.
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,671.22,671.691,--Right.
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.691,673.606,So it's just a question of contract.
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,679.028,679.448,Right.
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,679.448,701.496,"So presumably if 10304 had read no dispute, claim, or controversy shall be arbitrable, okay, under... under this code where 6 years have elapsed, that would... would that exclude this from... from the arbitrator?"
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,701.496,704.593,"I believe not, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.593,709.238,"My goodness, it's using the exact term that you concede sends it over to the... to the court."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,709.238,709.864,Well--
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.864,716.468,It... what do you have to do beyond using the... the very word that you say bounces it to the court?
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,724.288,725.305,--Well--
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.305,735.282,"And my next question is going to be, is there a whole lot of difference between saying it shall not be arbitrable and saying, it shall not be eligible for submission to arbitration?"
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,735.282,736.034,--I'm not--
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.034,736.764,And I don't think there is.
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,736.764,738.398,"--I don't think there is either, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.398,738.66,Okay.
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,742.05,742.676,Precisely.
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.124,774.796,What happened to the intent of the parties?
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,774.796,775.919,--That... that's what--
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.919,779.596,"I mean, you're talking as... as though this is some law being sent down from on high."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,783.912,784.345,--Right.
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.345,788.489,"And you say that even if the parties say it's not arbitrable, well, that doesn't matter."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,792.625,818.143,"But the question is who will decide a certain issue of arbitrability, and AT&T and... and Moses H. Cone and First Options even says that once you find that there's an agreement to arbitrate the substance of the... the dispute, then the question is did the parties, by unmistakable evidence, agree that the courts, rather than the arbitrators, would decide that scope issue."
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.143,825.365,So then you're saying arbitrability under our cases is not for the court necessarily.
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,825.365,826.838,I'm saying--
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,826.838,827.743,"I mean, you can't have it both ways."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,827.743,828.386,--There... there's a--
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.386,840.846,"If you say arbitrability is for the courts, then if the... if the agreement between the parties says this is not arbitrable, that question of... of whether those facts exist or not ought to be for the courts."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,840.846,862.061,"--I think that's true for that threshold issue, but if we get to a point where all issues that... that may preclude ultimately submitting the case to the arbitrators for determination have to be decided by the court, then we're running afoul of John Wiley."
2002.01-800,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,862.061,863.322,I... I didn't understand it that way.
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,896.123,898.552,"I think you're wrong, Justice Breyer, although--"
2002.01-800,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,898.552,898.972,Because?
2002.01-800,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.048,902.934,Try again.
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,902.934,912.782,"--I think what... what the... again, what the initial issue for the Court is, did the parties agree to arbitrate the substance of the dispute."
2002.01-800,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,912.782,922.178,"Yes, of course, and I thought what my opinion said was that when we're trying to decide whether they agreed to arbitrate or not, we apply a fairly tough standard."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,939.636,944.45,I believe I quoted from the Moses H. Cone--
2002.01-800,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,944.45,944.868,Yes.
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,946.86,952.746,--decision which... which says... which says that the presumption is in favor of the arbitrator's deciding.
2002.01-800,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,952.746,956.551,I'll get the phrase and then... I'm not communicating.
2002.01-800,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.118,962.114,I... Justice Ginsburg asked a question that I'm also interested in.
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,994.429,995.391,No.
2002.01-800,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,996.01,998.093,I... I just don't know what you want us to write.
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,1000.71,1010.78,"--Justice Kennedy, it's basically what was announced in the AT&T case when it was sent back to the court to decide who decides certain questions."
2002.01-800,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1068.103,1068.847,"Mr. Friedberg, do you disagree with the Government?"
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,1093.469,1094.329,--No.
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.684,1141.058,"What... what if I have an arbitration agreement that says all... all disputes arising from an... an accident on the employer's premises shall be arbitrable, and the issue is whether this accident occurred on the employer's premises or not?"
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,1154.7,1165.242,--I think in the first instance the court would decide that because the parties did not agree to arbitrate any claims.
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.242,1167.135,Why is that different from here?
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,1167.642,1168.024,Because--
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.024,1178.853,"--did not agree to arbitrate any claims that... with... with regard to an accident that did not occur on different premises, but that incurred... occurred more than 6 years before."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,1178.853,1180.307,--Because--
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1180.307,1181.742,They didn't agree to arbitrate it.
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,1186.435,1191.13,"--Because of the principle, Justice Scalia, set out in the John Wiley case and the Moses H. Cone--"
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.13,1197.189,"But I don't see how that principle applies... doesn't apply here, but applies in the other premises situation."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,1199.376,1208.168,--I... I think because the Court has previously said that a timeliness issue is... is a procedural issue.
2002.01-800,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.123,1217.185,"Well, can't you make it a... I mean, it's up to the parties, who are masters of their agreement."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,1224.684,1228.285,--They could but they didn't in this case.
2002.01-800,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1228.285,1248.037,"What you're saying, I guess, is that if the... if the allegation of harm falls within the subject of the arbitration clause, everything goes to the arbitrator unless they have unmistakably said that some subsidiary issue does not."
2002.01-800,0,15928,alan_c_friedberg,,1248.682,1251.817,That... that is what our position is.
2002.01-800,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1251.817,1252.789,"--Thank you, Mr. Friedberg."
2002.01-800,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1254.904,1262.446,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-800,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1296.549,1304.937,What is... what is the general principle that Justice Ginsburg was asking for that controls your first conclusion?
2002.01-800,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1304.937,1305.384,Okay.
2002.01-800,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1355.99,1358.266,What was the text in John Wiley & Sons?
2002.01-800,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1366.298,1367.297,"No, Your Honor."
2002.01-800,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.014,1377.501,Why?
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1874.004,1877.442,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1913.88,1918.638,"But doesn't a grievance... I mean, isn't the point of speaking of grievance just what Mr. Roberts said?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1934.848,1940.408,"We believe, Justice Souter, that the language is in fact clear, of 10304."
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.573,1946.568,Wait.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1962.624,1963.05,It is--
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.05,1965.661,--and not conduct that occurred before 6 years.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1965.661,1971.133,--It is going to the issue of what did AT&T mean by the specific word grievance.
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2004.409,2008.612,"This is your submission argument, your... your argument based on the... on the word submission."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2008.612,2009.826,--It's eligible--
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2009.826,2010.069,Okay.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2010.069,2011.214,--eligible for submission.
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2011.214,2031.336,"But submission... I just don't see how submission can decide this case because you can say the... the ultimate issue is submitted when the... when the whole case goes to the arbitrator, or you can say it is submitted when the arbitrator gets beyond procedural issues and gets down to the issue of the primary conduct that caused the injury."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2031.336,2032.1,Justice Souter--
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2032.1,2035.408,So I don't see how submission is... is going to be the... the deciding factor.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2035.408,2040.381,"--Justice Souter, we would guide the Court first to the word eligible for submission."
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2079.42,2087.161,But you can agree to a temporal restriction and still not commit yourself as to who decides whether that restriction is true.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2087.161,2096.322,"And that guides us... you're exactly right, and so you then go to what is that temporal restriction, and let's analyze that temporal restriction."
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2098.116,2104.803,"But if the temporal restriction then were phrased in terms of no relief shall be granted on a claim arising, then it clearly would go to the arbitrator."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2104.803,2106.375,--It might very well go to the arbitrator--
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2106.375,2107.489,"But it clearly would, wouldn't it?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2107.489,2108.782,--under... under those circumstances.
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2111.351,2111.899,So it depends on the wording of the clause.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2111.899,2112.512,Absolutely.
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.108,2147.814,"But how... how does the party that's dealing with the NASD know that this is... I mean, why should it be bound by what the NASD has said in other contexts?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2150.058,2155.453,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the submission agreement in 1997... and this is commonplace."
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.904,2166.097,"No, no."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2175.138,2181.512,"But they... they don't, and that's the assurance I want to give and why it's odd that the SEC has been silent on this."
2002.01-800,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2288.552,2298.935,"Well, I thought that... that what it says, this rule says... one interpretation of it, plausible interpretation, is arbitrators decide the eligibility question first."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2336.758,2338.135,That is correct.
2002.01-800,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2346.161,2358.083,"That's now... now, that's my puzzle because isn't it odd that a limitation period that applies only in the arbitration forum is then decided by a court where the court would have a different limitation?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2358.083,2373.016,"Not... not at all because if there is a different limitation... and, indeed, 10304 draws the very distinction between the eligibility requirement to get in the door of arbitration as opposed to a statute of limitation which might vary."
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2394.315,2395.531,It said more than that.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2421.211,2421.693,--Yes.
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.346,2442.67,I... I would like to get back to the question--
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2442.67,2443.855,Yes.
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.855,2452.715,--Why is these interpretations that are not part of the agreement that the respondent or the petitioner here signed... why are they binding on the petitioner?
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2452.715,2458.922,Because she agreed in the submission agreement to be bound by arbitration under the code of procedure.
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2464.287,2474.361,"Well, so we're just talking here, when you say the NASD has said, this is incorporated in the code of procedure which she agreed to be bound by?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2474.361,2475.465,--No.
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.465,2476.08,Okay.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2478.319,2487.548,What I tried to say is that the NASD has described the reasons for the rule to which she agrees.
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2487.548,2489.152,"Well, why should that bind her?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2489.152,2496.319,It binds her only in the sense of it helps the Court understand what the background of the rule is.
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2503.048,2516.815,"Well, supposing I enter into a contract with Sears and, say, I'll pay $300 for something, and then Sears has a publication which says, you know, here's the warranty and, okay, you get the warranty."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2526.532,2529.455,"--There may very well be, under those circumstances, an issue of whether there was a contract."
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2535.507,2539.064,But it's the NASD's interpretation of the rule.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2546.164,2549.157,I'm not suggesting binding authority.
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2564.291,2566.923,"But, Dr. Starr, can I ask you a question about the meaning of the rule?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2580.256,2587.026,"--Well, there would be an issue that the Court would then analyze what is the occurrence or event."
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2587.026,2589.149,"Well, I'm talking about the occurrence is 7 years ago."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2589.149,2599.743,"And... and in terms of purchase or sale of security, it might very well that that would not be arbitrable in this industry because of the occurrence or event."
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2609.262,2613.853,So this is an absolute rule without any tolling provision.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2613.853,2614.405,--That's correct.
2002.01-800,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2630.464,2635.964,"But I'd... I'd like you to go back to what I thought was the key question, Justice Ginsburg's initial question."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2775.083,2788.695,"Justice Breyer, I believe that the question of arbitrability, the duty, and who decides that question is guided by the... is determined by the intent of the parties."
2002.01-800,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2788.695,2789.413,And we agree with that.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2789.413,2792.356,We now look to the contract.
2002.01-800,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2854.007,2855.98,Which brings you to 10324.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2855.98,2874.084,"And 10324 is, in fact, a broadly worded provision that says on its face that the arbitrators are empowered to decide, to interpret, and the like, the provisions of the code."
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2902.405,2903.94,Where do we find that in your brief?
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2903.94,2907.095,--10104 is at page 35--
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2907.095,2907.679,Thank you.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2907.679,2910.532,"--of the brief, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-800,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2974.388,2979.242,But are not... but that those... those provisions are not ones that the court decides either.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3031.856,3046.255,"--Because it is building in a procedural versus subject matter distinction, a sort of way of looking at the code as opposed to determining... and you used the term, Justice Ginsburg, statute of limitations."
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3067.556,3067.975,"Mr. Starr, can I interrupt?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3067.975,3068.388,--Yes.
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.388,3081.053,"Supposing the... the claimant files a piece of paper saying the events occurred 5 years and 11 months ago, and the... a company comes in and files a piece of paper and says, no, they occurred 6 years and 1 month ago."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3084.272,3087.082,That would be a question of... for the court.
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3088.628,3092.204,So just filing a defensive pleading would oust the arbitrator of jurisdiction--
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3092.204,3092.56,Oh.
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3092.56,3094.503,--even though the claim itself said it was 5 years.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3094.503,3094.668,No.
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.04,3121.985,"Well, so... so in my hypothetical--"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3121.985,3122.578,--Yes.
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3122.578,3126.322,--it would be the arbitrator's initial task to resolve the question of fact.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3126.322,3129.548,Only under the circumstances that... I want to be very clear.
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.784,3140.256,So then am I correct--
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3140.256,3140.499,But--
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3140.499,3150.053,"--that if the... if the claimant files a claim saying it happened 5 years ago, and the company files an answer saying, no, it happened 6-and-a-half years ago, they would immediately refer that to the court?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3150.053,3165.377,"--Well, you're suggesting a procedural issue, namely, filing an answer which suggests to me that the company has, under those circumstances, agreed for the arbitrators to decide that issue."
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3165.377,3166.458,Why?
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3170.279,3171.582,"No, I'm sorry."
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3171.582,3172.379,That's why you file.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3174.173,3182.629,"You can, under those circumstances, say the arbitrators... I will allow the arbitrators to take this initial cut at that."
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3182.629,3183.942,"But you can, but what if you don't say that?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3193.209,3193.806,Exactly.
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3194.304,3196.372,"All right, and if that's what they say, then they go to the court."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3196.372,3197.004,--That's right.
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3197.004,3200.814,So all they've got to do is file a paper and we're out of arbitration and into court.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3201.126,3204.184,You're... you're in... you're in the court.
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.299,3221.768,--And it's the same thing if... if you say that the accident occurred somewhere other than in the work place.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3222.204,3223.583,--There's... it's the same principle.
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3225.832,3226.02,--All right.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3226.098,3227.531,Are you going to stand... I'm sorry.
2002.01-800,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3227.531,3227.719,--No.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3228.164,3232.928,I was just going to say the issue is are you going to stand on your rights under the contract.
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.616,3245.213,They make--
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3245.213,3245.616,--I'm sorry.
2002.01-800,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3245.616,3248.01,"--They make their submission in a motion to dismiss, not in an answer."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3253.37,3255.057,You... the point is you would file that in court.
2002.01-800,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3255.057,3258.984,Can you step back one second... one second from these details you're in?
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3327.188,3333.035,"Justice Breyer, we're asking you not to apply a presumption at all."
2002.01-800,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3336.185,3336.828,"Well, fine."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3360.997,3369.471,"--But again, the presumption and the analysis in First Options goes to where, in fact, the parties have not spoken to this issue."
2002.01-800,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3382.221,3382.44,"No, no, no."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3385.112,3390.428,--That's the standard with respect to... the First Options presumption works for us.
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3400.417,3409.124,"Can I... can I ask you about the rules, about 10324 in particular which deals with the interpretation of provisions of the code?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3409.124,3409.714,Yes.
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3409.714,3423.167,I assume your... the... the other side says that... that that provision gives the arbitrator the power to decide whether 6 years have elapsed or not.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3435.503,3437.87,The same logic applies.
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3437.87,3442.448,"--I don't see how you could limit it to the one and... and not apply it to the other, could you?"
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3442.448,3444.042,I don't think that they could.
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3444.042,3446.146,Shall be empowered to... so how do you read it?
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3455.209,3457.655,Once the arbitrator has juris--
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3457.655,3459.266,Within the scope of--
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3459.266,3462.001,"--arbitrators have jurisdiction, they are empowered to interpret the code."
2002.01-800,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3501.108,3502.486,--So you don't think you even need it.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3504.152,3511.558,"--That's correct, because we think the parties' intent is clear and the NASD is clear with respect to why this rule exists."
2002.01-800,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3528.359,3535.014,"Well, nobody is questioning the 6-year limitation, and the question is who decides it."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3576.817,3592.222,"--It's not odd in this context where the original agreement... there was not, Justice Ginsburg, an agreement, in paragraph 19 of the original client access agreement, to arbitrate in some generic, undifferentiated way."
2002.01-800,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3600.062,3600.638,But that would--
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3600.638,3606.668,"--Mr. Starr, I guess the same anomaly occurs when... when the dispute goes to whether the primary conduct is covered."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3608.89,3609.319,--It's the... it's--
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3609.319,3610.272,--if the court decides it?
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3617.838,3618.213,--It's the--
2002.01-800,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3618.213,3619.822,--for the conduct that... that is not arbitrable.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3619.822,3624.4,--It is the same principle in terms of to what did the parties agree.
2002.01-800,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3638.407,3650.633,What I was saying is that there's a difference between a code of procedure that says we agree to arbitrate and then this is the rules governing the arbitration forum when you're in arbitration.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3657.626,3662.734,"--But, Justice Ginsburg, I would guide you back to 10304 and its language and the term eligible."
2002.01-800,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3679.44,3684.676,"But it could be if you say that all this is is a code of procedure, like the Federal rules."
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3684.676,3685.067,--Your Honor--
2002.01-800,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3685.067,3695.174,And if that's what you... if you say we opt for arbitration and we opt for it to proceed under this set of procedural rules.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3695.174,3696.671,--May I briefly respond?
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3696.671,3697.807,Very briefly.
2002.01-800,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3697.807,3703.479,"Justice Ginsburg, our submission is rigorously enforce the contract."
2002.01-800,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3706.945,3708.129,"Thank you, Mr. Starr."
