2012.11-564,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.137,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-564, Florida v. Jardines."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,7.885,10.416,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-564,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,35.482,40.731,"I mean, that just can't be a proposition that we can accept across the board."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,64.938,69.922,"Well, Justice Kennedy, in the Caballes case, the contraband wasn't visible before the dog alerted."
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,79.807,89.946,So doesn't that mean that what's in your home that's not visible to the public has an expectation of privacy as well?
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,89.946,92.743,"--Not when it comes to contraband, Your Honor."
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,95.133,96.194,But that -- that is circular.
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,103.941,113.171,"--Because, Your Honor, when you have a search warrant and you go into a home, there's going to be a lot of private information that you're going to come across, even if your expectation is finding evidence of a crime."
2012.11-564,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,113.171,139.568,"Mr. Garre, does your argument mean -- you say minimally intrusive, and that the dog will detect only contraband, that the police then are to go into a neighborhood that's known to be a drug dealing neighborhood, go into -- just go down the street, have the dog sniff in front of every door, or go into an apartment building?"
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,146.032,153.527,"Your Honor, they could do that, just like the police could go door to door and to knock on the doors and hope that they will find out evidence of wrongdoing that way."
2012.11-564,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,171.914,178.052,"How is it -- supposed the house had on the lawn, no dogs allowed?"
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,178.052,181.566,"--I think that would be different, Your Honor."
2012.11-564,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,192.203,192.718,"Well, that's right."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,207.914,208.507,That's right.
2012.11-564,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.507,220.658,"But if they can't see clearly enough from a distance, they're not entitled to go onto the curtilage of the house, inside the gate, and use the binoculars from that vantage point, are they?"
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,220.658,222.471,"They're not, Your Honor."
2012.11-564,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.471,223.423,Why isn't it the same thing with the dog?
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,227.438,233.717,"Your Honor, first of all, I think that, as this case comes to the Court, the police were lawfully present at the front door."
2012.11-564,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,246.632,268.09,"Well, then we've taken an unrealistic case, if that has been conceded, because it seems to me crucial that this officer went onto the portion of the house that -- as to which there is privacy, and -- and used a means of -- of discerning what was in the house that -- that should not have been available--"
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,268.09,270.294,"Well, I think the way you would--"
2012.11-564,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,270.294,270.543,--in that space.
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,270.543,279.088,"--I think the way that you would answer that question, Your Honor, is, of course, there's a curtilage that extends around the house and protects, in which the homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy."
2012.11-564,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,290.957,294.58,"Yes, but not implied consent for the policeman to come up with the dog."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,318.523,328.459,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, first of all, I think, if the Girl Scout or the salesman or the trick-or-treater brought up a dog with them, there would be implied consent for that too, at least as long as the dog was on a leash."
2012.11-564,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,329.754,330.394,This is not any dog.
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,332.472,333.424,"--No, that's right."
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,337.862,339.234,Why is that an implied consent?
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,355.775,359.117,"Well, you can certainly put the “ No Dogs Allowed ” sign out front."
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,360.462,361.008,"No, no, no."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,364.662,366.615,"Well, we start with the proposition that--"
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,366.615,370.207,Do you think homeowners freely let dogs just come into their apartment?
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,372.598,374.533,"--Well, certainly not in an apartment, Your Honor."
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,381.454,382.032,So we're going to treat it like a human being now?
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,385.716,393.105,"--No, I think -- and certainly this is true in my neighborhood, Your Honor, is neighbors can bring their dog up on the leash when they knock on your front door, and I think that's true in most neighborhoods in America."
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,399.446,399.961,So now we tell--
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,399.961,400.741,--allowed.
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,400.741,402.335,"--all the drug dealers, put up a sign that says “ No dogs ”."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,402.335,403.973,"Well, they could, Your Honor."
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,407.506,410.879,Isn't it fair just to assume that -- what's logical?
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,423.078,437.727,"--And I think -- Your Honor, I think the reason why that doesn't work here is that if you ask that question with respect to the officer, I think it's well settled or accepted that police officers can walk up the front path, absent a sign or something, knock on the door--"
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,437.727,444.349,"That implied consent, does that include them coming up and -- up to your porch and sweeping stuff into a garbage pan?"
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,444.349,446.614,"--I don't think it would, Your Honor."
2012.11-564,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.705,460.31,"Police officers can come there to knock on the door, but I thought you've conceded that police officers can't come there to look into the house with binoculars, right?"
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,460.31,462.654,--With binoculars--
2012.11-564,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.654,469.587,"When the purpose of the officer's going there is to -- is to conduct a search, it's not permitted."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,469.587,482.487,"--If the purpose of the police officer here, for example, was to walk up to the house, hope that they answered the door, or hope that once they were up there, that they would smell the odor of marijuana, as Officer Pedraja did, that would not convert it into a search."
2012.11-564,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,485.502,494.512,"That's true, but if you're looking at expectation of a reasonable homeowner, imagine you have a home, a long driveway."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,511.351,513.176,"Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-564,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.176,515.223,--is that something I wouldn't -- would you be nervous about that?
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,515.223,515.894,--I think--
2012.11-564,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.894,518.55,Anyone coming to your door and not knocking.
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,518.55,523.128,--I think what -- I think what happened here--
2012.11-564,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,523.128,523.799,Just sniffing.
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,523.799,536.465,"--Well, I think everyone accepts when someone comes to your door, they can avail themselves of their God-given senses, whether it's looking into a window without binoculars, taking -- breathing in and smelling the air, as Officer Pedraja did."
2012.11-564,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.838,540.603,"No, there is in this sense."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,566.873,568.468,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-564,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,568.468,577.62,Would a homeowner resent someone coming with a large animal sitting in front of his front step on his property and sitting there sniffing for 5 to 15 minutes?
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,584.46,595.235,"--Your Honor, what I think you can say there is implied consent to is a dog accompanying a person on a leash walking up to the front door, taking a sniff in a matter of seconds, not minutes--"
2012.11-564,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.235,595.578,Ah.
2012.11-564,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,596.346,597.641,"Well, that's not what the record says, Mr. Garre."
2012.11-564,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,597.641,598.686,I thought what happened here was 5 to 15 minutes.
2012.11-564,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,598.686,608.497,"I mean, the record suggests that he put the dog on a very long leash, the dog goes back and forth, tries to figure out where the smell is coming from."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,629.534,639.607,"--Your Honor, I think what the record shows is, is that the dog was on the scene, i.e., at the curb, walking up, going back into the car, and then leaving, for a total of 5 to 10 minutes."
2012.11-564,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,699.663,706.159,"Well, we've had a lot of -- we've had a lot of discussion about whether it's 5 minutes or 15 minutes or whether it's mothballs."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,723.279,725.729,That you need probable cause just for the dog to sniff.
2012.11-564,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.739,737.957,It isn't just the sniffing in the abstract.
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,744.425,757.06,"--Well, that's true, Your Honor, but I think if it wasn't a search for the police officer to walk up there and sniff and report smelling live marijuana, then it wasn't a search when Franky walked up there and alerted to the presence of an illegal narcotic."
2012.11-564,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.06,765.963,"--Well, I didn't say it wouldn't be a search if the police officer himself did that if he went there with the intention of -- of smelling at the door."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,769.836,778.207,"I think it's been conceded in this case, at least it was below, that the officer could walk up there, knock on the door, report the smell of marijuana, and that that was not a search."
2012.11-564,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,778.207,780.753,"Mr. Garre, this is what we said in Kyllo."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,808.741,811.442,"Well, first of all, Franky's nose is not technology."
2012.11-564,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,816.722,841.933,"So does that mean that if we invented some kind of little machine called a, you know, smell-o-matic and the police officer had this smell-o-matic machine, and it alerted to the exact same things that a dog alerts to, it alerted to a set of drugs, meth and marijuana and whatever else, the police officer could not come to the front door and use that machine?"
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,841.933,844.542,"Your Honor, I think the contraband rationale would be the same."
2012.11-564,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,856.084,861.08,So your basic distinction is the difference between like a machine and Franky.
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,861.08,861.891,Well--
2012.11-564,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,861.891,870.668,"That we should not understand Franky as kind of a sense-enhancing law enforcement technology, but we should think of him as just like a guy."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,870.668,873.137,"--Your Honor, I think that's true for two reasons."
2012.11-564,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,894.974,896.316,Not this purpose.
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,909.265,912.14,"Well, to use it for drug detection purposes, that's right."
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,928.865,934.659,"Mr. Garre, there's no dispute that dogs can smell what human beings can't; is that correct?"
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,944.514,946.171,"--They have a much better sense of smell, that's right."
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,947.325,956.321,"So you have to treat him like a guy, to think that he is not like technology in terms of augmenting what a human being can do."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,956.321,957.043,--Well--
2012.11-564,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,957.043,959.585,He's not augmenting what a human being can do.
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,961.742,966.663,"--He's -- the dogs, no doubt, have an enhanced sense of smell compared to the officer."
2012.11-564,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1031.948,1033.04,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-564,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1033.04,1035.977,--Thank you.
2012.11-564,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1035.977,1050.456,Ms. Saharsky.
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1050.456,1054.003,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-564,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1068.947,1081.597,"I didn't -- I didn't understand the concession to be that the police had come to the door with the dog, the sole purpose of the dog being to detect contraband."
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1081.597,1084.503,"--Well, let me give the Court specific citations on that."
2012.11-564,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1145.884,1156.538,"You're agreeing with Mr. Garre that the police could take a dog and go down every house on the street, every apartment in the building?"
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1156.538,1163.206,"--Well, assuming that the police can lawfully be in the place that they are going with the dog, which is conceded here--"
2012.11-564,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1163.206,1165.0,A house just like this house.
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1165.0,1173.107,"--If they are approaching the front door using the normal path, because the dog only detects contraband, yes, they could be used in those circumstances, but that's not happening."
2012.11-564,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1175.17,1184.243,"Well, so any home, any home anywhere, and we should say that that's okay, and we can say it's okay because the government won't use it?"
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1184.243,1190.241,"--There are justices that have warned about this for over 30 years, and these problems have not come to fruition."
2012.11-564,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1195.443,1204.549,"This Court has dealt with an item that was seized before, a piece of luggage, a car."
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1210.905,1228.632,"--But in Caballes, where admittedly the Court did not decide this specific issue, it distinguished the case of Kyllo as saying that that was finding out about lawful activity in the home, and that a person -- the critical distinction between Kyllo and the dog sniff in Caballes is that a person does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in contraband."
2012.11-564,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1228.632,1234.052,"I just -- again, as I told Mr. Garre, I just can't accept that as the premise for the case."
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1251.171,1257.527,"Well, I wanted to be sure to respond to that, Justice Kennedy, because I would hate for the Court to have the impression that all the rules go out the window."
2012.11-564,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1265.556,1265.977,That's fine--
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1265.977,1266.461,--to get a warrant.
2012.11-564,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1266.461,1270.739,"--but don't ask me to write an opinion and say, oh, we're dealing with contraband here, so we don't need to worry about expectation of privacy."
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1282.75,1296.48,"Well, the reasoning in contraband -- in Jacobsen, though, the Court said that the rationale, the reason for its decision in Place, is because when you're talking about people's reasonable expectations of privacy, they have both a subjective and an objective component."
2012.11-564,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1308.193,1317.814,"Again, I don't think the cases go that far because those were cases in which the contraband -- Jacobsen -- was in plain view."
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1328.827,1334.684,"--What we're trying to say, Justice Kennedy, is not that you lack any privacy expectation in the home."
2012.11-564,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1342.555,1343.429,That's fine.
2012.11-564,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1345.148,1348.304,"How does what you're saying, Ms. Saharsky, square with Karo?"
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1374.98,1380.413,"I think that my answer touches on the point that you made, which is it was not contraband."
2012.11-564,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1395.219,1396.454,"Well, not lawful uses in somebody's house."
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1403.591,1411.807,"Well, with respect, Your Honor, the defense counsel I think correctly suggested in the Karo oral argument that, in fact, there are lawful uses in photography labs in houses and the like."
2012.11-564,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1447.729,1451.181,But in Kyllo -- and I think this was what Justice Kennedy was saying.
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1458.866,1469.423,"Well, with respect, when we look at the -- when we look at the language in these cases, in Caballes and the like, you know, the Court wasn't saying, oh, it's not a search because this has already -- this had already been seized and nothing more was happening."
2012.11-564,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1487.102,1498.47,"Yes, but I -- what I'm curious about, and it's an unanswered question for me, is we are considering whether the dog sniff is permissible, so I wanted to know what a dog sniff at the front door involved."
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1547.841,1550.138,"This sniff occurred very quickly, and it--"
2012.11-564,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1550.138,1553.153,It was 5 to 10 minutes and it's 96-97.
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1553.153,1554.089,--Right.
2012.11-564,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1582.594,1587.949,"Could I follow up on Justice Breyer's question, because it strikes me as a little confusing."
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1603.3,1606.848,--The 5 to 10 minutes as I read the record was the whole process.
2012.11-564,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1610.955,1612.203,And the whole process is -- is what?
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1612.203,1624.701,"--That they were -- that they met at the front gate, that they were walking up to the -- to the door, that the dog did the sniff, that the -- that he talked to the other officer, and then he went back to his car, which was parked I think some -- some length of time away."
2012.11-564,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1625.528,1628.402,It doesn't take the 5 to 10 minutes to walk to the door.
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1632.82,1634.009,"--Well, the dog sniffs."
2012.11-564,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1643.131,1646.332,Where -- where in the -- where in the record do I find the few seconds point?
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1646.332,1652.532,"Well, I think the -- probably the cites that -- that Justice Breyer gave are the cites that describe it."
2012.11-564,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1655.171,1657.032,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-564,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1657.032,1657.593,Thank you.
2012.11-564,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1657.593,1668.933,Mr. Blumberg.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1668.933,1671.511,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-564,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1696.312,1703.23,"That's your first reason and I don't want you to be deterred from giving us the second, but if we can concentrate on that for a minute."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1762.019,1771.139,"Justice Kennedy, I would add a few words to the end of that statement: Anything that an individual seeks to keep private in the home, and that's the difference."
2012.11-564,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1775.995,1783.088,"Well, the police officer talked with somebody at the police station, or walking down the street about what their occupation is, do they work at home."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1786.929,1788.743,"--Certainly, but in that hypothet--"
2012.11-564,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1788.743,1791.772,"Well, then your broad statement simply does not work."
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.772,1796.787,"Suppose you -- you have someone who, who has been guilty of a crime."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1822.727,1829.348,"--In that situation, the person inside the home has knowingly exposed what is inside the home to the public."
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.348,1830.288,Oh -- he hasn't knowingly.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1831.598,1836.004,"Well, but I -- I understood under your hypothetic that he knowingly left the blinds open."
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.004,1838.613,He certainly wanted to keep it -- he wanted to keep it private.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1838.613,1843.453,"Well, certainly; and the defendant in Reilly wanted to keep the marijuana private."
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.453,1844.205,"Well, you could say the same thing here."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1856.137,1857.198,"Well, that--"
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1857.198,1858.212,They were careless.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1858.212,1867.649,--I -- I don't believe there is anything in the record to indicate that the air conditioner was blowing the smell of marijuana out from the house in a very strong manner.
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.288,1869.006,There were the mothballs.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1869.006,1879.784,"--There were mothballs there, and Detective Bartelt, the dog handler that was standing at the front door as well, testified without contradiction or without hesitation he didn't smell anything."
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1889.762,1891.229,What were the mothballs there for?
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1891.229,1899.243,--The mothballs presumably were there to -- to mask the smell of an odor coming from the house.
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1899.243,1899.633,"Okay, then--"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1899.633,1902.023,It's manifesting an expectation of privacy.
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1902.023,1903.54,"--Well, that's my question."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1909.506,1916.081,"The expectation of privacy on the -- in the details, what's going on inside your house."
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1916.081,1928.169,"Well -- well, no, that can't be right, because if you're letting smoke out that -- that -- I don't know, from the burning of a body or something, you don't say, well, because he's trying to conceal that you can't rely on the smoke."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1928.169,1930.184,But that's knowingly exposing what's inside the house.
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1930.184,1951.285,"So I guess the question here is, if you appreciate the fact that the odor is coming out to the extent that you're going to put mothballs all around the house, it seems to me that you -- you may have an expectation of privacy in the marijuana plants, but you don't have an expectation of privacy in the odor, because you're emitting it out, out into the world, and it's the odor that was detected."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1951.285,1962.89,"But assuming that's what the mothballs were there for, that's to keep the odor inside the house, so that the public cannot find -- cannot detect that odor, unless you go up there--"
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1962.89,1974.179,"That's like saying you put the -- the drugs in a -- in a bag to protect them from observation on the outside, but you use, you know, a clear bag rather than a, you know, opaque one or something."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1983.472,1989.597,--There's -- there is really no evidence in the record as to -- the only people who testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress were the two police officers.
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1989.597,1993.719,"Well, I think your first reason is -- is so broad, it is clearly incorrect."
2012.11-564,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1996.578,1999.795,"Yes, I was going to ask for your second, your second point."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,1999.795,2012.399,"Well, the -- when a police officer takes a narcotic detection dog up to the front door of the house, that is also a Fourth Amendment search because that is a physical trespass upon the constitutionally protected area of the curtilage of the home."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2012.399,2015.287,"You know, we've had hundreds of years of trespass cases in this country and in England."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2026.362,2039.434,"Well, there are cases that go back to the -- I'm sorry, I don't have the, the citations -- but there are cases in the 1700s that established that basically a dog running on to someone else's property is a trespass."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2039.434,2040.716,"That really wasn't my question, was it?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2040.716,2045.665,I thought your question was if a dog comes on to private property--
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2045.665,2051.681,"If a dog on a leash is brought up to the front door of a person's house, was that a trespass at the time when the Fourth Amendment was adopted?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2051.681,2056.115,"--If it was without the consent of the homeowner, yes, it was a trespass."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2056.115,2057.398,What is the case that says that?
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2057.398,2058.521,I do not have a case.
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2058.521,2059.52,You don't have the case.
2012.11-564,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.52,2060.834,You're assuming the conclusion in these things.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2087.631,2089.082,Well--
2012.11-564,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.082,2095.47,"--to protect a person with a dog coming up to the door and going [indicating,] all right?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2097.907,2105.124,--My response to that is that does violate the resident's reasonable expectation of privacy.
2012.11-564,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2105.124,2107.514,"And then the question was, as Justice Alito put it, why?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2127.535,2139.297,"My response to that is that any entry onto private property in the 1700's was a trespass, was the tort of trespass, unless it was with consent."
2012.11-564,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2139.297,2154.87,"What about, Mr. Blumberg, the government cited many, many pages in the record, I just took the first one, petition -- appendix to the petition, 104 and 105."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2168.223,2169.612,"Absolutely not, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-564,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2195.32,2195.757,Okay.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2203.084,2208.739,"If the police officer is perform -- is knocking on the door, part of a knock and talk, yes; but, if the police--"
2012.11-564,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2208.739,2210.252,"But smells it himself, so there's no problem there."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2243.849,2254.577,"--Well, whether it's a Cockapoo or Franky, who, from all the pictures, appears to be a very cute dog, it's not what the dog looks like, it's what the dog is doing on the front porch, which is--"
2012.11-564,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2254.577,2256.017,The dog does what your neighbor's dog does.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2256.017,2260.606,"--Well, no, this dog -- the neighbor's dog does not search for evidence on your front porch."
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.951,2274.54,"But, Mr. Blumberg, I think you're, with respect, misguided to concede that if it was just the officer alone without the dog, it would be perfectly okay."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2274.54,2277.21,"I did not mean to concede that, and I was going to say that."
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.21,2277.772,"Well, I thought you did."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2277.772,2279.02,I was about to return your--
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.02,2293.745,"And I would assume you would say that if the officer walks up there with no intention to knock and talk, but just walks up to the door with the intention of sniffing at the door, you would consider that to be a violation, wouldn't you?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2293.745,2295.777,--And that was the point I was going to make in response to Justice Kagan's question.
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2295.777,2300.916,"--Well, our Fourth Amendment cases are very clear that they don't turn on the subjective intent of the particular officer."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2300.916,2302.132,And I am not arguing that.
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2302.85,2307.35,I thought you just said it depends on whether or not he's going up to the door to sniff or going up for something else.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2307.35,2310.645,"--It depends what the officer does at the front door, not what his state of mind is."
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2315.956,2319.891,"Yeah, sure, if he's down on his knees; but, what if he goes up to the front door and sniffs?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2321.532,2322.702,--That's--
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2322.702,2323.295,--he's got to breathe.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2335.45,2338.184,--It is not because he is not performing any type of search.
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2338.184,2341.963,"So it depends on -- but if he's going up to sniff, it is a violation?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2341.963,2342.587,Not going up to sniff.
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2344.287,2345.352,What if he goes to--
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2345.352,2349.583,"--and starts searching around, looking in the windows--"
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2349.583,2350.132,"--he goes to deliver the tickets, and he sniffs?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2355.409,2358.894,"--No, because he's not performing any kind of search."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2360.688,2363.452,"Well, he doing exactly the same thing."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2374.184,2379.589,"--No, and I am not in any way, shape or form tying it to the subjective intent of the officer."
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.589,2380.057,All right.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2396.361,2397.297,I believe the language--
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.297,2401.734,And it's fine to say -- I don't think it's true that the intent of the officer is never relevant.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2416.229,2421.665,--The language in this Court's opinion in Jones is for the purpose of conducting a search.
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2421.665,2426.239,"Can odors be in the equivalent of plain sight, plain smell?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2441.169,2442.356,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2442.356,2445.51,So this depends upon how strong the odor is.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2445.51,2453.258,This Court's decisions establish that a police officer does not have to close his eyes when he goes up to the front door of a house to do a knock and talk.
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2464.957,2469.376,If the -- let's say it's a townhouse that goes right up to the sidewalk.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2480.341,2482.419,"Well, that would not be a trespass."
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2483.604,2484.634,So it's okay?
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2484.634,2495.381,"--No, it's not okay, respectfully, because the dog would still be revealing details inside the home that the officer could not reveal using his or her ordinary senses."
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2497.004,2498.146,"Well, let me make sure I understand you."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2515.312,2521.886,"Well, but I assume on your hypothet it's a policeman walking with his narcotics detection dog up and down the street."
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2521.886,2522.433,Sure.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2522.433,2524.339,A dog that he knows is trained--
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2524.339,2524.963,He's walking the dog.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2532.914,2533.881,--Yes.
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2539.801,2542.69,But you do say that this is an easier case.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2542.69,2553.231,"This is an easier case, of course, because the police officer in this case -- and not only the facts of this case, but the question presented is going up to the front door of a home."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2553.231,2569.944,"I thought the relevance of technology was that the technology that we have now was not necessarily -- was not -- much of it was not available at the time when the Fourth Amendment was adopted, so we can't tell what the -- what people in 1791 would have thought about it."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2574.818,2576.534,"Dogs were around, Justice Alito--"
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2576.534,2583.908,"--and they've been used -- and they've been used to detect scents for 10,000 -- for thousands of years."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2587.671,2596.028,"--But in 1791, dogs had not been trained to detect criminal activity within a house -- not -- I'm sorry--"
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2596.028,2598.637,"But they had been trained to track people, had they not?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2598.637,2599.168,--Yes.
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2601.043,2619.113,"So in 1791, if someone -- if the police were using -- or somebody was using a bloodhound to track someone who was suspected of a crime, and the bloodhound -- and they used the bloodhound to track the person to the front of -- to the front door of a house, would that have been regarded as a trespass?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2619.113,2623.234,"--Yes, I believe it still would have."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2623.234,2625.547,And what's the case that says that?
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2625.547,2634.185,"Well, the -- I do not have a case that says that taking a bloodhound up to the front door of a house would be a trespass."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2644.994,2646.398,Without implied consent.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2646.398,2646.71,--Right.
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2646.71,2647.836,Actual or implied consent.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2647.836,2656.19,"I don't believe a homeowner, back in the 1700's, impliedly consented to police coming up to the front door of his house with a bloodhound, even though everybody knew they could do that."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2656.19,2675.169,"Well, are there cases that say that the implied consent exists only where the person is coming to the door for a purpose that the homeowner would approve if the homeowner knew the purpose of the person coming to the door?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2675.169,2678.932,The specific doctrine is implied consent by custom.
2012.11-564,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2686.539,2694.206,"How is that different from what Justice Breyer I think correctly indicated, our inquiry as to whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2706.451,2707.858,It's very similar.
2012.11-564,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2712.81,2713.886,Let me ask this.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2737.908,2742.985,--If the homeowner chooses to engage in conversation with that officer and his conversation is overheard on the microphone--
2012.11-564,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2742.985,2745.122,It doesn't occur to him that that mike is on.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2745.122,2749.216,"--But, again, when you talk to the police officer, that's a reasonable possibility."
2012.11-564,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2760.042,2762.85,"But -- but maybe it is a reasonable expectation, maybe it isn't."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2776.688,2792.212,"--But, again, this particular case is not -- the question presented does not hinge on whether or not a normal officer could smell it, because this officer, Detective -- I'm sorry -- Detective Bartelt said he did not smell it."
2012.11-564,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2792.212,2794.587,It does hinge on what is a reasonable expectation of privacy.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2794.587,2794.883,It does.
2012.11-564,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2794.883,2795.964,And that's what we're trying to find out.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2795.964,2796.588,It does.
2012.11-564,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2796.588,2799.4,"I'll look at this later, but I'm rather surprised."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2838.211,2839.303,Correct.
2012.11-564,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2840.632,2849.441,"So what is it in Jones that said what we're supposed to look at is not behavior, but the subjective intent of the officer?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2849.441,2865.48,"--It's the language in Jones that says one of the elements in determining whether or not a physical trespass constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment is, is there a physical trespass, onto a constitutionally protected area, for the purpose of conducting a search."
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2867.403,2871.244,What is the constitutionally protected area in this case?
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2871.244,2873.056,"--In this case, the curtilage of the home."
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2873.056,2877.631,Even though it's the sidewalk where people -- there's an implied license for people to walk up to--
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2877.631,2878.118,"Well, that was your--"
2012.11-564,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2878.118,2879.429,"I mean, it may be a search."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2879.429,2881.039,--It's not a sidewalk here.
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2882.302,2883.55,"It's not the sidewalk here, is it?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2883.55,2885.848,"No, no, it's the front door of the home here."
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2885.848,2886.628,"--No, it's the front part."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2888.612,2890.768,Only -- only to do certain things.
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.768,2894.203,There's -- there's an implied license to -- to go on to the curtilage for most people.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2894.203,2894.64,Yes.
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2894.64,2898.014,The curtilage is -- is not sacrosanct to do certain things.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2898.014,2909.462,"Such as to try to and sell Girl Scout cookies, to knock -- even a police officer can go on to the curtilage, to knock on to the door -- I'm sorry -- to knock on the front door, to try and engage the person inside the home in a conversation."
2012.11-564,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2909.462,2917.991,"Could we go back to the concession that was asked of you, what you conceded in the Florida court or didn't?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2929.752,2934.313,If what the police officer was doing at the front door was a knock and talk.
2012.11-564,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2935.062,2941.372,Did he have -- did he have a right under the facts of this case?
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2952.493,2953.273,--Without the dog.
2012.11-564,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2953.273,2956.147,"Let's -- sans dog, yes."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2956.147,2956.943,"Yes, yes."
2012.11-564,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2958.834,2959.458,All right.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2966.723,2975.075,"A police -- there's implied consent for a police officer to go up to the front door, knock on the door and attempt to engage the person in the house in conversation if they open the door."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2975.075,2975.719,So why is that?
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,2993.664,2996.32,In terms of consent?
2012.11-564,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3008.452,3016.418,I guess the bottom line is that are you taking -- it sounds to me like you're saying there's no implied consent to bring a dog on to my property.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3016.418,3017.903,Absolutely.
2012.11-564,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3020.009,3027.431,"You're -- Mr. Garre said differently, that there is an implied consent for your neighbor to bring the dog up for anyone else but a police officer."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3035.849,3048.516,"I think a strong argument can be made that there is no implied consent for anyone to bring a dog up to the front door of your house, because, as you pointed out, a lot of people don't like -- don't like dogs and -- and some people are allergic to dogs."
2012.11-564,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3048.516,3053.265,I thought you were talking about a dog trained to detect contraband--
2012.11-564,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3053.265,3053.639,Yes.
2012.11-564,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3053.639,3054.918,--not just any old dog.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3054.918,3057.121,"We are, but I believe the hypothet was just any dog."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3074.583,3081.891,You draw a distinction between dogs that are not drug detection dogs and ordinary dogs.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3095.559,3098.932,In terms of the right of that officer to come up to the house and knock on the front door?
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3098.932,3099.369,"To knock on the front door, yes."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3099.369,3102.336,"No, there -- there wouldn't be any distinction to that."
2012.11-564,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3110.662,3111.785,Not a police officer.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3159.001,3167.42,"And -- and just to clear up the factual, I don't believe that -- that what happened here in terms of the use of the drug detection dog took 5 to 15 minutes."
2012.11-564,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3228.333,3240.859,"Mr. Blumberg, the Florida appellate court, yes, the court of appeals, did say that that the officer and the dog were lawfully present."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3243.779,3249.606,"Well, that's -- I did not make that concession and -- no, I certainly did not concede that, but the court found that."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3275.471,3277.019,"Well, don't we have to accept that?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3278.204,3279.874,I'm sorry.
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3280.47,3284.03,Do we not have to accept that as a statement of Florida law?
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3284.03,3285.84,--No.
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3285.84,3286.686,No?
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3286.686,3287.216,No.
2012.11-564,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3287.216,3287.669,No.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3287.669,3290.995,The issue is whether or not that's a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3318.813,3324.765,"Maybe this is the same question Justice Alito asked earlier, but people have different senses of smell."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3347.377,3357.032,--I think that would lead more to a determination that there was a trespass because they selected the officer who had the best sense of smell to go up to that door.
2012.11-564,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3359.731,3360.265,To do a knock and talk.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3362.34,3369.698,"--Well, but there's -- knock and talks are okay; but, under your hypothet, it appears that the knock and talk was -- was not really what the officer was going up there for."
2012.11-564,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3371.449,3374.526,You're on a really slippery slope with that answer.
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3377.161,3377.852,--Right.
2012.11-564,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3377.852,3385.533,They knock to hope the person comes to the door and that they can see something from the door.

2012.11-564,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3390.501,3391.5,In terms of our rule--
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3391.5,3392.611,I don't--
2012.11-564,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3392.611,3403.137,"--that if they select somebody with a sense of smell because they have gotten a tip of drugs in a house, that we give up, in that situation, the assumption that they went to investigate."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3403.137,3403.792,--No.
2012.11-564,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3410.168,3413.728,"--He knocks, and he says to the neighbor, who are you?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3419.053,3421.05,--That -- that would be fine.
2012.11-564,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3423.597,3426.704,"But if he smells first and asks the question second, that's not okay?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3426.704,3427.048,"--No, no."
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3468.188,3475.219,"I thought the reason -- I thought the rationale in Jones, what Jones added, was that it is a search if it was a trespass."
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3475.219,3477.013,Yes.
2012.11-564,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3477.013,3484.465,"And so I come back to the very first question I asked you, do you have any authority for the proposition that this would be a trespass?"
2012.11-564,2,26600,howard_k_blumberg,,3491.367,3500.502,I don't believe any court has faced this issue as to whether or not taking a police dog up to the front door of a house is a trespass under the common law.

2012.11-564,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3567.743,3568.289,--Yes.
2012.11-564,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3579.286,3582.893,But the point is that he's sniffing all the way around the scene.
