1991.90-681,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.522,"Well hear argument next in Number 90-681, Barbara Hafer v. James C. Melo, Jr.--"
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,53.301,59.205,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-681,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,213.455,215.055,May I ask you a question right now?
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,221.792,227.879,--The issue would be no different.
1991.90-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,384.044,390.948,You mean that's what they... is that they way they put it?
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,390.948,394.417,"There were 11 complaints, Justice--"
1991.90-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.417,395.102,Is that the way they put it?
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,395.102,408.66,"--In that one complaint, the eleventh complaint, six of the Gurley plaintiffs have sought reinstatement against the Auditor General in her official capacity, and money damages against her--"
1991.90-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,408.66,409.862,And expressly so stated?
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,409.862,412.112,--And expressly so stated in that one complaint.
1991.90-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.695,603.57,"Mr. Richter, if you're not acting in your official capacity, does 1983 apply at all?"
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,612.307,613.009,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.675,618.996,How can you be under color of State law if you purport to be acting only in your personal capacity?
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,618.996,626.232,"--As... as we see the Will decision, Your Honor, acting under color of law is separate and apart from the capacity in which you act."
1991.90-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.803,633.003,"What does it mean, then?"
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,643.361,656.936,"--My understanding of the definition of ""acting under color of law"" is a misuse of power possessed by virtue of State law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of State law."
1991.90-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.073,664.692,Would you read that again?
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,664.692,667.159,Misuse of power--
1991.90-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.159,667.893,Right.
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,667.893,670.261,--Possessed by virtue of State law--
1991.90-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.261,670.878,Right.
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,670.878,672.797,--And made possible only--
1991.90-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.797,673.83,Right.
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,673.83,677.365,--Because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of State law.
1991.90-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.365,679.565,Doesn't that mean acting officially?
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,679.565,685.638,"We submit that it does not, Your Honor."
1991.90-681,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,697.528,713.038,"In a 1983 case, is it useful to analyze in what capacity a public official acts beyond the question of under color of State law?"
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,724.263,740.105,"This Court has consistently been dealing with the issues of capacity up until 1989, based on its interpretation of the immunities and the Eleventh Amendment issues that drove those decisions."
1991.90-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,787.717,792.788,"Well, Will said they were separate... really, separate considerations."
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,792.788,794.838,"Absolutely, sir, and--"
1991.90-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.838,799.025,Do you think Ex parte Young applies in 1983 cases?
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,799.025,802.477,"--Well, Ex parte Young was not a 1983 case--"
1991.90-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.477,803.344,I... that isn't what I asked you.
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,803.344,811.683,"--No, I understand, sir, but Ex parte Young in our submission is still very much a viable doctrine."
1991.90-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.599,813.449,Under 1983?
1991.90-681,0,32725,jerome_r_richter,,817.884,820.586,"--It provides... it provides, as we know, for prospective relief."
1991.90-681,1,44748,william_goldstein,,1423.348,1431.204,"Mr. Chief... Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1991.90-681,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1618.508,1627.095,"How do we know when it's a personal capacity suit, and how specific must the complaint be, do you think?"
1991.90-681,1,44748,william_goldstein,,1627.095,1648.86,--In order to be an official capacity suit under Kentucky v. Graham it is necessary to allege that the governmental entity was the moving force behind the deprivation of civil rights and that the entity's policy and custom played a factor.
1991.90-681,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2084.891,2087.726,"Thank you, Mr. Goldstein."
1991.90-681,2,32725,jerome_r_richter,,2090.746,2092.63,"Thank you, sir."
1991.90-681,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2159.941,2172.499,"In your view, Mr. Richter, do the plaintiffs in this case then have no chance of monetary relief against the State Auditor?"
1991.90-681,2,32725,jerome_r_richter,,2172.499,2199.566,"In our position, they... they have no right... they never had a right to seek monetary damage against the Auditor General since she's acting in her official capacity in the firings, is not a person, and their relief that they seek ought to be limited to either prospective relief or some other alternative relief."
1991.90-681,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.566,2221.58,"You know, we frequently have cases, and there are hundreds of cases around, where people are suing policemen or prison guards for damages for violating their constitutional rights and wanting an injunction to keep them from doing it."
1991.90-681,2,32725,jerome_r_richter,,2232.954,2234.406,That--
1991.90-681,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.406,2241.643,--But they are... but they were acting in their official capacity just as surely as your Auditor was.
1991.90-681,2,32725,jerome_r_richter,,2241.643,2242.659,"--Well, may I respond to that?"
1991.90-681,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.867,2256.533,"Well, what about--"
1991.90-681,2,32725,jerome_r_richter,,2256.533,2256.9,Here--
1991.90-681,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2256.9,2258.667,--What about State prison guards?
1991.90-681,2,32725,jerome_r_richter,,2258.667,2265.571,--Here we're only addressing the function of hiring and firing as being within official capacity.
1991.90-681,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.87,2413.214,"Of course, in the preceding sentence the Court would be... pointed out that they were confronted with the question of whether Congress intended to create a cause of action against States, to be brought in State courts."
1991.90-681,2,32725,jerome_r_richter,,2413.214,2413.697,That's correct.
1991.90-681,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.697,2414.214,Yes.
1991.90-681,2,32725,jerome_r_richter,,2414.214,2415.999,Thank you.
1991.90-681,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2415.999,2418.466,"Thank you, Mr. Richter."
