1960.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,26.942,"Number 63, Eugene C. James, Petitioner, versus United States."
1960.63,0,39321,richard_e_gorman,,29.675,41.318,I am Your Honor.
1960.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,741.435,748.937,"Well, in principal, what is the difference between embezzlement and extortion so far in this context?"
1960.63,0,39321,richard_e_gorman,,748.937,760.441,The – the -- difference is in the type of the events as we see it and as I think the courts have pointed out.
1960.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,862.709,879.221,"Do you think that any court had two cases, one of embezzlement and one of extortion would, under the same circumstances, order restitution from the embezzler and not from the extortionist?"
1960.63,0,39321,richard_e_gorman,,879.221,894.493,"Oh that well maybe, but the distinction which this Court made, if Your Honor please, was that the likelihood of their being any chance that the extorter would be called to test if that that is very unlikely."
1960.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,894.493,896.087,Well does that change the principle?
1960.63,0,39321,richard_e_gorman,,896.087,907.447,It doesn't change -- it doesn't the principle except that this Court has held that in embezzlement cases there is no taxable gain to the embezzler.
1960.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,907.447,908.221,"Well, I understood."
1960.63,0,39321,richard_e_gorman,,913.578,915.639,"Not at all, and this Court has so stated."
1960.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,915.639,916.807,That they are consistent?
1960.63,0,39321,richard_e_gorman,,916.807,918.157,That they are consistent.
1960.63,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,919.109,924.52,Has there been any efforts made so far as you know that Congress changed at all in this respect?
1960.63,0,39321,richard_e_gorman,,924.52,926.55,"There has been, if Your Honor please."
1960.63,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,950.504,952.706,When was that proposed?
1960.63,0,39321,richard_e_gorman,,958.102,958.385,No.
1960.63,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,974.739,976.406,When was Wilcox decided?
1960.63,0,39321,richard_e_gorman,,976.406,980.671,Wilcox was decided in 1946.
1960.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1087.547,1088.781,You may.
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1091.361,1094.407,"Mr. Chief Justice, please the Court."
1960.63,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1137.587,1176.28,"One of the things that bothers me about this particular case is how a person, who makes a tax return on the basis on which this Court has said the return is proper, can be convicted willful default, willful evasion, willful avoidance, because if that Wilcox case have never been overruled, it was distinguished whether right or wrong it still there as subsisting authority and man follows it, why would a man who follows it -- how he could end up in prison, I don't understand that?"
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1176.28,1179.889,There is no contention along those lines made here by the petitioner.
1960.63,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1182.298,1184.68,I didn't find it in this brief but I'm asking you.
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1184.68,1189.844,"Well, there is nothing in the record to show that he filed his returns on the basis of the Wilcox case."
1960.63,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1212.311,1226.065,"Well, but if there -- that this particular -- Wilcox isn't cloudy it's a decision it's there and it's been -- it's been propped up as others decisions have combined."
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1252.196,1269.246,"Well, not only is the point not raised, there's no showing that these tax returns were filed and prepared on the basis of the Wilcox decision, as a matter of fact three of the returns for the four years in issue were filed subsequent to this Court's decision in the Rutkin case."
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1269.246,1278.37,I presume though you were saying the Government on that side that he is supposed to know the law.
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1289.664,1296.538,"Well, we would say that on the evidence that District Court properly found that he intended to deprive -- to fraud the Government here."
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1311.806,1334.509,"Well, undoubtedly they had enough evidence, I suppose, to show that he embezzled this and had not reported this embezzlement funds, but there would also but behind that, at least were usually accepted the Congress changes it, he didn't have to report it 14 years ago."
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1334.509,1350.897,"Well, our position would be on that that even if he had shown at the trial, and again I want to emphasize, he offered no evidence whatever dealing with reliance under Wilcox decision and in fact three of the tax returns here were filed post Rutkin, but in any event even he had shown --"
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1350.897,1353.611,But Rutkin didn't -- did Rutkin overrule that?
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1353.611,1354.733,In our view it did.
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1354.733,1356.056,Did it say so?
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1356.056,1364.181,"It did not say so explicitly, but in our view, it's an inescapable conclusion that we derived from the reasoning of the Rutkin decision."
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1371.618,1374.525,But I think I argued that.
1960.63,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1374.525,1380.304,"(Inaudible) suggestion, five people escaped what you said couldn't be escaped?"
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1380.304,1422.44,"Well, I think the Court in the Rutkin case resorted to the technique of overruling a decision by distinguishing it and we say here that the Wilcox rule has with it a way that the Rutkin decision administered the mortal wound and since then the lower courts have chipped away at it and that really there is nothing left of the Wilcox rule at all, and we're here asking this Court to declare explicitly that which has been implicit and in fact applied by the lower courts, ever since the Rutkin case and the rule applied by the Rutkin case itself."
1960.63,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1422.44,1427.988,You want us to do it retroactively not respectively.
1960.63,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1427.988,1434.125,Is that a suggestion that was drawn by (Inaudible) --
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1434.125,1434.368,"Well, --"
1960.63,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1434.368,1439.629,-- (Inaudible)?
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1439.629,1444.604,"Well, the way it has turn out it means Mr. Wilcox specifically."
1960.63,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1444.604,1446.361,"How do you mean the way it's turned out, where?"
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1446.361,1472.696,"Well, we say this first that the legal criteria for the determination of taxable income which were set forth by the Court in the Rutkin case were really an embodiment of the basic principles of determining gross income which this Court has declared in many of the earlier income tax cases, Corliss and Bowers, Helvering and Hallock, the Horst case, Lucas and Earl, the basic principles for the determination of gross income."
1960.63,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1492.913,1494.513,Plenary right and so on.
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1494.513,1498.217,The basis for taxation exists and the lower courts have so construed it ever since --
1960.63,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1498.217,1502.942,"Well, it's not universally true, is it, the Dix case in the Second Circuit?"
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1502.942,1532.175,"Well, I was going to say where the exception of the Dix case, as a matter of fact Chief Judge Clark who participated in Bruswitz case but not the Dix case stated that in his view Rutkin was diametrically opposed to the Wilcox case and that the circuit courts who had -- which had been distinguishing Wilcox were calling at the process of distinguishing it out of deference to this Court but that in fact they had concluded as they logically they could conclude that the Rutkin case had overruled Wilcox."
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1538.598,1540.757,But the court proved it.
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1577.344,1577.577,They are both --
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1577.577,1585.223,Perhaps it seems to me like it's treating the opinion of the Court was to get respect if I may say so?
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1585.223,1586.04,"Well, we say --"
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1586.04,1591.848,The court intended thereby to leave -- overrule Wilcox case.
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1591.848,1596.882,We say that the legal criteria in Wilcox and Rutkin cannot be reconciled.
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1596.882,1598.732,You say they should've overruled.
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1598.732,1602.921,"No, we say that the court, in effect, overruled it."
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1623.192,1627.251,"You're adopting my argument in dissentient in part, are you not?"
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1628.387,1629.928,I was about to quote –-
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1629.928,1630.505,I think I said so.
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1630.505,1632.245,--that reference to Your Honor.
1960.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1633.067,1637.06,(Inaudible) that close the case.
1960.63,1,27167,howard_a_heffron,,1637.06,1638.188,"Well, I think that's right."
1960.63,2,39321,richard_e_gorman,,2493.562,2500.044,Just a couple of brief in my -- if Your Honors please.
1960.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2553.692,2555.992,They generally held that the facts didn't show embezzlement?
1960.63,2,39321,richard_e_gorman,,2555.992,2557.782,That is correct Your Honor please.
