1998.97-843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.648,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 97-843, Aurelia Davis v. the Monroe County Board of Education."
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,10.328,16.672,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,63.152,70.946,"May I ask, Ms. Williams, how you would propose to cabin this cause of action were we to agree with you?"
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,86.818,88.3,"No, Your Honor."
1998.97-843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,96.505,101.527,What standards would you think would govern to cabin this kind of a cause of action?
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,101.527,106.269,"First, I would recommend looking at the title VII standards."
1998.97-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.115,134.429,"Gee, but little girls always tease little boys and little boys always tease little girls."
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,135.191,138.664,"It's pervasive, but it is not severe."
1998.97-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.664,140.313,"In my experience, it's... it's severe."
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,140.313,142.723,But it doesn't always--
1998.97-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.723,144.694,Are you going to apply a reasonable... a reasonable teenager standard?
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,148.027,157.283,"--Well, the Department of Education has applied the title VII standards and given consideration as to how they would apply to the education context."
1998.97-843,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,161.617,190.826,"The concern... the concern is I think that if you simply take the same standards of title VII, i.e., anything that would be sexual harassment in the work place, when done by a co worker or a supervisor to a subordinate or a co worker, that which is sexual harassment there is also sexual harassment for which the school district is liable when a 7-year-old does it to a 6-year-old or a 13-year-old to a 12-year-old."
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,225.527,232.443,"--We understand the concern and we think that, first of all, the title VII standards wouldn't apply wholesale in the education context."
1998.97-843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,253.077,259.829,"I think then that every school district in the Nation should adopt guidelines and codes, as we've suggested for employers."
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,274.11,277.631,We're not suggesting that there are Federal standards for school behavior.
1998.97-843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,278.683,280.335,I thought this was a Federal statute we're talking about.
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,280.335,297.005,"--Well, we are talking about a Federal statute, but the Federal statute imposes the obligation on educational institutions to ensure that no person is excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under the education program or activity."
1998.97-843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,297.005,298.215,"Now, let's... let's... let's be very careful here."
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,301.097,301.448,Yes.
1998.97-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.448,301.988,Thank you.
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,317.228,320.43,The... the... the prohibition is broad.
1998.97-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.43,330.786,"Well, what if... what if parents, benighted as they may be, decide that they don't want their daughter to study science because they think girls shouldn't study science?"
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,335.331,339.264,The parents wouldn't be persons that are under control of the institution.
1998.97-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.939,355.166,I... I suppose the... the parents are under the control of the institution to the extent that the institution decides what course ultimately the student will take.
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,365.142,378.381,Title IX doesn't impose an obligation on the school to act in that instance any more than title VII would require an institution to step in if a husband didn't want his wife to work in a nontraditional occupation in the public employment sector.
1998.97-843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.381,398.794,"So, you think the language cannot be read literally, that it... it in fact does not mean that no one... when it says no one shall be deprived of the benefits of or subjected to discrimination under, it doesn't mean that it's the responsibility of the school to assure absolutely that that will be the result."
1998.97-843,0,43693,verna_l_williams,,398.794,402.476,"It would be difficult to say that absolutely everything, and certainly--"
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1168.98,1181.438,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.412,1217.83,Excuse me.
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1218.902,1222.745,--The question of cabining principles.
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1222.745,1223.106,"Oh, cabining principle."
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1223.106,1224.065,Cabining principles.
1998.97-843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1246.27,1270.864,"But I take it if... if it is pervasive, you know, if the kids gang up and the one... the... the object of the teasing really is... is... is left incapable of getting the benefit of the education, I take it your answer is... implicit in your answer is there's... there's no principle line between harassment and what we call teasing by... by primary grade children."
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1270.864,1282.562,"Well, when it's sufficiently severe as to deprive somebody of the ability to get an education and it's done on the basis of sex and the school fails to respond in a reasonable fashion, it seems to me that's--"
1998.97-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1282.562,1282.823,Excuse me.
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1302.377,1309.18,--I think the key here is that ordinarily there... there will be deference to the reasonable judgment of school officials.
1998.97-843,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1309.18,1331.175,"This is true... I can't believe that you're... I mean, I... I doubt... you seem to be saying that if... if X is sexual harassment when a teacher does it to a student, it is sexual harassment when a student does it to a student, when an employer does it to an employee, and the concern... I'll take that as a given."
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1393.255,1406.505,"But there's no reason why those discussions, counseling sessions, training, conciliation wouldn't be precisely the sort of response that would avoid deliberate indifference and would avoid liability."
1998.97-843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1412.129,1418.053,"Well, but if it continues again, there's another incidence of it, it fails, then there you go."
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1421.664,1427.297,--There's no... there's no requirement that a school guarantee that this not happen.
1998.97-843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1435.423,1471.836,"Well, that's very true, but I think our concern is... is a slightly different concern, and that is, if there is, as... as... as seems to be developing, no principle line between sexual harassment at the... at the... in effect, at the high end of the scale in high school and... and teasing in the first grade, then in every case in which there is pervasive teasing, which we all know goes on, there is a potential Federal case here whenever the parents are dissatisfied with the actions, which you quite rightly describe any reasonable school should take."
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1485.586,1493.921,"Well, I think the principle where to draw the line is in recognizing that the appropriate response of the school is different from the appropriate response of an employer--"
1998.97-843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1493.921,1498.133,"Well, that goes to the... that goes to the school's response when it gets into court."
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1498.133,1499.015,"--No, it doesn't."
1998.97-843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1499.015,1512.275,"But it still remains the case that the school is going to be subject to... to a Federal court action, and it is going to be Federal guidelines which will be implicated by the claim for every first grade pervasive teasing incident."
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1512.976,1536.15,"Well, of course, it's always possible to bring a lawsuit, but the cases that have developed so far and presumably, should this Court adopt this rule, the courts could quickly establish what would be a basis for summary judgment, that is, what sort of that... that it would only be a failure of... of the... that rises to the level of deliberate indifference that would be a basis for--"
1998.97-843,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1536.15,1548.159,"Well, is it possible that under title IX the harasser must be an agent of the school district and the district must have actual knowledge and act with deliberate indifference?"
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1552.463,1557.195,--I don't think it's... it's true to the purpose of the statute.
1998.97-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.887,1589.726,You... you keep saying that.
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1600.495,1603.837,"The more severe it is, the clearer it is that the school has to respond."
1998.97-843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.837,1604.068,"I suppose that's right, but... but--"
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1609.652,1612.403,And fails to respond appropriately to.
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1612.403,1612.733,And fails to respond to.
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1612.733,1619.225,"And ordinarily... as amici for... for the schools here point out, ordinarily schools do respond."
1998.97-843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1632.556,1641.512,"But the point... but the point is you do not have to show, under the statute, as Justice Scalia suggests and as I understand it, that the students cannot learn as well."
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1654.111,1658.926,--It depends on whether the school has failed to respond reasonably or not.
1998.97-843,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1669.252,1677.917,"But not... Ms. Underwood, I think the point is are you distinguishing between the student who can't learn she's so upset or the one who says, this is horrible."
1998.97-843,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1684.111,1684.512,--No.
1998.97-843,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.609,1757.732,"Thank you, Ms. Underwood."
1998.97-843,2,45900,w_warren_plowden_jr,,1760.914,1772.812,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1811.328,1816.61,"Mr. Plowden, can I give you a hypothetical that occurred to me as I listened to the dialogue in the last argument?"
1998.97-843,2,45900,w_warren_plowden_jr,,1816.61,1817.331,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
1998.97-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1817.331,1821.573,Just let's get away from the sexual harassment scenario for just a moment.
1998.97-843,2,45900,w_warren_plowden_jr,,1856.024,1864.841,"Your Honor, we draw a bright line here between acts of misconduct of adults on the one hand, as you had in Gebser, and the acts of misconduct of children."
1998.97-843,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.841,1869.835,Misconduct for the adult in my hypothetical is that the adult did nothing about it when fully informed as to what happened.
1998.97-843,2,45900,w_warren_plowden_jr,,1869.835,1876.667,"Yes, sir, but the underlying predicate for that, presumably the intent to discriminate, is the group of boys that are--"
