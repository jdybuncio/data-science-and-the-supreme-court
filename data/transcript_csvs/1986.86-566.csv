1986.86-566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.891,"We will hear argument next in No. 86-566, Barclay Perry and James Johnston versus Kenneth Morgan Thomas."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,56.837,122.629,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issues on this appeal from a decision of the California Court of Appeals for the Second Appellate District are whether that court in affirming the order of the Los Angeles County Superior Court in denying the petition of appellants to compel arbitration of the claims asserted against them first incorrectly based its decision squarely on whether, which it says in so many words in the opinion itself, whether it disregarded the ruling of this Court in Southland versus Keating, whether it failed to follow the ruling of this Court in Dean Witter Reynolds versus Byrd by refusing to sever the nonwage claims which it felt were nonarbitrable under Labor Code Section 29, and referring the balance of the claims to arbitration, and whether it erred in applying Labor Code Section 229 in the first instance, contrary to the Federal Arbitration Act and in violation of the supremacy clause."
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,188.72,190.756,There was an express provision for arbitration?
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,190.756,191.306,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,191.306,192.322,In his employment contract?
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,192.322,193.791,That is found--
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,193.791,199.728,It wasn't just a reference to New York Stock Exchange rules or anything like that?
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,199.728,200.512,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,201.312,202.314,"Well, that is all I really need."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,202.314,203.464,--That is Page 33A.
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,209.818,210.92,But this is express?
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,210.92,212.536,"This particular one says,"
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.981,231.981,"Well, that is by reference."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,231.981,237.818,"Well, the reference is only as to the ambit of the arbitration agreement."
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,259.648,260.5,All right.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,260.5,262.766,And I might say there is no issue but that he signed it.
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,273.391,276.61,And your clients here claim to be third party beneficiaries to that agreement.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,277.093,290.936,"That's correct, and their standing in that situation had been established 12 years ago in Berman versus Dean Witter Reynolds in the state courts of California, and by the Ninth Circuit in 1986 in the Latitzia decision."
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,317.437,319.053,But the court just assumed it in this case.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,320.989,321.605,--In--
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,321.605,322.907,This particular litigation.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,329.395,331.347,"--That's correct, the Court of Appeals did."
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.347,331.913,Yes.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,331.913,334.798,Because Mr. Thomas contested that.
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,341.902,348.122,Were these... were your clients employed by the same employer at the time he signed this contract?
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,348.122,348.572,Exactly.
1986.86-566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,390.999,401.807,"The standing issue really turns on state laws, doesn't it, how far... what the extent of the contract between the two of you is, and how far the Cal Labor Code extends?"
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,401.807,405.676,I don't think the first question was ever raised or is a problem in this case.
1986.86-566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,431.76,438.414,"The California Court of Appeals here unreasonably, I guess, in your view, read it so it did conflict."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,438.414,444.568,"Well, the California Court of Appeals squarely based its decision on Ware and says so."
1986.86-566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.984,579.506,"How does this line of argument bear on the question presented here, whether 229 is preempted by the Arbitration Act?"
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,579.506,586.945,Because 229 by its very words is limited to actions provided in Article 1.
1986.86-566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,600.686,609.025,"Well, are you saying that the interpretation that the California Court of Appeals made of Section 229 in this case, wherever it got it from, is wrong?"
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,609.025,610.042,Yes.
1986.86-566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,610.042,612.643,That is a question we just don't deal with here.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,612.643,613.46,But you did.
1986.86-566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.528,625.451,I would assume that the Ware decision took California law as it came from the California courts.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,625.451,635.99,"Well, I regret to say, Your Honor, that 229 had not previously been construed before the Ware decision came down from this Court in 1973."
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.99,638.592,"But your case doesn't depend on that, does it?"
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,638.592,640.211,On Ware?
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.211,644.496,"No, on the construction of the California statute."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,644.496,645.396,Absolutely.
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.368,656.986,"Well, that may be so, but you... how about your case?"
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,656.986,658.505,"No, my position--"
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.505,659.405,That is what I am asking you.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,659.405,661.79,"--No, I could simply say--"
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.79,662.107,Yes.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,662.107,663.524,--that no matter how you construe it--
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,663.524,665.942,You are bound to get around to saying that.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,666.542,667.461,--I think I have said it.
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.348,673.715,Exactly.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,673.715,675.465,But I don't think you need to go that far.
1986.86-566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.465,680.002,"We don't really much care, Mr. Dolan, how California chooses to interpret Section 229."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,684.906,686.806,"I appreciate that, except that--"
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.806,698.213,"You can't win... you can't win... you can't win except on this argument that that law is preempted, because as a case comes to us, we reach that law as a given."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,698.213,702.284,--I have a bit of a dilemma which I will explain to you on that point.
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.098,761.323,If you want to say you lose if Ware's construction of this section is correct--
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,761.323,761.89,--No.
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.89,763.473,"--You don't want to say that, do you?"
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,763.473,764.858,I do not want to say it.
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.653,787.021,"Well, I am not going to spend a lot of my time in deciding this case on what the construction of 229 is."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,787.021,787.488,--I understand.
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,789.223,790.607,"Well, you have been."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,790.607,794.794,"Well, the reason I raised it is with respect to the complaint."
1986.86-566,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.794,796.829,And you are still on a tangent.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,796.829,803.85,"If the complaint does not allege claims under Article 1 of the Labor Code, then 229 simply doesn't apply, no matter how you construe it."
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1050.24,1054.275,"Mr. Dolan, before you... can I go back to standing for just a second?"
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1065.633,1070.054,"No, the position is, the Berman case says that nonsignatories--"
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1070.054,1071.171,Which is the Berman case?
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1071.171,1076.208,--Berman versus Dean Witter Reynolds is the 1975 California Court of Appeals case.
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.208,1081.945,As a matter of California law nonsignatories may enforce an agreement of this kind as third party beneficiaries?
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1081.945,1084.58,"That's correct, and it was an agreement of this very kind."
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.663,1095.788,"But is it not true that as a matter of California law insofar as this agreement provides for the recovery of wages, it is unenforceable... it is not unenforceable, just unenforceable in arbitration?"
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1097.388,1098.388,I would differ with that.
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.388,1103.225,"In fact it is... no, the agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable as a matter of California law."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1103.225,1110.196,"Well, that is where I think that... that assumption is made but that is not what the statute says."
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.196,1113.048,Isn't that what 229 says?
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1113.048,1114.0,No.
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1151.006,1156.426,"Whatever it provides, apparently the author of the opinion didn't think the ellipses were very important."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1156.426,1159.027,"Well, I think this Court should."
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1185.429,1187.295,"Well, let me ask you... put my question this way."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1210.877,1214.698,"No, the arbitration agreement itself is not otherwise unenforceable."
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.964,1225.551,"Well, insofar as it has relevance to this litigation, which I take it from the California opinion is assumed to be a wage claim within the meaning of the statute."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1225.551,1227.436,"--Well, therein lies the problem."
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.045,1247.566,The common law torts and the like aren't covered by the Arbitration Act.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1247.566,1253.153,"No, but California case law has unequivocally held that torts are subject to arbitration."
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1272.049,1273.634,"I don't think it was a question of standing in that case, was it?"
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1273.634,1274.851,--No.
1986.86-566,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.851,1293.362,"All of my inquiry is not directed to the merits, but merely as to whether there is standing as a matter of Federal constitutional law, which as I understand it you rely for... the predicate for your whole standing argument is a California rule of law which makes this contract unenforceable insofar as it relates to this controversy."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1293.362,1297.999,"Well, the case in controversy existed well before we ever got to the California decision."
1986.86-566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.582,1379.632,Do me one favor.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1405.15,1406.15,That's right.
1986.86-566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1406.15,1424.48,"Now, you really have to refer to the rules to see what a claim by any other person means, and how does any other person mean a co-employee under the arbitration rules to which this provision refers?"
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1424.48,1428.349,The decision of the California Court of Appeals in Berman versus Dean Witter Reynolds.
1986.86-566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1449.263,1450.763,Twenty-one.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1452.548,1456.167,"Unfortunately, when they took a picture of this to reduce it for the size of the brief, it got a lot smaller."
1986.86-566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1457.317,1468.725,"That question that you just answered for Justice Scalia is a question of California contract law, I take it, whether this particular agreement embraces a particular situation."
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1468.725,1475.211,--Or specifically whether or not Johnston and Perry are the beneficiaries of the arbitration agreement.
1986.86-566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1475.211,1475.794,Yes.
1986.86-566,0,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,1475.794,1476.18,Yes.
1986.86-566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1479.032,1480.498,"Yes, you may."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1487.352,1515.252,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court, there are certain rights which are sacred and fundamental in the law, and as this Court recognized in 1973 in its unanimous decision in Ware, foremost amongst those is a wage earner's rights to the fruits of his labor, not to just part of the fruits of his labor, but to all of the fruits of his labor."
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.147,1587.282,Are we dealing with the Federal Arbitration Act in Ware?
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1588.967,1590.835,That I think you foresaw that that is the 20 percent--
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1590.835,1591.719,"--Yes, that's the 20 percent."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1591.719,1595.037,"--that may be in dispute, but let me answer it this way."
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.487,1618.453,"Oh, that is not so."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1626.343,1627.109,"Well, it would--"
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.109,1631.394,"The fact is, this wasn't raised or addressed in Ware, was it?"
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1631.394,1654.426,"--Your Honor, I would like to point out that this Court was fully mindful of the Federal Arbitration Act as it cited it at Footnote 15 of the Ware decision, and it is difficult to believe that the Ware case would have turned on whether or not the attorneys for Merrill Lynch were perceptive enough to raise the Federal Arbitration Act instead of just the state Arbitration Act."
1986.86-566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1654.426,1679.643,"The treatment of Ware... the Federal Arbitration Act in Ware may suggest that the Moses Cohn decision and the Southland decision were somewhat unforeseeable, but I think you have a hard time saying that... reading the Ware opinion in saying that that court viewed the Federal Arbitration Act the same way the Court viewed it in Southland."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1679.643,1688.833,"Well, the Federal Arbitration Act, Mr. Chief Justice, has been in effect long before Ware, and any impact it would have would have been fully available to this Court."
1986.86-566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.833,1691.451,"Yes, but it was rediscovered in Southland."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1691.451,1700.474,"Well, as things get rediscovered, the legislative intent does not change with the passage of time."
1986.86-566,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1712.781,1713.447,"But that lost, of course."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1717.833,1720.018,"But, Justice O'Connor, it was a very perceptive opinion."
1986.86-566,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1720.018,1720.951,"Well, of course."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1720.951,1723.987,I felt that perhaps you could persuade your brethren on the bench.
1986.86-566,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1723.987,1724.589,Without doubt.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1729.874,1730.826,I say to the majority--
1986.86-566,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1730.826,1733.076,You really have a problem.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1733.076,1763.38,"--I say to the majority that when we are dealing with a commercial dispute, perhaps that is appropriate for arbitration, but if we look at Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, there is a savings clause which says that certain disputes are not going to be arbitrated where they fall within a matter of law or equity and are revocable on those grounds."
1986.86-566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1837.262,1861.793,"But it is one thing for the Court to say that, as it did, I believe, in Ware, that California was entitled to reconcile its Section 229 in its state Arbitration Act in a particular way and this Court would accept it, but it is another thing to say that the same reconciliation would have to take place between the Federal Act and the California statute."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1861.793,1872.435,"Your Honor, that would presuppose that there is a difference in the policy between the Federal Arbitration Act and the Securities and Exchange Act."
1986.86-566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.91,1933.974,"xxx particular argument if the promise to arbitrate here made no reference whatsoever to the New York Stock Exchange rules, but the arbitration provision said, I agree to arbitrate, and then they listed all the agreements, all the kinds of disputes that were to be arbitrated, and that this case involved one of those listed."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1935.442,1937.96,If it involved one other than for wages?
1986.86-566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.96,1946.733,"No, just whatever... it involved the very dispute that is here, which is for what?"
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1948.649,1953.22,The dispute is over wages and different theories for recovering wages and different remedies for the--
1986.86-566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.22,1953.67,All right.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1962.493,1962.943,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.211,1975.586,"All right, but you couldn't be making an argument based on Congressional intent not to preempt in the securities laws."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1980.72,1988.457,"Your Honor, we believe that there is a Federal common law that would protect the wage earner on this case and that Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act says that there are exceptions."
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.826,1994.628,I think you are missing Justice White's point.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,1994.628,1995.178,--I am sorry.
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.178,1999.765,I think the point is that it is sort of the tail wagging the dog.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2041.509,2046.996,"Your Honor, I believe the policies are the same or similar as they relate to the two."
1986.86-566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2105.034,2110.605,"Mr. Gelber, what do you mean by the issue of standing in this case?"
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2110.605,2127.865,"What I mean by the issue of standing is that where we have a controversy over the right to compel arbitration, the party compelling arbitration has to have some vested interest or vested right such as a third party beneficiary right to raise--"
1986.86-566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2127.865,2132.102,That party has to have a contractual right to compel arbitration?
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2132.102,2133.185,--Correct.
1986.86-566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2133.185,2137.589,And where do we look for a determination of that question?
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2137.589,2139.756,I was going to get to that.
1986.86-566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.4,2159.686,"But it is a matter of California law, isn't it?"
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2163.388,2169.727,"Right, but I believe the interpretation would apply to this Court sitting in view of the agreements."
1986.86-566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.144,2184.736,"But we don't have any independent law of contracts here, since Erie Railroad against Tompkins, it is up to California to decide what a California contact means."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2184.736,2188.521,"--Unfortunately, the Court of Appeals didn't address the issue, and--"
1986.86-566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.521,2191.057,They certainly did by implication.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2191.057,2198.977,"--Because they felt that it was not timely raised, and they were in error on that point, as I have pointed out by reference to the record here."
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2237.469,2248.341,"Are you saying that the... is your point that the Exchange Act rules, their scope is a question of Federal law rather than California law?"
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2248.341,2253.562,--I would have to defer on... I do not have the answer for you as to what rule of construction would apply.
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.975,2277.677,"What about the cases that Mr. Dolan referred us to, Becker and another California--"
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2277.677,2278.377,And Berman.
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2301.209,2303.327,--What difference would that make as to whether--
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2303.327,2307.029,"Well, because they are an indispensable party to the agreement."
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.235,2319.603,--What about Becker?
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2319.603,2324.99,"I am not familiar with that enough to respond, Your Honor."
1986.86-566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.593,2367.15,But this promise to arbitrate that was written in the contract does on its face and under California law refer to disputes with co-employees.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2367.15,2369.435,"--That's right but, it incorporates by reference--"
1986.86-566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.435,2373.954,"I know, but it incorporates by reference just the kind of disputes."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2373.954,2377.291,--It actually mandates the arbitration--
1986.86-566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2377.291,2387.064,"The kind, the type of... the description of the arbitrable disputes in the rules, the Stock Exchange rules."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2387.064,2394.135,--What it says is that the... Mr. Thomas need only arbitrate those disputes which are required by the Exchange.
1986.86-566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2394.135,2403.491,But your position renders with any other person just... in the contract just makes it surplusage.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2403.491,2407.394,"Well, that is the... they are the drafters of that agreement."
1986.86-566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.394,2420.802,"Well, I know, but I think the reference to the New York Stock Exchange rules could certainly mean that just referring to the types of disputes that would be arbitrable."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2420.802,2430.041,"Well, I believe the exchange rules specifically say that you need only arbitrate those disputes with a member corporation and let me show you a different--"
1986.86-566,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.041,2430.893,That is a different point.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2430.893,2436.111,"--Okay, but let me tell you how I think it would apply here, Justice White."
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2632.207,2634.09,I don't understand what you are saying.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2649.769,2650.736,"--Yes, Your Honor, that--"
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2650.736,2651.519,It is.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2651.519,2656.487,"--That would simply, to my thinking, that would simply--"
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2656.487,2657.204,It is perfectly constitutional.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2657.204,2660.791,--turn the judicial system on its head.
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2661.658,2662.725,This is a private contract.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2674.748,2682.371,"--Well, Your Honor, I could only draw an analogy, perhaps, to a different area that may raise the Court's suspicion."
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.933,2776.833,"xxx Federal constitutional law of void contracts... contracts void because of undue influence or... you know, there are a lot of state laws that make certain contracts unenforceable because they are oppressive or one-sided or something, but I never heard of a theory that as a matter of constitutional law we are going to go around picking out those contracts that are just so egregious that they can't be enforced."
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2797.079,2803.9,"--Well, I believe it falls upon the judiciary to fashion the limitations on the Federal Arbitration Act--"
1986.86-566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2803.9,2804.967,You want us to take a run at it.
1986.86-566,1,17652,bruce_gelber,,2804.967,2816.058,"--as a matter of Federal common law, and I believe in so fashioning such a remedy that the Court would draw upon basic senses of fairness and fair play."
1986.86-566,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2819.26,2821.195,"Thank you, Mr. Gelber."
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,2823.814,2828.516,"Very briefly, I would like to respond to the points raised by Mr. Gelber."
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2913.055,2917.007,"You said without regard to the arbitration agreement, why wouldn't that procedure be preempted, too?"
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,2917.007,2920.894,--Because that is the authority of the state.
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2921.61,2931.25,"No, but under Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act it seems to me it would preempt that procedure if the wage earner had signed an agreement to arbitrate."
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,2931.25,2935.237,--The question is whether or not the Federal Arbitration Act would preempt 206.
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2935.237,2936.67,Would preempt the California procedure you just described.
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,2939.956,2946.126,"Well, that... our view of the case is that this is not essentially a wage claim, and the claims that occur in the case are not."
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.126,2947.712,If it is a wage claim.
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,2947.712,2948.612,If it is a wage claim--
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2948.612,2953.532,In your view could your opponent use the California procedure you have just described?
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,2953.532,2957.651,"--Well, or we could raise, perhaps, the arbitration agreement as a defense as a practical matter--"
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2957.651,2960.119,I am asking you whether that would be a good defense in such a proceeding.
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,2962.754,2964.673,"--Frankly, Your Honor, I haven't focused on it."
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2967.958,2968.641,"The answer is, you don't know."
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,2969.258,2969.591,--No.
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2977.731,2978.331,I don't care why you want it.
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,2995.424,2997.543,"--I appreciate those, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3004.379,3008.766,"No, you are telling me what your view of the issue you have asked us to decide is."
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,3015.087,3022.158,--My position is that it would not prevent the labor commissioner from making the inquiry.
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3022.158,3023.776,I don't think that is an answer to my question.
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,3023.776,3030.53,"Well, I am trying to parse out the role of the state agency under the legislation."
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.53,3039.202,Does it have the power to decide the issue in the face of an objection that the Federal statute has preempted this particular procedure?
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,3039.202,3040.654,Because of the arbitration agreement.
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3040.654,3041.971,"Yes, and that is what you are arguing."
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,3050.61,3066.22,"The private litigant, Mr. Thomas, would be bound by the arbitration agreement, and we could contend that his claim presented to the labor commissioner was barred by the arbitration agreement and the Federal Arbitration Act."
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.22,3067.139,I know you could contend that.
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,3073.576,3074.293,I suppose the answer is yes.
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3074.293,3074.859,All right.
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,3074.859,3075.995,"But, having said that--"
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3075.995,3077.345,Then it isn't available to them.
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,3077.345,3095.222,"--Having said that, I am not saying that the labor commissioner is precluded from undertaking his statutory investigation with respect to all of the things covered in Article 1, and therein lies the difference in applying 229."
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3103.478,3106.514,In other words you say he has got to investigate but he couldn't make a decision.
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,3111.251,3117.072,"--No, among other things the labor commissioner can do is bring an action in the name of the State of California for a penalty."
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3168.937,3172.889,"But it would be okay for them to collect a penalty, so is his punitive damage claim then not preempted?"
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,3172.889,3175.191,"No, the penalty is payable to the State of California--"
1986.86-566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.191,3175.524,I see.
1986.86-566,2,37846,peter_brown_dolan,,3175.524,3182.93,--expressly provided in the statute that the action is brought in the name of the labor commissioner and payable to the State of California.
1986.86-566,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3182.93,3184.514,"Thank you, Mr. Dolan."
