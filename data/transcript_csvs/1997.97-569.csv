1997.97-569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument now in No. 97-569, Burlington Industries v. Kimberly Ellerth."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,10.439,14.224,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,43.41,44.279,Mr. Casey.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,44.279,44.729,--Yes.
1997.97-569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,44.729,56.92,"It sounds to me like you're asking question 2 of the questions presented on petition for certiorari, which is whether strict liability is the proper standard."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,64.239,65.108,That is correct.
1997.97-569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,65.108,67.808,Most of your brief addresses question 2.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,73.279,86.106,"Justice, the... the... the question... question 1 is the un... is whether or not the strict liability standard ought to apply in the unfulfilled threat situation, where... where there is no adverse job consequence."
1997.97-569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,86.106,89.891,"Well, it doesn't address strict liability actually."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,103.199,103.983,"Yes, Justice."
1997.97-569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,104.617,106.519,It... it doesn't refer to strict liability.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,106.519,116.291,"--Under... under the assumption, Justice, that in... that most courts, who have addressed the issue, have addressed quid pro quo as a strict liability issue."
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.952,162.356,"Well, there... there's really no other reason to have the quid pro quo category, is there?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,162.356,164.239,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.239,166.658,Except to establish a different standard of liability.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,166.658,167.308,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,167.908,175.747,The statute doesn't... doesn't establish different kinds of sexual harassment... quid pro quo and... and environmental harassment.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,175.747,176.364,"--No, it does not."
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.03,177.449,"That's not in the statute, is it?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,177.449,178.332,"--It does not, Your Honor."
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,234.118,254.616,"When you say VII, you are just asserting that there is a different standard for the employer?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,254.616,255.282,"Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.282,258.817,So everybody agrees that this kind of claim is stated under Title VII?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,258.817,262.686,This is a... this is a claim for discrimination by reason of one's gender.
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,262.686,266.155,"And then how did we come to this distinction, then?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,274.66,276.112,"It... it does, indeed."
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,311.035,319.122,"Do we have a race or national origin case where there's a negligence, as opposed to vicarious liability?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,319.122,320.141,Not from this Court.
1997.97-569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.34,359.933,"So suppose this supervisor... let's use race as an example... suppose a supervisor says, I'm not going to promote you because you're Asian, Hispanic, whatever, and a week later does promote the person."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,364.67,370.074,"In that one instance, I would say there is not."
1997.97-569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,370.074,371.141,There is?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,371.141,372.474,There is not a violation.
1997.97-569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,372.474,373.457,There is not.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,373.457,384.782,If... if there was repeated... repeated and... and repeatedly hostile comments made by the supervisor to the employee because of his national... I think there then would be a violation.
1997.97-569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,385.615,389.019,And do you analogize what happened here to the hypothetical that I... I gave you?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,389.019,390.186,--I do.
1997.97-569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,407.58,412.884,"Well, suppose in the case that I... that I put the promotion... the case where I put it was... that she was promoted the next week."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,412.884,413.618,--Yes.
1997.97-569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,413.618,420.972,"Suppose in the race hypothetical the promotion isn't going to come up for a year, but the supervisor has said that."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,430.263,431.546,I think... I think there is no harm.
1997.97-569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,435.064,437.416,"Despite... despite the insult and the personal hurt, et cetera, et cetera?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,437.416,448.807,"--Well, I don't think, Your Honor, that one insult is sufficiently severe to rise to... to a hostile environment, as... as bad as it may--"
1997.97-569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.807,477.124,"Well, what if... what if you have a situation of a supervisor for a large corporate employer who routinely orders a female employee under his supervision to go to a certain isolated place, where the supervisor can be alone with this employee and repeatedly then tries to use that opportunity for sexual gratification... repeatedly?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,493.919,501.942,"--Your Honor, in... in the example you just gave, I believe that there... there is very likely a quid pro quo."
1997.97-569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,503.508,503.875,No.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,505.894,507.846,--All right.
1997.97-569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,510.612,521.153,"That the supervisor uses his supervisor... supervisory authority to place the employee in... in this situation, where he can then take advantage of her."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,521.153,521.403,--Okay.
1997.97-569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,521.403,522.436,And does so repeatedly.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,522.436,522.837,Okay.
1997.97-569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,533.477,539.448,"But the employer is not negligent, the employer tells all their supervisors to be careful, don't do this."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,539.448,550.423,"--By... by issuing orders to isolate an employee, I believe he is using the authority vested in... in... in... vested in him by the... by the employer."
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,550.423,550.856,All right.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,579.692,582.477,"No, Your Honor."
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,582.477,582.894,Why not?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,582.894,583.677,Because it--
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,583.677,585.262,What could be more hostile than that?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,585.262,597.736,"--Because he... he... he has one... well, in terms of the hostile environment, Your Honor, the... the courts have routinely... the circuit courts of appeal have routinely held that a single incident--"
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,597.736,598.436,"Oh, quite."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,651.204,664.298,"--For liability... Your Honor, for liability, for an employer to attach in an hostile work environment, there has to be some... some indication to the employer that he knew... the employer knew or should have known."
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,664.298,665.664,But why... why not?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,688.913,699.352,"Because, Your Honor, in... in the... in the example... or the hypothetical that Your Honor posits, the supervisor has done nothing but speak words."
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,700.137,708.125,"Well, but he has done nothing in Justice O'Connor's hypo except speak words, except that he has done so somewhat less explicitly than he does in my case."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,718.033,731.24,"--On the contrary, Your Honor, in Justice O'Connor's hypothetical, as I understood it, the... the supervisor repeatedly ordered the employee off to a isolated place where... where he could then take advantage of the employee."
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,733.275,734.242,But she resisted.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,749.987,749.987,"--Your Honor, in a... in a submission case, I would... I would argue that, in a submission case, that if the employee reasonably believed that submission was a term and condition of employment, I believe then there would be strict liability... if she reasonably believed--"
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,749.987,769.698,Okay.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,798.282,805.121,"--In... if I can modify my... not modify my answer, but if I can clarify my answer on... on the submission."
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,827.885,831.003,"Well, that's... that would all be for a trial if there were a trial."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,835.121,835.287,--On summary judgment.
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,835.654,839.423,So we don't know anything about what employees... we know that there was a policy.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,847.095,848.862,"We... we know... we know something in addition to that, Your Honor."
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,875.679,879.298,We... we know... we know two things: That there was a policy and she didn't use it.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,895.843,899.027,"--Your... Your Honor, and... and I'm not going beyond the summary judgment record."
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,914.221,914.989,Where is that?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,917.223,933.451,"--That's in the record, Your Honor, at... I will find it, Your Honor."
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,936.253,946.275,"What... what is the relationship between your reasonably believe standard and the standard either of employer negligence or, for that matter, employer strict liability?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,946.275,949.377,I... I don't understand.
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,949.377,968.458,"Well, I understood you to say a moment ago, in response to Justice Ginsburg's variant on the question, that if the employee reasonably believed that he could carry out... that the employer could carry out threats, even though those threats had not at that point been carried out, that there would be a hostile environment."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,976.295,980.515,"Your Honor, I... I... perhaps I misspoke."
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,997.358,1005.381,"But... but if she reasonably believed it and did not submit, even on a claim of hostile work environment, there would be no liability, period?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1007.583,1012.92,"In the hostile work environment, unless there... there is some evidence that the employer knew or should have known."
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1012.92,1014.92,May I ask a question on that point?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1035.665,1039.904,"Your Honor, I think in this... in the... in the situation you describe--"
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.904,1040.354,Yes.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1040.354,1045.708,--there would be... there would be the standard of the company should have known.
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.925,1048.476,"Well, but it's open only in Chicago."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1055.664,1057.932,And he was responsible for this office?
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.932,1060.05,"Well, he had exactly the duties he has in this case."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1063.602,1066.621,"I believe... I believe, Your Honor, if he was aware of open--"
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.621,1067.187,"--Yes, he's aware of it."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1067.754,1072.941,"--and... open and notorious conduct, of... of a hostile environment for female employees, it would be notice to the company."
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.975,1076.31,"--Well, then why isn't it notice to the company when he does it himself?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1076.31,1082.297,"--Because, Your Honor, he did not fulfill the threat."
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1087.201,1090.737,"What if he told the president about... about the case, the president of the company."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1097.074,1100.009,I'm missing the--
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.009,1103.829,"The question... part of the question is, A, is there a violation?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1119.756,1124.576,--I do not believe so.
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.976,1129.712,So... so it isn't a question of whether we hold the company responsible.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1132.23,1135.266,"--Well, if there's no liability, there's no... there's no violation."
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.266,1135.749,Right.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1143.421,1143.904,"No, that's correct."
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.904,1144.737,Yes.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1144.737,1145.573,And... and... and I don't--
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1145.573,1147.339,"So that's the reason, if there were notice to the company--"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1147.339,1148.858,--and I don't think it rises to a hostile work environment.
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1148.858,1151.893,--Can... can I ask you something about Justice O'Connor's hypothetical?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1151.893,1153.059,"Yes, certainly."
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.059,1165.867,"You said that where... where the company officer takes the woman aside to an isolated place where he can make his sexual advances, that that would... that would be automatic liability on the part of the employer?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1165.867,1166.45,Your Honor--
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.45,1167.75,That would be a quid pro quo case?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1172.937,1176.388,--To order her to isolated parts of the... of the factory.
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1176.388,1176.788,--What would you call that?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1177.94,1187.696,"I would... in... in that circumstance, Your Honor, I would say that is quid pro quo, because... because he is exercising the... precisely the authority--"
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1187.696,1189.246,"Well, what if he tells her to come over to the water cooler?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1198.236,1201.29,"--I don't... I'm making the distinction, Your Honor."
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1203.356,1215.596,"I had thought the quid pro quo was just those... those company actions which, in themselves, amount to an alteration of the terms and conditions of employment, like firing, promotion and so forth."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1215.596,1216.346,--I think--
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.346,1225.035,"But you're willing to say quid pro quo is... is what, any... any action that... that an officer of the company has authority to tell somebody to do?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1225.035,1225.369,--No.
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1233.958,1236.743,"Well, it isn't constant isolation, as I understood her hypothetical."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1244.849,1245.583,Justice--
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.583,1246.783,--then I could see a quid pro quo.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1246.783,1247.316,--Justice--
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.316,1249.068,But he just pulled her aside to make his proposition.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1249.068,1255.139,--Justice O'Connor's question was repeatedly... repeatedly ordered her to an isolated part of the factory so he could do that.
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.139,1255.389,"Oh, I see."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1259.923,1260.223,That's correct.
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.223,1260.656,All by herself there?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1260.656,1261.042,That's correct.
1997.97-569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1262.658,1263.125,Mr. Casey--
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1285.738,1287.39,That is correct.
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1287.39,1287.924,Okay.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1288.959,1291.309,"Environmental hostility, correct."
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1291.309,1291.828,--Right.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1322.03,1326.899,"It... Justice Souter, it may well be a hostile environment."
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1335.905,1348.08,"Well, but I'm leaving aside the... and maybe... maybe I'm isolating the question too much for... for... for your tastes... but I'm... I'm suggesting for a minute let's leave aside the standard for imputing liability to the employer."
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1364.59,1365.474,That's correct.
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1365.474,1383.837,"And your... your only point of difference then, I guess, with your opponents on that isolated point is that you say there's got to be more than one threat, just as there has got to be more than one hostile remark, if you will, in order to create the environment?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1383.837,1385.653,Correct.
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1385.653,1386.872,One... one instance--
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1386.872,1388.289,One instance does not create a hostile environment.
1997.97-569,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1388.289,1412.321,"--And you're saying that the fact that the hostile environment and the unfulfilled quid pro quo situation is created by a supervisor, with more authority than let's say just a fellow employee, that doesn't make any difference in the calculus of how many instances there have got to be before we can conclude that the environment has in fact become hostile; you're saying that really is not relevant?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1412.321,1414.607,I... I don't... I do not believe that to be relevant.
1997.97-569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1414.607,1414.973,Okay.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1425.997,1429.466,"My understanding, Your Honor, is... is this for that."
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.755,1439.774,Simply where it's proposed or where it happens?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1439.774,1440.44,--Where it happens.
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.44,1441.257,Where it happens?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1441.257,1442.174,Correct.
1997.97-569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.174,1443.042,You mean--
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1443.726,1451.648,"--where... where... where something is proposed by... by the... by the supervisor, but not necessarily acquiesced in by the employee, I take it?"
1997.97-569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1456.767,1457.0,Yes.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1458.086,1459.852,And I don't promote you.
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.852,1460.504,--Yes.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1484.053,1485.036,"Your Honor, if... if he gets--"
1997.97-569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.036,1486.103,It's an interesting theory.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1486.103,1488.255,"--No... no, it's... but that's... but that's not precisely the theory."
1997.97-569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1500.396,1518.007,"And in the case where it is... in the case where it is the violation, he makes the proposition, it's refused, and she is not promoted, and the person who did it is the vice president of the company, why doesn't the company know about it?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1526.513,1531.934,"Because he... he... excuse me, I didn't mean to interrupt you... because he didn't act with the authority given him by the employer."
1997.97-569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1531.934,1532.517,--All right.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1545.474,1547.709,"No, I don't... I don't think that's actually the case, Your Honor."
1997.97-569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1552.763,1553.097,But if we're talking--
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1554.979,1557.931,"--If he's bluffing in both cases and she had no reasonable belief, I think there's no violation."
1997.97-569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1557.931,1582.38,"But in your view, there... in your view... this is what I was trying to get at... there is nothing in this case in respect to authority, apparent authority, agency... all the things that we discussed in previous cases that were recently argue... in that area, there is nothing different here; the only thing that is different in this case is whether or not the quid pro quo is in fact substantively irrespective, is that right?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1582.38,1590.152,"In the face... in the face of a clear policy in the company, she could not reasonably believe that he had the authority to do... there is no apparent authority--"
1997.97-569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1590.152,1600.342,"I mean, but I know that you... I'm trying to figure out, is there anything in the question that we are being asked to decide that is different from the question in the two cases that were recently argued here?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1600.342,1601.225,--Absolutely.
1997.97-569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1601.225,1603.294,And there is one thing that seemed different.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1612.333,1613.518,The--
1997.97-569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1613.518,1616.035,"And now, other than that, is there anything different?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1616.035,1617.236,"--Yes, Your Honor, the difference--"
1997.97-569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1617.236,1617.736,And what is that?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1617.736,1621.171,--The difference in this case is the standard of liability to be applied.
1997.97-569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1624.123,1626.409,"So if I believe it's strict liability, there's nothing different?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1627.459,1629.194,"Other than standard liability, that's correct."
1997.97-569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.194,1630.794,--But that... that's what we didn't grant certiorari on.
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1632.579,1637.133,"Your Honor, I'm... I'm tying the strict liability to the quid pro quo."
1997.97-569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1645.237,1646.739,"Mr. Casey, how did all this come up?"
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1656.344,1663.7,"--Justice, it came up in the context, really, of the other violations of Title VII, in the race cases."
1997.97-569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1671.654,1673.237,Why... why should that be?
1997.97-569,0,29696,james_j_casey,,1683.26,1689.782,"--Well, this Court has... has instructed us, in Meritor, that we should look to agency principles."
1997.97-569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1706.975,1708.677,"Thank you, Mr. Casey."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,1711.279,1721.385,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1765.18,1765.93,Mr. Rossiello--
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,1800.27,1801.789,That's correct.
1997.97-569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1801.789,1813.228,"I mean, I... I don't see a lot of difference here than there would be to simply a hostile environment situation, where... where the threat is... is not carried out."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,1813.228,1815.296,"Well, the harm could or might be the same."
1997.97-569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1821.75,1822.868,"Well, I... I just don't see much difference now."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,1845.901,1847.534,It goes to the amount of damages.
1997.97-569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1861.243,1864.962,"Well, let's suppose it's a fabulous policy and very effective."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,1864.962,1865.529,--If we can find--
1997.97-569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1865.529,1866.731,"Now, what role does it play?"
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,1866.731,1867.364,--Excuse me?
1997.97-569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.364,1871.266,"What role should it play, if it's a perfect policy?"
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,1871.266,1873.301,Little to none on the liability issue.
1997.97-569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1886.209,1891.513,"Well, but might it go to the reasonableness of the employee's understanding when some comment is made?"
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,1907.039,1908.705,--The short answer to that is yes.
1997.97-569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1921.882,1929.452,"Well, but we've already explored the possibility that this is very much like hostile environment if the threat isn't carried out."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,1935.689,1951.116,"--Well, some case... if you look at Judge Wood's opinion, the first one, that was vacated in the Seventh Circuit, she seems to believe that quid pro quo sexual harassment also is a hostile work environment."
1997.97-569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.116,1952.734,"Well, what's wrong with that belief?"
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,1952.734,1953.151,Nothing.
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.436,1956.736,Could I follow up on that?
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,1956.736,1957.12,Sure.
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1957.12,1968.911,"You... you agree that where... where either she complies and... and the job action... threatened job action isn't taken or she doesn't comply and the job action still isn't taken, it's like hostile work environment."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2022.497,2023.014,Yes.
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.014,2023.897,Okay.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2023.897,2024.497,Because... right.
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.984,2030.651,You don't even need a threat.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2031.186,2032.853,--You don't need much necessarily.
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2032.853,2044.827,"--if he just makes a sexual advancement, she doesn't comply, she is fired thereafter, and if you can show that the reason for the firing was that she was not compliant, you... you've established a case, haven't you?"
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2044.827,2045.727,"Yes, you have."
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.727,2046.427,Whether there's been the threat or not.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2051.33,2051.813,Yes.
1997.97-569,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2051.813,2052.397,Okay.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2074.679,2075.663,Right.
1997.97-569,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2075.663,2100.045,"I suppose that a supervisor's threat, simply because it is that of a supervisor, may have more force, may be more powerful in creating a hostile work environment, even if it's only made once, than would one off-color remark or one proposition by a fellow employee without such power."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2105.699,2106.901,Well--
1997.97-569,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2106.901,2108.101,Which is essentially an evidentiary difference.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2108.101,2108.517,--There is.
1997.97-569,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2109.769,2110.203,Okay.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2110.203,2112.353,We're only on summary judgment here.
1997.97-569,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2113.471,2120.225,"With respect to that, if you've got a supervisor who just loves to... never makes kind of a thing,"
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2154.798,2159.084,"--Well, that is discriminatory conduct within the meaning of Title VII."
1997.97-569,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2165.94,2177.045,But nobody ever suggested in those days that there was something different between quid pro quo and a hostile environment and... and vicarious liability on the one hand versus knew or should have known on the other.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2181.699,2184.317,"--Well, we believe there should be one standard."
1997.97-569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2201.529,2202.613,"Well, let me ask you this."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2222.192,2225.144,"Yes, it would be."
1997.97-569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2225.794,2233.584,"And in fact, I noticed that in answering Justice O'Connor's question you said, but in a quid pro quo case."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2236.702,2237.752,"Well, it's so hard to--"
1997.97-569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2237.752,2239.352,Or at least you want to hold it in reserve.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2239.352,2241.321,"--You see, it's so hard to avoid it."
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.023,2261.651,"And we didn't start it, Mr. Rossiello, lest... lest silence indicate consent."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2262.367,2262.851,All right.
1997.97-569,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2264.103,2265.903,I don't see why it's a problem.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2277.577,2279.529,"Well, it is... it is instructive."
1997.97-569,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2279.529,2280.563,Instructive.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2283.398,2283.767,Yes.
1997.97-569,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.767,2285.4,And they're sometimes are followed by punishment.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2288.552,2289.671,"In many cases, yes."
1997.97-569,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.671,2314.536,"So there is actually... but if there is... if... to go back to our case, where... where there's a proposition turned down and no punishment, if it were true in that subset, in that subset of quid pro quo, that it is not a violation unless it is a hostile work environment, which depends upon circumstance and a lot more than just the bare facts I stated, how can you win?"
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2339.567,2340.019,Right.
1997.97-569,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2340.019,2342.888,Could you respond to my... what I'm worried about?
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2342.888,2343.171,"Yes... yes, I can."
1997.97-569,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2361.267,2370.289,"What are we supposed to do if... if... or what am I supposed to do if I thought that might still be there, in light of what the Seventh Circuit did hold, not what they should have hold... held?"
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2374.741,2375.075,--No.
1997.97-569,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.075,2375.693,All right.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2382.096,2389.584,"Well, I would remand this case for reconsideration of the whole claim."
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2390.119,2391.569,"He should regret that we did not accept your cross-petition, I suppose."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2391.569,2392.136,Well--
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2392.136,2393.738,We didn't accept it.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2395.021,2395.788,"--Well, it's still pending."
1997.97-569,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2397.356,2406.629,"Mr. Rossiello, as I understood what... what happened, was that you didn't surrender a hostile environment case, but you did surrender a simple negligence."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2428.494,2430.41,"Yes, I believe that's an accurate characterization."
1997.97-569,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2430.41,2452.192,"So that in the next round of this... let's assume you win this round... in the next round, if it is determined that in fact when a supervisor is involved and the action involves a threat of using the authority that the supervisor has been given by the company, negligence is not required."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2456.911,2457.744,Yes.
1997.97-569,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2467.785,2468.219,Right.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2475.123,2475.573,For sure.
1997.97-569,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2475.573,2476.475,"Yes, okay."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2476.475,2478.76,If there are no more questions--
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.76,2483.129,"Well, I don't... I just don't understand your response about his using authority that the company has given him."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2491.234,2493.067,"--That's true, the company has not."
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.067,2499.554,And I assume the company also hasn't given him authority to fire a woman for her failure to comply with his sexual proposition.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2499.554,2500.321,"No, absolutely not."
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2506.708,2508.16,I mean--
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2508.16,2512.279,--where a firing or discharge or a demotion or a pay... a pay differential is--
1997.97-569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.279,2515.397,"--where it occurs, you can say the employer has acted."
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2542.214,2545.416,"--Well, there's where you... we get into the hair splitting."
1997.97-569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2563.228,2566.18,You can finish your answer briefly to Justice Scalia's question.
1997.97-569,1,23042,ernest_t_rossiello,,2566.18,2566.564,All right.
1997.97-569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2574.685,2575.519,"Thank you, Mr. Rossiello."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2576.887,2590.647,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2618.381,2631.606,"Even when the employer's policy, which the woman knew about, specifically prohibits this, how... how could you possibly say that the employer was... was changing her terms and conditions of employment?"
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2635.26,2640.128,--Just as when a supervisor fires someone or demotes someone--
1997.97-569,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2640.128,2646.049,"Yes, but in... but in... but in that instance, the... the company is acting... the company has acted."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2656.673,2658.875,"--Justice Kennedy, there is."
1997.97-569,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2660.075,2666.279,And we'll... we'll leave aside hostile environment and repeated acts and pervasive discrimination and so forth.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2666.279,2678.087,"--The power to fire or to hire, to promote or demote, includes the power to state what the conditions are for doing that, to hold out threats and promises."
1997.97-569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2686.276,2687.895,"Well, you could say that, but it's not true."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2699.666,2705.772,"No, the company has given him the power to hire and fire, but not to do it for wrongful reasons."
1997.97-569,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2713.176,2713.743,"Well, but that's... that's--"
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2713.743,2714.545,--but not to do it--
1997.97-569,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2714.545,2715.512,--But that's the difference.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2736.808,2738.91,"--Well, a great deal has happened."
1997.97-569,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2747.23,2749.33,But... but that's never... that's never... never carried out.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2750.916,2753.551,"--Well, she doesn't know it's not true."
1997.97-569,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2758.053,2762.49,"Well, then she also learns that it's not carried out because she doesn't acquiesce and nothing happens."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2762.49,2771.18,"--If there are no damages, then that would be a matter for damages."
1997.97-569,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2772.23,2779.166,"Well, but there... there... my sense of the thing, if... if that is true, is that there simply isn't any liability."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2779.166,2785.439,"--Well, suppose the company fires somebody and she complains and she immediately is reinstated."
1997.97-569,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2787.455,2787.805,Sure.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2787.805,2789.991,There will be minor damages.
1997.97-569,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2789.991,2791.593,And suppose they don't discharge the person.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2795.545,2796.695,No.
1997.97-569,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2796.695,2798.663,He's wanting you to go collect unemployment insurance.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2799.713,2800.449,"No, you're not discharged."
1997.97-569,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2800.449,2800.982,All right.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2803.067,2804.001,"No, it doesn't."
1997.97-569,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.001,2804.434,All right.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2820.695,2823.045,"Well, this... this isn't just, I'm not going to give you a promotion."
1997.97-569,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2824.73,2831.318,"But suppose it is, I'm going to make you work in Timbuktu, or, I'm going to make you do some other thing terrible, but you don't."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2831.318,2834.503,"--No, what... what distinguishes this is the... the coercive effect it has right now."
1997.97-569,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2843.776,2845.828,"But if it has... if it has... if it has the bad effect, if they do something bad, she's hurt."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2845.828,2846.478,--Right.
1997.97-569,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2846.478,2856.452,"But you're saying the simple statement of saying it... so if you say something that never happens, because the person is a woman and it doesn't create a hostile environment, it still is actionable?"
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2856.452,2860.32,"No, not if they say because she's a woman, because that isn't attempting to coerce her to do anything."
1997.97-569,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2867.057,2872.728,"Ms. Underwood, supposing this supervisor had two employees, one a man and one a woman."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2886.638,2892.625,"Well, if it's on the basis of using your beach place, then it's not on the basis of sex."
1997.97-569,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2892.625,2897.244,"Well, but he's... he's asking favors from both males and females."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2897.244,2898.429,"Oh, I see."
1997.97-569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.324,2916.974,I see.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2932.0,2934.702,"--Well, that... that's the hardest case for the sex discrimination proposition."
1997.97-569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2934.986,2935.319,"--Yes, it is."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2937.238,2937.754,--Yes.
1997.97-569,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2938.321,2939.106,Ms. Underwood--
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2939.106,2940.256,But... but... yes.
1997.97-569,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2940.256,2942.307,"--No, finish... I thought you were finished."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2942.641,2964.221,"No, I want... I wanted, in response to some of those questions, to suggest that, for instance, if an employer said to the women employees or to the black employees that you have to work twice as hard as the men do in order to keep your job or to get a promotion or you have to do twice as much work or you have to work twice as fast or you have to do the... the... you have to, in addition to doing all the other aspects of your job--"
1997.97-569,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2964.221,2968.09,"And... and then the next... and the next day, a new supervisor comes in and says, We're sorry about that; that's wrong."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2975.779,2978.315,--There's a violation with de minimus consequences.
1997.97-569,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2991.722,2998.359,"Is there any case in any area of the law... I'll focus on the word ""discharge"", because it clarifies it conceptually."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3026.711,3027.195,--Not... not if the only--
1997.97-569,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3027.195,3027.845,--All right.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3028.33,3033.199,--there is not the case that to... that a discharge is equivalent to a promise to discharge.
1997.97-569,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3035.484,3046.042,"--Is there any case, then, under Title VII... well, but it's... you see, it's in... it's lined up certain things: hiring, discharge and discriminating in terms of conditions of employment."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3068.788,3080.363,"Well, I would describe the threat... if... if you describe the threat as altering her job responsibilities, altering what she has been told she must do to get a promotion, then the answer is yes."
1997.97-569,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3080.763,3091.904,"And can we tell from just the first threat... and this is the problem, Ms. Underwood, that I had understanding the government's position... there could be a threat and the company could have a very strong policy."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3125.661,3141.004,"--A genuine, credible threat, which could be communicated, depending on the circumstances of the particular case, by one, serious, credible statement by somebody who is known, for instance, to have carried out such threats in the past, notwithstanding the wonderful policy--"
1997.97-569,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3141.004,3145.705,"But suppose all you have is this... you have this vice president, who is a pest."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3153.478,3160.398,"--Well, I think you have an issue of fact about whether a genuine, credible threat, sufficient to support liability, has been made."
1997.97-569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3187.817,3190.401,Why does the threat... why does the threat make a difference?
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3223.075,3223.625,I... I... I--
1997.97-569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3223.625,3225.625,--there is no quid pro quo in the latter case.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3225.625,3226.359,"--No, I think they're the same."
1997.97-569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3226.359,3227.676,"They're not saying, Unless you do this, I'll do that."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3228.409,3235.382,"They are, in each case, imposing a new term or condition on employment by reason of race, in... in the hypotheticals that you've posed."
1997.97-569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3235.382,3235.665,--Right.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3237.465,3242.869,"No, the threat... the threat can be the mechanism by which the new condition is imposed."
1997.97-569,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3251.523,3252.408,What you're saying is--
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3258.129,3261.597,I'm saying it's a term or condition if it is--
1997.97-569,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.597,3270.602,"Even... even... even if the... if the supervisor says, You're going to have to work twice as hard because you're a woman, and she doesn't work twice as hard and nothing happens, he was bluffing all along, that's still a violation as soon as he said it?"
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3270.602,3281.208,"--Well, if he says it in a... in a sufficiently credible manner, so that she now... and everyone... and other people in the work place to whom it's said... anybody to whom it's said understands that to be a new term of employment under which--"
1997.97-569,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3281.208,3283.141,But how do you judge that just on the basis of the threat alone?
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3295.449,3301.586,"--Well, in general, it seems to me a good complaint procedure will serve many functions."
1997.97-569,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3312.977,3317.547,"But... but strict liability, which is what you're arguing for, will not encourage that."
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3330.822,3333.824,"Well, I don't... it's not so clear that that's so."
1997.97-569,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3343.449,3345.365,"It certainly will go to damages, won't it?"
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3345.365,3346.234,It would go absolutely to--
1997.97-569,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3346.234,3346.517,All right.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3393.062,3401.051,"--Well, it is similar to the hostile environment created by coworkers in the way that you suggest."
1997.97-569,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3409.574,3410.057,Okay.
1997.97-569,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3426.436,3430.887,"--The harm... yes, the harm that's caused is caused in the same way."
1997.97-569,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3431.839,3433.172,"Thank you, Mr. Underwood."
