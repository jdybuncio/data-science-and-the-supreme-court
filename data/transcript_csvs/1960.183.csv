1960.183,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,16.559,"Number 183 Eugene E. Maynard, Petitioner, versus Durham & Southern Railway Company."
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,27.142,30.799,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.183,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,392.667,394.876,"That's when he discovered this fraud, didn't t he?"
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,394.876,407.216,"Yes Your Honor, the Court did say that there -- that there was deliberate false statements made to deceive and which did deceive in that case."
1960.183,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,437.574,444.316,"Well, what -- what is your complaint that -- the copy that the North Carolina Supreme Court applied the wrong standard?"
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,454.132,491.925,"Your Honor, we feel that it's more than that, the -- we feel that the North Carolina court misinterpreted all of the federal authority apparently and while they didn't specifically said, apparently, they felt that the federal authorities require affirmative statements -- false statements or require some deliberate act of fraud and since there were no affirmative misstatements in this case, we feel that they let it go off on that and that tenure, but missing --"
1960.183,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,491.925,500.218,"(Voice Overlap) in other words that there was deficiency in the quantum of proof, isn't that the basis on which they turned it?"
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,500.218,502.476,"Your Honor, we feel it's more than that."
1960.183,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,557.051,561.485,"Now, it's on the fraud question, how about on the one of consideration?"
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,561.485,562.686,Now --
1960.183,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,562.686,563.179,I mean it just --
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,563.179,563.401,Yes.
1960.183,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,563.401,581.167,"-- is your -- isn't your point really what Justice Brennan has suggested by his question that you -- you put a little other way, you say they had ignored the federal authorities, but the authorities upon which you rely I gather, are those cases which upheld that it -- that under the facts of those cases, a jury question was presented."
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,585.634,588.052,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.183,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.253,589.756,On -- on both issues?
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,589.756,590.369,Both issues --
1960.183,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,590.369,592.373,On the issue of fraud or the issue of one of lack of --
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,592.373,592.952,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.183,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,592.952,595.175,"-- federal of consideration by that way, lack of consideration."
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,595.175,611.0,"Now, as -- as to lack of consideration, plaintiff clearly gives the evidence that he was owing at the time of the execution of this release, they owed him a $144.60."
1960.183,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,681.775,685.783,"(Voice Overlap) the $144.60 pay, wasn't that it?"
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,685.783,685.874,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.183,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,685.874,698.901,"It's your point that the only evidence -- there was at least a jury question although that did -- was the consideration supporting the release or not, is that it?"
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,698.901,699.497,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.183,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,699.497,710.808,"Because apparently, the Court held that there was no evidence in the record to support the contention that he was entitled for the $144.60 as wages."
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,719.565,723.981,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.183,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,757.744,760.962,"Did Judge Parker write a -- he dissented, didn't he?"
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,760.962,763.508,"He dissented, but he did not write a (Voice Overlap) dissenting opinion."
1960.183,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,763.508,766.04,-- notice anything.
1960.183,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,766.04,773.757,"Now, on this last point Mr. Blanchard, I notice at page 31, this is not a complete transcript, isn't it, it's just a narrative point of transcript."
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,788.049,794.067,"That's one of the places in record, which we complain of and there are two or three others, Your Honor."
1960.183,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,803.181,804.997,What page is that?
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,804.997,805.657,21.
1960.183,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,805.657,807.121,Thank you.
1960.183,0,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,807.121,826.712,"I never received anything from the railroad as a result from the injury which I have described here today and there -- there's I think, on page 26 of the transcript a similar statement."
1960.183,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,826.712,829.429,Mr. Nye.
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,829.429,831.437,Mr. Chief Justice.
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,953.03,954.494,But -- but that's question is not before us (Voice Overlap) --
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,954.494,956.426,"No, sir."
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1047.145,1048.107,He stated what --
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1048.107,1048.261,-- they were --
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1048.261,1052.364,"-- would you -- would you mind making that last statement again, I didn't quite understand it."
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1052.364,1058.509,The plaintiff testified and then he put on his labor supervisor as his own witness.
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1080.144,1083.496,The supervisor was employed by the company.
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1083.496,1088.287,"Yes, sir, but he was a -- a labor representative, a union labor representative."
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1088.287,1089.835,"Oh, I see."
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1089.835,1095.308,And he testified and my position is to be sure that the employees get a fair break.
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1152.9,1159.359,"Well, did the -- did the supervisor say that this man knew of that policy?"
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1159.359,1160.21,"No sir, he did not."
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1160.21,1160.825,He did not.
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1160.825,1162.262,"No, sir."
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1162.262,1162.279,Well --
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1162.279,1168.387,"The man had worked for the sea board for nine years, Your Honor before he came on the Government and he was an apprentice foreman."
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1197.398,1201.47,"There was a rather (Inaudible), was that for a given number of days?"
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1201.47,1201.949,"Your Honor, he was out --"
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1201.949,1202.817,(Inaudible) prevented that --
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1202.817,1203.925,"-- he stopped -- yes, sir."
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1203.925,1204.319,It was for --
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1204.319,1204.726,Yes sir.
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1204.726,1207.091,-- an equivalent of a given number of days.
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1207.091,1213.263,"Now, just as the side remark, the petitioner in his brief stated that Saturday was a normal work day."
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1219.867,1227.177,"Well, your point I gather is this, even -- for its time off he would not have been paid any wages compensation."
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1227.177,1228.28,"Yes, sir and that's what (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1228.28,1228.565,But that --
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1228.565,1229.167,-- the Supreme Court of North Carolina.
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1229.167,1241.199,"-- but that -- in order to give him that -- that he would execute a release, the company was willing to pay him the equivalent of what would have been his wages if he had worked."
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1241.199,1243.52,"Yes, sir."
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1244.955,1249.337,And you're pointing this out as an effect that admission of his is that is --
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1249.337,1251.214,What -- he act -- cannot read otherwise.
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1257.125,1262.154,"Well, he also says that -- still that I -- I thought they were paying you while you were out."
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1273.772,1275.21,That is right.
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1281.844,1286.105,"But his own witness didn't testify that he knew the policy, isn't there a difference?"
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1286.105,1291.722,"This is based on fraud, Your Honor, not -- not mistake."
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1307.141,1314.402,"But we were not on the fraud issue in the colloquy you and I have had, we're talking only that federal consideration, lack of consideration."
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1314.402,1316.828,"Well, the question -- I don't think --"
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1316.828,1320.844,"Well, aren't the questions here, one is fraud and the other is lack of consideration."
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1320.844,1322.062,The other one is no consideration.
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1322.062,1324.042,"No consideration, alright."
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1324.042,1326.092,Which is a big difference in the -- in the period of the State --
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1326.092,1327.272,"Yes, but they're separate issues as I understand."
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1327.272,1328.654,"Yes, sir."
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1328.654,1328.811,And (Voice Overlap) --
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1328.811,1330.076,They tried to set aside.
1960.183,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1330.076,1335.297,"And either should have gone to the jury, then the Supreme Court of North Carolina was in error was it?"
1960.183,1,19704,charles_b_nye,,1335.297,1337.401,"That's right, sir."
1960.183,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1736.783,1749.117,"Mr. Blanchard, you may continue."
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,1749.117,1766.5,"In respect to $144.60 which the petitioner states was due him, the defendant railroad, never offered any evidence to the effect that petitioner was not entitled to the $144.60."
1960.183,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1788.777,1789.985,-- where are you reading?
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,1789.985,1793.751,"Record 45, Your Honor."
1960.183,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1964.094,1968.764,"May I ask you a question about your pleadings, I don't quite understand."
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,1981.967,1983.564,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.183,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1983.564,1998.976,"In that -- in paragraph 4 of your replication, you said that the amount paid was not far a release for damages but was for wages due."
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,2004.926,2005.123,Your Honor --
1960.183,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2005.123,2007.178,-- with reference to that point?
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,2007.178,2013.971,"I -- I do not believe further pleadings were filed following a reply, I'm sure they were not."
1960.183,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2013.971,2026.921,"This raises the issue as to whether or not that was for payment, for the injury or payment for wages that is this replication for?"
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,2026.921,2028.847,"That's our opinion, yes, sir."
1960.183,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2028.847,2032.33,"And put -- well that's what it says, that's what you charge."
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,2038.616,2041.142,"I think, Your Honor, it's deemed denied."
1960.183,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2041.142,2042.979,It's deemed denied by being (Inaudible)
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,2042.979,2043.862,Yes.
1960.183,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2043.862,2054.833,"Then did they offer any evidence on that point as to the wages that was due him, was there any offer?"
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,2054.833,2055.128,"Your Honor, we --"
1960.183,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2055.128,2058.349,He pointed to some which he thought raised that point by (Voice Overlap) --
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,2058.349,2071.521,"He pointed to our own witnesses on cross-examination and is called by name of Bailey, but they themselves, never offered any evidence that the wages were not due to this petitioner."
1960.183,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2071.521,2077.877,What he referred to and what you have referred to is the total relevant evidence on that point?
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,2077.877,2081.542,"In -- in my opinion, yes, Justice Black."
1960.183,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2081.542,2090.568,As I understand there was (Inaudible) there's no dispute about it as having been paid for all wages up to the time he got (Inaudible).
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,2100.074,2102.062,"Yes, sir."
1960.183,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2102.062,2112.822,But is there any evidence beside here that much you had with reference to what was the policy of the company when men were off injured to whether they could pay them.
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,2112.822,2134.555,"Justice Black the only thing about that was the evidence of - of dues from my own witness Bailey and they never offered any evidence about the policy of the railroad, but I used Bailey to show what the policy was about a man when he was off, but they did not specify about a man who was injured."
1960.183,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2153.67,2155.078,He was -- you mean (Voice Overlap) --
1960.183,2,18356,charles_f_blanchard,,2155.078,2175.544,"Well he was petitioner's witness and they took him on cross-examination to establish what the so-called policy was, but never offered any evidence themselves on that point."
