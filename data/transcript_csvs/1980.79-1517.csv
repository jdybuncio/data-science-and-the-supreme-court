1980.79-1517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.685,We'll hear arguments next in Federated Department Stores v. Moitie.
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,72.096,77.093,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,458.565,460.33,Did the Brown case start in the state court?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,460.33,461.563,--Pardon me?
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,461.563,465.468,"Did the case start in the state court, Brown?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,465.468,469.483,"The Brown case did not start in the state court, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.041,478.259,And how were they removed?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,478.259,481.946,--They were removed on the basis of a federal question--
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,481.946,483.555,A federal question.
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,483.555,485.022,--and diversity of citizenship.
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,486.787,494.269,"So even if there were only state claims stated in those cases that started in the state court, they could have been removed?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,494.269,494.8,Yes.
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,494.8,499.001,And now Brown has stated both federal and state grounds?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,499.001,499.907,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.838,516.369,"Federal, yes."
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,518.087,524.741,"Brown II mentioned fraud and deceit, unjust... restitution, and--"
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,524.741,525.646,Arising out of the same facts?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,525.646,532.613,--Out of the same facts that were stated in identical fashion; they were verbatim copies of the... Brown II were the verbatim copies--
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.613,533.519,Brown II was in the state court?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,533.519,536.784,--Brown II was originally filed in the state court--
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.784,537.641,And then removed?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,537.641,538.547,--and then it was removed.
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,538.547,539.204,On the grounds of diversity?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,539.204,553.431,"It was removed on grounds of diversity, of federal questions, and then there was an additional federal question... ground... that the... the issue of the scope and effect of the first judgment itself raised the federal question."
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,553.431,561.147,Now why do you... what's the basis for your argument that the state grounds alleged in Brown II are barred by res judicata?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,566.801,586.669,"It's the standard principle of res judicata, and I should say, Your Honor, that the... both courts below held... we submit, correctly... that if Brown had been the only case that followed on the government indictment, had it stood below, the standard principles of res judicata would apply."
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.476,629.746,"Now, do you have a case that, right on, that says if you file in the federal court and you state only federal cause of action, and you lose, and then you file in federal court a... based on diversity, a state cause of action based on the same facts, that res judicata bars the second suit."
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,629.746,630.949,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,659.593,673.464,"What if Brown II had stayed in the state courts and never been removed, and stated only a state cause of action, could the state court have... you would have asserted res judicata there too?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,673.464,674.853,"--Yes, res judicata--"
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.853,675.463,But you might have lost.
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,687.254,702.67,"--Well, Your Honor, it is our understanding, and we have never seen anything contrary to this in any of the briefing or research in this case, that the same standards as to res judicata which are applied in the federal court are also applied in California."
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.419,705.466,"Well, what if California didn't?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,722.724,735.579,--The federal court had a special interest in connection with Brown II in determining and avoiding circumvention of its initial judgment in Brown I.
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.493,802.629,Do you think then that you can get an injunction from the federal court if... you should have been able to enjoin the filing of Brown II in the state court?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,802.629,803.598,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,836.789,876.147,"Well Mr. Chapman, supposing that in federal court you have 30 days to file your notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals, and in the California system you have 120 days to file your notice of appeal from an adverse decision of the Superior Court; do you think the principles of Angel v. Bullington and cases such as that would require the federal court to adopt the 120-day principle of California, rather than its own Federal Rules of Civil Procedure?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,876.147,876.662,"No, Your Honor, by no means."
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.819,957.99,"Well didn't Moitie, when it started in the state courts state only a state law?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,957.99,958.755,Yes.
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.755,961.05,That's all it ever had in it?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,961.05,961.832,That is correct.
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.797,971.453,Is the Moitie case here?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,972.421,975.217,"--No, Moitie has been voluntarily dismissed."
1980.79-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.901,1063.04,"Mr. Chapman, may I ask you a question?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1077.207,1077.613,That is correct.
1980.79-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1077.613,1085.969,"And the federal case... they both progressed with discovery and all the rest, and the federal case had gone to judgment first."
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1096.605,1097.074,"Yes, that's correct."
1980.79-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.952,1136.62,"Well, when the Brown II complaint was filed, you did not in the state court move to dismiss on res judicata grounds, you removed?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1136.62,1137.104,--That is correct.
1980.79-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.104,1139.728,"And then after you removed, you filed a res judicata motion?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1139.728,1140.258,That is correct.
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.923,1163.89,"Well Mr. Chapman, suppose in Justice Steven's example, the two cases being filed simultaneously and the federal case finishing first."
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1189.192,1192.254,"--It's not a constitutional question, no, that's not part of our--"
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.254,1211.245,"Well why shouldn't the rule in the federal court, in Brown, which was filed in the state and then removed, why shouldn't the state rule apply, of res judicata apply?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1211.245,1214.353,"--Let me make clear, Your Honor, that the--"
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.353,1216.758,When it's removed on the basis of diversity?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1216.758,1230.738,"--Every indication in every case that was ever referred to in the lower courts when this matter was briefed before the lower courts... it wasn't briefed extensively here, because it wasn't the issue decided by the Ninth Circuit--"
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.738,1233.549,But why shouldn't the Ninth Circuit though focus on what the state law is?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1233.549,1234.767,"--No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.543,1248.09,Well... the Ninth Circuit didn't say that.
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1248.09,1251.979,--If I may address specifically what the Ninth Circuit did?
1980.79-1517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1273.564,1282.639,"Well both the federal courts by statute and the state courts by the Constitution are bound by the full faith and credit clause, are they not?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1282.639,1282.952,Precisely.
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.333,1394.672,"Mr. Chapman, are you saying that... I guess you are, that if you file a federal cause of action in federal court, a federal question case, if out of those facts you have a pendent state claim you must file it."
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1408.557,1410.213,"--Oh quite the contrary, quite the contrary."
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.846,1440.374,"Well wasn't Brown, when it was originally filed in the state... in the federal court, weren't the state claims asserted only within the jurisdiction of the federal court because of pendent jurisdiction?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1441.999,1447.997,The state claims could have been based on diversity or pendent jurisdiction; there was no adjudication of that point.
1980.79-1517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1451.699,1453.215,"But none were alleged, I thought you said?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1453.215,1454.963,In Brown there were none alleged.
1980.79-1517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1462.383,1466.333,"Well, your argument doesn't depend on what happened in the other cases does it?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1466.333,1468.411,--That's exactly the point.
1980.79-1517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1474.565,1476.688,But Mr. Chapman--
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1476.688,1483.342,--solely that the only reason why res judicata should be relieved in this case was that the other cases were reversed on appeal.
1980.79-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.391,1527.294,"--Mr. Chapman, let me interrupt you again, because there's a point of the precise way in which litigation... precise posture of litigation I'd like to clarify."
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1536.228,1536.946,Yes.
1980.79-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.946,1547.863,And your primary argument is they are wrong in reinstating the federal claim on the basis of the five other... reversal of the five other cases.
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1561.013,1563.466,Well I would answer in two ways.
1980.79-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.963,1572.791,"You just told me they are both still standing, both the state and federal claims are alive now."
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1572.791,1589.628,"--The Ninth Circuit understood that the application of res judicata would bar the entire claim and the term claim is not... we're not dealing with forms of actions, it's the entire collection of rights and any legal theories that arise out of this transaction."
1980.79-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1603.153,1603.685,Well in that--
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1603.685,1615.805,"May I say, there's no question but that California law and federal law are absolutely identical on what is meant by res judicata."
1980.79-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1628.829,1642.777,"--Well yes, but if in Brown I... there'd never been any appeals... the district court had dismissed the complaint saying well I don't know anything about California law, but I know you're not a plaintiff qualified to sue under Section 4 of the Clayton Act; file any state law claims you want someplace else."
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1647.307,1653.147,--The district court could have had discretion under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction to pull out any--
1980.79-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1653.147,1662.347,"But there were no state claims asserted, so all he could do on the basis of what had been filed before him, is say well I don't think you are a proper plaintiff under Section 4."
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1662.347,1677.606,"--On the contrary, Your Honor, the law against splitting a cause of action makes it clear that when plaintiffs bring their actions they cannot hold back theories in their back pockets and try out... try their luck with the federal claim."
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.033,1720.354,"Wouldn't you... on this very argument, wouldn't you make a difference between claims that are just pendent to a federal claim or that are arguably pendent, and claims that could be brought originally in the federal court based on diversity?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1729.57,1732.725,"--There was diversity... I think, the important point, Your Honor, is this."
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.096,1741.096,Because there is diversity.
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1741.096,1747.937,"--Because there is diversity, but the basic rule against splitting a cause of action would apply no matter how the case got into federal court."
1980.79-1517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1747.937,1750.624,"Well in any event, there's only one issue before us, is there not?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1750.624,1751.327,Yes sir.
1980.79-1517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1751.327,1753.887,In the present posture of the case?
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1753.887,1754.373,That's correct.
1980.79-1517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.373,1762.557,"Only one question was raised in the certiorari petition, only one question is addressed in your original brief--"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1762.557,1763.415,That is correct.
1980.79-1517,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1763.415,1772.911,"--and while the Respondent's brief canvasses the issues that my brothers have asked you about, that's not before us now, is it?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1772.911,1774.582,That... you are precisely correct.
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1781.205,1789.764,"But what if the question is did the Court of Appeals... if the question is, did the Court of Appeals properly reinstate these judgments."
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1790.655,1792.842,--The Court of Appeals... the question--
1980.79-1517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.842,1797.903,"That is the question, you say they should not have reinstated either the state or the federal claims?"
1980.79-1517,0,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,1797.903,1805.182,--The question is whether the Court of Appeals properly reversed the dismissal for res judicata.
1980.79-1517,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1827.688,1831.827,Mr. Offstein.
1980.79-1517,1,32274,jerrold_n_offstein,,1831.827,1835.294,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1517,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.3,1941.704,"Well Mr. Offstein, I take it you would concede that the Ninth Circuit is bound by holdings of this Court in matters of federal law?"
1980.79-1517,1,32274,jerrold_n_offstein,,1941.704,1942.641,Agreed.
1980.79-1517,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1944.859,1962.4,"I notice in your brief you give rather short shrift to the case of Reed v. Allen, which was decided in 1932, on page 8, you cited, simply saying that Professor Moore has criticized it in his treatise."
1980.79-1517,1,32274,jerrold_n_offstein,,1965.804,1971.318,"I believe it should be, I believe it was bad law then."
1980.79-1517,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.842,1988.935,And that would be a case-by-case analysis.
1980.79-1517,1,32274,jerrold_n_offstein,,1988.935,1990.716,"Indeed, it is an equitable rule."
1980.79-1517,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2038.651,2045.633,"But you could have presented your state claims originally in the federal court, not just as pendent jurisdiction, but as... on diversity grounds?"
1980.79-1517,1,32274,jerrold_n_offstein,,2045.633,2046.742,--I don't believe there was diversity.
1980.79-1517,2,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,2611.364,2615.659,"I would like, Mr. Chief Justice, to make two brief points."
1980.79-1517,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2677.696,2678.727,Thank you gentlemen.
