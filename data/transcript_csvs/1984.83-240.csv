1984.83-240,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,68.863,"Mr. Raywid, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,68.863,95.024,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this appeal challenges the validity of a state statute which would alter and redirect the distribution of federal funds payable to local units of government paid for the presence of non-taxable federal land which are located within the jurisdiction of these local units of government."
1984.83-240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,175.367,183.472,"You described the second sentence in the statute, Mr. Raywid, as a caveat; a unit, and they use the payment for any governmental purpose."
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,188.534,196.14,"I'm glad you called me on that, Justice Rehnquist, because no, I do not see that as a limitation at all."
1984.83-240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,222.504,224.113,They didn't need Congress to tell them that.
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,224.113,226.721,They did not need Congress to tell them that.
1984.83-240,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.216,246.854,"Mr. Raywid, the counties are creatures of state government, in a sense."
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,263.815,273.545,Perhaps the legislature could have declined altogether the federal aid.
1984.83-240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.643,343.799,Obliged by what law?
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,343.799,349.233,"Well, obliged by the precedent of this Court."
1984.83-240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.275,372.365,You are now deducing a principle of federal law that requires the State of South Dakota to adhere to its own statutes?
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,372.365,380.753,"Well, the State of South Dakota, like any other entity, must observe its own laws."
1984.83-240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.753,389.904,"But isn't the... usually, the final authority as to whether a state has observed its own laws is found in the determination of the highest court of that state, is it not?"
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,389.904,391.373,It is indeed.
1984.83-240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.373,399.353,"And here, we have a determination of the Supreme Court of South Dakota that what the state has done has consisted with South Dakota law."
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,399.353,405.117,"Well, the State of South Dakota went much further than that."
1984.83-240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.329,436.636,"It's one thing to say that Congress has mandated these funds to the counties and notwithstanding the relationship between the counties and the state, the Congress wanted the counties to have the final authority to say that."
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,455.192,469.844,"--Well, I think that what the federal statute attempted to do was to confer authority, discretionary authority for the expenditure of funds on the local unit of government."
1984.83-240,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,535.691,544.141,"Well, you concede, I gather, that the state could have prohibited the counties from accepting any federal aid altogether."
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,562.195,565.866,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.76,638.508,May I ask this question?
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,653.77,655.643,"No, Justice Stevens,--"
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,655.643,656.721,With respect to tax revenues anyhow.
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,656.721,657.142,--I don't understand that to be the--
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,657.142,661.921,"Well, aren't they required to expend their tax revenues in certain prorated shares?"
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,661.921,667.529,"--Well, the county does have limited authority, and it does not have general legislative authority."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.529,672.479,"But it doesn't have any general authority to disburse funds any way it wants, apart from these funds, does it?"
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,672.479,681.07,"There are certain units of government, such as primarily the schools--"
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,681.07,681.367,"Well, we're talking about the county right now."
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,688.349,690.332,"--No, Justice Stevens."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.254,729.504,"Some discretion, but isn't that discretion, in some respect at least, limited by state law?"
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,729.504,731.909,"Well, indeed it is."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.909,734.97,What do they want to use the money for in this case?
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,740.218,753.338,"Well, I believe that the county has, with great reserve, not made any determination as to the use of the funds until it determines the outcome of this litigation."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,753.338,759.617,"So it's entirely possible the county may decide to distribute the money exactly in accordance with the state law, isn't it?"
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,759.617,764.083,"Well, again I differ with you."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,770.487,776.907,"And you must acknowledge, I assume... say there's a state law against spending money on liquor licenses or something like that."
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,778.561,778.827,--No.
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.059,793.289,Should the state pass a statute that says you should spend no more than $10 million on roads in any one county?
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,793.289,807.893,"I do not think that they could place a limitation on the federal funds which had been given to that particular county, and could not do by indirection what they could not do by direction."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.857,827.979,"Even though they were used for a valid governmental purpose of some other kind, such as school?"
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,827.979,837.927,"Well, the fundamental purpose of the Act is for this county to decide how these federal lands have impacted upon it, and to spend accordingly."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.161,843.27,Without interference from the state legislature.
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,843.27,844.987,--Without interference by the state legislature.
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.987,846.956,Can you find that in this statutory language?
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,846.956,860.389,"This statutory language would make the county auditor a mere cashier, just to receive the funds and then to disburse them according to a formula."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.778,871.039,Are you saying a state does not have the power to say that the county auditor shall be a mere cashier and shall spend the money the way we tell him to?
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,872.492,889.532,--The state has no such power when the exercise of that power would entirely gut the purpose and intent of Congress in conferring jurisdiction and discretion on the local unit of government to make such a decision.
1984.83-240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.532,901.684,These payments are in lieu of what would be real property taxes that the government would pay for government-owned land in the county?
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,901.684,906.417,That is correct in this particular instance.
1984.83-240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,922.16,936.982,"And there is no question, I take, it, that under South Dakota law, if these lands had been in private hands and taxes had been paid on them, the state legislature could have told Lawrence County how to spend the taxes."
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,936.982,938.45,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.513,986.603,I didn't mean necessarily that the state legislature had adopted such a regimen.
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,992.147,1003.767,"Well, I suppose the State of South Dakota could eliminate its local government altogether and also remove its taxing authority."
1984.83-240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1003.767,1014.622,"Or it could tell its counties that out of each dollar of real property tax that you collect at the county level, you assign 60 percent of that to the schools, could it not?"
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,1014.622,1015.81,It could.
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.171,1168.857,Can I ask you in this example... I think it's in the government brief... a very costly trial because a crime occurs in the county.
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,1191.239,1200.251,"--Well, depending upon the state constitution and depending upon the jurisdictional authority, I suppose that the state could assume those funds."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.906,1207.762,They could prohibit the county from spending money for that particular purpose without violating the federal statute.
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,1207.762,1209.855,--Or could supplement--
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.855,1214.291,"Just say we will pay for this out of state funds in this county, as we do throughout the state."
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,1214.291,1221.398,"--Yes, but as the Congress observed and as the Congress noted, states don't do that."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.398,1226.959,"Well, but isn't the state the best entity to decide whether it shall be done within its borders or not?"
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,1230.208,1235.549,"Perhaps the state is the best entity, generally, to make such decisions."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1251.291,1255.228,"Yes, but the statute clearly says the Federal Government shall not say how the money shall be spent."
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,1256.853,1262.881,"--The statute clearly confers to the local unit of government, yes."
1984.83-240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1262.881,1267.035,And it clearly disables the Federal Government itself from allocating the funds.
1984.83-240,0,16879,alan_raywid,,1267.895,1269.66,In that particular section.
1984.83-240,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1274.628,1289.716,Mr. Claiborne.
1984.83-240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1289.716,1297.807,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, perhaps I could most usefully begin by descending to particulars."
1984.83-240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1362.672,1371.371,"Mr. Claiborne, what were the consequences of the state statute here as to these particular funds?"
1984.83-240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1373.823,1396.75,"It is true that in this instance, Justice Rehnquist, the state statute did not require the funds to be expended outside the geographic area of the county, but it did require that 60 percent of those funds be allocated to a school district, a school district whose needs were in no way increased by the presence of federal land."
1984.83-240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1400.718,1403.124,"--But the school district is, nonetheless, in the county."
1984.83-240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1403.124,1403.811,--Yes.
1984.83-240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1468.066,1469.613,"Mr. Clairborne, I don't understand."
1984.83-240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1480.671,1489.495,"One aspect: If the state had power to allocate the money, it is difficult to see why that power was limited geographically."
1984.83-240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1534.728,1535.228,Go ahead.
1984.83-240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1535.322,1542.335,"There is another aspect of this statute which leads us in the same direction, which is the second part."
1984.83-240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.963,1579.274,But it's one thing for Congress to say that we're not going to try to supervise the expenditure of these funds.
1984.83-240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1583.725,1585.302,"Indeed, Your Honor."
1984.83-240,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1611.338,1614.805,Let me try and hypothetically... it may clear it up for me; it may not.
1984.83-240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1634.673,1641.373,If that condition had been announced in advance and the state had accepted--
1984.83-240,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1641.373,1644.48,"Well, aren't you suggesting that there's a condition announced in this statute?"
1984.83-240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1644.48,1645.59,--Indeed.
1984.83-240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.495,1816.099,"Yes, but the county could choose not to furnish any services to your lands, the way the statute is written, could it not?"
1984.83-240,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1816.099,1817.754,It is so.
1984.83-240,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1882.683,1893.271,Mr. Fuller.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,1893.271,1902.174,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case doesn't deal with a whole lot of things."
1984.83-240,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1995.261,2010.599,"Well, isn't the purpose of South Dakota's statute in this instance to assure that school districts get a share of the federal payments in lieu of taxes?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2010.599,2013.973,I think that's the practical effect.
1984.83-240,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2013.973,2017.081,"Well, is that the purpose of the statute, do you suppose?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2017.081,2021.125,I don't... I was not present when the statute... when 511--
1984.83-240,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2021.125,2024.546,Can you think of some other purpose that the statute might have?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2024.546,2038.541,"--There are other governmental entities that the county distributes money to, like water conservance of the subdistricts, or water districts, conservance of subdistricts, fire districts, and other governmental entities that gather the money."
1984.83-240,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2067.435,2071.434,Which would assure a portion of it going to school districts.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2071.434,2072.98,--Yes.
1984.83-240,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2078.9,2084.21,"Does that purpose conflict with the congressional intent, do you suppose?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2084.21,2085.866,"Well, now I don't think so."
1984.83-240,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2130.113,2136.127,"Why doesn't your view, then, amount to a windfall from the school district?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2147.684,2150.934,"Well, there's nothing magic about the 60 percent."
1984.83-240,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2153.135,2153.338,"Well, sure."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2163.505,2164.458,--Correct.
1984.83-240,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2164.458,2170.893,"Well, then anything that goes to the school district from the federal funds is a windfall to is."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2170.893,2173.876,That would be true--
1984.83-240,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2173.876,2175.094,Perhaps an unneeded one.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2175.094,2178.781,"--Well, that I can't answer."
1984.83-240,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2178.781,2180.327,"Well, that's what you want."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2180.327,2182.404,Your Honor--
1984.83-240,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2182.404,2184.169,You're here representing the school district.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2184.169,2185.497,"--That's correct, Your honor."
1984.83-240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.98,2194.462,"Isn't that true of all government services, that they are budgeted for them, and whatever the federal windfall is, it's prorated for all these services?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2194.462,2196.477,--That's what I was going to say.
1984.83-240,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2233.696,2235.039,That's what I say.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2238.46,2239.335,That's right.
1984.83-240,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.334,2241.834,"Well, that's not an ordinary windfall."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2245.739,2254.205,"--Well, but Congress... I have to agree with what he's saying if the definition is proper, because Congress is giving the counties that money."
1984.83-240,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.205,2255.72,In lieu of taxes.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2255.72,2256.142,Right.
1984.83-240,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.075,2280.444,"Another thing: Doesn't the legislative history suggest at least that Congress was somewhat concerned about what states did sometimes with these kinds of grants, in lieu of taxes and other types of grants, and they wanted to vest the control entirely in the county."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2282.709,2286.941,Congress was concerned about all the things you mention.
1984.83-240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.072,2322.411,"Mr. Fuller, you raised the question about the 60 percent a couple of times in your... who determines, what governmental body determines the percentage of tax revenues that shall be given to the school district?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2322.411,2327.269,"No governmental entity, because it's through the budgetary process."
1984.83-240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.252,2332.611,Is it a county budget or a state budget?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2332.611,2335.656,--It's a school budget and a county budget.
1984.83-240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2335.656,2341.342,So that the county has a voice in determining the allocation of tax revenues.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2343.371,2362.692,"It's very limited, because our South Dakota Supreme Court has ruled that when a school district comes before the County Board of Equalization and they need X number of dollars, the county cannot arbitrarily reduce the assessed valuation so that the school district will not have the monies to function."
1984.83-240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.692,2368.675,"Yes, but what I mean is, the decision as to what percentage... is the percentage the same in every county throughout the state?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2368.675,2369.642,"Oh, no."
1984.83-240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.002,2376.061,So that the percentage that's in effect in the county in dispute here is really largely governed by what happens in that county.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2376.061,2377.233,"Oh, absolutely."
1984.83-240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.233,2380.997,"And all the state has said is, you've got to follow the same percentage for other funds in that county."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2380.997,2381.497,That's right.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2388.728,2400.442,"Yes, but the 60 percent, the 60 percent results from the fact that the school district makes up its own budget, and in a sense is a taxing authority itself."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2404.643,2405.612,That's correct.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.018,2408.846,"And the county, as you say, has very little to say about it."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2411.672,2412.953,"--No... yes, the Board of Commissioners."
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.953,2415.655,--The Board of Commissioners has very little to say about it.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2415.655,2418.295,They have very little to say about--
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.295,2422.355,They can't cut the school district back.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2422.355,2424.262,--They cannot cut the school district back.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.913,2446.704,"I take it, if you prevail... if you prevail, you can predict that the counties are going to get certain money and that you won't have to assess as high as you would have if you weren't going to get the federal money."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2446.704,2447.532,That's correct.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.532,2451.437,So you'll be saving all of the people in the school district money.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2451.437,2452.046,Correct.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.459,2477.192,Is the entire county covered by one school district or another?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2477.192,2484.173,--There are three school... excuse me... there are two complete school districts within Lawrence County and a portion of another school district.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.11,2492.702,Every piece of non-government land is covered by a school district?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2492.702,2495.918,In Lawrence County?
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.918,2496.808,Yes.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2496.808,2499.26,Yes.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.305,2521.158,"So if the government wins... if the government wins this case, it's just that what everybody in the county would have had to be assessed to pay the county expenses, they won't have to be assessed as much."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2521.158,2522.439,That's right.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.439,2531.794,So how much difference will it make as to who... in terms of taxpayers... what taxpayer group shall benefit and what not?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2531.794,2533.7,Well--
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.7,2541.51,I know that the taxpayers in the school district will be taxed less if you win.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2541.51,2543.274,--Correct.
1984.83-240,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2598.471,2603.454,"Mr. Fuller, where do the schools in your state derive their money from anyway?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2603.454,2605.36,From real estate taxes.
1984.83-240,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2605.36,2609.669,"From real estate taxes in the school district or in the county, or both?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2609.669,2610.841,In the school district.
1984.83-240,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2610.841,2616.292,"And you have a general sales tax in South Dakota, state sales tax?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2616.292,2616.964,Yes.
1984.83-240,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2616.964,2624.288,And does the state appropriate any of their sales tax fund either to the county or to the school districts?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2624.288,2626.24,Not specifically.
1984.83-240,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2634.987,2638.205,That state aid comes from the sales tax and the state income tax?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2638.205,2642.063,It comes from all state revenues.
1984.83-240,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2646.092,2650.731,"Now, does your state legislature specifically appropriate money for the public schools?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2650.731,2651.043,Yes.
1984.83-240,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2651.043,2653.307,That money goes directly to the school districts?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2653.307,2653.745,Yes.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2653.745,2661.383,But it goes by... they make up the amount that goes to each particular school district.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2661.383,2662.492,Correct.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.492,2663.586,Based on some formula?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2663.586,2664.086,Formula.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.086,2669.678,"Well, what if some district is getting money from the Federal Government?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2670.396,2670.974,"No, sir."
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.096,2679.673,But the school district would reduce its own taxes.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2679.673,2681.751,And so will the county.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.751,2682.78,Yes.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2686.295,2687.045,Yes.
1984.83-240,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2687.045,2690.106,Real estate taxes?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2690.106,2690.497,Yes.
1984.83-240,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2690.497,2695.042,"And, in addition, the county levies a real estate tax also?"
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2695.042,2695.401,Correct.
1984.83-240,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2695.401,2697.103,It's not unlimited.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2697.103,2698.056,"No, no."
1984.83-240,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.894,2715.299,Back to that one.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2718.642,2723.516,"Well, if we don't get the money, we will."
1984.83-240,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2723.516,2726.825,Does the taxpayer lose?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2726.825,2731.495,Does the taxpayer lose?
1984.83-240,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2731.495,2732.261,Yeah.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2735.151,2735.868,He may.
1984.83-240,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2735.868,2737.837,How?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2737.837,2744.365,"Again, depending upon the governmental needs of the specific time, if the county needs a great deal of money, then yes."
1984.83-240,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.459,2747.911,This is political.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2761.219,2762.608,--Pardon me?
1984.83-240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.608,2764.171,Who is going to get the money if you don't?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2769.762,2781.866,"Well, I don't think so, because the school district has gone to the county on numerous occasions, asking them to please do what the state statute says, and they continue to say we don't have to."
1984.83-240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2784.053,2785.724,Did they ever tell you what they're going to do?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2787.693,2790.753,"The money has been held in escrow, gathering interest--"
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.753,2794.315,"They certainly wouldn't spend it on the school district, I take it."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2794.315,2797.735,--One never knows.
1984.83-240,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2804.092,2808.433,Is there any way they could send it back to the other U.S. taxpayers?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2813.307,2821.257,"Well, we'd like to keep it in Lawrence County and we'd like to keep it at our school district, where it should be, and it should be distributed at the same."
1984.83-240,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2831.253,2832.425,Which statute?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2832.425,2834.721,--The state statute.
1984.83-240,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2848.732,2861.524,"But you said when the county... when they come to the school board, the school board refuses... or is it the county that you said... the county refused to do what the state statute purports to compel them to do."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2861.524,2862.709,Correct.
1984.83-240,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2862.709,2866.521,That's the political aspect that you are talking about.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2866.521,2867.834,Correct.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.067,2879.079,"Well, it's also their position that they're not only free, but obligated, to refuse to do that, if they're going to take the federal money."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2892.841,2897.792,I'm going to disagree with that.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.792,2900.166,You don't think that's their position?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2900.166,2900.494,No.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2905.178,2911.832,"Yes, but I just said one of their positions is that they have a legal right not to spend it that way."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2911.832,2912.473,That's correct.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.473,2915.956,So it just isn't a political position.
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2920.063,2920.407,Correct.
1984.83-240,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2931.279,2932.824,"Well, that's why you're here, I guess."
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,2932.824,2933.261,That's correct.
1984.83-240,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3020.29,3026.754,Except that the county has different ideas from the state; isn't that so?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,3026.754,3036.391,"The county... well, the state is not telling them how to spend the money."
1984.83-240,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3042.811,3047.668,Are you suggesting that the state statute doesn't put any constraints on them?
1984.83-240,2,15927,a_p_fuller,,3047.668,3055.962,"You're talking about... yes, it tells them about vouchering and bonding and bonds of indebtedness and all that."
1984.83-240,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3071.471,3074.188,Very well.
1984.83-240,3,16879,alan_raywid,,3076.937,3091.541,This is the only statute in the country that seems... or the only state in the country that seems it is necessary to make some reallocation.
1984.83-240,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3196.717,3203.667,"Would you agree that it doesn't entirely remove the discretion, because the basic allocation is at least partially determined by the county itself?"
1984.83-240,3,16879,alan_raywid,,3203.667,3210.868,"--Well, first of all, the county in the year before receipt of these funds tries to budget its needs."
1984.83-240,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3210.868,3216.053,And it probably in doing that can anticipate it will be getting some federal funds in the following year.
1984.83-240,3,16879,alan_raywid,,3216.053,3217.459,"Well, not necessarily."
1984.83-240,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3228.282,3235.295,But it does participate in the decision whether the school district will get 60 or 39 or 59 percent of the tax revenues.
1984.83-240,3,16879,alan_raywid,,3235.295,3237.435,"--Indeed, it's instrumental in--"
1984.83-240,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3237.435,3240.059,"So it does have a part in the allocation of these funds, too, then."
1984.83-240,3,16879,alan_raywid,,3240.059,3261.395,"--Well, it would have to be using a crystal ball or some kind of a mathematical formula, of which I'm not aware, in order to find out what the Secretary of Interior is going to allocate for this particular county, and find out how that works in the equation... which is totally apart from the purpose and intent of Congress."
1984.83-240,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3263.504,3264.863,Very well.
