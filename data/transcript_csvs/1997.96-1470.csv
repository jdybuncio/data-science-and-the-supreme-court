1997.96-1470,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,5.618,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-1470, Quality King Distributors v. L'anza Research International."
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,7.904,11.039,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1470,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,67.608,94.962,"Well, Mr. Snyder, the Government has come in and urged us to rely on the section that... 602, dealing with infringing importation of goods, and they tell us that the United States has entered into treaties on the assumption that that provision governs."
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,99.497,106.269,"--Justice O'Connor, I believe the issue before the Court is what did Congress say and what did Congress intend in a statute."
1997.96-1470,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.269,120.243,"Yes, I think so, but I would be very interested to know how you evaluate the extent to which this country has relied on some other interpretation, as the Government argues."
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,120.243,149.512,"I believe that the Government has shown that in several bilateral trade agreements that were never submitted to Congress either for consideration or for action, the Government has asserted the position in dealing with the Governments of Cambodia, Trinidad and Tobago, and several other countries, that it is the executive branch's position that parallel imports of the kind at issue here should be curtailed."
1997.96-1470,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.772,170.074,Do we owe deference to any Government agency in interpreting these laws before us?
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,170.074,171.259,"I believe not, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-1470,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.948,213.669,"Let me ask you one more question, since I have you interrupted, and then I'll leave it alone."
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,243.788,248.259,I think it's correct that that particular language could have been omitted.
1997.96-1470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,295.99,296.99,"Mr. Snyder, I--"
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,316.319,318.855,"Well, it is an act of infringement."
1997.96-1470,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,340.269,361.098,"But Mr. Snyder, if you're right about that, wouldn't it have been more logical to say, in the first part of 501(a), exclusive rights, section 106 through, including the right, the 602 right, instead of making it conjunctive, as... instead of making it separate?"
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,401.592,423.006,"Well, first of all, Justice Ginsburg, 501 obviously is not the section that specifically was dealing with either the distribution right or the importation issue, and I think to determine Congress' intent, the first place that I would urge the Court to look would be the statutes directly on point, including 109, but I take your point that it could have been phrased in a different way."
1997.96-1470,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,681.003,683.021,"Mr. Snyder, can I ask you another question."
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,691.877,705.887,"The 602 exceptions, Justice Stevens, we believe apply on their terms to very limited situations where people are importing or bringing property in for personal use or for noncommercial use."
1997.96-1470,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,727.55,732.204,Why wouldn't those exceptions already be protected by the first sale doctrine if it applied?
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,733.37,743.512,"Justice Stevens, they are not because the language of the 602 exceptions is not limited to copies that are lawfully made under this title."
1997.96-1470,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,822.695,836.605,"Or, if you're traveling in some other country and you pick up a totally unauthorized copy of a phonograph, a CD or some... or a book, totally unauthorized, you'd be protected as a traveler if you bought it and brought it back in--"
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,836.605,837.355,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-1470,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,837.355,839.49,--under the 602 exceptions.
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,839.49,840.09,That's correct.
1997.96-1470,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,840.09,844.21,"But it would not be protected under 106, presumably."
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,844.21,849.662,"We agree with that, and we think that is a very significant distinction between the two statutes."
1997.96-1470,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.662,852.114,Maybe I'll reveal my ignorance about that.
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,870.426,877.098,"As... not as we interpret the statute, although this has not been addressed in any of the decisions that I'm aware of precisely."
1997.96-1470,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.941,893.358,"Yes, but if the U.S. copyright... oh, I see."
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,900.345,900.797,That's correct.
1997.96-1470,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.014,908.618,"So British copies would not be lawfully made under this title, within the meaning of 109, in your view."
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,908.618,946.926,"--That is our understanding, and that is exactly the parallel or analogue to what this Court held in the K Mart case, which obviously arose under customs laws and trademark law, but in K Mart the Solicitor General then argued that the first sale doctrine in the trademark law should protect a U.S. mark holder from competition from a totally unrelated entity, such as the kind we're talking about now, but should not protect the U.S. mark holder if the U.S. mark holder is a parent or a subsidiary of the foreign mark holder."
1997.96-1470,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,981.349,993.407,Does the U.S. copyright holder have to have specific authorization from the author to manufacture abroad in order to avoid a violation of 602?
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,993.407,1010.332,"Well, we do not believe that 602 limits the question of where you manufacture, and there's a BMG decision from the Ninth Circuit that we cite in our brief that seems to say the opposite, but that decision's been criticized by a number of other courts, including the Ninth Circuit in a later case."
1997.96-1470,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1027.461,1037.067,"But if the contract is silent, your answer is the geography of manufacture is irrelevant."
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1037.067,1041.702,"--I think that's correct, but I... I'm not certain."
1997.96-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1041.702,1050.04,"Am I right in my understanding of your answer to Justice Stevens that (1), (2), and (3) are exceptions from 602?"
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1081.927,1083.196,"I think that's correct, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1083.196,1083.529,Is that right?
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1083.529,1092.016,"There could... there are cases I think where there could be some overlap between the 109 protection and 602, but there are a great number of cases where there's not overlap."
1997.96-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1092.016,1097.651,"I mean, there might be a lot of people who have those books coming to the border who didn't buy them."
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1097.651,1098.253,Correct.
1997.96-1470,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.253,1103.138,In which case there's no first sale doctrine under anybody's theory.
1997.96-1470,0,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1103.138,1104.071,"Well, if they don't own them--"
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1450.446,1453.148,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1537.802,1551.526,"May I ask, since you've cited the Sony case, which dealt in part with fair use, how, under your reading of the statute, does the fair use doctrine protect the importation of foreign-made goods?"
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1551.526,1573.475,"Well, I think that in enacting section 602(a) Congress made a decision that the limitations under Chapter 1 of the Copyright Act, which would include the fair use under section 107 as well as the first sale defense under section 109(a), did not apply to section 602(a)."
1997.96-1470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1573.475,1578.36,"Oh, so your view is there is no fair use defense in this... for imported goods."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1578.36,1593.02,"Yes, except to the extent that we think that the three exceptions that Congress did set out expressly to section 602(a) do have a fair use element to them."
1997.96-1470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1617.67,1632.347,"Mr. Goettsch, you don't question the contention of petitioners that there is no need to give any deference to the negotiation... negotiating position of the United States in trade agreements?"
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1632.347,1635.466,"--Well, I don't... no, we do not agree with that."
1997.96-1470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.168,1651.891,"Well, then you say that there is some... I thought you just said that we just pay attention to the language used by Congress, but you're saying, though, that that language should be interpreted through the prism of the executive branch deference?"
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1651.891,1652.841,"--No, I'm not saying that."
1997.96-1470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1680.578,1683.946,"It has no duties under this section, does it?"
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1686.314,1686.748,--No.
1997.96-1470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.062,1724.588,"Well, on your interpretation of the statute, actually, that it's sort of an import violation rather than a distribution violation, it really ought to be the Customs Service to whom we might defer rather than the Copyright Office."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1724.588,1726.438,"Well, that could be."
1997.96-1470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.421,1734.71,But I don't understand your argument that just because the Copyright Office had much to do with the drafting of this provision we give them deference.
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1744.05,1768.581,"--Well, I think what I meant by deference, and probably my choice of words was not particularly apt, what I meant was that if the Court is going to look at legislative intent, which I don't think the Court needs to do, that the Copyright Office's role in the writing of the statute is corroborated... is evidence of intent, and its current interpretation corroborates the legislative intent."
1997.96-1470,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.581,1768.848,Okay.
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1772.3,1779.72,"Not in that sense, just in the sense that this is corroborative evidence of legislative intent if the Court needs to reach that."
1997.96-1470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1779.72,1799.617,"Will you... just concentrating on the language for a minute, will you explain how you get out of the box that the right that's been infringed is the exclusive right to distribute copies under section 106, a right which is otherwise qualified as a first sale doctrine, fair use doctrine and others."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1810.758,1813.591,"Well, there are several reasons."
1997.96-1470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1828.886,1829.403,"Well, I understand."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1854.685,1862.774,"--Well, section 106, subparagraph (3), which provides for the copyright holder--"
1997.96-1470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1862.774,1865.076,"Subject to 107 through 120, yes."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1865.076,1895.662,"--Right, but that gives the copyright holder the right to control the exclusive distribution of a copy, is not exhausted unless there is a sale, and importation does not denote a sale, so the distribution right under section 106 is complementary but separate from the importation right under section 602(a)."
1997.96-1470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1895.662,1905.57,"Well, but the importation right is treated as though it were an infringing sale, and to be an infringing sale, it has to get by all the things like the fair use doctrine, the first sale doctrine, and so forth."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1906.87,1912.707,"No, I don't think it is Justice Stevens, I don't think it is treated as an infringing sale."
1997.96-1470,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1927.966,1936.655,"--But, of course, the argument on the other side is, there's no infringement, obviously, if there's been a first sale, because 109 applies."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,1995.778,2025.98,"Well, I don't agree, Justice O'Connor, because prior to the enactment of the 1976 Copyright Act section 602 prohibited the importation of piratical goods, meaning unauthorized copies, and Congress... by enacting section 602(a), Congress intended to extend that protection to the copyright holder beyond piratical goods to the unauthorized importation of authentic copies."
1997.96-1470,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2025.98,2029.201,"Well, of course, that gets us to the issue."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2051.777,2052.964,I don't think so.
1997.96-1470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.964,2061.985,You would say that the piratical goods encompass lawfully made goods pursuant to a license from the original author--
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2061.985,2062.219,Well--
1997.96-1470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.219,2064.57,--in the other... the British copyright.
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2064.57,2079.33,"--Justice Stevens, if you're asking, prior to the enactment of section 602(a) was the provision with respect to piratical goods applicable to that situation, then I think it was."
1997.96-1470,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2079.33,2080.596,You think it was?
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2091.885,2114.964,"Well, it wasn't... there was no case law that expressly said that, and I think that Congress, by enacting section 602(a), wanted to make it very clear that the unauthorized importation of authentic copies was copyright infringement."
1997.96-1470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2114.964,2117.583,"--That makes sense, but I don't see how it helps you."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2146.9,2147.116,Well--
1997.96-1470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2147.116,2154.82,"If there's been a first sale, no more reason to... no more reason, if there's been a first sale, to stop them than if there's been a first sale in the United States."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2155.753,2156.253,"--Well, of course--"
1997.96-1470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.253,2159.872,Do you want to apply a first sale doctrine to copyrighted books or not?
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2166.628,2192.743,"--Well, because the first sale is intended to reflect the fact that the copyright holder has exhausted its exclusive distribution right and has received the full value of its copyright, and a sale abroad, a sale outside the United States, since the Copyright Act operates territorially, the sale outside of the United States does not exhaust--"
1997.96-1470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2192.743,2194.361,"No, but he's been paid for it, hasn't he?"
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2197.111,2208.502,"--Well, under the facts of this case, which is true in many situations where copyright holders sell the copyright goods abroad, they're sold at a discount, a significant discount."
1997.96-1470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.239,2222.178,"They would like... the copyright holder, I take it, would like to have a vertically imposed territorial division, as would many manufacturers."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2253.4,2263.755,"--Well, the concern is that if the copies acquired outside the United States at a discount come back into this country, then they compete with the copyright holders--"
1997.96-1470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2263.755,2264.071,Yes.
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2267.957,2268.309,--No--
1997.96-1470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2268.309,2274.313,"If you decide to sell at a discount, it would be nice to do that often, and many manufacturers feel that way."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2274.313,2274.746,--Well--
1997.96-1470,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.746,2278.781,"You can't sell at a discount to Maine, and you won't be able to to France."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2278.781,2302.027,"--Well, if the sale were in the United States, then the copyright holder would have exhausted the right under 106(3) to control the exclusive distribution, and then section 109(a) would apply, but if the sale is outside of the United States, then the right to control distribution has not been exhausted."
1997.96-1470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2302.027,2321.524,"May I ask... just to comment very briefly on one aspect of the case that I just can't quite get out of my head, it's easy to follow the arguments when you're talking about books and records and so forth, but when you're talking about the label on a product that is not itself patented or copyrighted, the label is controlling the distribution of the product, is that relevant at all in the case?"
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2321.524,2327.345,"No, because the Copyright Act does not recognize classes of copyrights."
1997.96-1470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.516,2334.099,For a label.
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2334.099,2336.368,--a product label or a product design.
1997.96-1470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2336.751,2337.334,"Thank you, Mr. Goettsch."
1997.96-1470,1,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2338.617,2339.084,--Thank you.
1997.96-1470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2339.084,2340.869,"Mr. Wallace, we'll hear from you."
1997.96-1470,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2340.869,2365.584,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1470,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2407.126,2409.411,Where do you want us to be reading?
1997.96-1470,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2411.93,2415.048,"Well, subsection... the 602(a)--"
1997.96-1470,3,39341,raymond_h_goettsch,,2440.245,2442.078,Yes.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2442.078,2442.445,All right.
1997.96-1470,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.434,2489.742,"May I ask right there, Mr. Wallace... it's quite important to me... did that section cover copies made pursuant to the... an authorized British copyright?"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2489.742,2496.896,"--Piratical copies are copies that are not legitimate in the country where acquired, and not--"
1997.96-1470,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.896,2497.479,So you're answer is no.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2497.479,2499.329,--My answer is no.
1997.96-1470,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.329,2506.002,"And so his response to the argument you're developing as well, this... the big change in this statute was, it covers that universe."
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2506.002,2533.235,"The authority that has been given in 602(a), the new authority, allows the owner of the copyright to prevent without... if it doesn't have his permission, to prevent importation of legitimate copies as well as piratical copies, but the piratical copies are prohibited from entry separately as well, under 602(b)."
1997.96-1470,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.803,2562.519,"Or by the British copyright, right?"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2562.519,2563.838,However... but it--
1997.96-1470,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2563.838,2565.288,It would have permitted those.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2565.288,2565.521,--Right.
1997.96-1470,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.521,2568.456,I want to be sure we understand what it does apply to.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2577.712,2579.014,"Of course, we have--"
1997.96-1470,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2579.014,2579.648,Do you agree with that?
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2579.648,2599.594,"--Yes, but we have agreements with these countries so that there's reciprocal recognition of copyright rights, and the British copyright is very apt to derive from the American copyright, or vice versa, depending on where the original copyright is, so that we're not really separating out very much."
1997.96-1470,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.594,2605.748,"Is there a substantial reduction of copyrighted goods, pursuant to copyrights in Trinidad and these other countries, that these agreements are made with?"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2609.033,2633.648,"There... the goods are marketed in these countries, and our concern in negotiating these agreements has been in protecting the distributors from gray market imports that would undermine the distribution of the American made works in these other countries."
1997.96-1470,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.648,2640.635,"Briefly, you want to assure that the Americans can sell cheaper in that country than they do at home, right?"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2640.635,2641.254,Well--
1997.96-1470,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2641.254,2641.787,Briefly put.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2641.787,2647.658,--there... that is part of the reason why we have been--
1997.96-1470,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2647.658,2649.125,We don't even do that at home.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2656.645,2673.957,"--There are reasons why we've been espousing this, because in order to market copyrighted works, and the whole point of copyright is to give incentives to created copyrighted works and to protect their... the ability of the authors to market them--"
1997.96-1470,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.957,2675.408,"We're talking about shampoo here, aren't we?"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2680.878,2686.782,"--The statutory issue is going to apply to motion pictures, sound recordings--"
1997.96-1470,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2686.782,2688.948,But it's also going to apply to shampoo.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2688.948,2694.769,--When the label that is affixed to it qualifies for copyrighting.
1997.96-1470,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2702.124,2715.865,"Well, is it your position that in construing the statutory language we should give some sort of deference to the position that our Government has taken in negotiating with Trinidad and Tobago?"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2715.865,2722.621,"--We have not asked for deference, nor do we think deference is the right approach to this."
1997.96-1470,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.625,2737.195,"Well, if there's no deference, why... I'm sure we're entitled to be informed about it, but why do you take up your time informing us about it?"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2737.481,2741.349,"--Well, because of the very reason that the Court gave."
1997.96-1470,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2761.096,2762.146,The sentence that you didn't quote?
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2762.146,2771.285,"--That we didn't quote, and the very next sentence starts off, that concern counsels against construing the act differently."
1997.96-1470,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.454,2776.856,"Well, should we look, for example--"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2776.856,2777.439,--as the Court said.
1997.96-1470,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2777.439,2780.324,--Is it the case... I'm not certain at all about this.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2793.818,2804.09,"Well, they have not been brought to my attention, and we're talking here about construing an act of Congress, and--"
1997.96-1470,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.09,2816.564,"So why is the Government... normally the Government takes the position, with what I consider here... you can see the analogy to territorial restrictions imposed by a manufacturer."
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2827.872,2840.863,"--Well, there are trade restraints in copyrighted and patented materials that are not permitted elsewhere, and they're permitted under statutes that Congress has enacted."
1997.96-1470,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2846.684,2867.882,"Mr. Wallace, since it's obvious that there is some ambiguity here, room for different views, since the Government was taking this position in its representations to other nations, why didn't it ask Congress for a clarifying amendment so that there would be no doubt about how the statute should be read?"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2867.882,2873.853,"--Well, I'm not privy to reasons that... why it did not."
1997.96-1470,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2892.165,2894.85,I'm talking about once this problem surfaced.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2911.895,2915.097,"Well, this is not a problem that arises in Government litigation."
1997.96-1470,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2951.77,2955.972,"Then you're saying this is not a very important issue for the Government, however important it is for private--"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2955.972,2956.84,"--Well, it--"
1997.96-1470,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2956.84,2957.624,--participants.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2957.624,2963.594,--We do think it's important because it bears on positions we've been taking in international negotiations.
1997.96-1470,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2965.196,2971.767,"Mr. Wallace, I've been reading subsection (b) and I'm curious, could you just help me with the second sentence?"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2991.762,2992.396,Well--
1997.96-1470,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2992.396,2996.931,--Why doesn't the second sentence describe this case?
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2996.931,3010.774,--It's... it does describe this case for purposes of what the Customs Service is authorized to do.
1997.96-1470,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.469,3071.162,"That just emphasizes, it seems to me, the statement in (a) that importation is not a violation of any importation restriction."
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3077.35,3078.002,The right--
1997.96-1470,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3078.002,3079.435,--doubles up on that statement.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3079.435,3105.485,"--The right to distribute is covered in section 106B, a separate section in a separate chapter of this provision, and something was added here to stand alone in a different chapter, and there are a series of exceptions listed which the petitioner in substance is saying can be explained because they would allow piratical copies in, but they would not allow piratical copies in."
1997.96-1470,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3105.485,3111.223,"No, not piratical copies, legitimate copies made under a different copyright, under a different licensee."
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3118.443,3118.777,But that--
1997.96-1470,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.777,3120.079,You keep referring to piratical.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3120.079,3133.053,--But that limits very... most of these importations that are listed here as exceptions would have been ones where a first sale of a legitimate copy occurred.
1997.96-1470,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3135.089,3140.742,"Well, what about the personal right of a traveler in their baggage."
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3146.21,3151.514,--There's nothing in the copyright law that allows a piratical copy to be brought in.
1997.96-1470,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3151.514,3161.204,"Well, 602(a) now has a specific little provision for somebody arriving at Customs with an illicit book--"
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3161.204,3162.405,But the point I've been--
1997.96-1470,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3162.405,3163.371,--in their baggage.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3163.371,3170.775,"--The point I've been trying to make, and perhaps I haven't explained it, is that 602(b) separately prohibits that."
1997.96-1470,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3170.775,3171.808,Is 602... can you--
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3171.808,3175.429,It prohibits the import of any piratical copy.
1997.96-1470,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3175.429,3185.284,"--Can you correct this, which I'm about to say: 602(a) says, the act of importing is an act of distribution."
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3206.631,3208.566,"Because (a), (a) has--"
1997.96-1470,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3208.566,3209.75,(a) is covering both.
1997.96-1470,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3217.189,3231.682,--It doesn't... what is wrong for a starter is that 602(a) says that importation is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute.
1997.96-1470,5,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3281.162,3282.128,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-1470,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3403.524,3404.657,You could put it more kindly.
1997.96-1470,5,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3410.51,3415.146,"--I will accept that, Justice Scalia, although I don't agree with the ultimate decision."
1997.96-1470,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3415.146,3424.168,"Well, they do say that the foreigners have to advertise it on their own, they have to service it, it doesn't come with a warranty, so there is--"
1997.96-1470,5,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3424.168,3424.354,Well--
1997.96-1470,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3424.354,3425.504,--There's a justification for the differential.
1997.96-1470,5,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3425.504,3426.92,"--They do say that, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.96-1470,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3480.218,3484.753,"But you wouldn't have any problem if you just changed the label, right?"
1997.96-1470,5,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3491.007,3499.613,"--There might be some issues of tampering with goods if we were to take off the label of someone else's product, but I'm not prepared to say what the State law issues there are."
1997.96-1470,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3574.944,3576.444,"Thank you, Mr. Snyder."
1997.96-1470,5,17051,allen_r_snyder,,3576.444,3577.127,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-1470,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3577.127,3578.393,The case is submitted.
