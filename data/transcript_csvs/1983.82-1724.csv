1983.82-1724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.07,"Thank you gentlemen the case is submitted, we will hear arguements next in New York v Uplinger and Butler."
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,13.324,16.676,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,44.945,49.247,"Mr. Arcara, can I ask you a question about the procedural posture of this case?"
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,54.985,55.835,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,55.835,57.937,And you represent the state in this case.
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,57.937,58.803,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,58.803,63.906,"Now, the Attorney General of New York has apparently taken a partial fall in this case."
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,73.845,74.745,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,86.735,89.954,You are not speaking for the Attorney General of New York though?
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,89.954,91.739,"--No, I disagree with the Attorney General."
1983.82-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,91.739,95.274,"I know, I know you do, but he--"
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,95.274,98.143,"Your Honor, he doesn't have the responsibility of enforcing this law either."
1983.82-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,104.463,108.015,"--You have the authority to represent... You can't speak for the State of New York, can you?"
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,109.617,112.267,"--No, Your Honor, I am speaking on behalf of the State of New York."
1983.82-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,112.267,114.002,"For the state, because you have the authority to do that?"
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,114.002,114.868,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.868,116.618,"But, only he has to run for election."
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,116.618,118.836,"I have to run also, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.836,119.836,But not statewide.
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,119.836,120.855,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,145.753,154.159,"Mr. Arcara, do you have some state requirement that the Attorney General has to be vouched in whenever their is an attack on the constitutionality of a New York statute?"
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,154.159,162.063,"--Under the executive law, Your Honor, it says that the Attorney General can appear in court to defend the constitutionality of a statute."
1983.82-1724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,162.063,162.396,No.
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,182.892,184.309,"Your Honor, he has that option."
1983.82-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,187.761,189.313,Are you required to give him notice?
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,189.313,194.534,"--We did give him notice in this case, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,194.534,199.919,Aren't you required to if the constitutionality of a law is at stake and then he has the option.
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,199.919,200.854,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,204.99,207.842,"So, after he got the notice, he never told you he was going to appear in the case?"
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,207.842,208.675,"No, he didn't, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,345.829,379.919,"Well, Mr. Arcara, that may be true, but apparently the New York Court of Appeals placed the construction on the purpose of this statute that was more limited than that said that it was not a statute intended to protect the harassment of other people in the vicinity, but rather was in the nature of the companion attempt statute to another law which New York, of course, had held unconstitutional."
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,387.973,389.175,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-1724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,392.794,399.214,"Well, I was afraid you might have dealt with it incorrectly and that is why I asked the question."
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,399.214,406.97,"Well, Your Honor, I submit that the Court of Appeals applied no statutory construction to that statute."
1983.82-1724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,413.808,421.913,"Well, the Court gave... spelled out what it said the purpose was and was not."
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,424.179,434.304,"No, Your Honor, because the Court, in making its finding, relied upon the Onofre decision and that decision relied upon the right of privacy and the equal protection clause."
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.317,463.038,Do you think in interpreting the New York Court of Appeals opinion we may read the opinion in this case in the light of its Onofre opinion?
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,463.038,469.275,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think you have to."
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,506.298,515.987,"Counsel, here we are dealing with an opinion of New York's highest court that is a little over a page long."
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,515.987,517.003,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,517.003,520.272,"And, it doesn't cite any constitutional provision."
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,534.949,536.733,"It is very difficult, Your Honor, I agree."
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,536.733,541.102,So then don't you think People against Onofre sheds some light on it?
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,541.102,545.506,"Well, People versus Onofre dealt with the right of privacy and equal protection."
1983.82-1724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,559.314,561.814,"Well, this Court denied cert on that."
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,561.814,562.849,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,562.849,571.372,Do you think the New York Court of Appeals held this statute was unconstitutional?
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,571.372,573.588,"It would have to, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,573.588,576.674,"Well, I would think it would have to, but it doesn't say so."
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,576.674,578.34,"Well, it is very difficult, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,609.478,612.18,What did the dissenting judge think they acted on?
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,612.18,634.444,He thinks that they acted on the overbreadth; that they felt... Justice Jasen felt that the Court was applying the law from the setting of a private setting of a home or private residence to the street and he felt it was an overbroad interpretation of the statute.
1983.82-1724,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,634.444,645.084,"Well, possibly the Court based it on either the right of privacy inquiry or possibly a First Amendment problem, is that right?"
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,645.084,647.184,I don't believe there is any reference at all to the First Amendment.
1983.82-1724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,660.059,683.257,"Now, the only intimation I find in the opinion of the New York Court of Appeals in this case as to some constitutional ground is it says this statute, therefore, suffers the same deficiencies as did the consensual sodomy statute."
1983.82-1724,0,38535,richard_j_arcara,,696.998,698.017,"I agree, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1594.439,1597.224,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.154,1620.673,Based on the United States Constitution?
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1620.673,1626.475,It was based... The challenge was based on both the United States Constitution and the State Constitution.
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.475,1628.41,Then what was the case adjudicated on?
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1628.41,1634.081,One can't determine that by looking at the Uplinger decision by itself.
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.081,1634.831,"No, but Onofre?"
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1635.414,1640.568,The Onofre decision was adjudicated solely under the United States Constitution.
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1640.568,1640.851,Right.
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1643.353,1646.489,"Yes, that is what they said in their decision."
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.616,1792.066,Let me ask you this.
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1829.324,1842.649,"I would say that the ground would be that the Court of Appeals has construed the statute as being limited to a smaller... if I may use the word ""geographical"" area... than what you are talking about."
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.059,1862.229,"So, you are saying you couldn't be convicted under the statute even if you were annoying people by your solicitation?"
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1862.229,1864.747,"--Well, Your Honor, I haven't--"
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1864.747,1865.481,Is that right or not?
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1865.481,1870.568,"--I haven't thought that through, I am not sure, but you could be convicted under another statute which is the harassment statute."
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.568,1875.353,I want to know whether you could be convicted under this statute.
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1875.353,1883.292,If you take the construction of the New York Court of Appeals--
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1883.292,1894.433,"I can see that perhaps... Suppose the person first solicited, a person who says, please leave me along, you are annoying me, and refused."
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1910.443,1920.382,--I believe that the way this statute is written and the way the New York Court of Appeals has construed it he would not be convicted under this particular statute at the present time.
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.382,1921.501,On either count?
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1921.501,1922.167,On either count.
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.676,1942.93,Then I can't believe that you say this is a constitutional decision.
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1961.709,1966.03,What I have said is this--
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.03,1968.232,"And, you can't have it both ways."
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,1983.741,1991.328,"--I don't believe... First of all, I am convinced that the Court of Appeals decision was a constitutional adjudication."
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.28,2002.369,Why did it have to reach a constitutional issue if it just construed the statute not to cover either one of the situations that I outlined in those two counts?
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2002.369,2006.857,"--Well, because, Your Honor, it was faced with a fact pattern that is totally different from what you were talking about."
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2016.562,2029.686,"It may be private, but can you imagine holding that when he solicited an undercover police officer that it was sort of a consensual matter?"
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2029.686,2042.196,--I don't think that the determination of the consensual matter can be judged on the identity of the police officer which was not known to the Respondent at that time.
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.065,2051.136,"You mean he can just take his chances, solicit anybody he wants to as long as he doesn't know."
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2054.837,2058.305,"Your Honor, that is not what I say at all and that is not the facts in this case."
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2058.305,2059.491,"Well, I--"
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2059.491,2073.715,What the people are saying is that there is a per se absolute prohibition which is constitutionally permissible that no man or woman can ever have this kind of a conversation with any other person anywhere in the State of New York under any circumstances.
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.715,2075.584,"--Well, that is an overbreadth argument, isn't it?"
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2075.584,2078.869,I believe that overbreadth is necessary here and I don't understand--
1983.82-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.869,2081.719,"Well, if it is necessary, the Court of Appeals didn't think it was."
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2081.719,2082.437,--I understand.
1983.82-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2082.437,2083.971,That is not the state's case.
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2087.339,2112.204,"The state makes the claim, Your Honor, that it can't be done in public under any circumstances except in what it says is a limited circumstance, if two people were in a remote place and no one else was around, which, I submit, is the general situation, in these kinds of situations, as pointed out in the UCLA Law Review Article cited in a couple of the amicus briefs."
1983.82-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2147.044,2151.179,How would that case ever come up if no one is around and they both consenting?
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2151.179,2152.365,It would only come up--
1983.82-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2152.365,2154.381,You are talking about a hypothetical that can't occur.
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2154.381,2183.718,"--It would only come up in the way that this case has come up, through an undercover police officer, which is another way of indicating that the only way that you have offensiveness in the typical situation is where somebody has blatantly posed the question right up front at the very beginning and has not, through a process of acquaintanceship, become attuned to the fact that the other person is receptive to the conversation that is going to occur."
1983.82-1724,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2183.718,2184.42,Mr. Gardner--
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2184.42,2185.637,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1724,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2185.637,2203.481,--do you agree with me on my understanding of the New York Court of Appeals opinion which I am about to state to you that... They say in Onofre we held that you cannot criminalize the act of deviate sexual intercourse and that is their language.
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2216.106,2223.878,I am not sure that they said this prohibits the solicitation.
1983.82-1724,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.878,2224.928,That is a quote.
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2227.829,2228.229,All right.
1983.82-1724,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.243,2257.098,It is not illegal only in the sense that the New York Court of Appeals has opined that the legislature can't make it illegal in Onofre.
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2257.098,2270.858,"--I pointed out in my brief, Your Honor, that it is not illegal after the Onofre decision, as a matter of adjudication in that case, whatever the rule may be in this Court's opinion with regard to the correctness of that case."
1983.82-1724,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.725,2291.154,"Well, I don't know that I agree with you, because if one of the pins of the New York Court of Appeals opinion in this case is the validity of its Onofre decision... We obviously can't review Onofre, but we can certainly review the constitutional law that is laid down in Onofre."
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2291.154,2295.807,I would agree that you have that power.
1983.82-1724,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2336.884,2368.939,"Well, Mr. Gardner, assuming that that is correct and we shouldn't address the correctness of the Onofre decision, nevertheless, if there is any right, as recognized in Onofre, and assuming for this purpose that there is, does that right extent to prohibiting the state from controlling attempts made in public?"
1983.82-1724,1,44825,william_h_gardner,,2384.947,2397.838,"Your Honor, I don't believe that the right of sexual privacy that Onofre talked about is the right that protects my client in terms of his conversation with someone else in a public place."
1983.82-1724,2,38535,richard_j_arcara,,3455.465,3458.833,"Your Honor, I will waive my rebuttal."
1983.82-1724,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3458.833,3460.499,"Thank you, gentlemen."
