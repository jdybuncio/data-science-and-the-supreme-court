2009.08-1569,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.802,"We'll hear argument next in Case 08-1569, United States v. O'Brien."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,6.487,19.462,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 924(c)(1) starts by defining a single crime of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,40.191,40.641,Well wait.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,54.549,55.549,"--Well, no, and, of course--"
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,55.549,56.799,"I mean, (A) says,"
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,63.166,67.987,"--Well, I agree with you that the phrase (A) as well."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.08,102.791,"So does -- so does the language of (A)(ii) and (A)(iii), which is the same language: ""if the firearm is brandished""; ""if the firearm is discharged"" -- they all apply to a conviction for carrying the firearm."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,105.057,105.524,"--Well, I agree."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,107.343,109.028,So that makes (A) the same as (B).
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,114.08,119.051,"--Well, I certainly don't claim that they -- that the elements in the principal paragraph of (A) are."
2009.08-1569,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,137.012,139.564,"No, but you're forgetting the words of this subsection."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,140.347,140.947,--Well--
2009.08-1569,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,140.947,142.249,--the subsection would be (B) itself.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,161.561,164.013,"--Well, I agree it doesn't use ""subparagraph""."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,214.262,226.986,"But still and all, if -- if Congress were being precise and if the statute is to be read the way you suggest, the introduction to capital (B) should have been"
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,242.579,246.781,--That -- that I think would be so precise that we wouldn't be here discussing it today.
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.362,266.895,Yes.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,266.895,271.598,--which is not then to say that this subsection -- that everything in this subsection is an element.
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,272.998,280.454,"I guess I agree with you that if (B) is -- if (B) is an element, (C) would be an element, too."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,280.454,283.004,"Well, that certainly would be the inference."
2009.08-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,305.953,321.448,"What is this to do -- I mean, the obvious question, to me, is -- since I wrote the -- I think I wrote the opinion in Castillo -- is we looked at the language of the statute, very similar to this, and we said: Machinegun means a separate crime."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,346.58,350.781,"--Well, I think there are -- there are several specific changes that Congress made."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.576,368.343,Right.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,368.343,374.897,"And then the new statute is in the appendix to the government's opening brief at 1a and 2a, so you can look at them side by side."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.897,377.015,"Isn't the old one in your brief, too, in your--"
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,377.015,377.615,It is.
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.615,379.217,--It's 3a of the government's brief.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,379.217,381.367,"It is, although, of course, you have to turn the page, and I--"
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.367,382.253,All right.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,382.869,386.121,"--Perhaps it's helpful to look at them next to each other, because the differences are quite stark--"
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.121,386.655,All right.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,386.655,387.188,--when you do that.
2009.08-1569,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,433.018,433.701,But it didn't.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,482.701,485.084,--So a few answers there.
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.199,545.859,"Well, except that with -- with (C), you -- you could say that traditionally recidivism has been a sentencing factor, and you cannot say with respect to (B) that whether it's a short-barreled rifle or a machinegun has traditionally been a sentencing factor."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,547.811,560.968,"--Well, I disagree with that, Justice Scalia, because the tradition, as I understand it, is relevant because it might indicate what Congress was thinking or what suppositions it had in mind when it passed a statute."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.413,605.497,Let's -- let's talk about the guidelines.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,616.788,623.292,"Well, the guidelines -- as before and as now for this offense, the guidelines level is the minimum."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.292,634.648,"The guidelines -- do you think that if under the guidelines the sentence was 30 years because of a machinegun, do you think that that would be upheld?"
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,634.648,636.433,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.0,649.859,Do you think it would be upheld as a reasonable sentence under our Booker/Fanfan theory of -- of how the guidelines are to be applied?
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,649.859,664.083,"--A reasonable -- well, certainly courts have, since Booker, imposed even up to a life sentence for offenses that did not otherwise trigger the elevated minimums."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.027,680.545,"Where -- where is the life sentence maximum, by the way?"
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,688.734,694.138,"--The -- the maximum is not textually in the statute, but all courts that have looked at this have understood that."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.946,708.046,Where -- where do you get the life maximum?
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,711.414,714.802,"--Well, it is certainly the case, if we simply take (a)(1)--"
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.802,718.754,"And if it mentions nothing about life, then these are not mandatory minimums."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,723.658,724.99,--I absolutely disagree.
2009.08-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,732.394,733.679,Is the life part of the--
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,733.679,734.529,Or not less than.
2009.08-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,734.529,736.965,--what the substantive crime was?
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,748.706,750.641,"Well, I wouldn't describe it as an add-on."
2009.08-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,760.914,767.817,"Well, then -- then you wouldn't be relying on what might be a life sentence for the underlying crime."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,767.817,768.786,"--I -- oh, I'm sorry."
2009.08-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.927,784.779,"Yes, but where do you get the maximum?"
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,786.731,790.516,"--Well, they are minimums because they say 5 years> [""]."
2009.08-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,791.083,792.283,But where is -- where is the maximum?
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,792.283,800.139,"--The -- well, because there is no stated maximum, the -- the assumption then must be that a sentence higher than 5 years is appropriate."
2009.08-1569,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,800.572,817.166,"Is there a Sixth Amendment problem with reading a statute this way, with -- with reading a statute to provide for an unlimited maximum when Congress hasn't specified it, and now you're going to have the judge find the minimum and the maximum?"
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,817.166,820.368,"--Well, I don't -- I disagree that the judge is finding the maximum."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.97,826.622,I don't find that implied at all.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,828.388,832.176,"--Well, the trouble, Justice Scalia, is then that I don't otherwise know what the maximum would be."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.176,832.692,That's right.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,833.226,833.692,The maximum--
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.692,835.061,--That's her question.
2009.08-1569,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,835.061,839.763,But isn't there a Sixth Amendment problem with not knowing what you are exposed to?
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.9,853.839,"I think what you are exposed to, as I read the statute, (c)(1)(A) does not impose a new sentence at all."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,882.109,886.577,"--Well, I don't think it would make sense to treat them, as you are describing them, as add-ons."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.986,902.938,I'll amend what I said.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,931.505,938.861,"--Well, I -- I think it would be helpful then to compare this to the -- the language of the prior statute, which describes exactly what you are describing."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,938.861,939.445,I got it.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,939.445,944.349,"Which is -- which is that whoever during or in relation, et cetera, et cetera, uses or carries a firearm--"
2009.08-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,944.349,945.332,Can you give us the page?
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,945.332,948.801,"--I'm sorry, this is at 11a of the petition appendix."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.801,951.384,It's also on 3a of the government's brief.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,951.384,954.436,Or 3a of the -- of the government's -- the government's brief.
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.999,974.382,Right.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,974.382,975.618,--particular determinate sentences.
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.618,976.184,Right.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,976.184,981.605,"If Congress had wanted to continue that approach, I assume it would have kept that language."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.961,994.08,It says (c)(1)(A):
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1020.646,1029.835,"--That -- I understand that language, the in -- the ""in addition to"" language, to have -- to have been to make clear that this is a separate offense."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1034.121,1034.823,Yes.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1034.823,1049.131,"And that then it is a separate -- then from there it is a question what is the appropriate sentence for a conviction on the offense described in 924(c)(1), which is to say, well, it's a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years, which holds open--"
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.131,1052.499,In addition to the term that's -- that exists for the substantive offense.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1052.499,1053.016,--I -- I agree.
2009.08-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1072.044,1089.506,"To make your life a little more complicated and difficult, though perhaps it makes it easier, we reach the questions that Justice Scalia was raising, I think, and they are important only if you win, only if we say that it is a sentencing factor."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1150.173,1163.98,"--Well, to answer -- well, first of all, there certainly has not been in -- in the briefing or argument here, any opportunity for this Court to consider what it would need to consider to overrule McMillan."
2009.08-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1167.551,1171.753,"Well, I think basically Apprendi did significantly change McMillan, but that's--"
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1171.753,1194.119,"--Well, and that's -- and that would be my -- my second point, is that -- is that since -- I think it has been become clearer since Harris that the rule in McMillan and the rule in Apprendi coexist quite well and coexist in a principled fashion, and that there is -- and that there is no -- Harris was correct in light of Apprendi, which is -- which is in the following respect."
2009.08-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.119,1202.355,"--Does the government believe that it has sufficiently argued this, or would you suggest on the government's behalf that if it becomes an issue it's set for reargument?"
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1203.557,1206.776,"Well, yes, we would certainly want to set it for reargument--"
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.776,1207.559,That's the right answer.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1207.559,1208.476,--obviously.
2009.08-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1221.164,1239.458,"Why can't we just say, as Judge Boudin did, they weren't -- this revision was on the books before Castillo was decided, so obviously Congress wasn't trying to adjust the statute in response to Castillo."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1285.604,1288.522,"--Well, I disagree that it's not all that different."
2009.08-1569,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1327.497,1329.765,Isn't a minimum always a maximum?
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1329.765,1330.565,"--No, I--"
2009.08-1569,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1330.565,1346.477,"In -- to the person who would otherwise, in the judge's discretion, qualify for a lower sentence, doesn't it become that person's maximum once you have indiscretion?"
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1346.477,1360.367,--I disagree with that because the principle -- the background -- the basic principle behind Apprendi and our criminal law is that what you can rely on is what Congress has said in the statute or in -- as Booker holds--
2009.08-1569,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1360.367,1372.425,"What you can rely on in an indeterminate sentencing regime without a minimum is that you've got a statutory maximum, whatever it may be, but a judge's discretion to start from zero."
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1386.983,1390.185,"--I disagree with that, because it is not the only thing the judge can give you."
2009.08-1569,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1394.837,1398.771,"Counsel -- counsel, I think you had said you had three responses to Justice Ginsburg--"
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1398.771,1399.373,--Yes.
2009.08-1569,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1399.373,1400.123,--and only got one out.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1400.123,1417.502,"Right, and perhaps only half of that one, which is -- which is that in the -- on the question of -- of tradition, Congress apparently exclusively uses sentencing factors when it wants to do nothing more than give some rules to the judge to channel his discretion with minimum sentences."
2009.08-1569,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1428.524,1429.31,All right.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1429.826,1439.081,"Number two is that the -- is that the -- the -- the linguistic change here, the textual change, the fact that subparagraph (D) says"
2009.08-1569,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1486.229,1495.418,Those are all -- all three of those are -- are pretty subtle ways for Congress to change the view in Castillo.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1495.418,1497.584,"--Well, I would agree that--"
2009.08-1569,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1497.584,1502.738,Moving something from the body of the paragraph to a separate section and so on.
2009.08-1569,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1502.738,1516.796,"--Well, I would -- I would point out -- of course, one has to -- one has to recognize what Congress had before it when it -- when it made the change, which is to say, when it -- when it embarked on these revisions, there was a one-to-one circuit split on the question."
2009.08-1569,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1547.35,1548.783,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.783,1557.206,We have tall lawyers today.
2009.08-1569,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1561.59,1562.525,Mr. Fisher.

2009.08-1569,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1666.427,1671.914,"How about the short -- what is it, the one that gets 10 years, the short-barreled rifle?"
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1693.177,1701.35,"We think, Justice Ginsburg, that if this Court had to construe that statute in a different case, that provision, it would find it's still an element."
2009.08-1569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.255,1766.339,"Oh, I guess I'm not following the ball here."
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1778.564,1780.366,I don't understand that to be what the government has said.
2009.08-1569,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1789.122,1792.157,"Now, they have to because that's what Harris said, brandished--"
2009.08-1569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1792.157,1793.624,"That's -- yes, that's Harris."
2009.08-1569,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1793.624,1794.776,--brandished is a sentencing factor.
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1794.776,1795.409,That's right.
2009.08-1569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.176,1797.645,"--Well, that's even worse, then."

2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1865.603,1866.003,Right.
2009.08-1569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1891.253,1895.055,And you believe there is a background of life sentence?
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1896.991,1899.141,"--I don't think that's necessarily the case, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.674,1900.693,"--Well, it either is or isn't."
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1901.243,1911.049,"--has said a couple of times that this is a theoretical maximum sentence, but, surely, if nothing else, the Sentencing Reform Act sets a maximum sentence here if it's not just a straight determinant sentence."
2009.08-1569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1931.378,1936.365,What's the -- I don't want to interrupt your nice organization here.
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1954.91,1955.577,--Let me answer it--
2009.08-1569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1955.577,1957.279,"Other than, this is just--"
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1957.279,1958.329,--If I might say one more--
2009.08-1569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1958.329,1959.079,--other than how awful this is.
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1959.079,1962.064,"--If I might say one more sentence to Justice Breyer, and then I'll answer that."
2009.08-1569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.064,1962.531,Please.
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1962.531,1971.955,"Justice Breyer, the other thing I'd point out is that, so therefore, once you make the Bailey fix, you just come -- in the old statute, then you come to the machinegun provision, and you just leave it where it was."
2009.08-1569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2004.26,2007.879,Is that just based on empirical studies or is there guideline support for that?
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2007.879,2009.595,"There is both, Your Honor."
2009.08-1569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2011.246,2012.113,I understand.
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2012.83,2017.417,--but the guideline sentences as -- as to this statute are pegged exactly to the mandatory minimums.
2009.08-1569,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2017.417,2017.917,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2025.006,2030.994,Under the facts that either we prove to the jury or are admitted by the defendant.

2009.08-1569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.466,2044.384,Where does 7 years come from?
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2044.384,2051.805,"Seven years comes from -- comes from the statute, for brandishing, which is what both defendants had admitted that they did."
2009.08-1569,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2053.073,2054.939,"Yes, but we know that's a sentencing factor."
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2054.939,2056.941,--But they've admitted it.
2009.08-1569,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2162.905,2185.319,"How do we find it with this statute, if there's a 10-year minimum/maximum under (A) subdivision (iii) if the firearm is discharged, and it's 10 years; and if it's a short-barreled rifle under (B), it's also an equal amount, of 10 years?"
2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2192.342,2194.675,--How do we find substantively unreasonable after Booker?

2009.08-1569,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2208.018,2208.485,Exactly.

2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2375.87,2379.172,I don't contend that Castillo absolutely decides the case.
2009.08-1569,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2519.361,2524.246,"The prior statute -- which was 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1), right?"

2009.08-1569,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2752.238,2756.725,"I assume so, but I don't know the specific answer to that, Justice Kennedy."
