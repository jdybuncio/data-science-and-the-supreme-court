1986.86-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear argument now in Number 86-130, Vickie Lorene Rock v. Arkansas."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,12.058,20.829,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Frank Rock died on July 2nd, 1983."
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,214.371,217.407,What was it she was proposed to testify about?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,217.407,222.644,--She proposed to testify that her finger was not on the trigger.
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,223.061,227.63,Was she going to testify about what she remembered under his hypnosis.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,228.63,229.847,--She was going--
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,229.847,232.999,--She was going to testify what her answers were while she was hypnotized?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,232.999,233.534,"--No, sir."
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,243.14,246.425,Well didn't she make some responses during hypnosis?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,246.425,247.708,"Yes, she did."
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,248.558,253.996,And she remembered making them afterwards or does she claim that those were her independent recollections afterwards?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,253.996,259.315,"--She remembers some of what occurred during the hypnosis, but most of it she did not."
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,277.027,281.931,So she says that something happened to me during hypnosis that made me later remember it.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,281.931,282.265,"No, sir."
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,287.317,290.019,"But after hypnosis she remembered it, whereas she didn't before?"
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,290.019,290.371,"Yes, sir."
1986.86-130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.361,354.644,"Mr. Luffman,--"
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,356.829,357.929,"Yes, ma'am."
1986.86-130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,357.929,373.608,Do you acknowledge that Arkansas or any state does have a right at trial to exclude inherently unreliable testimony whether it comes from the defendant or a witness called by the defendant?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,373.608,386.016,"Yes, ma'am, I do so long as that ruling is not extended to the point that it takes what should be properly a jury question away from a jury."
1986.86-130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,386.016,401.008,"Well, presumably most states take the position that the trial judge may exclude altogether from evidence certain types of evidence."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,413.0,414.352,"Yes, ma'am."
1986.86-130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,414.352,421.172,--And that doesn't violate a constitutional right because the court makes rulings like that does it?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,421.172,423.624,"No, not because the court makes rulings by that."
1986.86-130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,430.111,436.198,Well but it's a traditional function of the court to keep out certain types of unreliable evidence.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,466.551,468.069,I think it could.
1986.86-130,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,488.15,496.237,Well it might very well if the court concluded that the background was such that it was in fact totally unreliable.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,521.102,527.672,"--I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, because I think those areas fall within the traditional area of competency of a witness."
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,545.818,547.92,Well what about somebody who claims to have observed it?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,578.372,581.557,"I believe that's in a different category, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.4,596.35,"Well, that's what you say."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,603.172,605.458,I think a judge could leave it to a jury.
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.308,607.974,That's not the question.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,627.805,633.792,I think that the medium's testimony would be held to be incompetent and I think would be properly excludable.
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.792,642.279,"Well I don't see much difference between that and your case except you know, it's a matter of argument what's reliable and what's not reliable."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,657.407,657.79,I--
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.79,659.807,What of it is suggestion and what isn't?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,659.807,673.084,--I do agree that the state has the right to make that decision of what is reliable and what is not so long as it does not interfere with the person's constitutional right to fairly present his defense.
1986.86-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,698.382,704.203,"Mr. Luffman, was there any record of the hypnosis?"
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,704.203,705.805,"Yes, Your Honor, there was."
1986.86-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,731.02,732.605,Were they played for the jury?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,732.605,732.972,"No, sir."
1986.86-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,736.407,738.276,With a video tape?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,738.276,738.626,"No, sir."
1986.86-130,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,740.644,746.548,What's the custom with respect to how you record that sort of occasion?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,749.5,755.071,Dr. Back's testimony was that she customarily made an audio recording of such sessions.
1986.86-130,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,767.296,771.263,xxx.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,772.782,775.734,"No, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I haven't."
1986.86-130,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,775.734,782.638,Do you know of any instance where the prosecution in Arkansas has used witnesses that have been subjected to hypnotism.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,782.638,785.757,"Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun, we do."
1986.86-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,846.748,854.167,Are you arguing that what's sauce for the goose isn't sauce for the gander in Arkansas under this rule?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,854.167,856.686,"It's certainly wasn't in this case, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.686,860.638,"Well but you haven't made that argument anywhere in your brief I don't think, have you?"
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,860.638,864.959,"Well, I attempted to, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.61,892.21,"Mr. Luffman,--"
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,892.21,899.715,"I don't dispute that the Arkansas Supreme Court has a right to change its mind, or to reach any decision it wants to when the case is properly presented to them."
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.715,903.85,--Well we don't know the basis for the Arkansas Supreme Court's opinion.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,904.134,905.286,"That's correct, Mr.--"
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.286,912.606,--We don't know that it's lawful in Arkansas to allow hypnotized witnesses except for the defendant himself.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,922.362,927.716,"--That's correct, Mr. Justice Scalia, that's why I noted that it was dismissed without opinion."
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.716,932.454,"So it really isn't a sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander proposition we have in front of us."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,932.454,946.344,"Well except in reading of the record, to read the indignation of the prosecuting attorney when the prosecuting attorney objected to not having been informed until the last minute before trial of the--"
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,946.344,946.779,Right.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,946.779,947.046,--xxx.
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.046,950.414,But you're not asking us to censor the prosecutor.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,950.414,952.731,"No, I'm not, Mr. Justice."
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.731,953.816,You're asking us to strike down the Arkansas Law?
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,953.816,955.616,"No, I'm not, Mr. Justice Scalia."
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,955.616,966.258,"xxx case that there's no, that the record doesn't indicate sufficiently that her testimony after hypnosis was caused by the hypnosis."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,966.258,968.542,"That's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.994,980.783,"So as the case comes to us from reading the opinions and what not, that it seems assumed that what she was testifying to was caused by the hypnosis."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,980.783,982.133,--That was the assumption.
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.825,994.277,"--Well, but the courts below thought it was, didn't they?"
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,997.043,1003.883,--The trial court didn't go that far.
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.588,1016.706,Well he wouldn't let her testify.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1016.706,1017.892,That's correct.
1986.86-130,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1017.892,1022.01,Which meant that he had to think that this was caused by hypnosis.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1022.01,1032.902,"But, his step by step ruling are the only indicators of what apparently the trial judge thought might have been the product of hypnosis and what was not."
1986.86-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1077.931,1107.3,"Well the Supreme Court of Arkansas on the first page of its opinion, Appendix A in your petition for certiorari, says that the trial court ruled testimony of matters recalled by appellant due to hypnosis inadmissible because of its unreliability and because of the effect of hypnosis on cross, appellant was allowed to testify about things she remembered prior to being subjected to hypnosis though testimony resulting from post hypnotic suggestion was excluded."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1123.959,1138.236,"That's a deficiency in the record, Mr. Chief Justice, because the state of Arkansas, the Supreme Court of Arkansas also did not have available to it when it made its decision the record of that pre-trial hearing on which the order was based."
1986.86-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1138.236,1142.289,But we're basically reviewing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1145.658,1161.584,"I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, and I was submitting that there is no indication in the record of the case of any testimony of Vickie Rock that was inherently unreliable, or that can be seen from the record to be unreliable."
1986.86-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.584,1167.005,"Well, how does that advance your argument?"
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1167.005,1178.713,Because we maintain she was not permitted to testify to that one important factor that was virtually her only claim to a defense.
1986.86-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1187.751,1188.335,And you're saying--
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1188.335,1189.437,In so many--
1986.86-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1189.437,1196.341,"--whether or not that testimony was caused by hypnotically induced recollection, it should have been allowed under the Constitution."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1196.341,1199.043,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1199.043,1201.745,xxx let's get back to the beginning.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1217.271,1218.805,In this case--
1986.86-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1218.805,1219.54,Not in this case.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1224.358,1246.707,"--If any of the parties to the trial had previously undergone hypnosis and that was the basis, and what was learned from that was the basis of their defense, or the basis of their complaint, and was the only basis, we're submitting that that is a better question for a jury than for a judge."
1986.86-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1246.707,1249.476,"Well, will you go back to my question?"
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1270.405,1272.924,"I think it's much too broad, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1986.86-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1285.732,1291.553,"Why, well supposed you hook it up with the exclusion when you say all witnesses shall be excluded."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1298.909,1302.36,--My argument again is that it's just much too broad.
1986.86-130,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1302.36,1307.68,I think you're real argument is that it applies to you.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1307.68,1324.374,"If it applies to a defendant whose only means of saying her defense is from that testimony which was the product of that, then I think it can be applied in an unconstitutional way."
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.374,1324.724,What--
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1341.402,1341.769,I think--
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.769,1343.37,It seems to me the more unreliable it is.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1347.389,1350.107,"--There are degrees, of course, of unreliability."
1986.86-130,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1393.37,1397.822,"May I ask, Mr. Luffman, I just don't remember in this case."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1402.642,1410.998,The prosecuting attorney was advised of such by the defense counsel when they were exchanging lists of witnesses.
1986.86-130,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.998,1412.232,And one of your witnesses--
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1412.232,1417.236,"And the defense counsel listed as a witness, Dr. Betty Back, who was the hypnotist."
1986.86-130,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.236,1419.688,"--And she, of course, did not testify at the trial?"
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1419.688,1421.521,She testified at the pre-trial hearing--
1986.86-130,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1421.521,1421.938,At the pre-trial.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1421.938,1422.504,--not at the trial.
1986.86-130,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.504,1429.876,And the record is gone but I assume she testified that she did not suggest this particular recollection to the witness.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1430.709,1435.511,"That's correct, sir."
1986.86-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.346,1479.44,"Well the difference there is when somebody refreshes his recollection that way, in such a manner that he's lying, I mean he knows that he didn't remember it before, the jury can observe his demeanor."
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1507.173,1518.481,"I don't think so, Mr. Justice Scalia, because the cross examination and demeanor of the witness is not the only way to impeach his testimony."
1986.86-130,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.868,1560.723,But you agree then that getting at it by demeanor testimony would be ruled out in this situation.
1986.86-130,0,31551,james_m_luffman,,1560.723,1563.092,"Not necessarily, I think it could be."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1582.471,1601.932,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I submit to this court that the issue clearly here presented to you today is whether this hypnotically refreshed testimony is so inherently unreliable that the state of Arkansas may, consistent with the United States Constitution, exclude that testimony when it's offered by the defendant in a criminal case."
1986.86-130,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1634.337,1637.689,"Well now, why should we take your word for all of this, General Clark?"
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1642.442,1643.725,"--No, Your Honor, I do not."
1986.86-130,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1677.949,1683.019,"And yet prosecutors in Arkansas have used hypnotized witnesses, have they not."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1683.019,1687.221,"Your Honor, the prosecutor, in fact in the Cline case did attempt to hypnotize two witnesses."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1726.413,1728.615,But did they know about it at the time of trial?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1728.615,1746.51,"Mr. Putman's associate, a young woman by the name of Priscilla Kay Pope participated in the trial of Cline and Orendorf and I assume as an associate in a small law firm in Arkansas, who participated in this, had knowledge of it, in fact filed the petition with the court prior to this decision, transferred that information and could have well raised it in this case, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.51,1753.231,"Well in this case, but you're not suggesting that the defendant's knew about the hypnotism in the Cline case at the time of the trial xxx."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1753.231,1755.033,"No, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting that."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.449,1765.49,"In this case, the reason that you learned about the hypnotism of the defendant was the defense counsel listed the psychiatrist, or whatever his profession is, as a witness."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1765.906,1767.106,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.106,1782.699,"Is it correct that at the hearing, the record of which is lost, that that expert whoever it was testified that she had not induced this particular scenario of what happened about the pulling the trigger."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1782.699,1785.401,"Your Honor, there were two hypnotic trances in this."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1843.338,1845.523,But it was given before the judge?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1845.523,1846.123,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1847.391,1848.858,It was given.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1849.926,1850.893,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1851.66,1853.128,What happened at the hearing?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1853.128,1854.062,He heard the tapes.
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1855.495,1858.43,Could that have influenced the judgment.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1858.43,1870.654,"Your Honor, I think it influenced the judge's decision in the sense that he felt this testimony was so inherently unreliable that its probative value was outweighed by its ability to mislead or confuse--"
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1870.654,1871.238,Like what?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1872.588,1874.023,"--Well in the second instance, Your Honor--"
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1874.023,1876.558,"It was in your opinion, it was misleading."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1876.558,1879.51,"--Your Honor, I would submit it was in the opinion of the trial judge and I certainly concur with that."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1879.51,1880.127,xxx.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1880.127,1880.91,And the Arkansas Supreme Court--
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1880.91,1882.379,I don't think you can speak for the trial judge.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1883.879,1885.581,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1885.581,1889.633,"May I ask, in your view of interpreting the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1906.994,1908.077,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1912.815,1914.683,--Because it's frequently unreliable.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1914.683,1915.117,--unreliable.
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.927,1959.296,"Well, why wouldn't this be a matter of expert testimony?"
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1959.296,1959.729,--Well then--
1986.86-130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.729,1966.3,"xxx on reliability and depending on what the jury, which expert the jury believed."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1966.3,1989.565,"--Your Honor, the problem with that simply is, is that in terms of the rules of evidence that Arkansas, I submit this Court can fashion you want to have a judicial proceeding that is fundamentally sound in the sense that you allow that trier of fact to judge the witness on their manifestations and indicia of outward concern, their testimony and you don't resolve that issue to a battle of experts."
1986.86-130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.35,2009.062,"In criminal trials and a lot of other trials people, the courts permit the calling of psychologists to talk about eyewitness testimony, its reliability or its unreliability."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2009.062,2016.815,"Certainly, Your Honor, you permit expert testimony to talk about reliability, but not to comment on the ultimate and the final outcome of the issue at hand."
1986.86-130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2016.815,2017.182,"Well, I know."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2022.302,2027.623,"Yes, Your Honor, in the instance that the phenomenon called confabulation, mixing fact and fiction."
1986.86-130,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.007,2056.292,How do we know this?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2058.891,2084.193,"Your Honor, I only know this in the instance that, of course I've read the proffered testimony, but in the instance of the scientific comments on expert, or hypnosis and its effect on an individual is that the weight of scientific authority and the reason that the scientific community has rejected this as a generally accepted standard is that it is unreliable because you lower critical judgment."
1986.86-130,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.248,2120.45,"Well, do these experts say that every single witness coming out of a hypnotic state is this way?"
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2125.02,2135.225,"Your Honor, I think the experts tend to believe that what is remembered post hypnotic, that person believes to a moral certainty that that is accuracy."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2169.549,2178.238,"Well isn't it also true, General Clark, that there are instance in which hypnotism has enabled people to recollect things they have not previously remembered?"
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2178.238,2182.273,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think in this very case it assisted Mrs. Rock in her defense."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2199.235,2206.924,"So that what you're saying is that although it perhaps it's highly unlikely, it is at least possible that the testimony she wanted to give was the truth."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2206.924,2208.358,"--Yes, Your Honor it is possible."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.35,2228.687,"What if you had a, say there are drugs as I understand that are called truth, and I can't remember the name."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2228.687,2229.521,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.521,2232.973,"That presumably, or at least some people think they cause a person to tell the truth."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2240.645,2243.097,"Those drugs are, I think, Sodium Ambithal and Sodium Pentothal and others."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.097,2243.664,Right.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2244.164,2246.899,I think the court could exclude that.
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2265.796,2270.748,"But your rule as I understand this case, doesn't even allow the trial judge discretion to admit this testimony."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2270.748,2271.064,No.
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2271.064,2274.818,"Even if he was persuaded by the pre-trial hearing he'd say I'm sorry, we have a flat rule against."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2274.818,2277.218,We have a flat rule of inadmissible per se.
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2282.472,2282.939,Right.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2282.939,2285.274,--shown to have been known before the hypnotic trance.
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2285.274,2290.662,How will you enforce this rule against an unscrupulous defense lawyer who just doesn't tell you about hypnotic sessions.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2290.662,2298.267,"Well, Your Honor, we are going to be of course, in a situation of jeopardy if defense counsel just is unscrupulous and does not disclose."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.267,2299.85,Or maybe the lawyer doesn't even find out about it.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2307.789,2314.31,"Simply all we could do in this instance, Your Honor, if it was hidden from the state, or hidden from a party in this proceeding, that if some point, If discovered--"
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.31,2314.577,Yeah.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2314.577,2317.062,--raise that issue in terms of appellate relief.
1986.86-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.274,2345.046,"How does that work when you don't know, when there is no record of what was recollected prior to the hypnotic suggestion?"
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2345.046,2345.998,"Well, Your Honor,--"
1986.86-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.998,2346.781,Would xxx the witness--
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2346.781,2357.306,--In this specific case and in the instance of what Mrs. Rock told the hypnotist in terms of the pre-hypnosis notes and there were some handwritten notes in complete sentences.
1986.86-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.306,2357.322,--Right.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2365.976,2368.362,"Under the Arkansas rule, your Honor,--"
1986.86-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.362,2369.697,I wouldn't be able to testify at all.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2369.697,2372.566,--xxx would not be able to testify to anything that was a product of that hypnosis.
1986.86-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2375.184,2377.151,"No, not to anything that was a product of that hypnosis."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2379.302,2380.635,"--No, Your Honor, I submit--"
1986.86-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.635,2381.004,Isn't that right?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2381.004,2392.293,"--that if you could indicate to evidence or this that were outside the subject of the hypnosis you certainly are permissible and permitted and can testify to that, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.43,2397.714,"Oh, sure, sure."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2397.714,2399.132,"--with your husband, those things you could."
1986.86-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.132,2416.511,"But once, unless I have, the burden is on me to make a pre-hypnosis record of whatever the hypnosis is going to cover and if I don't do that whatever the subject matter of the hypnosis happens to be is excluded from my testimony."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2416.511,2417.944,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1986.86-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2420.962,2424.247,"Even though, in fact, I remembered a lot of that stuff before the hypnosis."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2427.299,2428.235,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2428.235,2449.315,What would you do if an unscrupulous law firm assigned one of its unscrupulous juniors to study hypnosis over the summer and he graduated from the hypnosis school and didn't tell anybody and came back and he questioned the witness?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2454.886,2459.02,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that witness would be thrown out for the fact that--"
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.02,2459.587,Why not?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2459.587,2473.014,"--simply the fact that one has studied hypnosis, has graduated from hypnosis school as your hypothetical suggests, Your Honor, does not move to the decision of the Arkansas rule of evidence and that is that when one--"
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.014,2476.882,Well how many years does he have to go to qualify?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2476.882,2479.334,"--Your Honor, that's the problem with this hypnosis itself."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2479.851,2481.168,Well if he goes--
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2481.168,2483.186,"Comedians, dentists, lawyers, anyone can do hypnosis."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2483.186,2485.755,--as many years as this person did.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2485.755,2486.505,Your Honor?
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.505,2488.44,This hypnotist.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2488.44,2495.844,"In the instance that this person, this was a trained Psycho Psychologist who had advanced degrees, so had a baccalaureate degree and an advanced degree."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.844,2496.296,Uh-huh.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2496.296,2503.199,But hypnosis is not a method that you have to have formal training to be able to apply.
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2510.889,2514.257,"Well then why, well why did they have a hearing?"
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2514.257,2517.376,"--Had a hearing, Your Honor, I think in the instance--"
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2517.376,2519.659,Had a hearing to find out of it was reliable.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2519.659,2520.611,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2520.611,2526.649,Well how is it so inherently unreliable that you have to have a hearing to find out if it is?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2526.649,2527.449,Well in this instance I--
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2527.449,2528.767,It's either one or the other.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2528.767,2537.79,"--In this instance, in this Rock case, Your Honor, I submit that what happened was that when Mr. Putman, Defense Counsel, gave the list of his witnesses which included Dr. Back, the first time--"
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2537.79,2538.19,I know that.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2538.19,2541.241,--the prosecution had notice they asked for a hearing to have that testimony excluded.
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2541.241,2544.86,"And if he had found that it was reliable, he would of let it in."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2544.86,2547.478,"I submit, Your Honor, yes he would have, but he did not."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2547.478,2548.728,"Well, of course he would of."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2550.294,2552.896,"He would have been reversed by the Arkansas court, yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2552.896,2554.548,--That's not certain to me.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2556.834,2565.004,I think the rule has been applied by the Arkansas court is one that is applied so that juries can reach verdicts on the basis of logical inference and not guess work.
1986.86-130,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2627.796,2633.35,"There's no pretention here that this was a lie, is there?"
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2633.35,2647.658,"--No, Your Honor, there is no contention that this was a lie, but I simply say that the due process of the law does not require that you put any witness on and let them deliberately lie or let them throw anything that they just happen to feel might have some bearing on the case in the case."
1986.86-130,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2666.055,2672.875,Well it seems to me that a lot of what you're arguing here is great grist for a jury argument.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2672.875,2701.978,"Yes, Your Honor, it could be grist for a jury argument and I submit that in fact that's what Petitioner would like for us to say, except that, constitutionally in Arkansas we're barred from giving instruction on the weight of the evidence, the credibility of the witness, and secondly, in any judicial proceeding where you put counsel, a civil or criminal matter where they cannot effectively cross examine a witness and put them in the trier of fact that guess work, I submit that you don't have a judicial proceeding at that point any longer."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2701.978,2703.044,"But, let me just ask you about that."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2726.26,2729.129,"Yes, Your Honor, I think the answer to that is yes."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.779,2735.965,And this very case could of been of the expert who subsequently examined the gun and come up with the opposite conclusion.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2735.965,2742.036,"But in this very case, the testimony that was excluded I think was equally as beneficial to the state as it was the defendant."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2750.209,2752.577,I presume she was prepared to acknowledge that.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2755.696,2757.415,"The problem is, Your Honor, she doesn't really know."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2796.44,2798.392,He's not terribly generous to let her testify to that.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2799.742,2801.075,But she was not in the instance--
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2801.075,2801.844,"You may not believe it, but--"
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2801.844,2804.879,"--Your Honor, disqualified as a witness to participate in her own defense."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2806.562,2813.734,"--The important part of her, what she wanted to testify to was excluded and was consistent with other physical evidence."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2813.734,2815.851,"Well arguably consistent, Your Honor, with other physical evidence."
1986.86-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2815.851,2816.103,xxx.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2816.103,2820.388,"The experts say it's possible that, under your hypothetical it would be a different situation, of course."
1986.86-130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.388,2832.696,"Mr. Attorney General, I thought that this lady purported to testify, wanted to testify to what she now said she independently recollects."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2861.382,2862.498,"Now, Your Honor--"
1986.86-130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.498,2868.119,"But I remember it now and I will tell you the whole story, Mr. Prosecutor."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2868.119,2872.94,"--I would submit that your hypothetical is inconsistent with this case but in response to your hypothetical, Your Honor--"
1986.86-130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2872.94,2874.206,Why is it inconsistent?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2874.206,2876.742,--I don't think she independently could remember that her finger was extended along the side of the weapon.
1986.86-130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2876.742,2886.364,"I asked the counsel as to what she purported to testify to and he says it's her independent recollection, post hypnotic recollection."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2886.364,2891.652,"But, her post hypnotic recollection, I submit to the Court was enhanced and may be the direct result of fabrication."
1986.86-130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.652,2892.418,That may be.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2895.686,2902.559,"But she doesn't know the difference I submit to this Court, Your Honor, in terms of what she did know pre-hypnosis and post hypnosis."
1986.86-130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.61,2940.084,"Well, that may be, but there was no testimony, she wasn't purporting to testify to what she said during hypnosis."
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2942.884,2944.302,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1986.86-130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.988,2948.638,"She didn't even remember what she said during hypnosis, did she?"
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2948.638,2951.123,"--Your Honor, I don't think she remembered all of what she said during hypnosis."
1986.86-130,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2963.866,2965.65,Well how do you know that?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2965.65,2992.267,"I only know that, Your Honor, in the sense that the process called hypnosis leads an individual and it's in varying degrees, Your Honor, to suggestibility, to lowered critical reasoning and judgment, to a willingness to try to find acceptance to respond in the affirmative acceptance answer to the questions that are asked and that because of that what we simply know is we don't know what Mrs. Rock really knew or what she responded in trying, as I said earlier, to escape from two kinds of prisons."
1986.86-130,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2992.7,2995.469,"Counsel, I'll ask you the question I asked of your opponent?"
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2996.504,3000.373,"No, Your Honor, I have not."
1986.86-130,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3000.373,3002.908,You constantly refer to Ms. Back.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,3005.277,3006.36,"Yes, Your Honor, she was."

1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,3008.379,3009.329,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3009.329,3012.764,So that your reference to her is not an attempt to down grade her testimony.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,3012.764,3014.733,"No, Your Honor, I would apologize to the Court."
1986.86-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3018.417,3020.036,What is a psycho psychologist?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,3026.523,3032.344,"I would have to plead ignorant to what is a psycho psychologist, Your Honor, and could not find a clear definition xxx."
1986.86-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.344,3034.962,Is there a physio psychologist?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,3034.962,3036.462,"I do not know, Your Honor, xxx."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3036.462,3041.2,From what college that gives a Ph.D. in hypnosis?
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,3041.2,3043.0,"I'm not aware of any, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3043.0,3044.502,Well you said she had a Ph.D.--
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,3044.502,3047.687,"Her Ph.D. is in psychology not in hypnosis, Your Honor."
1986.86-130,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3047.687,3054.274,--Well many psychologists certainly are capable of administering hypnosis.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,3054.274,3055.96,"Oh yes, Your Honor, that's correct."

1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,3057.542,3059.161,--including many psychologists who can do that.
1986.86-130,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3059.161,3060.194,Some lawyers can.
1986.86-130,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,3060.194,3061.863,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, too."
