1985.85-519,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.365,We'll hear arguments next in Randall against Loftsgaarden.
1985.85-519,0,38618,robert_a_brunig,,60.28,63.512,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.262,373.695,"Is it possible, Mr. Brunig, that the tax benefit features of a particular investment might be part of a bargained for exchange, or part of what caused the investors to make the investment in the first instance?"
1985.85-519,0,38618,robert_a_brunig,,373.695,377.278,"First of all, the short answer is yes."
1985.85-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.151,409.659,"Well, can they have a market value in the mind of the investor such as would affect the damages recoverable in the event such becomes necessary?"
1985.85-519,0,38618,robert_a_brunig,,409.659,422.398,"Well, every investor, including these, looked on this as an opportunity to recover a profit from the investment and to have certain tax consequences flow from that investment."
1985.85-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.279,483.658,"Well, in this case I guess the... your clients brought the action under both Section 10(b) and 12(2)?"
1985.85-519,0,38618,robert_a_brunig,,483.658,485.238,"That's correct, as well as--"
1985.85-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,485.238,488.46,And 12(2) provides just for rescission?
1985.85-519,0,38618,robert_a_brunig,,488.46,492.924,--In the case of these investors it provides only for rescission.
1985.85-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,499.309,503.583,Does 10(b) provide a different measure of damages?
1985.85-519,0,38618,robert_a_brunig,,503.583,508.215,10(b) has no expressed statutory remedy.
1985.85-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,547.982,559.058,"Well, when the two sections are both brought into the picture, then is it up to the plaintiff to select which measure of damages, or what do you do?"
1985.85-519,0,38618,robert_a_brunig,,563.549,576.669,"The plaintiff is allowed to elect after the jury has returned a verdict, and the trial court in this case under 12(2) has made factual findings."
1985.85-519,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,584.794,591.199,Both issues in... rescission and benefit of the bargain were submitted to the jury for findings of damages?
1985.85-519,0,38618,robert_a_brunig,,591.199,592.869,"No, that's not correct."
1985.85-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,628.103,630.734,Was an election then made by the plaintiffs?
1985.85-519,0,38618,robert_a_brunig,,630.734,642.782,"What happened was, the trial court said that the result was the same, that there was $35,000 per unit plus interest available to these people."
1985.85-519,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,975.772,990.09,Mr. Wallace.
1985.85-519,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,990.09,995.175,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-519,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1230.858,1233.6,Basic error by both courts?
1985.85-519,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1233.6,1266.221,"By both courts, of undertaking to make an amalgamation of the securities issues and the tax issues in the first place in the fraud suit, rather than applying each statute on its own terms and pursuant to its own processes in a straightforward way, seriatim, as the tax law provides and as this Court recognized in the Hanover Shoe case is the proper approach to these cases."
1985.85-519,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1328.573,1332.794,Mr. Friedman.
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1332.794,1335.618,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-519,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1338.209,1342.501,"Mr. Friedman, before you start, could I ask whom you represent?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1342.501,1346.814,"--All the respondents, sir, Mr. Loftsgaarden and his corporation."
1985.85-519,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1346.814,1348.835,Mr. Loftsgaarden must be out of the picture now.
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1351.517,1353.678,"He is very much in the picture, sir."
1985.85-519,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1353.678,1355.761,Where is the juice in this case?
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1360.834,1362.576,I'm not sure I follow you.
1985.85-519,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1362.576,1365.736,"Well, where is the financial responsibility?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1365.736,1369.99,"With Mr. Loftsgaarden exclusively, and his corporations."
1985.85-519,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1369.99,1373.663,Is there money in these corporations?
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1373.663,1376.335,"I don't believe the... well, I don't know the status of the corporations."
1985.85-519,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1376.335,1380.569,"You've come out of New York, a large firm."
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1385.231,1390.897,"Mr. Loftsgaarden is not paying the bill, sir."
1985.85-519,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1429.141,1437.406,Is it your position that deterrence is not one of the functions of the securities law?
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1437.406,1440.438,"Deterrence is a function of the securities laws, sir, yes."
1985.85-519,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1440.438,1446.802,"Deterrence, by implication, embraces the idea of a penal sanction, does it not?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1446.802,1456.117,"Yes, and penal sanctions are found in the securities laws, but the provisions of the securities laws to be construed by the Court in this case are compensatory in nature."
1985.85-519,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1547.677,1558.396,"In terms of congressional policy in antitrust cases, for example, you have a trebling of damages, do you not?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1558.396,1559.087,"--Yes, sir."
1985.85-519,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1559.087,1560.576,"And that is for deterrence, isn't it?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1560.576,1561.587,"Yes, it is."
1985.85-519,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1561.587,1568.533,"There's nothing expressed in the Securities Act about trebling the damages, is there?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1568.533,1569.434,That is correct.
1985.85-519,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1570.065,1580.381,"Well, would you suggest that this large amount would not function as a deterrent with respect to other people similarly situated?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1580.381,1583.161,I expect it may.
1985.85-519,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1686.438,1706.754,"Mr. Friedman, do you know to what extent, if a rescission is obtained as a result of the securities fraud litigation, that IRS could come back later on the investor, seeking a recoupment of some of the tax benefits previously taken?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1706.754,1721.131,"Depending on the situation, the normal result would be that following rescission the monies received would be treated as income by the petitioners here."
1985.85-519,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1793.289,1795.52,I know that motel.
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1795.52,1801.364,"--I'm not sure how to take that, but--"
1985.85-519,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.851,1878.896,I suppose that if the fraud hadn't taken place in the first place there wouldn't have been any tax savings?
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1878.896,1882.039,"--Well, let me examine that very scenario."
1985.85-519,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.919,1925.596,"That may be so, but these people who invested, if they had... they probably wouldn't have invested if they had known what they should have known."
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1925.596,1927.206,--That's right.
1985.85-519,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1927.206,1933.21,Or they may have acquired a tax benefit that was caused by the fraud.
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1933.21,1939.525,"Yes, it was caused by the investment, induced by the fraud, that is correct."
1985.85-519,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.766,1952.655,Your clients were not entirely blameless for causing the--
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1952.655,1954.295,"--No, they weren't."
1985.85-519,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1956.495,1958.408,--The government suffered from the tax benefit?
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1958.408,1961.61,"--I don't think the government has suffered, and I think that's a vital issue here, and I think that's exactly what--"
1985.85-519,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1961.61,1965.702,At least it didn't collect these taxes from these investors.
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1965.702,1967.504,"--But, it encouraged--"
1985.85-519,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.504,1969.867,And it may never be able to collect then from anybody?
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1969.867,1981.365,"--It may not, but the reason it may not is because it sought to induce a kind of economic activity that was in fact induced, and brought about."
1985.85-519,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1981.365,1990.891,"Well, did the government lose anything by the fraudulent nature of the transaction that it wouldn't have lost if the transaction had not been accompanied by--"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,1990.891,1997.223,"Not at all, not at all, and that is what the Second Circuit meant when it said, the government is banking exactly what it agreed to bank."
1985.85-519,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.877,2057.053,"--Do you think the United States, then, has a financial interest in this case at all, or is it just, they think this would be a sort of deterrent way of enforcing the securities laws?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,2057.053,2058.775,"Well, they do have a financial interest."
1985.85-519,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.606,2083.63,"So, the United States would stand to collect some more taxes?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,2083.63,2086.192,"If the award was increased, yes, they would."
1985.85-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2086.192,2100.812,"Well, I suppose the government might have an interest in appearing as amicus before any court reviewing any sort of awards to plaintiffs, urging that the awards be increased on that basis because the government would get more tax money?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,2100.812,2105.226,"Well, they would have an incentive to do that, yes."
1985.85-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.703,2248.788,"What may constitute income for purposes of the internal Revenue Code can be quite different from what we think of normally as income, can it not?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,2248.788,2249.59,Yes.
1985.85-519,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2257.907,2261.08,Do you regard that as income too?
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,2261.08,2261.601,--Pardon?
1985.85-519,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2261.601,2265.051,Do you regard capital gains the same as income?
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,2265.051,2267.873,"They are a form of income, yes, sir."
1985.85-519,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2272.257,2274.247,"They're taxes somewhat differently, aren't they?"
1985.85-519,2,30328,john_m_friedman_jr,,2274.247,2275.689,"--And they are taxed differently, certainly."
1985.85-519,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2396.521,2404.224,"You have five minutes remaining, Mr. Brunig."
1985.85-519,3,38618,robert_a_brunig,,2404.224,2406.565,"Thank you, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-519,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.617,2474.821,"Yes, but what about the relationships between the investors and him?"
1985.85-519,3,38618,robert_a_brunig,,2474.821,2478.774,"--I'm sorry, I don't understand the question."
1985.85-519,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.774,2494.083,"Well, are they being... are their relationships being returned to what they were before, the investors' relationship to Mr.... what's his name?"
1985.85-519,3,38618,robert_a_brunig,,2494.083,2494.754,Loftsgaarden.
