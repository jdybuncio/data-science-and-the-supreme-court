1967.844,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,32.265,"Number 844, Vincent R.Mancusi, Warden, Petitioner, versus Frank DeForte."
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,33.756,37.258,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.844,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,41.878,47.09,You may stop whenever you wish.
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,47.09,66.852,"This case raises the question whether the taking of union records from union premises without a warrant and not incident to an arrest violates the Fourth Amendment right of a union official to be secure in his person, houses, papers, and effects."
1967.844,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,71.399,74.423,But no Fifth Amendment issue here.
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,74.423,81.437,The respondent has never raised a Fifth Amendment issue as such Your Honor.
1967.844,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,81.437,81.948,Thank you.
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,81.948,87.342,It's our position as I -- and I will get to that shortly.
1967.844,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,408.21,432.031,"Apart from the question of whether the respondent has standing to assert the Fourth Amendment infirmity here, do you concede that the seizure of the books pursuant to a subpoena was unlawful?"
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,452.099,454.777,"That's not my understanding of New York law, no Your Honor."
1967.844,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,454.777,456.699,"But that's what happened here, isn't it?"
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,456.699,466.591,That's what happened here and I do not try to justify what happened in this case in terms of a proper execution of the subpoena here.
1967.844,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,466.591,486.743,"So what we have here is a situation that is conceded, they are clearly the unlawful use -- the unlawful seizure of books pursuant to a legal paper, a subpoena that did not authorize the seizure of the books?"
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,486.743,487.038,Well --
1967.844,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,487.038,495.966,"And the question is whether this respondent has standing to assert the infirmity, am I right?"
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,495.966,510.446,That is the question although I would submit that the term standing is itself a shorthand expression for a description of whether or not this was an unlawful search in terms of this particular individual's Fourth Amendment rights.
1967.844,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,510.446,511.622,"Yes, I agree."
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,516.49,519.482,"But except for that, what you've said is correct."
1967.844,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,519.482,524.573,"Well, then I gather that -- that's to say we can treat it as if there were no subpoena in the case at all?"
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,532.563,536.583,I believe so Mr. Justice Brennan.
1967.844,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,551.74,569.153,"Well, it would be the same issue if he had refused to turnover the books and records pursuant to subpoena and then the decisions had gotten to the Court for an order and he had said, ""This violates my own rights""."
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,569.153,574.329,"Well, it's my position that his rights are no different if that had been what happened."
1967.844,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,574.329,577.957,"That's right, absolutely."
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,577.957,586.471,"First, with respects -- with respect to the items that were taken, that is with respect to the papers and effects clause of the Fourth Amendment."
1967.844,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,652.126,658.533,You make no point to the fact that this man was only a minor official or a general (Voice Overlap) --
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,658.533,659.809,He was a vice-president.
1967.844,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,659.809,665.546,"It wouldn't make any difference to you if he had absolute charge of him for the Union, would it?"
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,665.546,665.771,No.
1967.844,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,667.776,673.866,But his status has no relevancy in that -- on this issue we have here.
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,673.866,679.751,"No, I think we can assume that he had as much status as a union officer could ever have like -- he was the custodian of the books."
1967.844,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,679.751,681.225,Yes.
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,681.225,685.599,And I think under United States against White that's irrelevant.
1967.844,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,714.927,722.182,I suppose the Union could have brought an action to compel the return of these records to it.
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,722.182,723.342,I would assume so.
1967.844,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,723.342,733.335,The Union as -- it's a non -- unincorporated association and in New York because they have the capacity to sue?
1967.844,0,36514,michael_h_rauch,,733.335,741.655,"Well, I have foreseen it on the assumption that there is an unincorporated association and that it would have capacity to obtain return of the records."
1967.844,1,31925,justice_marshalll,,781.175,791.533,Did the Second Circuit -- didn't the Second Circuit say that the determining factor was whether the search was aimed at the individual involved?
1967.844,2,36514,michael_h_rauch,,791.533,795.098,"I believe that that's the crux of the Second Circuit's decision, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1967.844,3,31925,justice_marshalll,,795.098,797.779,What's wrong with that?
1967.844,4,36514,michael_h_rauch,,797.779,799.154,"Well, what's wrong with that is the --"
1967.844,5,31925,justice_marshalll,,799.154,801.423,They would have to this man.
1967.844,6,36514,michael_h_rauch,,801.423,807.102,"Well, first -- in the first place, factually that's not entirely correct."
1967.844,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.375,866.027,The --
1967.844,7,31925,justice_marshalll,,866.027,875.78,"He agree that if they had taken from his desk his personal bankbook, that would have been bad, could not have been used, could it?"
1967.844,8,36514,michael_h_rauch,,875.78,877.198,I think not.
1967.844,9,31925,justice_marshalll,,877.198,886.46,"But if it is a bankbook that had his entries in but the bankbook was technically in the name of the Union, they could take it."
1967.844,10,36514,michael_h_rauch,,886.46,890.552,"Well, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by his entries."
1967.844,11,31925,justice_marshalll,,890.552,893.604,"Well, you said somebody -- books were kept by him."
1967.844,12,36514,michael_h_rauch,,893.604,898.594,He kept the books as -- in his role as a union official.
1967.844,13,31925,justice_marshalll,,904.934,907.659,"And if they'd been his personal checks, you couldn't take it?"
1967.844,14,36514,michael_h_rauch,,907.659,909.19,I would assume not.
1967.844,15,31925,justice_marshalll,,909.19,912.313,"But because they were Union's check, you could take it."
1967.844,16,36514,michael_h_rauch,,912.313,913.479,That's our position.
1967.844,17,31925,justice_marshalll,,913.479,916.141,And either one would have equally incriminated him?
1967.844,18,36514,michael_h_rauch,,916.141,921.884,That's our position and we believe that United States against White for example supports it.
1967.844,19,31925,justice_marshalll,,922.122,926.448,"Well, what about United States against Jones, I don't mean United States -- the Jones case have --"
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,926.448,934.266,"We also believe that the Jones case supports it, except in the narrow areas of possessory crimes which this is not."
1967.844,20,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1050.147,1067.294,"I gather that -- do I correctly read it that Court of Appeals of saying that had this been a legal seizure than under White, this respondent would have had no basis to complain, is that right?"
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1067.746,1071.365,I'm not -- had been a legal seizure in that --
1967.844,20,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1071.365,1075.724,Had the (Voice Overlap) -- the materials had been legally obtained?
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1076.114,1079.742,"Well presumably, we wouldn't be here if that had been the case."
1967.844,20,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1079.742,1082.397,"Well, I'm -- what I'm -- I was trying to figure --"
1967.844,20,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.397,1094.269,"But if the Second Circuit is right, the union official that charged the books like this respondent, the union official does not need to turn them over under this -- in response to the subpoena."
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1108.99,1109.876,Well --
1967.844,20,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.876,1111.26,Under the Second Circuit (Voice Overlap) --
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1111.26,1112.171,I don't want to be in a position --
1967.844,20,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.171,1117.792,"Because there is no way of a having legal seizure under this opinion, is there?"
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1117.792,1124.163,I don't want to be in a position of defending the Second Circuit's decision Mr. Justice White.
1967.844,20,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.011,1148.674,"Well, if it extends the -- it just said, the gentleman has the right to assert his rights under these consequences, we -- under these circumstances, why wouldn't his --"
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1148.674,1148.721,Well --
1967.844,20,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.721,1150.218,-- Fourth Amendment rights apply?
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1150.218,1173.632,"This -- I under -- I see what you're getting at and this indeed is what we are getting at, that is that the rationale for the denial of the privilege under White, namely the character of the books, his lack of any personal relationship to them in the sense that it does not -- they do not involve any element of the privacies of his life."
1967.844,20,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1191.598,1216.523,"Well, I don't follow that, not if I read -- get the correct import of what I'm about to read to you, page 34 from the opinion, this still was of course was a privilege but nevertheless, it said that, “If these materials had been legally obtained, the Fourth's -- Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination would not have prevented this evidence of being used against him,” relying in White."
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1241.611,1248.973,I think it turns on that fact as well as on the fact as Mr. Justice Marshall observed that the search was directed at this defendant.
1967.844,20,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1261.912,1262.95,Yes.
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1262.95,1265.084,-- we believe that undermines the rationale of the White case.
1967.844,20,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1265.084,1265.82,You don't think that --
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1265.82,1267.942,"That sort of beside the point, what they said there."
1967.844,20,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1267.942,1274.451,"Yes, whether or not the privilege is involved or a Fourth Amendment right is involved, the same result should follow under White."
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1274.451,1275.809,"Yes, I do believe that."
1967.844,20,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1382.789,1390.348,How did the Court of Appeals' opinion deal with the White case?
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1390.348,1392.159,"Well, I just -- we just went through that."
1967.844,20,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1392.194,1393.372,(Inaudible)
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1393.372,1394.413,They -- what they did --
1967.844,20,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1394.413,1395.692,Just show me the page.
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1395.85,1397.267,"Alright, I have it at page --"
1967.844,20,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1397.267,1401.25,"I think its 34, just in the Footnote in the petitioner's (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.844,20,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1401.25,1403.59,"Alright, fine."
1967.844,20,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1405.211,1407.826,"They've dealt with it only in the Footnote, that's the only record presented with it."
1967.844,20,36514,michael_h_rauch,,1407.826,1417.627,It's page 41 of the appendix at the -- in the Footnote.
1967.844,20,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1693.135,1699.411,Mr. Lekin.
1967.844,21,31439,james_l_lekin,,1699.411,1704.126,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.844,21,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1712.928,1714.546,You say assigned counsel?
1967.844,21,31439,james_l_lekin,,1714.546,1716.803,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.844,21,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1938.05,1939.256,Do you mean in Judge Kaufman's opinion?
1967.844,21,31439,james_l_lekin,,1939.256,1941.027,"Yes, in Judge Kaufman's opinion."
1967.844,21,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1965.747,1971.332,"Well, could I ask you -- do you think White has an issue with the Fourth Amendment?"
1967.844,21,31439,james_l_lekin,,1971.332,1972.2,No.
1967.844,21,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1972.2,1982.115,White said -- the opinion in White says that he relies upon the unreasonable search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment and the explicit guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.
1967.844,21,31439,james_l_lekin,,1985.945,1986.848,"Your Honor, I think it has nothing --"
1967.844,21,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1986.848,1990.921,-- requires that recognition of the privilege supplement.
1967.844,21,31439,james_l_lekin,,1990.921,2004.724,"Alright, to answer your question, I think that the Fifth Amendment -- White and Wilson have absolutely nothing to do with the Fourth Amendment in this particular instance and I have explained this on page 18 of my brief as well as I can."
1967.844,21,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2020.798,2028.9,"But I gather you mean, aimed at illegal searches and seizures, you mean specifically in the context of the deterrence, the Mapp rule?"
1967.844,21,31439,james_l_lekin,,2028.9,2034.291,"Specifically, in the terms of police or federal authorities going into whatever it might be --"
1967.844,21,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2034.291,2035.725,"Yes, but deterrence?"
1967.844,21,31439,james_l_lekin,,2035.725,2036.159,That's right.
1967.844,21,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2036.159,2039.092,Deterrence against the -- committing illegal searches and seizures.
1967.844,21,31439,james_l_lekin,,2039.092,2039.788,That's right.
1967.844,22,36514,michael_h_rauch,,3296.361,3321.793,"All I would say in rebuttal Your Honors is that the issue which the respondent has attempted to inject indirectly into this case, namely the whole question of standing itself is one that was not briefed below and I can't say whether it was argued below because I didn't argue in the case below myself, but it was not -- neither has it been briefed here."
