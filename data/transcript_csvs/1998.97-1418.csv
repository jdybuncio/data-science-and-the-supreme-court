1998.97-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,123.628,127.949,So that it's actually a different group of individuals than it was before?

1998.97-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,129.449,133.435,"If it's a different partnership, in effect, do they have different partners?"
1998.97-1418,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,133.435,137.054,--It is the reorganized debtor.
