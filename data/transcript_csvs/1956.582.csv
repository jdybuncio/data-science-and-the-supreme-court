1956.582,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,38.109,"Number 582, Samuel Roth, Petitioner versus United States of America."
1956.582,0,20505,david_von_g_albrecht,,39.294,41.077,My name is Albrecht Your Honor
1956.582,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,41.077,42.849,"Mr. Albrecht, you may proceed."
1956.582,0,20505,david_von_g_albrecht,,46.173,59.73,"The complement in any events, I would like to reserve 10 minutes of my time for conclusion for my able associate, Mr. Rogge for rebuttal."
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1079.938,1086.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1956.582,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1184.02,1187.678,Do we have to assume that that it's concededly obscene?
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1189.859,1196.879,"No, the question -- it is concededly obscene within obscene, the standard of statutory standard."
1956.582,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1203.325,1205.012,Where the obscene means?
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1205.012,1215.914,"And enough to be a criminal statute.If it means anything, these -- these advertising circulars in this one book are obscene.You still have the question whether it means or not."
1956.582,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1253.622,1255.218,But that wasn't this statute at least.
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1255.218,1262.026,"No, but the standard, the New York standard of obscenity did not challenge the constitutional validity of an obscenity statute."
1956.582,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1262.026,1268.298,"And do you think that you're discussing this thing as though this isn't a statute by the Congress for the regulations of mails, is it?"
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1269.463,1272.205,"No, I -- I lean heavily on that, I think of the easiest grounds which decide it."
1956.582,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1272.205,1275.32,Why don't you talk about the Hecate case?
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1275.32,1281.282,"Well, the -- the argument that is made here is that -- that no obscenity statute can be acted."
1956.582,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1285.886,1291.935,"But you haven't got a -- an ordinary obscenity statute here, whatever one may think of that."
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1298.468,1301.366,The first custom statute is in 1842 and this one is 1865.
1956.582,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1301.366,1304.882,You've got here a question of regulating the mails.
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1312.464,1314.289,"No, no, not at all."
1956.582,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1316.029,1317.297,It only confuses me.
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1322.085,1336.644,"The -- if it were a regulation of the mail and if Congress although the First Amendment can impose no restraint whatever on speech not leading to conduct, you would have a different question than you'll have here."
1956.582,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1339.024,1342.245,"You're suggesting, you don't have to follow in its wake."
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1342.245,1344.069,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1956.582,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1353.735,1362.699,"But this is a -- I -- this is a particular statute and not at large, general obscenity, the area of obscenity."
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1365.894,1366.922,"No, this case is not."
1956.582,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1366.922,1373.539,"Well, we didn't ask the Government just to discuss all alternative statutes."
1956.582,1,39278,roger_d_fisher,,1373.539,1381.978,"We did not discuss all obscenity statutes, although some of the issues go far beyond issue in this case."
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3122.083,3126.007,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1956.582,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3158.174,3164.413,You may file it.
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3164.413,3170.325,"Now, the next point I'd like to make is to be sure that we're talking about this case."
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3426.026,3433.203,"Mr. Rogge, since you're quoting a dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes, they never strike at my Achilles heel, including him."
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3433.203,3435.785,The Court approves that in Hannegen against Esquire.
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3435.785,3442.9,I suggest that as -- I suggest there's another dissenting opinion on which I suppose you would rely which you do not cite in your brief.
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3461.954,3466.298,"Now, you ask -- I'm -- I'm sorry that I don't have that additional --"
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3466.298,3469.333,"258 U.S.138, you find it."
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3469.333,3475.117,"I am familiar with the citation if Your Honor please, but I have not reread it in connection with this."
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3480.447,3480.476,I may (Voice Overlap) --
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3480.476,3485.531,-- require briefs to be filed in particular periods of time don't always leave one that much time.
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3485.531,3496.115,"Well, in that -- in that dissent, he suggested that the Court reconsider the Jackson case way back in 1872 and I should suppose that's the strength of your case."
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3496.115,3518.403,"Well, I had assumed that when this Court granted certiorari on the three questions of whether the federal obscenity statute involved here was in violation of the First, the Fifth, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, this Court was going to reconsider that statute, although it's been on the books for over three quarters of a century and has been assumed to be constitutional at times, but --"
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3518.403,3522.394,Do you think that's the same thing as though this statute was passed yesterday?
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3550.912,3562.571,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, if this statute as I submitted is, is in violation of the First, the Fifth, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, I submit to Your Honor that it doesn't make any difference if it's been on there for a 150 years."
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3562.571,3569.015,"I agree with you entirely, but before determining whether it is, we better consider what has been."
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3569.015,3581.067,I submit to Your Honor that the constitutionality of this statute on the points in which we raise in this brief has not been squarely argued and considered by this Court and I think you should do so now.
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3581.067,3593.824,"What do you do with Ex parte Jackson, a very history to which you refer the abolitionist debate in the Senate and the vote against President Jackson's proposals?"
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3593.824,3594.712,Ex parte Jackson involved --
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3594.712,3597.222,Was all that it dealt with in that opinion.
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3597.222,3598.057,Ex -- what --
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3598.057,3602.256,"He prodded out as though it was a novelty, something new that we've heard."
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3602.256,3619.703,"Well, if I'm not mistaken, that case dealt with a lottery and it was in the course of that that the Court makes the point and quotes the Congressional history on the defeat of President Jackson's proposal for prohibiting the use of the mails, the so-called incendiary literature."
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3619.703,3633.125,"And draws the conclusion that despite the evidence of the men who made those feature in the Senate, both the Statesmen and jurors had rejected them."
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3633.125,3660.234,"I submit, if the Court please, that on the first two major occasions, which involved statutes aimed at speech, namely at the time of the Sedition Act of 1798 and again in 1835 and 1836, when the Congress was considering the passage of the law that President Jackson asked for against what in old days were called incendiary publications."
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3708.81,3711.387,"Well, of course it doesn't have as to libel."
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3721.425,3723.544,"They're in the First Amendment area, if Your Honor please."
1956.582,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3723.544,3727.931,Everything that's in an area isn't the same.
1956.582,2,37550,o_john_rogge,,3727.931,3735.005,"Now, I want to address myself for a moment to the point that Mr. Justice Douglas raised."
1956.582,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3827.639,3834.505,"Mr. Rogge, you may -- you may have five minutes more if you wish to with your argument."
1956.582,3,39278,roger_d_fisher,,3834.505,3835.833,I just wanted to make this last point --
1956.582,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3835.833,3836.266,"Yes, you may."
1956.582,4,37550,o_john_rogge,,3836.266,3838.634,-- Mr. Chief Justice.
