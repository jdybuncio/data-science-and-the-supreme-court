1967.68,0,39656,richard_kanner,,0.0,13.22,-- whether it is feasible for this Court to accept standard by which the effectiveness and duty of a Court appointed trial counsel can be measured.
1967.68,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,122.618,135.596,"Excuse me sir, did you say you were or were not going to discuss point 1C in your brief that psychiatric witness' point."
1967.68,0,39656,richard_kanner,,135.596,147.37,Yes sir Your Honor I expect to discuss that on to the topic of the test in determining the adequacy of trial counsel.
1967.68,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,147.37,152.985,Because that's the only importance here attached to the point in this case.
1967.68,0,39656,richard_kanner,,152.985,173.274,I feel that the failure to present such testimony Your Honor is one of the indications to show that trial counsel completely abandoned all defenses that were applicable so far as the question of mercy was concerned Mr. Justice.
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3169.195,3173.563,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3273.585,3274.912,May I ask?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3292.687,3295.812,Judge I don't know whether--
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3295.812,3298.19,We don't have the original file record here?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3298.19,3304.993,"No, and let me say this, there is a very little of the original file record, most of it is taken by the voir dire."
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3339.795,3343.416,All you fellows seem to get there lately?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3343.416,3347.084,"I am almost a native, I was just away for a while."
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3347.084,3353.407,I understood you to say [Inaudible]
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3353.407,3358.015,He was not in Miami at that time I believe he said he did not live in Dade County.
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3365.187,3367.271,Mr. Carlisle.
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3367.271,3368.742,Yes sir.
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3368.742,3378.596,Nobody here in this courtroom knows as of now what was shown over television.
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3379.839,3381.1,That's correct Your Honor.
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3381.1,3385.139,So why should we have an evidentiary hearing to find that.
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3386.016,3387.837,Because you don't need one.
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3387.837,3388.865,Why not?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3388.865,3399.564,"Well, let's, let me I guess I am getting ahead in my argument, but I am glad you asked the question because it's a beautiful time to answer it."
1967.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3472.028,3476.478,What was the defendant's counsel's name?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3479.457,3489.602,"We had, no Gerstein is our state attorney in Dade county and Mr. Block is in there too as, also an assistant state attorney at the time."
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3496.765,3497.865,And Judge Goldman.
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3497.865,3499.888,Judge Mitchell Goldman.
1967.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.888,3503.299,The defense counsel had complete opportunity to question each juror?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3503.299,3511.554,"Yes sir and did so, I say and if you read the appendix did so with vigor."
1967.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3511.554,3534.571,"Well now of course your ground if you just – you spoke of -- it's not a ground I believe there are -- that was articulated by either at the trial court which dismissed this petition and nor by the Court of Appeals which confirmed it, and isn't the reason that district court appeals gave, it was saying that on this point there need to be a hearing."
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3534.571,3547.415,"No I -- it is of course my argument and it was in the third district court that the voir dire proves that this was a fair trial at least as far as the jury, the composition of the jury --."
1967.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.415,3550.123,That's what said in its opinion --
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3550.123,3551.101,"That's right, but –"
1967.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3551.101,3555.776,-- the court said he didn't move for a change of venue and that's the end of it.
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3566.626,3586.922,"Let me again I think I started out saying I didn't want to argue my opponent's case and yet I want to make clear what I think his position is, and I believe I can do this I only got far of it out and I began to answer questions and I am not deferring your question I am going to answer it right now."
1967.68,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3636.943,3645.065,I want to ask you a very question that I try to put as simply and directly as I can.
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3664.585,3665.78,"That is right, Your Honor."
1967.68,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3674.975,3676.412,"Alright, alright I understand."
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3676.412,3677.717,Alright.
1967.68,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3677.717,3698.515,"Now subsequently collateral proceedings the court did not afford the defendant, petitioner here an opportunity to introduce evidence as to that prejudice, allegedly prejudicial publicity is that right?"
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3698.515,3699.988,That is correct.
1967.68,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3699.988,3721.96,"Now the question is, whether the petitioner here was deprived of constitutional right by reason of the court's refusal in collateral proceeding to permit him to present evidence with respect to this prejudicial publicity."
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3773.437,3806.193,Alright Your Honor my answer is that it was not a denial of due process for this reason that assuming as we must in the posture of this case that there was adverse pretrial publicity that nevertheless the voir dire examination of the jurors establishes beyond any shadow of a doubt that no prejudiced juror was seated in that Jury box.
1967.68,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3806.193,3819.854,"Now you are saying that if this was error, was harmless error, I'm not sure it depends on the legal infirmity here if there is a legal infirmity?"
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3819.854,3823.724,"There is no legal infirmity, there is no harmless error."
1967.68,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3823.724,3826.096,"Let's point to, now lets see your position on that."
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3834.57,3838.249,I don't like it when you say there was no harm done Mr. Justice.
1967.68,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3838.249,3843.174,Well you stated it your way but give me a complete answer to that.
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3843.174,3868.904,"Well Mr. Justice my position is simply that no evidentiary hearing is necessary if, I assume and I am positive that in Florida or that in the Federal courts under 2255 a motion to vacate a judgment and sentence is handled the same way it is in Florida."
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3933.263,3955.063,"Mr. Carlisle, can you conceive of one or more television performances that would make it on its face impossible to hold a trial in that area?"
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3955.063,3963.401,"You know we asked this question at the time Oswald was shot by Ruby, everybody saw it many, many times."
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3975.373,3983.134,Well do you agree that there is a possibility of such a television show?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3992.385,3995.778,"You wouldn't consider me unfair if I said no, would you Mr. Justice?[Laughter]"
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3995.778,3998.623,Under those circumstances I would not?[Attempt to Laughter]
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,3998.623,4006.937,"No seriously Mr. Justice I don't know maybe, you know I said I have always been a --"
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4006.937,4010.12,"I remember you said a minute ago once we are here, let's sort it out?"
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4010.12,4011.021,I know and --
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4011.021,4013.337,Well you were there and --
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4013.337,4013.761,I know and --
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4013.761,4017.331,And he had a chance to putting on the evidentiary hearing and then you said no.
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4017.331,4029.315,"I think that -- I have always been, well I have always been a prosecutor on the prosecution side, there are very many times when I could see a case, a defense case and say well I'd like to defend the case."
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4050.492,4061.22,"But Mr. Carlisle in this according to the allegations he not only confessed to this one, but he confessed to, I've lost count of them, how many of them?"
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4061.22,4065.74,He killed a total of seven people he shot one man with gun.
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4065.74,4077.08,"Wouldn't that be material to whether or not he was entitled to mercy, not guilty or anything but mercy?"
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4077.08,4082.013,You mean that perhaps these Jurors saw this.
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4236.067,4237.85,Mr. Kanner may I just --
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4237.85,4239.24,I am Carlisle.
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4239.24,4244.688,"I beg your pardon, excuse me, may I ask you a question on a different subject."
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4286.729,4296.068,"Your Honor, I hate this argument by adequate state grounds, but anyway let's go into it a moment."
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4297.187,4302.508,But you may hate it but let me suggest you that it has a very great bearing on our jurisdiction?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4302.508,4334.181,"I understand that Your Honor, but if the only contention raised by the petitioner had been the adverse pretrial publicity perhaps the holding of the Third District Court of Appeals of the State of Florida that failure to move for a change venue and failure to exhaust the peremptory challenges constitutes a waiver or an adequate state ground."
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4348.702,4355.505,"You may not agree with it but I expect we have to, we're governed by it and in fact an adequate state ground, isn't it?"
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4355.505,4356.404,If in fact –
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4356.404,4359.59,"That was the Court held, whatever might be your view of?"
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4359.59,4406.58,"I think they could have set a great deal more and I would like to state it here, let me continue to answer your question though, as I say that if the only allegation had been this pretrial publicity that would have been an adequate state ground, but counsel has also alleged that the -- he was -- petitioner has alleged that he was denied the adequate assistance of counsel or the effective assistance of counsel in that his attorney failed to move for a change of venue, failed to ask for these instructions, fail to use the psychiatric witnesses and that would -- I would like to make that portion of my -- that portion of this case, that issue, the second portion of my argument."
1967.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4443.927,4446.139,The second argument where?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4446.139,4449.657,"My second, your – [Laughter]"
1967.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4449.657,4461.123,What about his -- was this -- was the argument about denial of effective assistance of counsel raised in the District Court of Appeals?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4461.123,4462.803,Oh yes Your Honor it was.
1967.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4462.803,4466.48,Why didn't the District Court of Appeals passed on it?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4466.48,4469.196,I'm not so sure they didn't but if they --
1967.68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4469.196,4476.85,"Well, they certainly didn't pass on it as respects the publicity failure to move for change of venue."
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4490.104,4525.831,"Your Honor, they close by -- its not because we didn't tell them either, it's -- they closed by saying that the quoting from the record of the Supreme Court in the habeas corpus which Mr. Whitney took to the Florida Supreme Court the opinion and that just simply says the record is to devoid of any evidence that petition's counsel failed to act in good faith, whether they -- it's quoted on page 8, and 9 on my brief, I don't want to read it to you, at any rate that's the only mention they make of whether counsel was confident or not."
1967.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4630.981,4643.085,Because the lawyer [Inaudible]
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4643.085,4645.018,That's what they allege.
1967.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4645.018,4650.303,They allege but the court – has the lawyer [Inaudible]
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4650.303,4665.039,"As far as the transcript of the habeas corpus and that's really the only point where we get to ask the attorneys and happened, there's no evidence about it, it was not an issue at that time and we must take as true."
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4745.831,4752.07,What was there interval between the date of his arrest in West Palm Beach and the date of his trial?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4752.07,4755.54,"Your Honor, I'm not sure I'm giving you a perfect answer."
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4761.907,4768.802,And anything -- because we don't know at all when if ever the state televised it?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4768.802,4770.525,We don't know when it was broadcast.
1967.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4770.525,4775.559,"Whether it was close to trial or rather back at the time of arrest, we know nothing of that."
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4775.559,4779.37,"No, we don't."
1967.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4791.129,4797.011,Then I guess you would have to assume jurors [Inaudible]
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4797.011,4813.113,"Well, if you wanted to reverse this I think you're going to have to say that voir dire is no longer a useful tool and while you might as well then go on and say that that sworn testimony in court is no longer useful tool in determining truth."
1967.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4822.831,4855.334,"But do you now assume that in every cases of trial unless they adopt a -- wanted to use retroactive, non retroactive rule to the evidence, you have everybody hearing [Inaudible] you could demand and get a constitutional evidentiary hearing [Inaudible] because he alleged some statement made by him were uncovered?"
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4855.334,4858.559,Unless of course we could prove the statements were not manky.
1967.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4858.559,4868.124,"Well but I am talking about the constitutional rights and evidentiary hearings, constitutional right that is evidentiary hearing."
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4887.928,4905.238,"That specter does present itself but I would say there are two -- as a prosecutor now there are two ways you find such a motion, when the allegation is made you find – you gather up all of the publicity and say this is all there was although the burdens fall on me."
1967.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4905.238,4910.409,On finding you would have evidentiary hearing before the court?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4910.409,4914.323,"That's right, this -- such an allegation it would --"
1967.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4914.323,4916.599,Constitutionally speaking.
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4916.599,4917.768,I don't know about constitutionally speaking.
1967.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4917.768,4938.46,"I mean if, this I assume if it's a decision of reversing this, it'll be a constitutional decision on the federal -- United States constitution not just the question to whether we want to say that that practice of [Inaudible] question of really constitution."
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4938.46,4963.223,"If I understand you Your Honor I believe you are saying that from this time on anyone who came forward in a 2255 motion or anybody who came in a Florida Rule 1 motion and alleged that there was this adverse pretrial publicity a la Rideau, but right then we would have to have an evidentiary hearing and you are right."
1967.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4963.223,4964.995,"It would have to be, yeah."
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,4964.995,4968.54,You are right.
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5052.207,5063.317,"To the contrary, I understand petitioner's point, one that this publicity was so violent and so horrible and so everything else."
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,5073.644,5077.76,"Yes, that is his point and I'd say to you that --"
1967.68,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5077.76,5080.488,That depends on how bad the publicity was?
1967.68,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,5080.488,5102.127,"No, I don't say that, I say that even if the publicity was as bad as Rideau, if in Rideau you are able to show from the voir dire examination that no prejudice juror found his way into that jury box, you would not have reversed and that all of these decisions --"
1967.68,2,39656,richard_kanner,,5615.752,5637.605,"May it please the Court, in the short time remaining Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Fortas and to get over the jurisdictional problem what the third district did they said that it was a waiver of a Federal right and this Court's clear holding that waiver of Federal rights that is the question of publicity is a Federal question."
1967.68,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5638.188,5647.476,"So I just don't read it that way Mr. Kanner I read it there is nothing more than a determination, decisive like that of the Court of Appeals in Fay and Noia."
1967.68,2,39656,richard_kanner,,5677.859,5679.223,This is for this Court to decide.
1967.68,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5696.856,5698.24,[Inaudible]
1967.68,2,39656,richard_kanner,,5698.24,5705.365,Okay now Mr. Justice White without any type of hearing the trial Judge says in response to the state--
1967.68,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5705.365,5706.313,Res judicata.
1967.68,2,39656,richard_kanner,,5706.313,5707.278,Res judicata.
1967.68,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5707.278,5710.025,Then you came and said the following matters are not res judicata.

1967.68,2,39656,richard_kanner,,5762.799,5774.931,Mr. Justice my talking about ineffective assistance of counsel here is only to show that we were entitled we should have an evidentiary hearing.

1967.68,2,39656,richard_kanner,,5797.194,5798.099,I am not going to--
1967.68,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5798.099,5805.032,These are the same kind of errors that you list that the Court of Appeals lists as having been read.

1967.68,2,39656,richard_kanner,,5843.157,5854.704,"So in one last, one last comment, the voir dire is still certainly and effective means to determine the fairness of a trial and I don't ever concede that it isn't."
