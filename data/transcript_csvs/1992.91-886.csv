1992.91-886,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.434,"We'll hear argument first today in No. 91-886, Bob Reves v. Ernst & Young."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,11.184,14.089,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,185.085,194.191,Was this in cooperation with any particular officer of the company who was doing the same thing?
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,194.191,199.626,"Your Honor, in this case, the principal wrongdoer was already in jail when this happened."
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,210.606,230.004,"You see, I'd find it easier to say that they participated In the conduct of the company's business if they were acting jointly with one of the managers or directors, or at least an employee of the company who was conducting the company's business."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,240.25,249.169,"I would like to make it as easy as possible for Your Honor to agree with me, but the truth is that they basically did it... they did 95 percent of this themselves."
1992.91-886,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,273.252,280.561,But their friends stood to be harmed or to be hurt when the extent of their derelictions came out.
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,286.762,287.137,Correct.
1992.91-886,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,287.137,297.931,--for the accountant to do what it did even though it may not have been in a literal... jointly sense... literally jointly participating at the time it committed the acts that you complained of.
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,297.931,298.945,Correct.
1992.91-886,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,359.671,361.232,May I just ask on that question?
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,361.232,361.685,--Yes.
1992.91-886,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,361.685,369.838,"Do you take the position that whenever an auditing firm creates financial statements, that it has engaged in the pattern of racketeering activity?"
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,369.838,370.151,No.
1992.91-886,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,419.069,422.02,By creating the books.
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,423.005,427.785,"By creating the books, doing it fraudulently, and then auditing themselves, and not catching themselves."
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.785,431.955,"--Well, you say they can create the books so long as they don't then audit themselves."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,431.955,433.61,"Your Honor, I think it is--"
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.61,437.765,It's sort of retroactively taken out of RICO when somebody else later does an audit?
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,437.765,440.546,"--Your Honor, I'm not actually speaking of a legal principle here."
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.634,458.365,"Yes, but I don't think RICO was intended to codify general rules of accounting practice, was it?"
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,458.365,458.724,No.
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,458.724,459.943,I have no indication of that.
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,459.943,461.301,It plainly was not.
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.208,478.749,"I thought this provision here in particular was meant to prevent a company from becoming an evil mechanism, a company becoming a law-breaking company as an enterprise."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,490.665,505.019,"Well, in terms of whether outsiders are covered, a point which Arthur Young has conceded... so have all the amicus... the proceeding language in section 1962(c) talks about people employed by or associated with."
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.342,524.181,"Well, that's true, but they are working with someone who is a manager of the business or an employee of the business with authority to conduct the business' affairs."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,526.853,529.93,"Your Honor, in that case, I now have an answer to Your Honor's question."
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.877,548.329,"Well, misleading them isn't the same thing as making common cause with them."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,558.216,560.09,"That's true with bribery, but not with fraud."
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.711,569.602,"Well, that's unlawful."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,577.16,585.112,"Well, the... taking 1962 as a whole, all three sections refer to pattern of racketeering acts."
1992.91-886,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,602.87,616.785,"Well, Mr. Elden, in interpreting that language, would you think the night watchman might be covered or the elevator operator or anybody who committed a pattern of unlawful acts?"
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,616.785,617.394,No.
1992.91-886,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,657.253,667.484,"But it could be at any level of involvement, and you'd say that's involved in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs?"
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,667.484,673.075,"I would say not the very lowest level, but not necessarily confined to the highest level."
1992.91-886,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,681.353,691.412,"Well, we're dealing with some pretty fuzzy language here I suppose, and the courts are all over the lot in giving meaning to it."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,698.517,699.08,"Your Honor, I--"
1992.91-886,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,699.08,709.061,"--and where it is fuzzy, maybe we should err on the side of being careful before we extend liability?"
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,709.061,716.183,"--Your Honor, the rule of lenity is to some extent at tension with the statutory command to give liberal construction."
1992.91-886,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,735.049,741.36,"Well, I'm not sure how anyone would understand these words just reading them."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,741.36,759.073,"Your Honor, I think unlike the pattern of racketeering concept, which is a novel concept in RICO and which is very difficult to understand, these words all have been interpreted by courts in the same way dictionaries interpret them, in the same way laymen use them, and they're used in many other statutes."
1992.91-886,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.21,814.127,But doesn't the notion of participation require at some kind of minimum level an action with other members of the management?
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,848.191,867.293,"Your Honor, I agree with the first comment Your Honor made, that at a certain very low level of participation, I would agree it is not covered, and I think that that is not simply a preference or... I think that is... in the word ""participate"", as it has been used for half a century, but it is sufficient."
1992.91-886,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,874.338,885.271,"But you are also acting in concert with the people who have robbed the bank, and that analogy doesn't hold here because they're not acting in concert with the remaining members of the management."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,896.671,901.373,"--Your Honor, I think there's a distinction between conspiracy and participate in the conduct of the affairs."
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.271,932.86,"Mr. Elden, let me give you a hypothetical which I think will highlight what's troubling Justice Souter and me as well."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,959.538,960.006,I think... no.
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.129,968.159,"Well, why is that any different from what we have here?"
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,968.159,971.626,That person merely sells defective parts to the company.
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.594,973.219,Fraudulently.
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,973.219,974.703,Commits a fraud on the company.
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.703,975.265,Yes.
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,975.265,975.594,That's all--
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.594,988.761,"Just as the accountant firm pawned off on the company a fraudulently defective financial statement, this person pawns off on the company fraudulently defective parts."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,988.761,996.334,"--As I read the word ""conduct"", it requires some carrying on of the actual business of the company, not merely selling it to them."
1992.91-886,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,996.334,1002.504,"Well, I don't see that in either case you have an actual carrying on of the business."
1992.91-886,0,25243,gary_m_elden,,1002.504,1005.097,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-886,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1007.049,1010.017,"Very well, Mr. Elden."
1992.91-886,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1011.392,1013.578,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1992.91-886,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1013.578,1015.328,"We'll get to you in a minute, Ms. Oberly."
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1021.529,1024.48,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.42,1101.73,"To manage is one thing, but to act authoritatively on behalf of the company is something else, isn't it?"
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1115.084,1115.943,Well--
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1115.943,1123.596,"And there's nobody here who meets that qualification, who was participated with by the accountants."
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1123.596,1133.311,"--Well, first, Justice Scalia, the statute covers two different ways of engaging the enterprise in this pattern of racketeering activity."
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.2,1137.481,Right.
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1137.481,1141.386,"Second, it covers people who participate in the conduct of the affairs."
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1170.452,1173.045,What aspect of the affairs did they conduct?
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1173.045,1175.465,"--They conducted, in essence, the--"
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.465,1177.668,"Not participated in the conduct, but they conducted."
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1177.668,1178.355,--That's correct.
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.355,1178.699,Why?
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1178.699,1192.272,I'm focusing now on their creation of the financial statements of the company in which they made fundamental accounting decisions about the valuation of assets and then gave those to the company.
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.272,1198.191,That's not the company's affairs any more than my keeping a diary could seriously be considered my affairs.
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1203.954,1204.189,Well--
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.189,1206.359,--there are no... there's no business being conducted.
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1206.359,1212.997,"--Well, of course, in this case, the financial statements were integral to the money-raising functions that the co-op was carrying out, but--"
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.997,1213.247,Exactly.
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1220.213,1225.727,--It is the co-op's affairs to present its financial data.
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.389,1254.404,Just presenting it?
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1256.888,1257.402,"--Well, it's--"
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.402,1263.337,"--Raising money is part of its affairs, but I don't think developing and writing out a financial statement--"
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1263.337,1270.804,"--Well, I think that all companies which maintain accounting staffs and financial departments view it as part of their affairs."
1992.91-886,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1281.878,1285.391,--May I ask you a question on this second category that you described?
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1295.7,1296.122,Yes.
1992.91-886,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1297.747,1299.949,It does require some level of seniority in the company.
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1300.215,1300.621,No.
1992.91-886,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.335,1313.834,Give me an example.
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1320.018,1327.156,"Well, for example, we have a number of RICO cases that cover bribery of court officials to obtain official action."
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.764,1386.399,"Yes, but if you apply that analogy here, what happened here is exactly what happened in your court case; that is to say, the company itself was misled just as the court was misled."
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1386.399,1386.696,No.
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.922,1410.998,And that's different from presenting facts to the court fraudulently which the court then adopts.
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1410.998,1415.496,"--Well, if the court then adopts them, then you have a different kind of question I believe."
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.496,1416.136,"Oh, I see."
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1416.136,1416.73,But if you have--
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.73,1419.854,"If it's successful, it's covered by RICO."
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1420.619,1435.471,"--Well, if the court, for example, invited the parties to prepare findings of fact and they were done with the knowledge that they would be used as the basis for the court's submissions, and they were done fraudulently, this would be a different case."
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1552.753,1563.998,"Assume a construction company... is it your position that a worker, the lowest paid worker who digs ditches for this construction company... is he conducting the affairs of the company within the meaning of this statute?"
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1563.998,1566.278,"No, he's not conducting the affairs."
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1566.278,1566.575,He's not.
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1566.575,1567.247,He may very well be--
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1567.247,1570.48,"So, there is some direction element to it, some--"
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1570.48,1570.886,--He may very well--
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.886,1574.103,"--supervisory, some authoritative element somehow?"
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1574.103,1576.556,"--I don't think there's an authoritative element, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1605.701,1607.185,But that doesn't include ditch diggers--
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1607.185,1608.106,--I think it--
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.106,1609.356,--or secretaries.
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1609.356,1612.869,--I would not say as a matter of law that it excludes anybody--
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1612.869,1614.354,It does include ditch diggers.
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1614.354,1618.243,"--As a matter of law, the statute doesn't exclude them, no, but the statute--"
1992.91-886,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1618.243,1619.118,Which means it does include them.
1992.91-886,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1619.118,1620.961,"--Yes, it does, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-886,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.007,1624.381,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1627.536,1628.005,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-886,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.256,1727.043,"Does a lawyer... is the outside general counsel to a concern... is it... whether that's an enterprise or not is beside the point, but would the lawyer be considered to be participating in the conduct of the business when he gives advice as to whether this conduct is legal or not?"
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1727.043,1736.007,"--Not in my opinion, Your Honor, when he gives advice, which when he gives advice, the company, the enterprise, is free to accept it or reject it."
1992.91-886,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1739.662,1743.239,Is the inside general counsel in the same position?
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1743.239,1750.675,"--If he gives... if the inside general counsel... if he or she gives advice to management, again it's advice which management can accept or reject."
1992.91-886,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1765.76,1766.854,But it doesn't say conduct.

1992.91-886,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.271,1817.318,But not in the conduct of the affairs--
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1817.318,1817.771,--Not in the conduct.
1992.91-886,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.771,1818.692,--I don't see that.

1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1882.464,1885.087,Well--
1992.91-886,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.087,1892.023,And... or what if they... what if a certified audit is required by law?
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1892.023,1893.053,--It is.
1992.91-886,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1893.053,1897.551,And without it the business can't go forward.

I suppose you want to win this case on any ground that you want to win on, but you want to win it... you submit that you want the general rule that no accountant who does no more than jigger with a financial statement... no accountant is participating in the conduct of the business."

1992.91-886,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.927,2092.129,--That isn't what the question is either.
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2092.129,2092.442,--Precisely.
1992.91-886,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.237,2102.079,"Even if he acts, A, at the direction or at the request of."

1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2123.196,2123.79,--Pardon?
1992.91-886,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2123.79,2125.539,"You said ""or request"" a minute ago."
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2128.943,2132.051,A request that the auditor can't refuse basically is--

1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2367.129,2370.658,--I don't think they did it in the sense you're talking about.
1992.91-886,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.658,2370.861,I guess it isn't in the--

1992.91-886,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2629.382,2632.49,xxx strange to use for someone who is subject to direction.

1992.91-886,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2905.238,2908.346,"--And you take the position the in-house counsel would be liable, bribe or no."
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2908.346,2915.798,"Yes, because he either controls the legal affairs of the company."
1992.91-886,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2916.625,2917.0,No.
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2922.013,2930.682,But he controls the financial affairs of the company or he operates under the direction of the board of directors--
1992.91-886,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2930.682,2933.041,"Well, why does he do it any more than Arthur Young did?"
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2933.041,2933.524,--Pardon?
1992.91-886,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2933.524,2936.211,Why does he do it any more than the accountants did?
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2936.211,2942.926,The outside auditor has no authority to come in and tell the client what to do.
1992.91-886,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2967.261,2971.307,"Well, I suppose in the my hypothetical the directors could have rejected what the in-house accountant said."
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2971.307,2984.784,"--That's correct, and in that event they would have taken away from the in-house accountant the ability to make decisions in the financial sphere of the enterprise's affairs."
1992.91-886,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3229.966,3235.62,Don't you think that the provision of the statute requiring a liberal construction trumps the rule of lenity?
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,3235.62,3237.089,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-886,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3237.089,3237.994,"If it doesn't, what does it mean?"
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,3237.994,3260.064,"I think the Court addressed that in a footnote in Sedima where it said that you can harmonize strict and liberal construction in... even within the context of RICO by applying strict construction to sections 1961 and 1962, which are the statutes... the sections that have criminal applications, and liberal construction to section 1964, which is RICO's civil remedies provision."
1992.91-886,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.547,3271.309,You have different results that the same transaction can be a civil violation and not a criminal--
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,3271.309,3271.653,"--No, no."
1992.91-886,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3277.697,3277.916,--Right.
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,3277.916,3281.055,"Therefore, the rule of lenity is applicable."
1992.91-886,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3301.767,3308.077,"Ms. Oberly, what if Congress passed a strictly criminal statute and said it shall be liberally construed?"
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,3308.077,3321.163,"At some point, Your Honor, I think the Court runs into constitutional problems of vagueness and due process concerns because if you... if the Court is unable to--"
1992.91-886,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3321.163,3322.351,"Yes, but the rule of lenity--"
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,3322.351,3334.737,"--give the statute a construction that people can understand, the potential criminal defendants can understand, then I don't think liberal construction can be used to save a construction that defendants don't know how to conform their conduct to."
1992.91-886,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3334.737,3342.078,--But the rule of lenity has been thought to extend further than just a constitutional prohibition against vague criminal statutes.
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,3342.078,3371.362,"That's right, but in answer to Justice Scalia's question about how do you reconcile what Congress put in here about construing RICO liberally, reconcile it by... you can... you'll do that as far as you can, but at some point if you reach an ambiguity that's going to put criminal defendants in a position of not knowing what their conduct should be in order to escape criminal prosecution, then that rule of liberal construction is going to have to give way to giving criminal defendants clear and understandable notice of how to conform their conduct."
1992.91-886,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3371.362,3379.968,"No, but you don't... you wouldn't disagree with the proposition that Congress could say in a statute the rule of lenity shall not apply to this statute even though it's a criminal statute."
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,3379.968,3382.702,"No, I wouldn't disagree with that, but I would still think it's important."
1992.91-886,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3382.702,3387.996,The question then is whether the general comment on liberal construction is equivalent to that or is limited to the civil context.
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,3387.996,3389.856,I--
1992.91-886,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3389.856,3393.385,Limited to the provisions that are entirely civil in their application.
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,3393.385,3405.02,"--I think the sensible way to interpret is limited to civil, but even if you gave it the broader interpretation, then I think the Court has to still ask itself are we giving this statute a construction that potential criminal defendants can understand."
1992.91-886,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3414.751,3420.577,"Well, I assume we should apply the rule of lenity to this provision instructing us not to apply the rule of lenity."
1992.91-886,3,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,3426.808,3428.636,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-886,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3428.636,3430.057,"Thank you, Ms. Oberly."
1992.91-886,4,25243,gary_m_elden,,3432.931,3433.415,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-886,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3470.745,3472.009,So?
1992.91-886,4,25243,gary_m_elden,,3472.009,3480.177,"So, the question that Your Honor put... Ms. Oberly responded by going into what happened at the board meeting, all sorts of factual things."
1992.91-886,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3489.533,3492.049,"Well, why is that participating in the conduct of the business?"
1992.91-886,4,25243,gary_m_elden,,3492.049,3498.077,"It's not... it does not necessarily dispose of the entire case, Your Honor, but I thought it was responsive to Your Honor's question."
1992.91-886,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3498.733,3504.479,May I ask this one question just... was this motion for summary judgment granted before or after the jury trial?
1992.91-886,4,25243,gary_m_elden,,3504.479,3506.838,The... it was granted before.
1992.91-886,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3513.539,3517.694,"So, the record that we look at is the entire record or the record at the time of the original motion?"
1992.91-886,4,25243,gary_m_elden,,3517.694,3525.113,"Frankly, Your Honor, the records are essentially the same, but we have cited to the trial record for convenience all throughout the case, and we did it again in this brief."
1992.91-886,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3534.515,3535.296,Okay.
1992.91-886,4,25243,gary_m_elden,,3535.296,3539.716,I'd like to answer Justice Scalia's very first question.
1992.91-886,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3602.831,3607.345,"Well, that's fine when you're talking about securities fraud, but RICO doesn't just apply to securities fraud."
1992.91-886,4,25243,gary_m_elden,,3620.746,3634.802,"Your Honor, I'm focusing on the fact that Congress chose a word 1970 had such a well-settled meaning as striking a middle road."
1992.91-886,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3635.646,3636.818,"Thank you, Mr. Elden."
