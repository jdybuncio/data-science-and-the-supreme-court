1991.90-1014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.901,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-1014, Robert E. Lee v. Daniel Weisman."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,10.79,14.947,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1014,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,32.627,34.764,"How old were these youngsters, Mr. Cooper?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,34.764,35.782,"I beg your pardon, Justice--"
1991.90-1014,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,35.782,37.638,How old were these youngsters graduating?
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,37.638,43.932,"--Your Honor, the graduates themselves, were graduating from middle school and into high school."
1991.90-1014,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,45.777,48.229,"Well, how old were they is my question."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,49.165,51.681,"Your Honor, I think--"
1991.90-1014,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,51.681,52.897,"About 13 or 14, aren't they?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,52.897,53.603,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,53.603,54.679,Are we getting so--
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,54.679,59.991,"I'm sorry, I could not hear you."
1991.90-1014,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,59.991,62.065,"--Never mind, go ahead."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,62.065,81.745,"The district court and the court of appeals concluded that Rabbi Gutterman's invocation... and he gave a benediction which contained a similar reference to God... he opened the ceremony with the statement, God of the free, hope of the brave."
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,93.991,100.518,"Mr. Cooper, the injunction sought here... this plaintiff is now out of the middle school and in high school."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,100.518,101.146,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,101.146,105.345,"And what's sought to be enjoined is the invocation in high school, isn't that right?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,105.345,108.391,"Your Honor, the injunction runs to the public schools in Providence--"
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,108.391,109.72,To the public schools in general.
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,109.72,110.437,"--And it includes certain high schools, yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,110.437,112.314,"But the high school students, how old are they?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,113.749,117.418,"Your Honor, the graduates generally are in the 18-year-old range, yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,182.423,194.842,"Well, isn't one of the reasons that the people who are listening to the prayer are capable of exercising different degrees of judgment, and hence different degrees of assent or nonassent by their being there."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,197.135,198.153,"Yes, Your Honor it is."
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.035,224.814,"If the same prayer were offered at the opening and closing of classes in the public schools, would you be making the same argument?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,224.814,226.733,"--No, Your Honor, I would not."
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.733,228.188,And why not?
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,232.2,245.775,"Your Honor, to the contrary, we think that we would offer the following analytical framework for determining whether or not governmental expression of religious beliefs is coercive."
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.352,247.257,Now the very same prayer?
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,247.257,249.615,"--The very same prayer, yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,260.535,262.766,And why is it voluntary here?
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,262.766,268.044,"--Your Honor, it's, it's... it's voluntary here because the parties have stipulated to that fact."
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.15,282.259,Children are perfectly free to attend their commencement or not.
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,283.885,288.303,"--Your Honor, that is the case by stipulation in this case before you."
1991.90-1014,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,288.303,297.158,Has there been a stipulation that there's no stigma to the student who absents him or herself from the graduation during the prayer?
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,297.158,299.721,"No, Your Honor, there is no such--"
1991.90-1014,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,299.721,321.741,"I find it very difficult to accept the proposition that it is not a substantial imposition on a young graduate to say you have your choice of... I want to characterize it in a neutral way... hearing this prayer, or absenting yourself from the graduation."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,339.878,345.513,"--Your Honor, I think that one... I think that one can make out a very serious argument to just that effect."
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,346.795,348.343,"Maybe that line doesn't work, then."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,348.343,349.138,--I beg your pardon?
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.138,353.744,"Maybe that line doesn't work, that it's only okay if you don't have to listen to it."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,360.053,360.681,That's true.
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.681,361.212,Right?
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,361.212,361.836,That is true.
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.836,366.036,I don't think we let them walk in after that is said in the Court.
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,367.006,377.953,"Well, Your Honor, yes, if... if it is... if it is that the Government's religious expression is forced upon the individual, then you must assess the nature and the setting of that expression, and--"
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.953,380.187,"Well counsel have to be here, but they don't have to agree to it, do they?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,380.187,381.22,--That's... that is the point.
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,392.026,399.477,"Well, if you take that line, I just don't see how you can draw the distinction, then, about the same prayer given in the classroom."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,399.477,400.148,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.148,401.68,"You don't have to listen, right?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,403.552,409.238,"--No, to the contrary, Your Honor, I think the classroom setting is much distinguishable."
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.238,414.861,Were... were the children at this commencement exercise all seated together?
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,414.861,418.172,"Your Honor, the record does not reflect that fact."
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.342,419.766,And you don't know.
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,424.793,428.856,"Ah, there's... there's no indication that that was the case."
1991.90-1014,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,428.856,435.306,"Counsel, if the point is that they don't have to listen or don't have to participate, why can't you use a sectarian prayer?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,435.306,443.678,"Your Honor, I don't think that a sectarian prayer would, per se, be coercive."
1991.90-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,455.174,458.984,But simply making the prayer sectarian--
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,464.467,466.826,"--I don't believe that it would, necessarily, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,466.826,471.572,"The imposition would require the same result if they, say they had Mass, if they prayed."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,471.572,475.807,"Your Honor, that, I think would be an extreme example... one that would--"
1991.90-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,475.807,476.946,Or say Our Father 13 times.
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,476.946,488.566,"--Your Honor, again, that might well be the kind of extreme example that Justice Kennedy referenced in Allegheny County... exhortations of religiosity that amounts to proselytization."
1991.90-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,492.859,494.797,"Well, would one be any more coercive than the other?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,494.797,496.201,I beg your pardon?
1991.90-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,496.201,500.795,"Would one be any more coercive than the other, under your view of what coercion means?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,500.795,512.462,"I think that one can imagine and can hypothesize extreme examples... examples that would, indeed, cross the threshould from religious expression to coercion."
1991.90-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.369,515.493,How could you coerce the audience?
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,521.053,535.625,"--Well, Your Honor, the statement from the podium may be accompanied by various exhortations such as Justice Kennedy has referenced, to actually participate through visible means of assent."
1991.90-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,535.625,539.185,"Nothing more than please stand, nothing more than please stand... which I assume happens in all graduations."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,539.185,544.512,"That may well be true, and I don't think please stand would probably rise to the level."
1991.90-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,544.512,549.902,"But then... but then a very sectarian series of prayers, if the student need not listen to them?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,552.101,561.912,"Your Honor, I am not making the argument... and I do not make the... the argument that merely adding sectarian references to the prayer is going to make it more coercive."
1991.90-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.923,571.625,The Government--
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,571.625,572.311,--in that case--
1991.90-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,572.311,573.282,--is endorsing a particular position.
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,573.282,574.733,"--Not necessarily endorsing, no."
1991.90-1014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.417,586.9,"I just simply don't follow you, why one is more coercive than the other."
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.9,590.071,"I don't either, Mr. Cooper."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,614.014,615.355,"Your Honor, I don't think we--"
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.355,618.182,And it's no more coercive than saying God.
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,618.182,626.009,"--I don't think we would put that on the coins, but I think that is because, at this stage, that would not be politically possible, because--"
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,626.009,630.022,"If that's the only... but if we could get the votes for it, we could do it under the Constitution?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,630.696,635.629,"--Your Honor, in 1983 the Congress passed a joint resolution that declared the Year of the Bible."
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,652.28,666.727,"Would it do so if a State legislature were to adopt a particular religion as the State religion, just like they might pass a resolution saying the bolo tie is the State necktie?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,675.863,677.813,If it is purely coercive--
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,677.813,680.204,Not coercive.
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,680.204,690.155,"--If it is purely noncoercive, then I have a difficult time distinguishing that from the proclamation that I've just cited, the Year of the Bible."
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,690.155,691.825,"So in your view, that would be perfectly okay."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,691.825,705.758,"Your Honor, I think that in light of the rule of law that we believe, the founding fathers established in the Establishment Clause, some finding of Government coercion of religious sentiment is necessary to make out a violation."
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,707.649,712.769,"Well, that certainly hasn't been our case holdings over a substantial period of time."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,718.969,720.142,--We are quite frank--
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,720.142,721.047,Yes.
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,721.047,728.062,--in our request that you re-examine at least Lemon's applicability to the context of Government expression in symbology.
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.357,733.681,"But one can abandon Lemon without going as far as you're asserting, Mr. Cooper."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,751.456,754.91,"--Well, Your Honor, the creche is sectarian, the menorah is sectarian."
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.109,757.956,"Oh, yes--"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,780.086,781.353,"--Oh, no, by no means, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.83,793.333,"Oh, I see."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,800.141,807.667,--I don't think that those holdings depart from the rule of law ordained by the founding fathers.
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.489,850.963,"You think our historical tradition establishes just as clearly that the State cannot favor religion over irreligion, as it establishes that the State cannot favor one religious sect over another religious sect?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,850.963,852.09,I don't think that the--
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.09,855.447,You don't see any difference between them... in our constitutional tradition?
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,855.447,858.992,--I do not see any difference with respect to coercion.
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.02,869.642,I'm talking apart from the coercion context.
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,880.043,893.195,"Your Honor, I certainly don't quarrel with the proposition that by and large our Government expression of religious values and sentiments has been nonsectarian."
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,945.628,948.218,"Mr. Cooper, it sounds very much--"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,962.494,978.255,"Your Honor, I do believe that the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise clause were, ah, were framed by the founding fathers to accomplish religious freedom generally, both to prevent the Government from--"
1991.90-1014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,978.255,982.782,"Well, is the test the same under either clause for a particular challenge?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,985.169,990.246,"--Your Honor, I do believe that both require the finding of some coercive pressure on the individual--"
1991.90-1014,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,990.246,995.183,"Well, could you have coercion from an establishment standpoint but not a free exercise standpoint?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,995.183,997.039,"--Could you, Your Honor?"
1991.90-1014,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,997.039,1002.288,"Yes, in other words, if you find coercion in one, do you necessarily find coercion in the other?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1013.174,1018.829,"Your Honor, I cannot think of an instance where that might not be the case."
1991.90-1014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1067.183,1076.679,"Of course, if you said that the Establishment Clause requires both noncoercion and nonsectarianism, then it wouldn't have a content different from the free exercise clause, would it?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1076.679,1081.179,"--Your Honor, I believe that is an accurate statement."
1991.90-1014,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1099.482,1100.371,"Mr. Cooper, let me ask you a question."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1123.27,1128.986,"--Your Honor, I... I believe that you're right, yes."
1991.90-1014,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1128.986,1129.657,You believe so?
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1129.657,1132.11,I will not argue with that.
1991.90-1014,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1151.619,1167.236,"When you say sectarian, you mean that the entire prayer has got to be lifted or taken verbatim from some traditional, sectarian liturgy or traditional expression of prayer?"
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1191.273,1195.052,"Your Honor, it might well qualify as sectarian."
1991.90-1014,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1207.83,1210.189,But how about using half a prayer or a third of a prayer?
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1225.433,1234.601,"Your Honor, I don't see how anyone could compose a prayer that did not include phrases that had been used by different sects."
1991.90-1014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1245.142,1246.611,"Thank you, Mr. Cooper."
1991.90-1014,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1246.611,1247.282,Thank you.
1991.90-1014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1247.282,1248.954,"General Starr, we'll hear now from you."
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1248.954,1255.104,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.023,1303.54,It's sectarian--
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1303.54,1304.757,Of course not.
1991.90-1014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.757,1308.083,"--General Starr, to use the word God instead of Allah?"
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1308.083,1310.396,"Absolutely not, not in our traditions."
1991.90-1014,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1367.905,1372.431,"You're not urging that we reexamine Engel v. Vitale, are you, the Supreme Court case?"
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1372.431,1380.398,"--We are not, because of concerns about coercion that are, in fact, at the heart of religious liberty."
1991.90-1014,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1388.299,1398.859,"Well, how... how is it... how does the analysis fit in the situation where the child is excused from participating in the classroom prayer?"
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1411.602,1412.506,"--They do, indeed."
1991.90-1014,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.182,1458.177,"Would this particular prayer, if given at the opening of a classroom in school, in your judgment be constitutional or unconstitutional?"
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1458.177,1460.553,"--If it is being given, Justice Stevens--"
1991.90-1014,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1460.553,1464.066,In the classroom and compelled by... by the teacher and--
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1464.066,1466.3,"--If it's compelled by... oh, I think that's unconstitutional."
1991.90-1014,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.3,1467.346,--That would definitely not pass your test.
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1467.346,1471.639,"Yes, because I believe coercion is very much at work in the classroom setting."
1991.90-1014,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.355,1486.134,"So the distinction between this case and that case is simply that the attendance at the graduation is voluntary, whereas attendance at class is not?"
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1486.134,1487.696,"--No, Justice Stevens."
1991.90-1014,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1503.251,1505.986,Suppose attendance were required at the graduation ceremony?
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1505.986,1508.188,--I think the case becomes more difficult.
1991.90-1014,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1539.314,1541.097,Suppose the whole class was asked to rise.
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1553.404,1554.371,We looked--
1991.90-1014,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1554.371,1555.997,--and this is a mandatory attendance.
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1560.981,1563.196,"--Well, they may choose to stand."
1991.90-1014,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1563.726,1565.134,Cross their fingers?
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1565.134,1573.663,"--the point is, we listened... Justice Kennedy, we hear a lot of things in a free society, with robust and uninhibited debate, with which we fervently disagree."
1991.90-1014,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1584.796,1585.142,Except the prayer is not--
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1585.142,1586.016,I beg your pardon?
1991.90-1014,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1586.016,1590.325,"--General, a prayer is not one element in a dialogue between people."
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1597.714,1604.695,"No, the point is that the act itself is an act of acknowledgement of our traditions as a people."
1991.90-1014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.738,1615.754,"You had to be here and you had to stand up, didn't you?"
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1615.754,1618.238,I felt it necessary to stand up.
1991.90-1014,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1665.468,1665.842,"General, if--"
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1665.842,1666.482,Discrimination--
1991.90-1014,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1666.482,1667.652,"--I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you."
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1667.652,1672.37,--I was just going to say discrimination among sects... are saying we favor this particular sect.
1991.90-1014,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1682.537,1694.234,"If we accept the kind of the concept of tradition as a source of a criterion, don't we really have not an easy answer here, as I think you're suggesting, but a difficult one?"
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1734.077,1739.558,I don't think that the Engel tradition is implicated outside the classroom.
1991.90-1014,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1755.115,1760.378,Isn't the analogy a lot closer there than it is to a presidential inauguration?
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1760.378,1761.533,It is certainly closer.
1991.90-1014,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1774.39,1776.371,Have you ever been to a graduation where the parents sit with the children?
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1776.371,1777.311,--I beg your pardon?
1991.90-1014,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.311,1780.355,Have you ever been to a graduation where the parents sit with the children?
1991.90-1014,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1780.355,1784.056,"No, the presence of the parents is not a talisman."
1991.90-1014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.555,1822.337,"Thank you, General Starr."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,1825.881,1830.331,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1014,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1866.348,1886.621,"Well, what about the courtroom prayer that we've heard argued and referred to this morning... ah, if you want to call it a prayer... at least the opening of court, in which the reference is made to the deity, and where people are expected to be here and to stand up and listen to it."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,1888.403,1891.761,"--Your Honor, I would suggest that there are two distinctions there."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.197,1929.305,You don't think invocations at graduations are a rote sort of thing?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,1936.071,1938.005,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1940.785,1941.363,They can or they can't?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,1942.786,1947.08,--It does not mean... it does not mean that students cannot be brought in to watch the Court sessions--
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.08,1954.406,"As required class, I mean you have to come to class and we're going to put you on a bus and you come to hear the Court session, or you come to watch a Presidential inauguration."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,1956.184,1961.714,"--I think that it is... yes, I think that the public school can bring their students--"
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1961.714,1963.932,"Right, even though the word God would be invoked?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,1963.932,1969.01,"--Yes, Your Honor, but I do not think that prayers at graduation are by any means rote."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.249,2003.338,"It may not be the history for the past few decades, but I'll bet there was before... before there came to be any doubt about whether such invocations could be given or not."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2003.338,2021.108,"Well, Your Honor, I... I think that public school education, as this Court has already recognized, doesn't fall into the Marsh kind of analysis to begin with, because the facts relating to the history of public education are different than the facts relating to legislative prayer."
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2021.108,2041.417,"Suppose that at this graduation the rabbi was present and he stood up before the main commencement speaker and said, I've been asked by the principal, on behalf of all the clergy here in... in Providence to congratulate you and to welcome you."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2055.219,2057.408,"I think so, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2057.408,2058.597,They're not asked to stand.
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2058.597,2073.607,"What you still have in that case, is part of the facts of this case, which is that the public school officials have chosen a particular clergy to come in, knowing that that clergy is going to give a message promoting religion."
1991.90-1014,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2087.473,2104.967,"But does that mean that the school can't invite a commencement speaker like Martin Luther King, who might make all kinds of references to the religious experience and the need to rely upon God's help in creating a just society?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2108.009,2109.635,"No, Your Honor, absolutely--"
1991.90-1014,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2109.635,2119.083,"To knowingly invite someone to be the commencement speaker, knowing that it's very likely that the person invited will speak in that fashion."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2119.083,2128.894,--I think that it is not prohibited for the school to invite anyone that it chooses to be a commencement speaker.
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2144.434,2155.618,Would your answers to these questions that Justice O'Connor and I are asking be the same if this Court or any of its justices were to use the dissent in Allegheny as the analytical framework--
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2155.618,2158.757,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2158.757,2164.084,"--i.e., are you answering based on the Lemon test or an... or an endorsement sort of a test?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2164.084,2173.157,"--I think, Your Honor, under any test that the Court has adopted, that this practice violates the Establishment Clause."
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2182.934,2184.809,What about under the coercion test of the Allegheny dissent?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2184.809,2194.134,"--Under the coercion test that the... that was set forth in the Allegheny dissent, I think yes, Your Honor there is definitely coercion here."
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2196.867,2197.647,"Well, what is the coercion?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2197.647,2220.685,"--There is no difference, Your Honor, between voluntary prayer in the classroom, between the fact situations of Abington, the fact situations of Karen B., where children were not required to be present in the first place, they could opt into the prayer session; from the situation in Engel where children were allowed to be excused, and there is in this situation."
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2220.685,2222.697,"Is there, then, a free exercise violation, in your view?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2222.697,2225.524,In this situation?
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2225.524,2225.93,Yes.
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2225.93,2227.385,"Yes, I think there is both."
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2230.024,2231.241,Did you argue that there was a free exercise violation?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2231.241,2231.771,--Pardon?
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2231.771,2234.209,Have you argued in your briefs that there's a free exercise violation?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2234.209,2240.974,"No, Your Honor, but in this particular case, Deborah Weisman was 14 years old when this graduation occurred."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2270.194,2279.112,"Ms. Blanding, suppose in addition to drawing the line between coercion and noncoercion, we drew a line between instruction and noninstruction?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2309.977,2316.052,"--I don't think, Your Honor, that this is a situation where people are voluntarily seeking to invoke God."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.548,2328.906,"Well, you... we have invocations like that at all sorts of events, not just high school graduations."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2346.85,2354.646,"--I think it is different, Your Honor, for the same reasons that this Court has always accorded a different level of scrutiny to public school situations."
1991.90-1014,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2369.889,2371.418,Is this apparent from the record?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2371.418,2373.23,"It is not, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.089,2380.807,Is that contained in the agreed statement of facts?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2380.807,2381.353,"--It is not, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2394.643,2397.985,"Well, I... that may be a reason to object to a particular argument made here."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2402.064,2402.75,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.75,2416.573,Does the record tell us how often prayers such as this have been said in graduation ceremonies during the history of the country?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2416.573,2418.087,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2418.695,2420.118,It just tells us about this particular graduation?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2420.118,2427.489,--The record goes beyond this particular graduation and deals with all of the middle schools and high schools in the City of Providence.
1991.90-1014,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.218,2439.655,I understand that.
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2444.264,2444.857,"--It does not, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2444.857,2445.797,--of any kind?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2445.797,2446.562,"It does not, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.562,2449.279,"So we don't really know if there have ever been such things before, do we?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2449.279,2450.293,"That's true, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2569.571,2579.023,"Of course, of course, on that line of reasoning, I assume that the inaugural prayer and the prayer in Marsh v. Alabama are also inappropriate."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2581.663,2585.582,"--I am not asking the Court to reconsider those decisions, Your Honor--"
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2585.582,2586.955,But the logic of your argument applies equally to those.
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2597.141,2608.103,"--I would suggest, Your Honor, that taking Marsh, as an example, that the facts in Marsh are radically different from the facts of a graduation ceremony in a public school."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2627.174,2629.471,So there's less coercion.
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2634.155,2635.593,"Well, Your Honor--"
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2635.593,2646.025,"And if that's the... I don't understand your basis for saying schools are an entirely different area, unless somehow it's a coercion basis, or an instruction basis, is it?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2667.846,2673.969,"--I am not suggesting, Your Honor, that the Court adopt a different test than it has used over the last several decades."
1991.90-1014,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2716.325,2741.629,"Well, is that a product of the manner in which the graduation is held, and the freedom to come and go... or lack of freedom to come and go... or is it because of the sophistication of the children or the adolescents, so that the effect of them is going to be different from the effect on legislators who may be standing here, or anyone in this courtroom who may be standing here and hearing God save the United States?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2741.629,2745.251,"It is a combination, Your Honor, of all of those factors."
1991.90-1014,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2792.716,2797.119,"What about graduation from State universities, under your analysis."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2823.031,2826.247,"I think, Your Honor, that may be a closer case."
1991.90-1014,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2845.726,2849.114,"Then it is an endorsement test, not a-coercion test that you're resting on."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2849.114,2859.624,"Yes, Your Honor... I am resting on the traditional Court... the traditional test that this Court has always applied in school cases, in combination with the endorsement test."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.257,2916.459,"On college seniors... I mean, that was the last hypothetical."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2924.629,2935.169,"I think that a coercion test applied to college seniors would be a closer case, and would need to... would need to depend more on the facts."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2936.327,2949.945,"The problem is, if you don't use a coercion test, if you use an endorsement test, which you seem to be falling back on when you're presented with the college example, then there's no basis for distinguishing schools from courtrooms, from... from halls of Congress."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2949.945,2956.067,"--There is, Your Honor, because part of the endorsement test depends on the perception of the audience."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.013,2972.078,"College, colleges, we're talking about."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2972.078,2975.182,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, in a college graduation."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2975.182,2988.429,"I think you have to say that that's good, unless you're using a coercion test rather than an endorsement test."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,2988.429,3014.088,"I think the message to college seniors, Your Honor, would still remain under the endorsement test, that the school officials that are... that are putting on and organizing the graduation, if they are choosing a clergyman, as happened in this case, if they are suggesting to the clergyman... as happened in this case also... the school officials told the clergyman what kind of prayer he could say."
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3017.947,3019.383,What about he coercion test... what about the coercion test?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3022.069,3022.834,Yes.
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3022.834,3024.974,Is your answer the same with reference to coercion?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3024.974,3030.551,"I think that the question, with regard to college seniors, Your Honor, is closer on the coercion test."
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.405,3052.992,"Well, counsel, don't you think that... you ought to urge the Court not to depart from the established precedent of Lemon?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3052.992,3054.852,"Yes, Your Honor, I am urging the Court--"
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3054.852,3058.911,You sound like you really don't care whether we depart from it or not.
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3058.911,3060.412,"--No, that's not true, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.848,3070.502,"Do you think making the decision turn on coercion would be, in effect, overruling the line of cases?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3070.502,3073.219,"--Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.586,3136.414,"Do you agree that this is a... under the Lemon test, this case turns on effects?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3136.414,3148.877,"I think, Your Honor, that both under the purpose prong of the Lemon test and under the effect prong of the Lemon test, that this practice must fall under the Establishment Clause."
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3148.877,3150.94,"Well, the court below turned it on effects."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3150.94,3152.5,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.5,3154.142,The court below turned it on effects.
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3154.142,3158.045,"Yes, the court below addressed the effects argument, and did not address the purpose argument."
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.045,3164.666,"Well, tell me how do you think that the primary effect of what went on at this ceremony is to advance religion?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3169.182,3170.118,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.118,3176.443,So there must be... there might be an effect advancing religion that isn't a primary effect.
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3176.443,3188.016,"I think, Your Honor, that if the Court looks at the effect test in concert with the overtones of endorsement, the message that the school committee--"
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.016,3189.736,Overtones of endorsement?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3189.736,3200.074,"--Yes, Your Honor... I think if the Court looks at the effect test as it has been interpreted in recent cases, in concert with the endorsement test, and understanding--"
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.074,3201.138,Where did the endorsement test come from?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3202.963,3204.355,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.355,3206.976,Is it or not?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3206.976,3207.525,--The way that I am--
1991.90-1014,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3207.525,3208.086,Is it or not?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3208.086,3217.582,"--Well, I understand... the way I understand it, Your Honor, it is that the Court views the endorsement test as part of the effects prong of the Lemon test."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3245.744,3265.266,"Ms. Blanding, do you subscribe to that version of the Lemon test which says that the primary purpose and effect must not be to advance religion, or to the other version that says that a primary purpose or effect must not be to advance... because we've used both, depending on whether we want to uphold or not to uphold."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3270.718,3280.416,"Your Honor, under either analysis, I think that the primary purpose and effect in this case, of the school department's practice, is to advance religion."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3393.295,3396.009,Why doesn't a Thanksgiving proclamation do that?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3397.26,3411.349,"A Thanksgiving... I think under its facts, Your Honor, a Thanksgiving proclamation is much different than a prayer which is delivered to a specific audience of children in a school setting which is as controlled as this one."
1991.90-1014,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3422.123,3436.665,"But if you're talking about making people... you know, if that's the test, whether people are made to feel like outsiders, if you're going to use an endorsement test, is there anything that's more of an endorsement than a Thanksgiving proclamation... which virtually every President has issued?"
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3436.665,3453.331,"Your Honor, I think that, again, there are some Marsh elements, or in some sense the Thanksgiving proclamation is more like Marsh and has some more of the elements of Marsh than this particular case does."
1991.90-1014,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3453.331,3456.72,I don't see what a controlled classroom environment has to do with endorsement.
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3461.204,3475.399,"I think that in terms of the message that is being given to the audience, the primary audience, the whole set of facts around a graduation ceremony are relevant to the endorsement inquiry."
1991.90-1014,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3475.399,3484.852,Isn't that also a substantial part of the answer to the... to Justice Scalia's question about the Thanksgiving proclamation?
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3486.1,3487.176,The audience--
1991.90-1014,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3487.176,3489.191,"--who's receiving it, and the audience is different."
1991.90-1014,2,41055,sandra_a_blanding,,3491.425,3492.314,"--I do, Your Honor."
1991.90-1014,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3506.529,3509.072,"Thank you, Ms. Blanding."
