1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,22.919,"We'll hear arguments next in 70-250, Carleson against Remillard."
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,27.535,31.295,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-250,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,80.147,86.518,"Is the entire group excluded or just the case by case, child by child?"
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,86.518,89.435,"The entire group of military orphans, Your Honor?"
1971.70-250,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,89.435,89.925,Yes.
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,89.925,90.905,Servicemen children?
1971.70-250,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,119.43,130.234,"This is true regardless of whether or not the father was drafted or volunteered, and regardless to the nature of his service and regardless to his rank or grade."
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,130.234,131.798,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,131.798,132.031,Now.
1971.70-250,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,134.201,142.337,And regardless of whether he is sending any part of his income home and regardless of whether he is a Prisoner of War?
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,142.337,158.91,"The assumption, Your Honor, is that the child is needy where he maybe sending some money home, but it's inadequate in terms of the need standards under California law."
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,158.91,183.569,"But would it be difficult, would it be impossible or very difficult for California to determine how much of an allotment of a drafted man in confinement to that, a drafted man in the service, how much he is sending home on the allotment and then at least gives the benefits to the extent of the difference."
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,187.511,189.763,Is Your Honor's question the administrative burden?
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,189.763,190.96,Yes.
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,190.96,192.544,I am not certain that I can answer it.
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,201.611,209.741,"Well, not if he is a lower class that is in the first few grades, there is a fixed allotment sent home?"
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,209.741,233.365,"There is, but then the question is that the state would have to ascertain on a month-by-month basis that in fact that amount did get there, so that I believe the answer to Your Honor's question in terms of the administrative effort is that it would have to be an ongoing month-to-month determination or verification of the precise amount that did actually end up in the hands of the family."
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,233.365,249.726,"Well, Mr. Linderman, I gather that under the California practice, where the absence is due to imprisonment or medical treatment or parental separation, that inquiry is made on an individual basis, isn't it?"
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,249.726,251.655,That's correct.
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,251.655,259.689,Well then what's the distinction between those classifications and this across the board as applied to children of fathers absent on military orders?
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,259.689,270.524,"The distinction I believe, Your Honor, is that California concedes in the instances that you have mentioned that the federal law requires the granting of assistance."
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,290.603,299.193,"And yet the guideline, all of these are embraced in the same guideline, aren't they, that's that 34222?"
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,299.193,300.754,That's the HEW.
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,300.754,301.466,That's what I mean.
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,301.466,301.741,Yes.
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,301.741,321.514,"And that one, within this interpretation of continued absence, the state agency in developing its policy will find it necessary to give consideration to such situations as divorce, pending divorce, desertion all the way down the line, service to the armed forces or other military service and makes no distinctions of a kind that California draws, does it?"
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,321.514,338.535,"No, HEW merely requires as the regulation says that the state will find it necessary to give consideration to these groups in the process of the stage to finding its own eligibility policy."
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,341.333,349.097,"Of course, but find it necessary to give consideration, may it distinguish in the way it gives consideration under that regulation?"
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,349.097,355.356,"Distinguish, in the sense, yes that you can find one group eligible and another group ineligible."
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,355.356,357.995,"Yes, but the sounds what problem is."
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,366.09,367.102,"No that's not correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,367.102,369.217,It's not!
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,369.217,374.353,"In the categories of, say, desertion or imprisonment --"
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,374.353,374.926,Yes.
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,374.926,382.674,"-- as a group, the children are eligible provided that they then meet the need standard as well."
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,407.612,424.778,"Does that suggest Mr. Linderman that the Court of Appeals is wrong because I am reading in cases of a father's absence due to imprisonment or temporary medical treatment or parental separation, California considers each applicant's situation individually."
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,424.778,426.707,"Yes Your Honor, we submit that --"
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,426.707,427.083,That's wrong.
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,427.083,428.003,-- the court is wrong.
1971.70-250,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,428.003,429.015,I see.
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,429.015,437.409,"And as specifically so said in our brief, we do challenge that, that that is a misstatement of what California does do."
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,787.792,790.542,"Well, let me ask you on that score."
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,813.611,818.589,"Unless that particular father -- I am assuming full employment in terms of number of hours, he is fully employed."
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.589,839.296,"Yes, but he is blind or whatever, some disabilities of it -- and let's not make it blind because then he would be getting some income under Social Security, but he has got some handicapped, maybe just basic intelligence, but he works at his full capacity and makes this nominal amount."
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,839.296,841.287,And is living in the home --
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,841.287,845.908,He is trying to win the bread for the family.
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,845.908,849.12,I do not believe that that family would be eligible.
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,849.12,853.005,Under the Federal statute or the regulations of California?
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,853.005,864.062,Under the Federal statute because he is an employed breadwinner living in the home.
1971.70-250,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,864.062,869.08,Unless it could be shown that he was physically or mentally incapacitated?
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,869.08,871.312,Incapacitated.
1971.70-250,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,879.206,882.606,It's continued absence from the home or physical or mental incapacity?
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,882.606,890.17,"I am not -- to be utterly honest, I am not completely clear whether in that instance, there would be eligibility or not."
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,891.985,902.259,"Well, assuming for the moment that there would be eligibility and this $118 a month does not bar an eligibility."
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,939.93,949.024,"I suppose conceive -- I am assuming now that you are talking not in terms that California makes decision on its own, but that --"
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,949.024,954.729,"No, I am just saying, is there arguably an equal protection problem there?"
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,954.729,974.81,"I suppose that it's conceivable that there is, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the equal protection question that the appellees in this case purport to raise is a completely different type of situation from the one that Your Honor is hypothesizing."
1971.70-250,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1034.943,1038.547,"Really not the unemployed breadwinner either, was it?"
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,1045.377,1068.434,"That's correct, but it subsequently has been expanded to include the unemployed, AFDC has now been expanded to include the unemployed father in the home, but not the underemployed."
1971.70-250,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1150.966,1157.415,But suppose he were amending there a loophole or a little --
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,1157.415,1180.043,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, then I think we're not talking about the income generating capacity or the sociological impact in terms of the intrafamilial strains that imprisonment would cause."
1971.70-250,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1195.022,1196.537,Or whether he is away from home?
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,1196.537,1205.007,"Or whether he is away from home, the child is not needy there which is the second facet of eligibility which is not present in this case."
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1284.489,1298.55,"Well, now does the legislative history of the act of Congress make these distinctions you're talking about or are these just advanced as your considerations?"
1971.70-250,0,31407,jay_s_linderman,,1298.55,1323.653,We view the legislative history of the Act as supporting these contentions and furthermore this Court's tracing and delimiting of the Act's scope in King versus Smith as erecting these kind of limits around the program.
1971.70-250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1587.577,1591.109,You may reserve that.
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1595.061,1598.07,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1638.646,1641.606,"May I stop to there, Miss Massey."
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1650.368,1652.012,Our argument is that it does not.
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1652.012,1654.496,No.
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1662.004,1666.381,"Your Honor, I think the District Court opinion is somewhat ambiguous on that subject."
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1684.338,1696.456,"There isn't any doubt I gather that at least the regulations suggest that states do have discretion in the definition of continued absence from home, is that so?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1696.456,1697.576,That is correct.
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1697.576,1698.44,Yes.
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1698.44,1706.92,"However, in light of the Townsend case which expressly disapproved HEW's, what is it known as a condition 'X' --"
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1706.92,1708.082,Yes.
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1708.082,1711.675,-- I think that is no longer a proper interpretation --
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1711.675,1714.345,"Is 3422.2, is that condition 'X'?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1714.345,1714.837,Pardon me.
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1714.837,1722.529,"Is that -- is the one that deals here with the interpretations, HEW regulation, the one I was talking, is that condition 'X'?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1722.529,1723.368,I think it is Your Honor.
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1723.368,1723.534,Oh!
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1726.136,1727.843,This one I couldn't hear.
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1727.843,1737.091,I believe that it is a part of the condition 'X' which was expressly disapproved by this Court in Townsend v. Swank.
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1897.279,1901.587,But he had been over there as our ambassador to South Vietnam?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1901.587,1904.401,And that his family had been free to join him?
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1904.401,1906.61,No.
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1906.61,1925.97,"Alright, if Mr. Remillard had been the ambassador and if his family were not free to join him and if by some chance that family were also needy that is according to this California definition, unable to provide the basic necessities of life, then I would say, yes, that family would be eligible for AFDC benefits."
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1932.871,1940.205,"Well now that I have interrupted you, is there anything in the -- nowadays in the military service that requires a serviceman to make an allotment to dependents?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1940.205,1964.377,"For grades E1, E2, E3, and E4, the regulations provide that a serviceman may initiate the basic allotment which consists of the basic allowance for quarters which is called to BAQ and which is a separate from the serviceman's pay and which also includes $40 per month which is taken out of the serviceman's pay."
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1966.349,1968.095,"You say, he may do that, is that it?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1968.095,1981.196,"Well, the regulations provide that he may, but they further provide that if he does not and if the wife objects that certain procedures will be followed to ensure that she does receive her allotment."
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1981.196,1983.631,From his pay or from some other?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,1983.631,1997.141,"From the same sources, the $105 for grades E1, E2, and E3, slightly more for grade E4, which comes from outside his pay and $40 which comes from in his pay."
1971.70-250,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2014.873,2023.761,"In every case when the parent is absent, the constant factor is that demonstration of need, is it not?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2023.761,2025.189,Yes.
1971.70-250,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2025.189,2035.038,"So that no benefits could be paid if the man were employed at the substantial income, no matter how long he was absent?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2035.038,2045.976,"And if that money were actually coming into that child, that is correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2131.953,2132.627,Are?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2132.627,2134.003,"Are, yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2142.861,2146.797,But they have also made them to the state's matching that don't pay those benefits?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2146.797,2147.991,"That's correct, Your Honor, I think."
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2158.872,2161.357,And about half of the states deny them?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2161.357,2162.28,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2169.101,2174.607,"So if we affirm here those states that are now -- not doing it, will have to, won't they?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2174.607,2175.735,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2200.477,2205.602,You mean the needy children of really patriotic soldiers don't get it?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2205.602,2211.373,[Attempt to Laughter] That's right.
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2211.373,2227.01,"During World War II, when there were literally millions of men, many of whom were fathers in the armed services, was the division among the states about the same as it is now?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2227.01,2229.32,"I do not know the answer to that question, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2229.32,2232.372,This was back to about 1935 --
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2232.372,2234.803,That is correct.
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2333.262,2336.764,"Well, there is (Inaudible)."
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2336.764,2343.426,"That is correct, Your Honor, except for the fact that in this case, need is not in question."
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2360.257,2367.201,What if he was living at home and he was in the military and he was not making enough to satisfy the standard needs?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2367.201,2370.126,We do not contend that the family would have been eligible for AFDC benefits --
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.126,2372.283,"But would be just as irrational, wouldn't it?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2372.283,2376.735,[Attempt to Laughter] We are dwelling here on the statutory argument --
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.735,2383.353,"Well, I understand that, but you are also arguing about the situations that you claim were in comparison are irrational."
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2385.152,2401.989,"Okay, if the father were living at home, there are, of course, certain economies of living about maintaining only one household and also the father would be available to help with the physical care of the children, he would be available to provide guidance and possibly in some situations, he would be able to take a second job."
1971.70-250,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2401.989,2407.033,"Well, if he is in prison there is one less mouth to feed too though, isn't it?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2407.033,2408.82,Yes.
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.054,2450.209,"Has there been any congressional, any proposals in the Congress to have a statutory definition of continued absence that would bear on this situation?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2450.209,2468.997,"No, Your Honor, I would only point out that Congress is currently considering enhancement, considering for some time, the Family Assistance Program and one of the provisions in that program is that the families who are assisted must be intact families living together."
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.246,2482.717,"But in the past, there haven't been some proposals to provide a national standard for aid to military people that have either been adopted, well if they haven't been adopted obviously but there have been rejected, there haven't been any proposals like that --"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2482.717,2488.745,I don't know of any proposals that deal specifically with the military problem.
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.204,2500.937,"And which -- under which definition, the states can do it either one way or the other?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2500.937,2503.257,"Well, we maintain there are two parts to that definition."
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.256,2515.636,"Well, HEW certainly doesn't think it's definition requires the states to give aid, at least that's what they've reached to --"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2515.636,2516.387,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2525.709,2538.759,I know this HEW has suggested this whole problem might perhaps more appropriately be handled as a responsibility to military pay and allotment system?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2538.759,2546.406,"Your Honor, we would agree that the military pay and allotment system could be much more equitable."
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2546.406,2558.776,"Well, I take it there must be some situations where even if 100% of the soldier's salary were remitted home under the allotment system, it still wouldn't be enough to meet the family standard either?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2558.776,2559.066,Oh!
1971.70-250,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2577.761,2600.701,"Well, would it be so difficult, I'll put the question to you, I'll put to the counsel for the state, to administratively determine what was the difference between the fair allotment, the maximum allotment that could be made and the allowance that the state would pay?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2600.701,2611.202,"Your Honor, our contention is that this would be very simple to administer and I would compare it to the situation where you have parents who are separated by agreement."
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.375,2659.771,"But if he is stationed near home and living off the base, the welfare was not (Inaudible)"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2659.771,2666.299,"Each case would have to be determined on its merits, but that's all that we are arguing here today is that each case must be determined on its merits."
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.81,2682.805,"Well, if switched into Seattle (Inaudible) even though he was sending them all the allotments?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2682.805,2692.584,"Your Honor, that's the point where you have to determine each case individually because there might certain situations where the family could not live with him in Seattle; there might be other situations where the family could."
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2695.185,2709.92,Mr. Linderman suggested that District Court was wrong in saying that there are other classifications of absence from the home that California handles on an individual basis.And t
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2717.276,2720.106,"Well, I would disagree with that."
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2748.773,2767.445,"Well, I understand Mr. Massey to say that California treats fathers who are absent from home either because they are employed away from the home or are seeking employment away from the home, just as does military personnel, that it excludes them as a group."
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2768.42,2769.524,"No, I believe that is correct."
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2777.391,2794.855,"But at least that group of fathers employed in a civilian capacity of one kind another away from the home, or who are seeking employment, civilian employment, non-military employment away from the home are excluded as a group from parents absent, continually absent from home, is that correct?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2794.855,2795.444,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2795.444,2796.343,Just as military --
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2796.343,2801.391,As military man.
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2841.408,2847.224,The conclusion from that is that the continued absence must have one definition countrywide?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2847.224,2849.218,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.18,2882.952,Well that means -- that would mean that any state plan that for which Congress provided matching funds would mean that those children for which the matching funds are eligible and every other state would have to confirm to the state that had the highest level of eligibility in its plan?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2882.952,2884.54,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.95,2915.591,"(Inaudible) this case, doesn't it?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2915.591,2916.212,"Your Honor, I believe --"
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.212,2924.323,It does because here you have to look and find legislative history or something in the Act to the show that Congress meant to include military --
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2924.323,2934.419,"Yes, Your Honor that was the first part of the argument and we used to support that claim, the interpretation of HEW in the plain English language of the words."
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2934.419,2937.751,"Yeah, but if you are wrong then that only had to be (Inaudible)"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2937.751,2942.462,"Your Honor, if we are wrong and Congress meant --"
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2942.462,2948.46,HEW certainly doesn't think that any of these words in the regulation to support your view?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2948.46,2953.852,"Your Honor, it does as far as the initial issue which is whether or not these children are federally eligible."
1971.70-250,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2966.285,2969.269,Because they're provided to some 20-25 states now?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2969.269,2975.288,"That is correct, plus the plain language of the regulation that you read from."
1971.70-250,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2975.288,2977.751,You raise any constitutional questions?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,2977.751,2978.672,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.571,3025.254,Nor from a child whose parent is away for civilian employment?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,3025.254,3029.505,Or for a child who's parent is away for civilian employment.
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3096.215,3108.244,"Now if Congress has said specifically in the act, continued absence but the states have a discretion of whether or not to include military people, would you be here?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,3108.244,3109.393,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.393,3110.792,On the constitutional argument?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,3110.792,3111.241,Yes.
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.241,3113.141,Not on the statutory argument?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,3113.141,3114.201,That's correct.
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3114.201,3123.3,"But even though on the statutory argument if half of the states covered military people and half of the states didn't, military people are eligible?"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,3123.3,3124.614,Yes.
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3124.614,3125.904,Which is the way it is now?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,3125.904,3126.129,Yes.
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.292,3162.639,"Well, I think that the HEW's position is by using this general term against the history, 35-year history that it's just as though that Congress had said expressly that the states may have discretion and thus even though military children are eligible, it doesn't mean there is a violation of the Act in those states where they clearly they don't --"
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,3162.639,3162.797,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-250,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.797,3163.644,That's your basic position?
1971.70-250,1,19571,carmen_l_massey,,3163.644,3165.828,That's the position of HEW and of the state.
1971.70-250,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3233.344,3234.08,Thank you.
1971.70-250,2,31407,jay_s_linderman,,3240.159,3253.53,May I just refer briefly to the Townsend decision to respond to what Ms. Massey says that the decision holds and I don't mean to be presumptuous in telling the Court what it held in that case.
1971.70-250,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3381.111,3381.987,"Thank you, Mr. Linderman."
1971.70-250,3,19571,carmen_l_massey,,3392.629,3397.263,Thank you.
