1969.249,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.351,Barlow and others against Collins.
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,21.264,23.977,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.249,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,211.022,215.643,You said Mr. Edgar that people know in the community you have a definite amount of funds coming in.
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,218.477,221.715,It is not known exactly in advance what the figure will be.
1969.249,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,242.441,244.025,Exactly predictable.
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,244.025,247.211,"No, Your Honor."
1969.249,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,480.869,482.392,If I could ask a question.
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,488.699,494.439,"Well, Your Honor I have planned to deal with the standing question at the end of my argument but let me --"
1969.249,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,494.439,499.215,Isn't that what was decided by the lower board that there was no standing?
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,499.215,503.683,Well the lower court also intimated its views on the merit but yes its specific holding was that there was --
1969.249,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,503.683,506.752,So it has not decided the merits?
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,506.752,508.729,"No Your Honor, not expressly."
1969.249,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,512.065,516.004,Well my point is this is a matter that's all before us.
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,516.004,521.947,"Well, Your Honor we believe that a decision on the entire case is appropriate in this Court."
1969.249,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,526.408,534.17,"Well, naturally you like to have it but I still ask whether the only issues -- the only question that decided on the lower court was standing."
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,534.17,538.303,"The only -- yes, Your Honor the only --"
1969.249,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,538.303,547.861,Therefore I would assume that you disagree with lower court and there are no standings involved and you have already told that.
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,551.85,553.75,"Mr. Justice Harlan, I think --"
1969.249,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,553.75,558.356,If the court decided them then the Court of Appeals did it.
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,558.356,579.037,I think it's fair to say that the Court of Appeals strongly indicated its view on the merits as respondent noted and in our view that the questions are so close that it doesn't want remanding for the purpose of -- and the Court of Appeals decision.
1969.249,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.037,587.154,"Though we note we review intonations, we only review holdings counsel, so you'd better address yourself to the standing questions."
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,587.154,588.226,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.249,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,826.829,830.031,Do you employ against on the data process engaged in case?
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,830.031,831.647,"No, Your Honor."
1969.249,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,966.501,975.482,You say the Act instructs the Secretary to issue regulations to protect the farmer?
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,975.482,976.639,"Yes, Your Honor, well it --"
1969.249,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.639,979.546,Where is that?
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,980.851,993.862,It's Section 7 U.S.C. 144 d (10) Your Honor which is Section 103 (d) 10 of the 1949 Agricultural Act.
1969.249,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.862,1004.161,So I take it then we have the Secretary responding by issuing what he thought was a regulation to protect the interest of the attendant farmer.
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,1016.529,1026.502,"Mr. Justice White, we don't think that construction of what is happened is a likely one."
1969.249,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.93,1031.635,Well do you think he was disobeying his duty or --
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,1031.635,1033.369,I think he was just --
1969.249,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.369,1040.059,He thought at least that was -- to help the tenant farmers I take it.
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,1041.196,1045.032,I -- we would not accept that Your Honor for this reason.
1969.249,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.896,1053.353,So he disobeyed his duty and he issued a regulation to hurt them?
1969.249,0,26914,harold_edgar,,1053.353,1061.417,"No, this regulation Your Honor is not issued pursuant -- the regulations we are challenging are not issued pursuant to Section (d) 10."
1969.249,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1474.734,1478.342,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.249,2,26914,harold_edgar,,3339.845,3355.315,Your Honor I'd like to first speak a bit about whether a remand would be appropriate in this case under both the Governmentsâ€™ discussion of standing and on our discussion of standing.
