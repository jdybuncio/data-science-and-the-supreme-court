1987.86-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,57.494,"Mr. Mathews, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,57.494,74.454,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.607,207.184,How about state laws against embezzlement?
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,215.93,229.58,"Well, Congress anticipated your question, Justice Scalia, because ERISA expressly removes from its preemption section state laws of general... criminal laws of general application."
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.283,233.814,Civil laws of general application.
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,233.814,234.501,--Criminal laws.
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,234.501,236.437,What about civil laws of general application?
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,236.437,237.984,Congress does not remove that.
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.984,244.59,So there could be no civil action for embezzlement under state law?
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,244.59,245.762,"No, there could not."
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,271.298,285.152,"An automobile accident caused by a car driven by an employee of the trust, on the business of the trust, you say there could be no recovery because that would relate to ERISA."
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,286.98,288.261,"Well, I--"
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.261,289.746,You have to.
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,289.746,290.777,--I don't think I have to.
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.777,291.324,No?
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,291.527,291.996,I'm not sure.
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.074,294.98,"Well, I know it's not your case."
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,294.98,301.822,"--Well, I think that Congress obviously intended that these ERISA plans function."
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.84,342.244,So we are just arguing about whether being liable for garnishment is one of the ordinary things that any employer normally engages in.
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,342.244,350.006,"And if this case were a garnishment about a fund employee, I might even agree that that is not preempted."
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.006,350.647,I see.
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,350.647,353.443,But this is a garnishment of the beneficiaries of the fund.
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.171,371.358,"Well, that makes a lot of sense."
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,384.695,385.179,Yes.
1987.86-1387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.035,397.956,You can have fun but you can't die laughing.
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,400.111,404.704,"--No, the federal laws should not be impaired in their work."
1987.86-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,423.947,431.584,"Well, Mr. Mathews, there is a sue and be sued clause in ERISA, isn't there?"
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,431.584,432.115,"Yes, there is."
1987.86-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,432.115,446.047,"And this Court has said, based on other sue and be sued clauses in other circumstances, that that would include garnishment proceedings, hasn't it?"
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,446.047,447.172,I believe it has.
1987.86-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.172,462.463,So it certainly is conceivable that Congress intended that garnishment procedures be included within the scope of that sue and be sued provision as being all right.
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,462.463,468.398,"If we were looking for an implied intent of Congress, I might agree with Your Honor."
1987.86-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,483.924,496.623,"Well, of course, Congress did enact Section 206(d) dealing expressly with assignment or alienation of benefits for pension plans."
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,496.623,506.15,"--That is true, but 206(d) in its specific terms deals with the voluntary alienation of pension funds."
1987.86-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,506.15,508.336,"Well, it deals across the board."
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,508.336,514.771,"Well, there has been a gloss on the statute by the courts that that would also cover involuntary alienation."
1987.86-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,520.222,530.562,"Well, in your view, 206(d) is at least partially superfluous since you think 514 would preempt anyway."
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,533.686,538.716,"Well, historically speaking, they passed 206(d) before they passed 514."
1987.86-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,556.021,561.878,Do you think that garnishment law is generally treated as a matter of state procedure?
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,561.878,567.907,I would have said that probably before I did the research in this case.
1987.86-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,618.234,629.542,"I am not convinced, I think, that Congress was concerned in its preemption Section 514 with the workload burden on the trustees."
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,662.904,668.372,"--Well, again, Your Honor, you are going to an implied preemption analysis in trying to psycho analyze Congress."
1987.86-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.821,760.725,I have to go back to Justice Scalia's questions if I may.
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,771.377,773.017,--I think they could.
1987.86-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,773.017,775.001,"Well, why is that different?"
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,775.001,785.293,"Because that is necessary to the functioning of the fund or of anybody else who goes into business, and I think it's impliedly revived by Congress's intention that there be funds."
1987.86-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.293,795.649,"But your language is still the same, and the garnishment... you rely entirely on 514, don't you?"
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,795.649,797.367,"Yes, Your Honor, entirely."
1987.86-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,808.566,817.562,"What they seek to garnish in this case, these were vested; these were not contingent benefits."
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,818.922,820.905,"Well, they wouldn't get them until they were due and owing."
1987.86-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,820.905,824.967,But under the plan when would they have gotten it if they weren't garnished?
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,824.967,828.7,"In Georgia, it would be the end of the year."
1987.86-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.549,867.061,"So suppose that you are right that this law does relate to garnishment, or does relate to the plan."
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,867.905,868.623,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.623,870.121,"It's preempted, and therefore what?"
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,870.121,870.684,It's preempted.
1987.86-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.776,872.698,So?
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,872.698,876.885,ERISA plans may not be garnished under state garnishment procedures.
1987.86-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.742,882.148,On what do you rely for that?
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,882.148,885.739,"--Well, the statute is null and void if it is preempted."
1987.86-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.739,886.364,All right.
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,888.645,895.189,"No, I said the state law which permits garnishment is null and void, because it relates to the plans."
1987.86-1387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.189,896.017,--All right.
1987.86-1387,0,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,896.017,900.157,And I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal if I might--
1987.86-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,900.157,901.47,"Thank you, Mr. Mathews."
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,903.109,912.762,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1038.072,1043.913,"Well, that's true any time you allow the trustees to be sued under state law."
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1054.677,1056.128,"No, no, I'm not saying that."
1987.86-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1062.032,1064.125,"Well, unpaid rent, Justice Scalia's example."
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1064.125,1065.562,"--Unpaid rent, all of these."
1987.86-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1095.862,1099.642,How about a state tax lien on the employee's benefits?
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1099.642,1114.699,That would be preempted too under 514(b)(7) which the House Report accompanying the bill specifically endorsed the Ninth Circuit's decision in Franchise Tax Board which held that state tax levies could not be applied.
1987.86-1387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.699,1120.946,Tell me again what is 514(b)(7) and where is it?
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1120.946,1126.305,514(b)(7) is an exclusion from the preemption language of 514(a).
1987.86-1387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1129.521,1131.818,Like from pension plans.
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1131.818,1133.49,From pension or welfare.
1987.86-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.741,1178.927,That's nice for this case.
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1178.927,1179.49,Yes.
1987.86-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.49,1181.785,"It won't help very many others, will it?"
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1181.785,1182.894,Probably not.
1987.86-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.894,1183.91,There are likely to be a lot of these.
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1194.671,1196.92,"Well, it's not self-evident."
1987.86-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1203.215,1205.918,What do you think would be a line of more general utility?
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1205.918,1217.461,"--A state law that determines whether the trustees will pay benefits to a plan participant pursuant to the plan is preempted, tied to the benefits and to the plan."
1987.86-1387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.461,1220.537,Is the legislative history as clear as you describe it?
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1224.253,1224.972,Yes.
1987.86-1387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1224.972,1233.937,"""The committee emphasizes that except as expressly provided nothing in the bill is intended to limit or otherwise change the original broad intent behind ERISA's rule of preemption. """
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1244.121,1246.246,The next sentence adds--
1987.86-1387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.246,1247.402,That just repeats the language of the statute.
1987.86-1387,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1247.402,1249.979,"--The next sentence of the House Report,"
1987.86-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1307.706,1309.018,"Thank you, Mr. Martin."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1311.206,1318.765,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1387,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1464.238,1470.892,"Ms. Mahoney, was the Franchise Tax Board decision to which you refer, was that decision of our Court or of the Ninth Circuit?"
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1470.892,1472.298,"That was a decision of your Court, Your Honor."
1987.86-1387,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.298,1472.689,Of our Court.
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1472.689,1485.934,"In that, it was a case involving the question of whether or not an action which was brought by the State of California to enforce its tax levy could be removed to federal court as a federal question."
1987.86-1387,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1660.757,1671.299,"Well, Ms. Mahoney, Congress also, though, enacted Section 514, and that's what obviously the government and the Petitioner are relying on."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1696.553,1700.818,"Your Honor, the domestic relations order I believe was done for a very different purpose."
1987.86-1387,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1721.061,1731.011,"Well, aren't most of these domestic relations orders from an errant parent collected by a garnishment order if there are some funds to do it?"
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1731.011,1732.073,"Your Honor, it could be--"
1987.86-1387,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1732.073,1736.258,And isn't that legitimately a concern of Congress in exempting it?
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1736.258,1741.911,"--Yes, it is, except that the domestic relations exception does something much broader than garnishment itself."
1987.86-1387,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1754.438,1756.329,But it may also affect the garnishment.
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1756.329,1758.672,--It certainly may affect the garnishment.
1987.86-1387,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1803.732,1810.386,"Let me ask you, since you are interrupted, about this particular Georgia law."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1828.613,1833.797,You are referring to the section which exempts ERISA plans from garnishment?
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1910.407,1930.696,"Do you happen to know if prior to the enactment of ERISA going back in the early days in Georgia, and prior to the enactment of the particular statute that you just say is preempted, the one relating to ERISA, would the garnishment been appropriate in Georgia of a, just say there was a state-administered plan like this?"
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1930.696,1942.801,"Your Honor, I don't now of a specific case, but I believe that the general principles of garnishment that were applicable in Georgia would have permitted this garnishment because there was no general exception for benefits of any type."
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1958.873,1967.089,"Do you happen to know if there is any reported cases in Georgia of garnishments of these funds, you know, just normal state trusts?"
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1967.089,1968.245,I know of no such case.
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1968.245,1970.073,It sounds strange to me.
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1976.492,1984.146,"Well, one of the things that I think is important to keep in mind here is that the specific funds are vacation funds."
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.623,2042.951,"Well, you get two kinds of vacation pay."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2060.554,2062.754,"Your Honor, it cannot be garnished until that point in time either."
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.754,2065.457,"Well, of course not, because there is no vested interest in it until--"
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2065.457,2065.973,That's right.
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.187,2079.593,--Right.
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2079.593,2085.153,"And when it garnishes wages, it's not entitled to the wages until the date on which it is payable to the employee."
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.153,2085.388,Right.
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2085.388,2087.292,So they are really indistinguishable.
1987.86-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2138.022,2146.706,"Ms. Mahoney, the government has given us its best shot at a general rule to determine what ""relating to"" means."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2154.313,2173.242,"I think the general rule has got to be that, first of all, state procedures are not laws that relate to ERISA plans even though they might burden ERISA plans, except to the extent they are in conflict with the substantive requirements of ERISA."
1987.86-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.84,2227.441,"Well, it seems to me this is a procedure if you look at it from the standpoint of the creditor, or from the standpoint of the debtor, but I don't know that from the standpoint of the garnishee getting an order from the court is a procedure."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2231.018,2233.33,"Well, I think, Your Honor, it's more like a subpoena."
1987.86-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.866,2299.349,What about an order and execution of judgment; is that a procedure?
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2299.349,2300.084,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1987.86-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.084,2302.035,So any state judgment--
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2302.035,2303.973,The judgment itself.
1987.86-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2303.973,2310.299,"--So long as you can get a judgment in state court, you can execute it against the ERISA trust."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2310.299,2316.219,I think that's correct except to the extent that it would contravene the substantive provisions of ERISA.
1987.86-1387,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2360.545,2372.228,"So you say then that even if ERISA would provide that you can't get a hold of these vacation benefits, nonetheless, the garnishment process would be in force?"
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2372.228,2373.665,"--No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1387,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.275,2388.519,"Yes, but that would mean the trustee would have to answer not that you can never garnish the trust, but that there is no liability on the trust in this case."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2392.19,2393.953,--That's correct.
1987.86-1387,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2422.458,2426.285,"But, counsel, I have trouble with this word ""procedure""."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2430.955,2433.345,Your Honor.
1987.86-1387,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2433.345,2436.015,I guess you call execution a procedure.
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2436.015,2437.593,"Yes, Your Honor, I would."
1987.86-1387,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2437.593,2439.577,That's a procedure?
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2439.577,2440.029,"Yes, it is."
1987.86-1387,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2444.309,2446.231,I said executions.
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2446.231,2449.417,"Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1987.86-1387,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2464.552,2472.97,"Well, do you see a difference between the procedure of asking you to testify and the procedure of taking your money away from you?"
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2475.86,2478.343,"Your Honor, in this case I do, because--"
1987.86-1387,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2478.343,2479.764,"They are a little different, though, aren't they?"
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2479.764,2480.405,"--Yes, they are different."
1987.86-1387,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2517.546,2520.405,"You mean as to the person with the money, it's just a procedure."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2520.405,2525.074,"--To the person with the money, it is a procedure, yes."
1987.86-1387,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2567.152,2568.965,"Well, that didn't involve an ERISA plan though."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2568.965,2570.153,"No, Your Honor, it didn't."
1987.86-1387,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2570.153,2576.01,"So I think that... unless you are dealing with Section 514, that probably isn't a good precedent."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2576.01,2585.772,"Well, the reason that I think it is a good precedent is because it says that garnishment is viewed as a normal incident of the judicial process."
1987.86-1387,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2623.819,2633.05,"Well, I think the Solicitor General doesn't point so much to that as it does a protection of the benefits themselves."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2633.05,2635.737,"Okay, that is a very different question."
1987.86-1387,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2665.257,2669.568,"Well, they may have done more in 514 with their ""relate to"" language."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2673.662,2688.437,"Yes, Your Honor, except that I don't believe that the ""relate to"" language should be construed to apply to a third-party action when Congress didn't even address the question of what remedies would be available to third parties."
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.475,2748.663,May I just clarify one.
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2757.583,2759.441,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2759.441,2764.423,--And you emphasized the fact that welfare plans and pension plans are treated differently under the statute.
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2764.423,2765.141,That's correct.
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.141,2768.531,"But then in Franchise Tax Board, it was a welfare plan, wasn't it?"
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2768.531,2770.234,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2770.234,2771.437,Then how to you explain that case?
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2771.437,2783.339,"Well, Franchise Tax Board I think is critical to the analysis here, because in Franchise Tax Board the state brought an action to collect on its tax levy in state court."
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.431,2870.616,"But then, as I remember the legislative history the government cites on (b)(7), refers to the Ninth Circuit decision in Franchise Tax Board."
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2870.616,2871.084,That's correct.
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2871.084,2873.053,Now was that before our decision?
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2874.801,2876.285,"Your Honor, I believe--"
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.285,2878.816,"--See, that seems inconsistent with your position, or am I missing something?"
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2878.816,2882.893,"--No, I think you are correct."
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2925.313,2938.231,"Before the (b)(7) amendment, had the courts been allowing... in alimony and child support cases, had they been allowing collections from pension trusts as well as welfare trusts?"
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2938.231,2939.169,"Yes, they had, Your Honor."
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2939.169,2939.466,They had.
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2939.466,2940.559,They had been allowing them.
1987.86-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2940.559,2944.027,Which was really inconsistent with... normally thought to be inconsistent with that spendthrift--
1987.86-1387,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2944.027,2947.261,"Yes, but they found an implied exception essentially."
1987.86-1387,3,22712,ernest_l_mathews_jr,,3136.998,3147.369,"Your Honor, obviously Ms. Mahoney and I are in sharp disagreement, but I think the lines are well drawn, and I don't think I have to take any more time of this Court."
1987.86-1387,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3147.369,3149.181,"Thank you, Mr. Mathews."
