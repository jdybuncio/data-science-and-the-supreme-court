1980.79-567,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.513,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Difrancesco.
1980.79-567,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,85.7,87.731,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-567,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,167.542,168.792,"Where does that stand now, Mr. Frey?"
1980.79-567,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,168.792,173.806,"Well, I believe it's passed the Senate and I'm not sure that it's passed the House."
1980.79-567,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,180.007,183.115,So you are sure that it hasn't passed the House.
1980.79-567,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,183.115,189.456,"Well, I am sure that if it passes the House and the Senate that Conference will be required--"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1783.44,1788.688,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1813.583,1816.941,But how is that relevant to our problem?
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1816.941,1824.689,"--Well, his first point, as I understood it, Mr. Chief Justice, was that there's a disparity in sentences."
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1826.923,1827.173,"Well, that's not."
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1833.531,1836.28,"--I misunderstood him then, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1845.477,1851.475,"But the Parole Board's power doesn't include any power to enlarge a sentence, does it?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1851.475,1852.115,"No, that's true, Judge."
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.115,1855.755,And is it a procedure or just some guidelines?
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1855.755,1869.327,"It's a regular scale, Justice White, and they take the offense plus other factors, recidivism, and come out with a scale--"
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.327,1870.687,What are you... to what are you referring?
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1870.687,1884.447,"--The United States Parole Board nationwide has a system by which they address sentences of all people in the federal parole system, Justice White."
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.213,1891.928,But that isn't binding on the district judges or--
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1891.928,1892.444,--No.
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1908.765,1914.888,"--But it also, however, might lead to some uniform application of this special offender statute."
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1914.888,1917.917,--That's true.
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.917,1920.37,"That's what they're talking about, isn't it?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1920.37,1923.087,"No, I believe that they're talking--"
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.087,1924.15,"Well, it's part of what they're talking about."
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1924.15,1925.259,"--Part of... yes, Judge."
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1939.144,1943.034,A judge's ignoring the statute; that's what the claim is.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1943.034,1950.872,"Ignoring the statute or they say... for example, they think Judge Burke ignored Mr. Difrancesco's background."
1980.79-567,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1950.872,1954.59,"When you say ""they"", you refer to Congress, I take it?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1954.59,1956.465,"No, I'm referring to the Department of Justice."
1980.79-567,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.465,1959.447,"Well, wasn't it Congress that authorized these appeals?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1959.447,1963.446,"That's true, that's true."
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.616,1970.959,But it's the Department that decides whether to appeal.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1970.959,1971.912,Right.
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.912,1976.503,And their claim is that the judge is misapplying the statute.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1976.503,1984.266,It... I don't want to... you're probably right and it's just going by me.
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.67,1990.17,Under the statute?
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,1990.17,1990.733,Under the statute.
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.66,2017.113,"Well, it isn't... no assurance it's going to be passed in this Congress."
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2017.113,2018.003,No; none at all.
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2054.613,2067.484,"However, from page 36 of the appendix on up to 42 and 3, they recite that this fellow has committed everything except possibly rape and bank robberies."
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2078.54,2079.165,"No, they're not."
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2084.305,2089.241,"Well, you don't suggest that the judge just rubberstamped those statements about his past record?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2089.241,2101.937,"Judge, the transcript of the hearing might be more illuminating, in which they went into all of that stuff, and I think Judge Marshall was alluding to it."
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2156.243,2158.289,How does that help you very much?
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2194.51,2202.85,"I'm suggesting to the Judge that... one, the judge knew Mr. Difrancesco very well, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2232.012,2234.932,"Arson isn't usually directed at hurting people, is it?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2234.932,2235.666,"--No, Judge."
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2237.666,2247.006,"The judge read the whole document closely enough to run a line through 2-1/2 lines, I think it is, or--"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2247.006,2249.442,"The last four lines, Judge."
1980.79-567,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2249.442,2261.953,"--Is it on 43, Mr. Nemoyer, and only 43, that there is the bracketed material is included, just at the very end there?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2261.953,2262.297,"Yes, Judge."
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2326.991,2338.41,About eight lines later he did not strike out the statement or alter in any way that at the time of the commission of the most recent felonies and
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2346.971,2354.482,"--I think it might not, taken out of context, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2376.739,2383.486,"Well, none of this really has anything to do with the question presented in the petitioner's brief, does it?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2383.486,2385.251,Well; okay.
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2385.251,2387.453,"Well, just... not ""okay""."
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2388.39,2392.919,"I'm sorry, Judge, I'm just trying to reflect that, Justice Stewart and... forgive me."
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2408.976,2411.538,"And therefore, that the question is not presented by this case--"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2411.538,2412.053,Right.
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2412.053,2418.003,"--and therefore, I suppose it would follow that the petition for certiorari ought to be dismissed as improperly granted?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2418.003,2418.503,Right.
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2457.799,2460.424,"Well, that would be the merits, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2460.424,2461.548,Right.
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2461.548,2470.06,And that really has nothing to do with the question at least as presented in the petitioner's brief.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2470.06,2473.012,"It was our position, first, that we lost the--"
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2473.012,2483.274,That would be an argument that you should make to the Court of Appeals if we disagree with the Court of Appeals that this whole provision of 3576 violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2483.274,2494.645,"--Well, Justice Stewart, you're correct that if I am not prevailing on either of those arguments, then I have to go to the merits, and the merits are then, first of all, the double jeopardy argument."
1980.79-567,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.284,2553.699,"Do you think that after a bench trial and a finding of guilty and the judge who tried the case from the bench dies, it would be a violation of Double Jeopardy for another judge to come in and impose sentence?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2553.699,2555.542,"No, I don't, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.583,2582.313,Did you argue to the Court of Appeals that the statute didn't apply here?
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2582.313,2587.171,"Judge, I didn't argue to the Court of Appeals, and I'm not sure what my partner argued."
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.091,2598.573,"You've raised in your brief, you've posed the question in your brief question one in your brief, you've got,"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2613.863,2610.209,I don't know.
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2618.032,2630.231,"Well, did the Court of Appeals decide that there had been, he had been properly determined to be dangerous or he hadn't?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2632.526,2632.995,They didn't.
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.995,2634.87,--They went to the constitutional question.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2634.87,2635.323,That's correct.
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2637.698,2642.524,But the dissenting opinion said that the statute was inapplicable.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2642.524,2643.696,"Yes, Justice Stewart."
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2645.397,2646.663,Or concurring opinion; right.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2647.662,2648.162,Right.
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2652.115,2654.097,Which is really your question three in your brief.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2654.097,2654.988,Right; that's true.
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2661.0,2662.124,All right.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2662.124,2676.839,"Now, Justice Stewart's point about the right of allocution and appeal to the 2nd Circuit, I think, is a real problem with this statute."
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2746.263,2764.037,"Of course, Mr. Nemoyer, one of the things that 3576 authorizes an appellate court to do on the Government's appeal is to remand for further sentencing proceedings and imposition of sentence by the trial court."
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2770.503,2772.565,"No, Judge Stewart, no."
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2776.813,2777.875,--itself extending the sentence.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2777.875,2780.265,--modifying by increasing; true.
1980.79-567,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2799.851,2803.224,Our double jeopardy rules change every two years too.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2803.224,2805.099,Well--
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2805.099,2806.879,Almost every week around here.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2806.879,2809.956,--In a hundred and... this is the first time ever that--
1980.79-567,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2809.956,2813.205,Even though the same Justices are sitting.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2813.205,2822.92,"--Well, this is the first time ever that the Department of Justice has sought to increase a sentence on appeal."
1980.79-567,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2828.138,2829.918,Did you say it was the first time they've tried it?
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2829.918,2830.637,"--Yes, Judge."
1980.79-567,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2832.885,2834.587,"Well, you ought to get your information updated."
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2834.587,2837.711,"--Well, as far as--"
1980.79-567,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2837.711,2839.914,"It doesn't mean any... doesn't mean anything in this case, does it?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2839.914,2841.21,--No.
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2861.42,2867.823,"Well, if there's never been any case, then surely there's no controlling precedent, is there?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2867.823,2873.119,"I think there is no controlling precedent right on point, Judge Stewart."
1980.79-567,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2897.296,2903.388,"Well, you've just told us it's never arisen before."
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2903.388,2906.246,That's true; that's true.
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2962.691,2966.409,"Well, do you suppose... are you suggesting Congress wasn't aware of all these considerations?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,2966.409,2977.779,"Judge, they well might have been, and when Congress enacted this section they were well aware, Mr. Chief Justice, that it had constitutional problems, and that was discussed when it was enacted."
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3062.683,3065.745,How many appeals has the Government taken since this statute was passed?
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,3066.37,3069.243,This is the first one that I'm aware of Judge.
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3069.243,3072.288,It doesn't suggest that there was a flood tide.
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,3072.288,3079.442,"No, but, Judge, this... Mr. Chief Justice, this is limited very narrowly to a special dangerous offender section."
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3087.392,3088.578,"That's not before us now, is it?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,3095.091,3100.043,I think Mr. Justice Stevens was correct in that it would even apply in murder cases.
1980.79-567,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3174.997,3181.447,"Is that the new bill, the pending bill... require it?"
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,3181.447,3181.932,No.
1980.79-567,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3187.304,3192.005,Do you know whether the pending bill requires that every sentence be accompanied by a statement of reasons?
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,3192.005,3192.989,"--No, I don't know that, Judge, Justice Brennan."
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3248.64,3259.104,"Well, there's one thing, if you're talking about finality in terms of appeal, and another if you're talking about final in the double jeopardy sense."
1980.79-567,1,22890,edgar_c_nemoyer,,3259.104,3263.916,"Well, I think in all senses this sentence was final."
1980.79-567,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3410.466,3412.762,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Frey?"
1980.79-567,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3414.34,3415.09,All right.
1980.79-567,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3447.967,3449.169,"Thank you, gentlemen."
