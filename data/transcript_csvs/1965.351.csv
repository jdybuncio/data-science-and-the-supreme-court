1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,33.848,"Number 351, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Petitioner versus Walter F. Tellier, et ux."
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,35.333,38.283,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.351,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,430.803,437.465,"Suppose you're on the way to a business, to a friend of yours to plainly discuss the business and he had an automobile accident?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,437.465,450.973,I think that undoubtedly there is -- there is room here as in most other tax questions for argument as to whether the activities were in fact personal or business in nature in closed cases.
1965.351,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,488.438,488.856,I see.
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,492.884,498.543,"Yes, and we take that position not on the ground that the expense is personal in nature."
1965.351,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,656.3,669.748,Does the record show whether the respondent was engaged in a general securities business or was this an isolated transaction?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,669.748,681.719,"The record is rather scanty, Your Honor, but we have cited in our brief in a footnote, the Second Circuit's opinion affirming his criminal conviction."
1965.351,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,708.856,717.554,"And there was only part of his securities business that was involved here, is that right?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,717.554,718.204,That's correct.
1965.351,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,740.711,742.311,"Well, that's not unlawful, is it?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,742.311,743.129,"No sir, it's not unlawful at all."
1965.351,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,743.129,746.379,Particularly if go up.
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,746.379,748.399,It's -- it's not unlawful at all.
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.768,799.069,"Well, do you draw a distinction between his attorney's fees in resisting a -- an injunction suit and attorney's fees for defending a criminal prosecution?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,799.069,800.115,Yes.
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,800.115,802.634,On the same -- the identical transaction.
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,802.634,804.301,That's correct.
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.591,818.859,And you and also between his attorney's fees -- how about his attorney's fees he pays for setting the transaction out?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,818.859,831.727,"The Commissioner has at least 40 years, consistently taken the position that three types of expenditures are encompassed by the public policy doctrine."
1965.351,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,855.445,866.75,"Now on page 5 of the Government's brief, it is that third category that the Solicitor General does not endorse, is that a correct statement?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,866.75,867.901,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,888.138,894.09,"Those first two types are established here, does that decide the case?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,894.09,894.919,No.
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,894.919,896.304,You have to have the third?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,896.304,897.07,That's correct.
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,911.418,920.043,"Well, is it fair to say that the Solicitor General does not believe that he should sustain the third?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,920.043,929.725,The Solicitor General has expressed serious doubts as to whether the public policy doctrine does in fact extend to the third.
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,946.17,947.504,In this sort of a case.
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,960.012,961.464,No.
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,961.464,986.509,"I was just thinking this, suppose a man was in the automobile business, secondhand automobile business, and it was charged that in connection with that business, he had acted as offense for stolen automobile and he was convicted."
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,996.913,999.611,"Well, to take it in two steps Your Honor --"
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,999.611,1002.35,"Could that -- that could not be distinguished from this case, I gather?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1002.35,1003.141,"No, I don't think so."
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1052.074,1070.541,"Would you think that in that case that I -- that I gave you that there's serious doubt as to whether -- whether he could deduct his -- no, as a serious doubt as to whether you could have to pay his tax on that money."
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1070.541,1077.634,"Well, the Solicitor General has expressed some doubt as to whether the Commissioner's position which would disallow those expenses is correct."
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1077.634,1080.131,But that has been done you say for --
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1080.131,1080.208,40 years.
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1080.208,1081.803,-- by the Commissioner for 40 years?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1081.803,1083.269,That's correct.
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1083.269,1088.236,When did the -- when did the Solicitor General first start to express such doubts?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1088.236,1090.024,When the case reached this Court.
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1090.024,1090.734,This Court?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1090.734,1091.085,That's correct.
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1091.085,1092.337,That's the first time?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1092.337,1092.843,That's correct.
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1092.874,1099.631,Have other Solicitor General acquiesced in -- in the viewpoint of the Commissioner?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1099.631,1105.038,"Yes, I believe to the extent that the case is -- the question has been presented to them, they have."
1965.351,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1105.038,1108.384,They ever -- have they supported it in the courts?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1108.384,1112.763,"Well, the case -- a similar case was before this Court once before."
1965.351,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1215.992,1218.191,It said that they had done it.
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1218.191,1223.503,"It said that the lower courts had done it, that footnote is quoted and cited in our brief."
1965.351,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1223.503,1226.096,But that wasn't cited in the body.
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1226.096,1228.021,"It was not in the body, in the footnote."
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.345,1247.524,"Mr. Levin, what do you say about the respondent's argument that after Heininger v. Commissioner really reversed this field in that Louisiana 1943?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1247.524,1247.96,Well --
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.96,1252.467,And that reading of the law until '56 or '62 was just the contrary.
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1252.467,1257.149,We filed a short reply briefly which I think adequately covers that.
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.338,1303.721,The Commissioner asserts that regularly in '43 right on up until now outside the antitrust field it has been nondeductible.
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1303.721,1304.924,That's' correct.
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1317.03,1320.806,"This was the role when the fit to foreclose was adopted, for example?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1320.806,1321.757,"That's right, Your Honor."
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1350.169,1356.42,"Well, does the Commissioner feel -- the Commissioner feel -- was that G.C.M. based on Heininger or not?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1356.42,1357.849,Based on what Your Honor?
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.849,1360.76,Based on Heininger?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1360.76,1364.776,I do not believe that the -- well the G.C.M. does cite Heininger.
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1365.72,1370.873,It felt that -- the Commissioner felt compelled by Heininger to adopt this G.C.M.?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1370.873,1372.454,Well I find it difficult to --
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1372.454,1373.623,For antitrust --
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1373.623,1378.595,"I find it difficult to say just what the Commissioner felt in 1944, but --"
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.595,1380.017,Well did he rely on Heininger or not?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1380.017,1381.238,He cited Heininger.
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.513,1406.346,"When you concede, you mean you argue that it's wrong?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1406.346,1407.393,What Your Honor?
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1407.393,1408.644,What do you mean you concede?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1408.644,1416.75,We concede that the G.C.M. was wrong in creating an exception for antitrust prosecutions.
1965.351,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1416.886,1418.576,"But you don't have to mean that, do you?"
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.576,1425.692,But now you -- but now you -- the Solicitor General has some --
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1425.692,1425.751,"When I said we there, I meant the Commissioner."
1965.351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.751,1429.028,Your position now is that it's right?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1429.028,1434.486,I've got to be careful with my use of the word 'we' it sort of slips out.
1965.351,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1452.872,1455.055,Suppose the man had been acquitted?
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1455.055,1462.641,"The man had been acquitted, there's no question but that the attorney's fees would be allowed as a deduction because they arose out of his business."
1965.351,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1486.761,1494.999,"Well, that would have to be a concession that the expense is ordinarily unnecessary, wouldn't it?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1494.999,1496.148,"Well, I don't think it's --"
1965.351,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1496.148,1500.564,Unless you're basing it purely on the question of public policy.
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1500.564,1521.514,"It is based purely on public policy whether this Court chooses to read ordinary and necessary as in themselves embodying a public policy exception or whether the Court reads public policy as a gloss on the statute which Congress intended, I'm not prepared to say."
1965.351,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1521.514,1521.54,Well what --
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1521.54,1522.91,The court has --
1965.351,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1522.91,1527.507,"Well, I thought you had to say it was that I understood you to say if he's acquitted."
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1531.369,1538.659,Because the man has not been determined judicially to have violated a sharply defined public policy.
1965.351,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1540.988,1545.498,"But if it's an ordinary and necessary business expense, it shouldn't be deducted, should it?"
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1545.498,1547.823,It is ordinary and necessary in the --
1965.351,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1547.823,1549.204,If he's acquitted.
1965.351,0,31590,jack_s_levin,,1549.204,1561.762,It is ordinary and necessary unless some concept of public policy which Congress intended to be embodied in that statute prevents the deduction.
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,2433.227,2438.417,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.351,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2801.141,2802.928,I thought you said the opposite?
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,2802.928,2803.961,I beg your pardon?
1965.351,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2803.961,2808.765,Would you restate what -- that last sentence?
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,2816.903,2819.19,"Yes, Your Honor, this was a civil case."
1965.351,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2820.086,2822.248,I think you said just the other way around.
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,2822.248,2825.0,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor."
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2982.899,2996.22,Is it denying a man his constitutional right that he has to pay a tax on money that he expends for his defense in a criminal case?
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,2996.22,3007.414,"Your Honor, I believe that it is an absolute denial of his constitutional right because the payment of the tax which is being imposed on that individual constitutes a sanction."
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3015.2,3025.642,I thought that's a different argument from the one you're making about the Sixth Amendment about he's entitled to counsel and entitled to --
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3025.642,3026.085,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3026.085,3027.425,-- to his deduction.
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3027.425,3049.86,"Your Honor, it is our position -- it is our position that when this Court decided -- when this Court decided the case of Gideon against Wainwright, the case in which this Court said that no jurisdiction, no court has jurisdiction over the person of a defendant unless that defendant is adequately represented by counsel."
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3049.86,3050.527,That's right.
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3050.527,3055.294,This Court stated a fundamental right which is superior to any statute.
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3069.447,3078.209,"Well let's take Gideon versus Cochran, he was burglar, allegedly a burglar."
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3085.782,3089.514,"Your Honor, the question cannot be answered simply."
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3090.764,3094.546,It can be answered as simply as yes or no.
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3098.496,3111.587,"If Cochran is engaged in the business of burglarizing, there is sufficient reason to permit him the deduction, but if Cochran is not engaged in the business of burglarizing there is no reason to allow him."
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3114.634,3131.14,"In other words, if Gideon was a habitual burglar and made his entire living by burglarizing stores, if he was alleged to have done here, he'd be entitled to a deduction."
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3134.719,3142.733,"Your Honor, does not Gideon say that the United States Government must subsidize Gideon's defense by paying for his counsel if he has none?"
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3142.733,3144.124,We're not talking about that.
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3146.112,3146.531,Yes but --
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3146.531,3148.208,Where the man is entitled to --
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3148.208,3148.682,Gideon --
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3148.682,3150.881,-- as a deduction.
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3150.881,3153.979,Gideon's offense was not a business offense.
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3216.184,3219.878,"Well, you take the case that I asked to Mr. Levin."
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3219.878,3220.825,Yes.
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3220.825,3241.524,"A man in the automobile business, a secondhand automobile business covers up by his business the fact that his offense for stolen automobiles and he is charged with knowingly receiving and handling stolen goods and he's convicted of it."
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3241.524,3242.821,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.351,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3242.821,3268.605,You feel -- do you feel that he should be entitled to a tax deduction because he was in the business of selling secondhand automobiles and therefore have the privilege of also doing offense for stolen automobiles to the extent that he would be entitled to deduct his expenses in maintaining himself his offense?
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3268.605,3274.064,I would answer Your Honor's question that he is entitled to the deduction but for another reason Your Honor.
1965.351,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3486.222,3487.387,May I ask you this question please?
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3487.387,3489.137,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.351,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3489.137,3506.7,"In taking this particular case and making the assumption that the respondent was advised by counsel with respect to the securities transactions before he embarked them, is that correct?"
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3506.7,3508.506,"No, that is not correct."
1965.351,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3508.506,3512.003,"Well, the respondent here was engaged in the securities business."
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3512.003,3512.575,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.351,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3512.575,3529.518,And we -- and I'm asking you to assume that he hired counsel to advise him about the lawfulness or unlawfulness and the form of the transactions that were subsequently attacked under the Securities Act.
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3547.483,3559.453,I believe that there is a case Your Honor where the Commissioner has argued that any relationship to criminality makes the crime -- makes the attorney fees nondeductible.
1965.351,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3559.453,3560.353,You suppose the lawyer --
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3560.353,3563.835,"My honest opinion that in that case, he would allow the deductions."
1965.351,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3563.835,3564.645,He would?
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3564.645,3565.622,He would.
1965.351,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3593.028,3605.566,"Well, specifically what I'm asking is whether the Commissioner has extended the application of this so-called rule beyond counsel engaged for the litigation?"
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3605.566,3607.424,Yes.
1965.351,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3623.652,3625.661,Well that's litigation connected.
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3625.661,3628.951,"Well, not yet the litigation in his examination."
1965.351,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3649.128,3657.212,"My recollection, this may not be accurate, but there were some special rulings in the General Electric case."
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3657.212,3657.764,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.351,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3657.764,3660.029,The settlement of those (Voice Overlap)
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3660.029,3662.153,"Yes Your Honor, I presume that we --"
1965.351,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3662.153,3664.954,Are they cited -- is that ruling cited in your brief?
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3666.342,3672.338,I have not cited it directly because they relate to the question of whether those payments are penalties.
1965.351,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3673.368,3675.69,"I know but I thought they were damage suit, weren't they?"
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3675.69,3679.437,"Yes, but the Commissioner has ruled that they are damages and not fines."
1965.351,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3679.437,3680.072,"Oh, I see."
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3680.072,3680.531,Yes.
1965.351,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3690.656,3692.331,Is that in you brief?
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3692.331,3700.019,"Yes I have referred to it, if Your Honor will bear with me for a moment."
1965.351,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3700.019,3701.85,"Well, if it's in your brief I can find it."
1965.351,1,36110,michael_kaminsky,,3701.85,3703.437,"Yes, it's on page 18."
1965.351,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3711.408,3711.857,"I see, yes."
