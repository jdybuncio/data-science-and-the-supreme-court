1975.75-122,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,59.493,We will hear arguments next in Laurence Cantor against the Detroit Edison Company.
1975.75-122,0,18148,burton_i_weinstein,,62.178,64.974,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-122,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,96.118,100.726,"When we read and hear about lamps, we are talking actually about light bulbs?"
1975.75-122,0,18148,burton_i_weinstein,,100.726,101.19,That is correct.
1975.75-122,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,104.234,105.773,"Lamps have other meaning, you know?"
1975.75-122,0,18148,burton_i_weinstein,,105.773,108.381,"It is not a floor lamp, Your Honor, no."
1975.75-122,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,156.268,159.586,It does not have the choice of not accepting not additional service?
1975.75-122,0,18148,burton_i_weinstein,,159.586,160.677,He does not have that choice at all.
1975.75-122,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,160.677,161.738,He has to take it?
1975.75-122,0,18148,burton_i_weinstein,,161.738,169.714,"No, that is -- the fact that makes it a tie-in, in fact, that is different than commercial customers who do not have that program at all."
1975.75-122,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,182.851,187.354,"It has been for great many years, has it not, in most utilities?"
1975.75-122,0,18148,burton_i_weinstein,,187.354,187.889,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-122,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,194.114,197.216,"But it is not been used in recent years very widely, has it?"
1975.75-122,0,18148,burton_i_weinstein,,197.216,197.878,"No, Your Honor."
1975.75-122,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,258.269,261.387,I gather the manufacturer is not quite (Inaudible)?
1975.75-122,0,18148,burton_i_weinstein,,261.387,262.792,"No, Your Honor."
1975.75-122,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1604.542,1607.136,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-122,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1721.662,1724.309,Or companies can get together to do so under Noerr?
1975.75-122,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1724.309,1726.116,That is true Justice Stewart.
1975.75-122,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1726.116,1726.916,The Noerr case?
1975.75-122,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1726.916,1732.845,That is true and we have no objection to anything that Detroit Edison may have asked the state to do or not to do.
1975.75-122,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.619,1811.496,"Mr. Solicitor General, do you take the position that the defendant could abandon the policy without the approval of the state?"
1975.75-122,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1811.496,1813.848,"I think it is quite clear that it could, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2478.0,2480.869,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.804,2607.687,"Mr. Solicitor General, your argument is that they were ordered and required to do it by the state?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2607.687,2609.597,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2609.597,2615.152,Do you think that that is the standard that the Parker against Brown --
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2615.152,2625.402,Parker v. Brown says that when am agency of the state issues a command to a private entity within the scope of its authority that the conduct there follows is (Voice Overlap)
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.402,2629.837,And do you think the rules should be broader than that and cover just mere authorization?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2629.837,2630.467,"I do not, Your Honor."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.849,2640.882,"Alright, but then now -- so you agree that the test is what the Solicitor General said it is?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2640.882,2644.5,"The test, I would rather say that the test is what Parker v. Brown said it is --"
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.5,2648.032,"Exactly, but you think he read Parker against Brown right or not?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2648.032,2661.043,"As I understood what he said, I think that he missed -- that he over read Parker v. Brown in that, he appears to be imposing a broader test upon what the scope of the legislative command --"
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.043,2663.771,But mere authorization would not do it?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2663.771,2667.662,"Mere authorization, we are not arguing that mere authorization would do it in this case."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2667.662,2671.224,"Now, what standard do you think the Court of Appeals acted on?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2671.224,2680.311,The Court Of Appeals adapted Judge Fiekens' opinion which had before it all of these orders that I am referring to which commanded --
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.311,2688.755,"Well, that maybe true, but what standard that the Court of Appeals used in affirming the --"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2688.755,2695.139,"Well, what it said was that the District Court had correctly applied of the principles of Parker v. Brown and thereby affirmed it --"
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.139,2696.109,Alright.
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2699.447,2708.265,"I believe that did say that it was authorized, but it did refer to Parker v. Brown which of course is narrow within their authorization."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.265,2710.303,"Now, how about the District Judge?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2710.303,2714.177,"The District Judge, I believe correctly described Parker v. Brown."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.781,2734.745,"So, you do not and I take it you do not think there is any problem here of either Court below applying the wrong reading of Parker against Brown and saying that mere authorization is enough?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2734.745,2740.367,"I do not think so Mr. Justice White, no."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.367,2749.35,"Mr. Reycraft because what the District Court said was when a state agency acts affirmatively in approving rates and practices of the utility, there is no anti-trust liability."
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2751.016,2757.68,"I think acting affirmatively and I would take it that the Court implies that, that is a command of the state and then --"
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.68,2761.596,"That is not what it said, that is not what the Court said?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2761.596,2764.353,"It did not say, use the word command, no sir."
1975.75-122,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2764.353,2766.979,And it is not what the Court of Appeals said?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2780.369,2782.021,"That is what he said Mr. Justice Brennan, yes."
1975.75-122,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2782.021,2784.261,It did not say anything about (Inaudible)
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2784.261,2785.185,Well but if the fact --
1975.75-122,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2785.185,2789.243,"The action, the affirmative action is approved --"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2789.243,2798.182,"The action, however, which is referred to is in fact a command and all those commands were before the District Court and were in the record which the Court Of Appeals considered."
1975.75-122,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2798.182,2801.836,Could the company have ordered these rates without further action of the Commission?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2801.836,2803.418,"No, it could not Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.75-122,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2808.802,2814.581,"Well, then do you say that the rate structure was a command, even though they did not use the word command?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2814.581,2817.608,The rate structure is indeed the command of the state.
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2817.608,2823.749,"Was the company required to file the tariff, including the incandescent light bulb?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2823.749,2828.465,"No, the company could have filed the tariff which did not include light bulb, but as long as the tariff --"
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2828.465,2832.455,It is not ordered to file a tariff as light bulbs (Inaudible)
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2832.455,2843.507,"It was not ordered to file a tariff, it is conduct is and the analogy is to that in Parker v. Brown where the producer has voluntarily petitioned the advisory pro-rate committee for a particular program."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2848.164,2857.837,Is there some law in Michigan that require the Public Service Commission to (Inaudible)
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2857.837,2874.539,"The law is 460.6 which is of course is a broad granted jurisdiction to the Public Service Commission to completely regulate Public Utilities within the state, including Electric Lightning Companies and the all the services that they provide with it."
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2886.994,2895.917,"Mr. Reycraft, was the Solicitor General correct that years ago they stopped going to the homes and deliver the bulbs and did not change the tariff?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2895.917,2899.374,I am not -- I do not know whether that is correct or not Mr. Justice Marshall.
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2923.08,2940.97,"(Inaudible) industry, you can fix prices in the industry or you need not to fix prices industry, but if you want to, go ahead just file a piece of paper up here with our Commissioner of Prices and if he says okay, go ahead, is that alright?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2940.97,2942.076,"No sir, that is not alright."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.348,2958.453,"But the -- even if the law said that if you want to fix prices in the industry, just file a piece of paper and if you file a piece of paper then you will be ordered to do it."
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2958.453,2960.485,"Well, I would think that --"
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2960.485,2973.623,"Then you are under an order, once you have all agreed to this under an order then you are ordered to do it, although you do not have to decide in the first place, the law does not require you to fix prices."
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,2977.478,2990.455,"Well, if it is optional as I understand the Court's decision Parker v. Brown then the conduct is not excluded from Anti-Trust laws."
1975.75-122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3201.317,3211.677,Does the Parker against Brown issue which I understand to be the basis of the decision in the District Court turn it all on whether or not the plaintiff has exhausted his state administrative remedies?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3211.677,3213.609,I do not believe that it does Mr. Justice Stevens.
1975.75-122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.609,3216.263,"And really it is not before us, is it not?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3216.263,3232.187,"It is not except to the extent that I do not know that jurisdiction was argued in Parker v. Brown, but here petitioner is arguing that the Michigan Public Service Commission did not have jurisdiction to order the lamp supply program in effect that it would be continued."
1975.75-122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.476,3289.605,"Mr. Reycraft, does the reasonableness of the program relate to whether there is a violation of law, but would it relate to the question whether Parker against Brown applies?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3289.605,3301.162,I think it relates to the question whether the Michigan Public Service Commission’s procedures were adequate and whether it conducted an adequate inquiry into Detroit Edison’s of a lamp exchange program.
1975.75-122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3318.716,3321.813,About how many of those pages were devoted to the lamp supply program?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3321.813,3324.526,"No indeed, there are devoted to all phases of Detroit Edison --"
1975.75-122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3324.526,3327.033,Were any of those pages devoted to the lamp supply program?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3327.033,3330.012,"Yes sir, those pages are included in the appendix to our brief."
1975.75-122,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3455.463,3466.448,"Mr. Reycraft, are you arguing that the plaintiff before he can prosecute in the Federal Anti-Trust sued has to exhaust procedures before a state agency?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3466.448,3473.578,That is an alternative ground Mr. Justice Rehnquist and which I think that this case can and it should be disposed of.
1975.75-122,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3477.316,3482.676,"But there is no authority at least from this Court for that proposition, is it?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3482.676,3483.926,"No, I would not agree with that."
1975.75-122,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3493.395,3496.177,But there you are dealing with two acts of Congress really?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3496.177,3497.657,"Yes, Your Honor, that is right."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3497.657,3509.728,And also you are dealing with an instance where the authority or the agency extended to deciding the kind of an issue that was up in the Anti-Trust Court?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3509.728,3509.917,I Agree.
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3510.698,3515.132,And here the state proceeding is a rate making proceeding?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3515.132,3515.368,"Well, yes."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3515.368,3523.151,And as you said the hearing certainly did not proceed as though it was a -- had any anti-competitive including in it?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3523.151,3533.938,"Well, I think my basic point is that the petitioner is arguing that the command which indeed the Michigan Public Service Commission did issue was outside the scope were their authority."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3548.362,3553.591,"Both Courts below accepted the order as valid, they did not, within the law?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3553.591,3560.961,They did and I think correctly.
1975.75-122,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3629.842,3634.407,That sounds like an argument to me that it does not cost any thing because it is there is anyway?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3634.407,3642.224,"Well, we paid in 1972 about 2 million 360 for the offices."
1975.75-122,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3662.85,3664.872,I have heard that kind of argument at home?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3664.872,3665.63,Sir?
1975.75-122,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3674.187,3680.897,But your rates could be entirely reasonable and that would not be a defense to an anti-trust (Inaudible)
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3680.897,3687.245,My argument Mr. Justice Rehnquist is as to the reasonableness of the procedures of the Michigan Public Service Commission.
1975.75-122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3727.219,3742.058,"Suppose Mr. Reycraft your analysis of the facts is correct and of course summary judgment, I guess we have to take your opponent's version, whether it is a dispute, if your analysis is correct, you have demonstrated that giving the customers an option they would still take the free light bulbs?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3742.058,3743.113,"That may, will be."
1975.75-122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3743.72,3747.283,So that we were really just fighting about whether it should be optional or mandatory?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3747.283,3749.909,"Well, I think what were -- I am not sure about that."
1975.75-122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3763.558,3768.493,"Would not there be the same number of people who would take the light bulbs, if it is such a bargain?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3768.493,3771.722,I do not -- obviously that is a matter in the future and I do not know.
1975.75-122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3771.722,3775.318,"If your premises are correct, you would think the conclusion would follow though?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3775.318,3782.114,"I think it is very likely true, yes, very likely true."
1975.75-122,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3782.114,3784.999,May I ask one another procedural question while interrupted you?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3786.842,3804.926,"No, Your Honor, there was no motion for a class determination and no class determination has been made and I might say at this point that the petitioner has testified in this case that he sold over I believe it was two or three years period, light bulbs with a retail gross value of about a $135.00."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3880.463,3885.612,"Mr. Reycraft, how many utilities are there in Michigan, do you know?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3885.612,3890.055,"No, there are at least three in Michigan who do have lamp supply programs, however, and I want to take it --"
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3890.055,3892.327,Are there good many others that they do not?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3892.327,3895.177,I do not believe there are many others throughout the country Mr. Justice White.
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3895.332,3899.571,"I know, but in Michigan are there good many others who do not have the program?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3899.571,3902.413,"I think there are at least some who do not have the program, yes sir."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3902.413,3903.04,And the --
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3903.04,3903.683,I can not tell you that --
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3903.683,3905.806,They are free not to have it under Michigan Law?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3905.806,3909.786,"Well, they are free not to have it only because their tariff -- the tariff is --"
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3909.786,3912.995,"I know, but they are the ones who decided what kind of a tariff to file?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3912.995,3916.991,"Yes, in the first instance of course it is voluntary action on the part of the utility."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3916.991,3925.175,And the -- do you know of any instance where the Commission has ordered a utility to have a lamp program against its will?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3925.175,3926.119,"No, I do not."
1975.75-122,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3926.119,3930.299,And that the statute does not say so?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,3930.299,3944.078,"No, the statute does not say that electric utility shall have lamp supply program, no, it does not."
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4039.476,4060.848,"Mr. Reycraft, getting back to Michigan, if the Detroit Edison are going to need decide to stop dealing in light bulbs, did so and filed an amended tariff, cutting its rates, is there any question in your mind that it would be approved?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4060.848,4064.294,"There is a question in my mind Mr. Justice Marshall, I do not know the answer to the question."
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4064.294,4066.558,"Well, what would your question be?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4066.558,4079.794,The question in my mind would be that if the choice is between continuing the lamp supply program at all or continuing on its present basis because of it is more economical in that sense.
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4079.816,4087.649,"I said they would could the rates, they could then decide the rate one way or the other, but that is all they would do, is it not?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4087.649,4094.107,"The Michigan Public Service Commission could say to Detroit Edison, we are going to require you --"
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4094.107,4099.376,Could they say you must continue to furnish the light bulbs?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4099.376,4100.403,"They can say that, yes sir."
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4100.403,4101.703,How?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4101.703,4102.205,They can say --
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4102.205,4103.978,What authority?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4103.978,4107.188,By their general authority in 460.6 --
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4107.188,4111.91,"Well, have they ever told anybody in Michigan that they had to do it?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4111.91,4112.944,No sir.
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4112.944,4116.011,"So, they have never done it before, why should they do it now?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4116.011,4119.014,"Well, let me explain my answer a bit."
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4119.099,4120.027,They could have told --
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4120.027,4127.035,"They have told Detroit Edison Company, 18 consecutive times since 1916 that they must continue the lamp supply program."
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4127.035,4129.118,I thought they said that you may continue.
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4129.118,4131.826,"No sir, they said you are ordered."
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4131.939,4135.142,They can say they ordered them to continue the light bulbs --
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4135.142,4136.051,I am sorry I did not hear.
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4136.051,4137.098,Wanted them to continue --
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4137.098,4137.444,Yes sir --
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4137.444,4138.203,-- to give light bulb?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4138.203,4139.854,Yes sir.
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4139.854,4141.273,When did they say that?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4141.273,4143.389,They said it 18 consecutive times --
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4143.389,4144.974,They said ordered?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4144.974,4147.25,"Yes, they said you are ordered."
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4167.236,4168.533,And how much more?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4168.533,4169.106,Sir?
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4169.106,4171.457,And how much more?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4174.127,4175.779,"Well, it is not a hundred, it --"
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4175.779,4178.6,It is just one of a whole group of items?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4178.6,4181.09,It is a paragraph which describes a lamp --
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4181.09,4190.502,But you say it is perfectly honestly that Detroit Edison could not stop furnishing these light bulbs?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4190.502,4192.698,Not under our existing tariff Mr. Justice Marshall.
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4193.823,4204.895,And then they furnish another tariff which takes into consideration and cuts the rates that much that the Commission would not approve it?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4204.895,4215.079,"The Commission does have the power to order Detroit Edison to continue the lamp supply program as it exists, to make it optional or to discontinue it all together."
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4245.052,4252.229,Your real trouble is that agreeing to and ordering are the same thing?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4252.229,4252.757,"Well, if I understand --"
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4252.757,4258.02,Or approving and ordering are the same thing?
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4258.02,4262.571,These orders that the Michigan Public Service Commission used the precise language order.
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4265.137,4267.799,"They stayed out of a form book, did they not?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4267.799,4275.749,"Well sir, to my simple mind whether it is out of a form book or not, it is an order and if I do not comply with it, I am in trouble whether it is a Court or the Michigan Public Service Commission."
1975.75-122,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4275.749,4281.114,"I think if you ask somebody to order you to do something, you would oblige, you would agree with it?"
1975.75-122,2,25984,george_d_reycraft,,4281.114,4283.901,"Well, that of course is what happened in Parker v. Brown."

1975.75-122,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4396.036,4400.16,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-122,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4564.035,4566.103,You are arguing (Inaudible)
1975.75-122,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4566.103,4570.546,I am arguing this case because the question here is really one of standards.
