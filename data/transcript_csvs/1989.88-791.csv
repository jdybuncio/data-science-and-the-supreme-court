1989.88-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.653,"We'll hear argument next in number 88-791, Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment Group."
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,12.261,15.057,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-791,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,332.585,338.801,Doesn't the signer also say that he is authorized to put the name down?
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,338.801,345.533,--I assume that that is implicit.
1989.88-791,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,349.593,358.839,"No, that the signer is authorized to use the firm's name and to sign on behalf of the firm."
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,361.135,365.259,"--Implicitly, I believe he does, in the sense that anytime someone uses--"
1989.88-791,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,365.259,365.712,"Well, what more do we need?"
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,367.164,372.037,"--Well, Your Honor, the rule rejects a firm's name."
1989.88-791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,385.705,394.981,"Well, aren't most pleadings signed Smith & Jones law firm by so-and-so attorney?"
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,394.981,395.653,--They are indeed.
1989.88-791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,395.653,409.039,"And you don't think that the attorney represents thereby that he represents, or she represents, that law firm and is authorized to sign it on behalf, not only of the attorney, but for the firm?"
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,409.039,413.99,"That is surely implicit within an attorney's signature that, that... that indicates that that attorney is--"
1989.88-791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,413.99,421.737,"So the rule could be interpreted, if you followed ordinary agency principles, I suppose, to bring the firm in as well."
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,421.737,426.781,"--Your Honor, I believe that that is not so, because I believe, first, we have the language of the rule."
1989.88-791,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,637.305,649.862,"And suppose you had an aggravated case in which two senior partners said well, this pleading is marginal, we might get in trouble with it, let's just have the junior associates sign it."
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,662.796,666.577,"--No, Your Honor, I believe that the district court would most surely not be powerless."
1989.88-791,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,682.412,683.725,Under what... under what rule?
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,683.725,690.893,"--Under its inherent... under its inherent powers, as was recognized by this Court in the Roadway Express case and a whole series of other cases."
1989.88-791,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,701.39,703.951,"Well, if you agree to that, why doesn't there inherent power here?"
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,703.951,707.951,"--There was no bad faith here, Justice Stevens."
1989.88-791,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.951,710.793,"Well, would you think the inherent power of a court is defined by bad faith?"
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,725.693,745.888,"Justice Stevens, in, in the Roadway Express case, in my reading of it, I believe it is clear, at least to me, from the language of, of this Court, that before a court can, can invoke its inherent authorities to sanction, to sanction an attorney, there must be a finding of conduct that either constitutes or is tantamount to bad faith."
1989.88-791,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.495,752.65,"Well, this sanction was imposed under Rule 11, wasn't it?"
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,752.65,753.369,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1989.88-791,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,753.369,758.008,And Rule 11 requires that a... an individual sign.
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,758.008,759.006,"Yes, yes, it does, Your Honor."
1989.88-791,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.006,764.52,And it says that the court may impose a sanction on the person who signed it.
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,764.52,765.379,"Yes, indeed, Your Honor."
1989.88-791,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.111,784.451,"Could, could I ask... let's assume we agree with you, and the sanction is limited to being imposed on the person who signed the... under state law could the sanction be collected from the partnership?"
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,784.451,786.246,--I would submit that it could not.
1989.88-791,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,787.403,790.636,Because of the rule or because of state law?
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,800.396,804.222,"--I believe that's so, and I believe it may do that in several different ways, if I may, Your Honor."
1989.88-791,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.157,862.636,"Oh no, you can't go against the... let's just assume the individual partner who is sanctioned is just... is just judgment proof, which is true, I suppose, of some attorneys."
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,867.916,874.678,"--I would think that in a circumstance where the signing attorney is judgment proof, I would wonder whether this is an appropriate sanction."
1989.88-791,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,886.253,893.328,"Under ordinary state law, the partnership would be liable for an obligation of its limited partners incurred in the course of the partnership business."
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,893.328,897.981,"What Your Honor, I believe, is referring to malpractice and the like, yes, yes indeed, sir."
1989.88-791,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,937.435,943.51,"But there is nothing in the rule that says it is a punishment or that is punitive, and in fact, the sanction is an objective one."
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,949.227,950.399,"--Yes, it is."
1989.88-791,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,950.399,955.786,"So the, the pure heart and the empty head are not a defense."
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,955.786,957.317,"That is so, Your Honor."
1989.88-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.239,971.998,"I suppose no one would suggest that if an appearing lawyer before a court were held in contempt and ordered jailed, and he absconds, that one of his partners could be required to come in and serve the contempt sentence."
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,971.998,972.857,"--That would be so, Your Honor."
1989.88-791,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1010.435,1018.214,"Which indicates to me that it is not a punishment, that it is a liability that we impose in order to make the party that is injured whole."
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,1018.214,1033.193,"Your Honor, the problem... the problem that the rule was calculated to address, if one looks at the Advisory Committee notes, is the problem of frivolous pleadings, is the problem of dilatory practices and the like."
1989.88-791,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1079.236,1090.481,"Well, what happens, as a practical matter, if a judge says you did wrong and I am going to penalize you, and I am going to fine you 11,000."
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,1105.647,1112.989,"The practical difference, Your Honor, is, I would submit, that the court is without power to impose that sanction upon the firm, under the rule and under its inherent powers."
1989.88-791,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1124.437,1131.949,"But the, the firm usually pays the debts of the partner, don't they, if it is incurred in litigation?"
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,1131.949,1134.293,The firm could do that.
1989.88-791,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1135.698,1137.368,"They usually do, don't they?"
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,1137.368,1138.275,"--I, I wonder."
1989.88-791,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1157.236,1159.594,Is the firm in the litigation or not?
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,1159.594,1165.123,"The firm represents a party, but the firm is not attorney of record for purposes of Rule 11."
1989.88-791,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1165.123,1169.653,But is... my question was is the firm in the litigation?
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,1169.653,1177.055,"Justice Marshall, that is a difficult... question for me to answer in the abstract."
1989.88-791,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1178.321,1178.634,Not for me.
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,1178.634,1185.663,"--Without question, if I might try to answer it, Justice Marshall, without question the firm is involved in the litigation."
1989.88-791,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1196.486,1203.468,The firm... the firm authorized the partner to sign its name to the firm.
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,1209.84,1213.963,"--Yes, because the rule rejects... the rule rejects that partnership responsibility."
1989.88-791,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1272.111,1275.969,I suppose the tougher case is the one that the court below referred to.
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,1292.635,1295.601,"--And that is... that is the system of the rule, and I think it is appropriate."
1989.88-791,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.03,1322.591,Do you know if this sort of payment is covered by most malpractice policies?
1989.88-791,0,31374,jacob_laufer,,1322.591,1325.153,--I think this is an evolving issue.
1989.88-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1500.081,1500.721,"Thank you, Mr. Laufer."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1503.111,1517.043,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1578.19,1584.626,"Well, of course, it is under seal of the court that... the statute also says it shall be under seal of the court."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1584.626,1619.377,"But analogously, Justice Kennedy, when a law partner in the course of partnership activity, with the authority of his partners, in a litigation such as this, which was a four-year litigation involving substantial discovery, a very serious allegation of forgery against another lawyer who served honorably a client for 13 years, when he signs his name, in essence, his signature is the act of the partnership."
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1630.482,1636.355,"If you are going to apply agency principles to the second half of the rule, why don't you apply it to the first half?"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1655.705,1657.018,"Justice Scalia,--"
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.018,1659.782,"You, you wouldn't allow that to happen for the first section, would you?"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1661.047,1662.593,--I don't believe so.
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.593,1663.422,Is that right?
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1663.422,1676.666,"Justice Scalia, I believe that the attorney of record, and by custom and usage in the southern and eastern district of New York is the law firm, can only sign through a member of the firm--"
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1676.666,1680.946,"So, so you--"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1680.946,1682.366,--as was done in this particular case.
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1683.554,1686.725,"--You think when the rule says in the attorney's individual name, that means the law firm's name?"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1686.725,1691.113,--It requires strict accountability.
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.814,1699.328,Doesn't a lawyer have to sign a federal pleading in his individual name?
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1699.328,1699.563,Yes.
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.563,1702.843,All right.
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1703.796,1707.686,"In the firm, yes."
1989.88-791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1707.686,1712.309,"But that can be an associate as well as a partner, I take it?"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1712.309,1713.011,Yes.
1989.88-791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1742.625,1754.636,"No, but you've got to assume though that the person who signs it is a lawyer, even if he's just out of law school and just passed the bar, takes responsibility if he or she puts his name on that paper."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1763.725,1766.958,"And that's, and that's what the advisors' comments noted."
1989.88-791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1778.422,1782.671,"Well, the point of the rule is that whoever signs it better be knowledgeable about the case."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1782.671,1784.982,"Yes, and has strict accountability."
1989.88-791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1795.494,1802.352,"Yes, but does Rule 11 impose any supervisory obligations on anyone who does not sign the pleading?"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1810.957,1812.315,--The text... the text does not.
1989.88-791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1824.56,1833.338,"--Well, I thought he suggested there could be, but under the inherent authority of the court, just not under the terms of Rule 11 as it is presently written."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1833.338,1850.393,"Yes, Your Honor, but we suggest that Rule 11 is a development, is an incremental development of the inherent powers of the court, including the power to regulate practice, including the disciplining of attorneys."
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.393,1860.265,"In order to decide this case, do we have to reach the question of whether you can get the law firm under some other basis than Rule 11?"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1860.265,1860.655,No.
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.655,1863.7,"Wasn't it... it rested below on Rule 11, didn't it?"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1863.7,1863.904,Yes.
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1863.904,1867.403,"So, if we think you can't do it under Rule 11, that is the end of the case."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1867.403,1867.854,Yes.
1989.88-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1867.854,1874.228,"Mr. Arnoff, Rule 56 of course deals with summary judgments."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1898.562,1899.593,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.593,1905.934,"Well, why wouldn't partnership principles apply there, the way the Second Circuit saw to apply them in this case?"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1905.934,1926.862,"Your Honor, I think there is a material difference between shifting the reasonable litigation expenses caused by abusive litigation practices and holding a law firm... a lawyer in contempt and then holding the rest of his law firm vicariously in contempt."
1989.88-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1955.585,1965.066,"Well, what if the district court in a Rule 56 summary judgment action says I hold you in contempt and fine you $1,000, and I fine the law firm $<one thousand> [= 1,000], too."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1966.972,1970.767,I don't believe so.
1989.88-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1970.767,1973.109,Why is that different from this case?
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,1973.109,1985.761,"Because we are specifically focused on the reasonable litigation expenses, one of the range of circumstances, one of the range of sanctions... contemplated by Rule 11."
1989.88-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1985.761,2002.785,"What if the district court in the Rule 56(g) proceedings said I, I find these, these... delaying tactics have incurred $1,000 of attorneys fees unwarranted for the other side, and so I am fining... I'm fining you $1,000 and holding you in contempt."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2002.785,2011.953,"Well, does, does the funds go into the court or to the Treasury, or does it... is it shifted from the... one litigant to another?"
1989.88-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.953,2015.841,"No, it is not shifted from one litigant to another in my hypothesis."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2015.841,2024.198,"Well, I think due process considerations would apply, and the due process, the format of due process is suited for the particular case."
1989.88-791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2296.073,2304.601,Do you say it is mandatory that the court impose the fine on the law... law firm?
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2304.601,2305.445,No.
1989.88-791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2309.131,2313.144,"Well, but the rule is phrased in mandatory language."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2313.144,2315.003,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2315.003,2317.158,"What, what is there in the rule that gives discretion?"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2317.158,2321.485,It is mandatory once a violation is found that a sanction be imposed.
1989.88-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2347.819,2364.748,"Mr. Arnoff, is it your contention that Judge Sweet in the district court fixed the amount of these sanctions in terms of attorneys' fees that the conduct had caused other parties to occur?"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2364.748,2366.076,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.197,2419.461,May I ask you a factual question?
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2431.065,2438.032,"The partnership, Justice Stevens, was formed in October 1984."
1989.88-791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.162,2481.747,"So are you... are you in effect arguing that maybe the rule required an individual's signature, but in fact the person who signed the pleadings, in this case, the person was the firm, signing by the individual partner, and therefore, the language of the rule reads on... the discipline can be imposed on the person who signs the pleadings, and that is the partnership."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2481.747,2481.903,Yes.
1989.88-791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.903,2484.543,Even though it didn't... the partnership didn't have to do it that way.
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2484.543,2484.855,"Well, I--"
1989.88-791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2484.855,2488.401,"You know, it seems to me there are two different arguments you might make."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2507.253,2516.781,"--Justice Stevens, we are arguing here that the firm explicitly signed by the appearance of the signature, Pavelic & LeFlore by Ray LeFlore."
1989.88-791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.383,2548.361,"Well, I understand that, but that's a harder argument to make in the terms of the language of the rule than the other argument when you say, in fact, the person who signed... because the court upon motion shall impose upon the person who signed it sanctions."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2559.466,2569.681,"Justice Stevens, I know of no way that a legal entity, a corporation or a partnership can sign a document other than through an agent."
1989.88-791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.803,2574.897,"Well, that is true, but it doesn't mean that--"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2574.897,2580.177,"--the person who signed, would mean a legal person as well as a natural person, a human being."
1989.88-791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.177,2587.143,--But that might not be true if they hadn't said Pavelic and whatever it was by so and so.
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2588.267,2593.219,"We, we, we would argue in support of both propositions."
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.356,2608.789,"Excuse me, you know, elsewhere the rule reads the signature of an attorney or party."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2630.312,2641.261,"--Justice Scalia, later on in the language of the rule, and I believe that portion that deals with the imposition of sanctions, the specific terminology is the person who signed."
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2641.261,2646.759,"--Well, that is so, but I am talking about the rule as a whole seems to be focusing on an individual attorney."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2646.759,2654.74,We would also argue that this rule should be interpreted in the light and consistent with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 1.
1989.88-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2665.782,2668.578,This certainly wasn't inexpensive for the partnership.
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2668.578,2700.456,"No, but it was... and it certainly wasn't inexpensive for the Defendants in this case, and particularly, my client who was a lawyer of good standing who was accused of forging a document and who went through four years of, of, of litigation, in respect to... and not only was his name involved but also his potential... economic liability."
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.073,2955.9,Why is that?
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2971.724,2972.285,True.
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.285,2977.876,"So why should you... why should you come out any differently for the partnership, if the partnership is covered by the rule?"
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2977.876,2980.829,You should come out differently for the partnership.
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2980.829,2981.266,Why?
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,2981.266,2984.67,"Because the, the prime purpose of the rule is deterrence."
1989.88-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.225,3017.346,"Although it wouldn't relieve the individual, even if he came forward and showed I had a monitoring system, I had the investigators who did all this check it out, my secretaries checked it out, it really wasn't my fault."
1989.88-791,1,36995,norman_b_arnoff,,3029.513,3051.379,"Justice Scalia, if, if the individual lawyer could show that he conducted a pre-filing inquiry, that a reasonably competent lawyer could conclude the bonafides of the legal claim, he would be able to exonerate himself from the... imposition of a Rule 11 finding."
1989.88-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3251.955,3253.953,"Mr. Arnoff, your time has expired."
1989.88-791,2,31374,jacob_laufer,,3256.03,3256.436,Thank you.
1989.88-791,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3259.013,3259.951,"Very well, speak it."
1989.88-791,2,31374,jacob_laufer,,3259.951,3271.915,"The argument that Respondents are making is an argument for a different Rule 11, for the wisdom of a different Rule 11, and I submit that we must deal with the rule as it now exists, as it has been promulgated."
1989.88-791,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3273.587,3273.884,Thank you.
