1965.545,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,6.197,-- et al.
1965.545,0,42638,thomas_f_daly,,7.906,12.296,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,2995.173,2995.958,Mr. Chief Justice.
1965.545,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2995.958,2996.494,Yes.
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,2996.494,2999.503,May it please the Court.
1965.545,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3027.517,3032.895,What New York said that the distiller didn't sell to the wholesaler but directly to the retailer?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3032.895,3045.381,"If the distiller sells to the retailer, he would then be called a wholesaler for the purpose of this statute and then he could not sell any for any higher price than a wholesaler in another state is selling to retailers."
1965.545,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3057.3,3061.276,Does it define the distiller in that situation as a wholesaler?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3061.689,3061.694,It --
1965.545,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3061.694,3062.191,-- so define.
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3062.191,3065.767,It talks in terms of sales to retailers.
1965.545,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3106.037,3112.325,Does New York law prohibit the ownership of retailers by distillers?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3112.325,3113.095,"Yes, sir."
1965.545,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3113.095,3116.338,Or by the ownership of retailers by wholesalers?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3116.338,3117.762,"Yes, sir."
1965.545,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3126.427,3131.922,"And if he sells directly (Inaudible) -- sells directly, he's covered by the Act?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3131.922,3132.724,He certainly is.
1965.545,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3207.116,3209.801,And what's the provision of the Constitution that violate?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3209.801,3214.116,We feel that this is in violation of Article 14.
1965.545,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3214.116,3215.16,"Well, which?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3215.16,3216.298,Due process.
1965.545,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3216.298,3217.144,Due process?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3217.144,3217.953,"Yes, sir."
1965.545,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3217.953,3223.116,"You mean, we're getting back now to the 1930s again and before application of due process?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3223.116,3226.978,"Well, we feel this, Your Honor, that --"
1965.545,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3226.978,3228.928,I thought that fight was over.
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3228.928,3256.136,"We feel that -- while this Court has given the states great power in terms of fixing prices in many industries, and they're all cited in the appellee's briefs, whether it's tobacco commissions or whether it's insurance or whether it's the theater tickets that came up, at least in those cases you had the legislature sit down and either itself or through an administrative agency, fix the price."
1965.545,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3256.136,3258.976,You would -- so you would concede the state could do that here?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3258.976,3260.096,I would say that the legislation --
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3260.096,3276.403,Even though the legis -- even though the Commission (Inaudible) -- if the Commission was empowered to investigate the prices at which liquor was sold around the country and was directed to set the price for the forthcoming month at the lowest price it found around the country that -- would you say that was alright or no?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3276.403,3283.192,"I would say that -- if it said that it automatically had to follow the lowest price around the country, that that would be in invalid."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3283.192,3285.082,"Would be valid, do you say that?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3285.082,3291.796,"If we said that it had to be reasonable, if we said that it had to -- it could take it into consideration, yes."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3314.843,3320.166,"So, you don't rest on any -- on the Supremacy Clause or conflicts (Inaudible) of that by the Sherman Act?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3320.166,3325.195,"I think that -- yes, those are -- the -- those are basically the problems of the distiller."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.45,3333.83,"Oh, I know but (Inaudible) -- from the standpoint of the wholesalers, you don't rest on this other --"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3333.83,3340.779,"No, the wholesaler doing business strictly in New York, I don't think has a commerce question involved here at all."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.982,3344.559,But are -- these all -- these local wholesalers?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3344.559,3346.235,Most of the wholesalers here are local.
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3423.397,3427.896,"Mr. Goodman, I gather, the Moreland Commission didn't recommend this law."
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3431.422,3445.667,"During the time that the Moreland Commission was investigating and recommending, the Minority Leader of the Senate, and it's in the record, proposed a Bill which would have limited the law only with respect to the distiller level to the wholesaler."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.916,3470.042,"Somebody -- usually, laws like these have some interest in mind or some purposes to be affected."
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3478.67,3478.91,What --
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3478.91,3482.263,-- you lose by it but who gains?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3482.263,3506.611,"I suppose that there is an underlying assumption that if you depress the price at the top from the distiller to the wholesaler, and if you depress the price from the wholesaler to the retailer, then somehow it might seep through to the consumer, although, before the lunch recess, it was brought out that the Feld-Crawford Act which still permits the distiller to fix the price at which the retailer sells to the consumer --"
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.611,3507.029,(Inaudible)
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3507.029,3507.955,-- is still in effect.
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3507.955,3512.663,Can he fix the price -- the price at which it's sold?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3515.135,3517.022,He can fix the price I think under New York law.
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3517.022,3519.159,Is just one price?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3522.357,3524.472,He can fix the price or he can set --
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.472,3525.835,That's it?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3525.835,3531.766,"Or he can -- usually, it's been a minimum but he could actually set the Act -- our Feld-Crawford law sets the price."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.766,3539.316,"So you said -- so, I gather from what you say that this is the consumer interest which was promoting this law."
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3539.316,3554.551,"That may have been the reason why the theory was that if you depressed it at the top and at the second level, it may seep through even though the control at the level from retailer to consumer was still maintained in the distiller under Feld-Crawford, which the Court of Appeals said is still in effect."
1965.545,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3554.551,3554.584,Is that an --
1965.545,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3554.584,3555.101,Mr. Goodman --
1965.545,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3555.101,3557.6,-- unreasonable assumption?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3557.6,3560.41,I don't think it's an unreasonable assumption.
1965.545,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3560.41,3564.665,"Mr. Goodman, what happens to private brand liquors?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3564.665,3565.97,Not covered.
1965.545,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3565.97,3582.223,"In other words -- I -- suppose a retailer has a private brand, owns a private brand, then none of these provisions of Section 9 apply?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3582.223,3584.3,None of them are applicable.
1965.545,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3584.3,3589.202,"Well, that excludes quite a lot of the business, doesn't it?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3589.202,3590.857,It's growing.
1965.545,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3590.857,3595.405,Do you have any idea what percentage it is in New York State?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3595.405,3600.96,I would say that it may be as much as 20% private legal business in New York State.
1965.545,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3600.96,3623.486,"So that, a distiller can sell private label whisky, let's say, to a wholesaler and a wholesaler can sell private label whisky to a retailer without reference to prices that are charged elsewhere for the same quality."
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3623.486,3630.02,"The private label business in how it operates in many ways, it may not come through a conventional wholesaler."
1965.545,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3643.411,3662.19,"Well, then I would infer from what you've said that possibly one of the purposes of this arrangement in Section 9 is to help the smaller retailer in his sales of branded whisky or (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3662.19,3673.598,"This was always the purpose of 101 (b) to which these amendments were appended and it is still, to a certain extent, I suppose basic in the Feld-Crawford."
1965.545,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3695.111,3696.978,Let me put it this way.
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3735.641,3745.328,I don't think that the question of the competition with the private brand was ever suggested in any of the legislative history of limiting the maximum price.
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3745.328,3752.198,"Oh, I must say then, what was then -- what does appear in the legislative history as to what prompted this bill?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3755.082,3756.646,If I can sum up the legislative history --
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3756.646,3759.016,"You could -- can they -- who introduced it, but I have no idea what --"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3759.016,3763.256,"If I can sum up the legislative history, I can say this."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3828.289,3834.624,"Well, if they intend to -- Feld-Crawford however would permit the --"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3834.624,3849.551,"They specifically said, Your Honor, in their recommendation and the Governor said it in the message to the legislature at the special session that we are still going to leave you with the Feld-Crawford law and in the vernacular knock your brains out in trying to enforce the minimum consumer."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3849.551,3851.63,Is there a non-signing provision in the Feld-Crawford --
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3851.63,3854.601,There is.
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3879.554,3883.753,"Feld-Crawford -- the Feld-Crawford relates only to retail prices to consumers, is that the --"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3883.753,3884.819,That's all.
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3884.819,3889.177,So that there's no inherent -- inconsistency between these two Acts at all.
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3889.177,3890.959,"No, (Inaudible) --"
1965.545,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3890.959,3894.608,"You said conglomerate, you mean confusing?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3894.608,3897.971,"When I say conglomerate, there were so many other sections in the statute."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3913.895,3915.446,What are the sanctions in this law?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3918.851,3919.453,Both.
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3928.19,3928.44,Let's assume --
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3928.44,3930.392,But actually what it means is you can't sell.
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3930.392,3938.911,"Let's assume you lost the -- you've lost this case to the extent -- I'm just saying that we can't decide it here, isn't right or something like that?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3941.425,3949.843,"I think that was the question that Mr. Justice Fortas suggested, whether or not this is a premature matter and from our view it's not premature."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3969.138,3980.968,"Yes, but what if the Court disagreed with you on your due process argument and we really wanted to look into the conflict -- problems of conflict of Robinson-Patman and Sherman Act?"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3993.959,3994.179,Well --
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3994.179,3995.91,-- from the impact under the Act.
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,3995.91,4006.999,"I would like Mr. Daly to have a few minutes to talk about Robinson-Patman Act but basically, his argument is that New York is saying that you can't do things that the federal statute says you can."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4087.22,4087.535,"Well, what about the --"
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,4087.535,4089.72,-- let the legislature try another way.
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4089.72,4099.977,What if the state said -- passed a law that said all the distillers must get together and all agree upon the price and sell only at the agreed upon price?
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,4105.042,4107.285,"Off hand, I would say yes."
1965.545,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4109.917,4113.136,Not withstanding the Twenty-first Amendment.
1965.545,1,30580,jack_goodman,,4113.136,4143.549,"Oh, I think that -- my feelings about the Twenty-first Amendment is they're -- that they're to take off the restrictions in connection with goods coming in and out of the state, but the Frankfort case, I think the -- this Court has said that the Sherman Act in the -- is still in existence and I think it said it in the Schwegmann case that the antitrust laws are still in effect and the state laws can't go haywire with respect to antitrust."
1965.545,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4143.549,4147.349,"Mr. Daly, you may now have your five minutes if you wish."
1965.545,2,42638,thomas_f_daly,,4148.81,4149.706,"In rebuttal, yes Your Honor."
1965.545,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4149.706,4150.551,"-- for rebuttal, yes."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4159.703,4163.228,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4449.052,4459.018,Is there evidence that the distillers were discriminating against New York?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4459.018,4473.024,"There is evidence, may it please in Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, and the Court, there was evidence that the price that the retailer paid in New York."
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4481.861,4483.886,"Yes, but that wasn't what I asked."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4490.436,4491.343,Right.
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4491.343,4495.555,"Now, the big fellows, I suppose, the biggest of all would be the distillers."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4495.555,4496.355,Yes.
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4496.355,4522.706,"Now, is there any evidence that or did do it, that they go into this because the distillers were discriminating against New York in the prices that they charged them as compared with other states or did this extra cost to the consumers in New York depend on something that was in the State of New York?"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4522.706,4524.684,The prices to the retails --
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4524.684,4525.955,The what?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4525.955,4532.213,The prices to the retailers by the wholesalers were known to be higher.
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4532.213,4534.769,"Yes, but I'm asking about the distillers."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4539.201,4541.425,Hold -- against New York wholesalers?
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4541.425,4542.381,Yes.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4542.381,4545.732,"That, I cannot say, Mr. Chief Justice."
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4565.884,4566.899,"Well, whose fault was that?"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4568.646,4582.898,"Well, now we have to accept the -- that they're not legislating the abstract and we have to accept what is known in the industry and which is not denied."
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4698.261,4702.573,"Well, the thing that concerns me is this."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4739.449,4745.138,"Well, when I say I -- I'm not willing to say “yes, there was” because I would have to check that."
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4789.534,4790.821,"Well, I could see that --"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4790.821,4791.125,Well --

1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4792.384,4792.86,Yes.
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4792.86,4796.137,-- if they were charging -- if the distillers were charging --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4796.137,4796.224,Well --
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4796.224,4797.871,-- the wholesalers more than they did in other states.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4797.871,4809.382,"Well, may I please, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that in any legislation the legislation has to spell out, we have --"
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4809.382,4809.794,No.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4809.794,4820.38,"-- found buts and so, we have to assume that they had knowledge, individual knowledge, pooled knowledge, and the case having said so."
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4820.38,4823.15,But the only reason I asked the question was because --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4823.15,4823.686,Yes.
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4823.686,4824.708,-- you said --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4824.708,4825.311,Yes.
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4825.311,4835.856,"-- as I recall it, that the legislative -- the legislature determined that the only way they could solve this problem was to get at the big fellows."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,4838.231,4860.44,"Well, the legislature, we have to (Inaudible) -- we have to assume that the legislature came to the conclusion from things people told them, from things they had read, from things they had heard from the retailers telling them and there is at least one bit of testimony that I did quote in the brief."
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5075.504,5086.589,Do you agree that Section 9 (f) would apply in the case of direct sales from a distiller to retailer?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5086.589,5087.709,"Do I -- yes, yes."
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5087.709,5088.599,You do?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5088.599,5089.528,Yes.
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5089.528,5090.942,The distiller in that instance is the wholesaler --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5090.942,5091.399,Yes.
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5091.399,5092.022,-- for the purpose of that.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5092.022,5093.506,"Yes, yes."
1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5148.655,5153.488,"It wouldn't be -- according to the argument at least, it wouldn't be the distillers that did it."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5172.405,5174.043,"Mr. Justice Stewart, no."
1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5180.512,5181.469,It's not the only one but it is --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5181.469,5182.679,Elsewhere.
1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5182.679,5189.77,"Yes, but there are -- surely, there are many areas where the cost of selling are much, much lower."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5196.87,5217.769,"I -- now, there's another answer to that, Mr. Justice Stewart, and that is, in New York as well as in any large state, the price -- the cost of operation is cheaper in one part of the state than the other, rents are cheaper and some aren't."
1965.545,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5469.269,5480.218,"Is it -- does the distiller know prices at which retailers sell for a country, a branded product?"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5480.218,5483.275,"Mr. Justice Fortas, I would certainly suspect so."
1965.545,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5483.275,5487.179,Is there anything in the record in that effect?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5487.179,5492.309,I think that there is some testimony to that effect.
1965.545,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5529.701,5529.883,"Well, I --"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5529.883,5532.405,-- who go around the country watching their prices.
1965.545,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5532.405,5546.877,"Well, I guess we're all familiar with that but that's another step from that to burdening a distiller with criminal responsibility or a wholesaler with criminal responsibility."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5546.877,5548.215,"Well, it --"
1965.545,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5548.215,5550.976,In the event that he -- that there are some sales in which he's (Voice Overlap) --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5550.976,5553.857,He doesn't have to know the retail price --
1965.545,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5553.857,5553.909,I know that.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5553.909,5555.241,-- for this statute.
1965.545,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5556.777,5557.078,Yes.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5557.078,5558.644,No question.
1965.545,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5559.192,5559.916,The third point --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5559.916,5561.453,-- of his -- sorry?
1965.545,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5561.453,5562.741,I said the third point is the --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5562.741,5563.119,Alright.
1965.545,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5620.793,5626.412,"I understand that, but I still -- still troubled by the question I asked you."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5649.485,5672.845,"The -- I think the way it is, is the wholesaler is not -- in other words, there're just certain wholesalers who are bound by this, and that is the ones who have an exclusive franchise or an interlocking director or are ahead, do a substantial part of their business."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5734.875,5735.304,"Yes, but the wholesaler --"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5735.304,5736.301,Maybe they have the maverick.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5736.301,5736.864,Excuse me.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5737.182,5737.561,Sorry.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5737.561,5742.11,-- doesn't need to give this information to the distiller legally.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5742.432,5746.482,"The wholesaler may not but practically, he certainly does."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5746.482,5749.765,"Well, I know but Mr. Justice Fortas is asking about the criminal penalty side."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5765.468,5774.017,"I -- and, number one, they -- for any criminal prosecution, there obviously has to be a criminal intent."
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5815.563,5820.64,"But it's not only the wholesaler, it's also the so-called related person, isn't it?"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5820.64,5826.015,"Well, it -- that is only the wholesaler who has -- does a substantial part --"
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5826.015,5833.295,"Well, how does the distiller know about this prices charged by the related person?Where does he get that information?"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5833.295,5839.874,"He -- as a practical matter, he knows it in advance and in -- and it's in --"
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5839.874,5845.658,"So, I gather, with the wholesaler being -- obviously has the records -- relationships."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5845.658,5846.431,That's it.
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5846.431,5848.367,But does he with the related person?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5848.367,5851.559,"Well, the related person is the wholesaler."
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5851.559,5852.334,You mean that's --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5852.334,5852.791,Related person --
1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5852.791,5853.985,-- (Inaudible) anonymous in respect to --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5853.985,5854.968,Yes.
1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5854.968,5855.748,But not exactly.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5858.824,5859.543,Right.
1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5859.543,5860.228,Is that it?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5860.228,5860.713,Yes.
1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5860.713,5860.861,Yes.

1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5861.204,5862.691,Not to all wholesalers.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5862.691,5862.841,What I --
1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5862.841,5865.331,"It's only such wholesalers who fit the definition of related persons, I believe."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5865.331,5873.278,Who fits that definition and the reason they put that in is because they knew they might as well not write the law if they --
1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5873.278,5873.726,Right.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5873.726,5876.02,-- did not do it that way.
1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5876.02,5876.427,Alright.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5876.427,5884.279,"Because the distiller -- Justice said here, he's -- have quoted it and said, “go peddle your papers,” and the wholesaler would've been."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5915.675,5935.043,"Well, why isn't it the -- why isn't it the -- why isn't the other side correct in saying that just this -- this absolutely forces the distiller to enter into an arrangement with all related persons as to what prices the wholesalers can resell their products because otherwise, there's a -- the scheme just couldn't work."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5948.855,5949.24,Mr. Justice --
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5949.24,5950.755,-- all agree.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5950.755,5952.939,"Mr. Justice White, they do it now."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5952.939,5954.718,"Well, I know, but that's what you say they're going to do."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5956.442,5957.69,"No, no."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5971.146,5971.507,"Yes, but I suggest they're just not going to sit back --"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5971.507,5973.29,-- of the month that they'll make the affirmation.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5973.29,5974.526,-- and wait for information.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5989.92,5993.866,That is only if they're going to insist on keeping their prices up in New York.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5993.866,5995.131,I don't get it.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,5997.132,5998.33,"Well, that's their doing."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5998.33,6000.196,They're going to have to do --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6000.196,6001.228,That is their doing.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6004.421,6004.708,"So, you're saying --"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6004.708,6005.783,-- in New York State --
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6005.783,6015.54,"You're saying that if the necessary result of your law is for them to enter into an arrangement in violation of the Sherman Act, that's their tough luck."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6015.54,6029.742,"That's their tough luck and they're doing it (Inaudible) to defeat the purpose of this law, to defeat it, because what New York wants is not for them to raise the prices outside so as to keep the prices up in New York."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6085.634,6087.096,Let me ask you another one.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6106.967,6108.724,Of course not.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6108.724,6117.03,"But that, I suppose, as regarding a competing distiller would be a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, wouldn't it?"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6117.03,6119.732,"Yes, why wouldn't it?"
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6119.732,6123.192,"Well, primary lined competition though."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6123.192,6125.687,"No, I don't think so."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6154.037,6160.933,"So, you don't -- do you think economically that the result is going to be a leveled price across the country or not?"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6160.933,6163.77,"No, I don't because -- I say, I think that what's happened in the 17 --"
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6163.77,6164.709,I'm not suggesting there's anything wrong with that.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6164.709,6166.675,-- monopoly states -- sorry Mr. Justice.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6166.675,6168.368,I'm not suggesting there's anything wrong with that.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6171.13,6177.775,"Well, I am not in on the conclaves of the industry so I don't know --"
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6177.775,6178.978,Yes.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6178.978,6181.489,-- if they're going to operate that way.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6370.992,6371.876,Excuse me.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6371.876,6372.303,Sir?
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6372.303,6382.585,What is your thought on the core of what the legislative history shows on what interests were promoting this law or you -- I know you --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6382.585,6385.855,I would suspect it was the retailers.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6385.855,6389.822,Although it -- you say it was aimed at certainly protecting consumers.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6389.822,6390.227,Yes.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6390.227,6397.427,Do you think that gives -- if the retailers were really interested in this to -- in order to get branded products cheaper?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6397.427,6401.126,I think it was the combination of two things.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6468.113,6479.217,"In your state, are retail licenses restricted in the sense of one license to one person or may a person have several outlets?"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6479.217,6482.871,I believe that a retailer has only retail license.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6485.241,6486.202,Only and the corp --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6486.202,6487.156,I think --
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6487.156,6492.816,"A partnership or a corporation can't have the whole string, the whole chain of retail liquor establishments."

1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6494.748,6495.114,And so it's an individual --

1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6496.304,6496.552,-- property.

1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6508.563,6511.25,-- would be willing to vouch for it.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6511.25,6513.293,"Macy sell liquor -- If they sell liquor at all, they just sell at that one price."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6513.293,6518.751,"I think it's another corporation that sells that if they do have others, I think so."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6529.57,6530.052,Liquors.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6530.052,6537.757,"-- liquor as there are where drug stores, I guess, and groceries can sell them we think in New York."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6564.663,6573.091,Are most of the distillers that are affected out of -- they actually do their distilling operations outside of New York?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6573.091,6574.502,"Yes, yes."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6574.502,6578.462,And they are foreign corporations as far as New York is concerned.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6578.462,6579.862,They have a right to do business and they have --
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6579.862,6580.054,Yes.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6580.054,6581.387,-- to be licensed to do business in New York--
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6581.387,6582.163,"Oh, yes, I know they're (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6582.163,6590.325,"Or through an agent, but this law affects only those who do business outside the state."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6590.325,6593.684,And New York is what percentage in the national market?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6593.684,6594.853,12%.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6594.853,6596.61,12%.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6596.61,6607.352,"12%, this -- I don't -- I'm no expert on economics, but it certainly seems to me that where you do a lot more business, you would be selling for less."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6618.903,6625.86,Does this record support your claim that New York was the higher priced market in -- higher cost market in terms of the --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6625.86,6649.45,"Well, (Inaudible) -- well, they do say that their price cost of operation is higher in New York and I'm sure that it is higher in California and higher in a lot of other states than, say, it is in Nebraska, but at the -- that is what happens when you have a nationwide operation."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6649.662,6650.002,Well --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6650.002,6650.427,-- as I have said --
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6650.427,6650.877,What (Voice Overlap) --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6650.877,6651.668,-- their price (Voice Overlap) --
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6651.668,6665.97,"That may be what happened, but if you concede that cost could easily be lower in Nebraska than in New York, what's very reasonable about New York saying that people doing business in New York must sell at the same price as they sell in Nebraska?"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6665.97,6687.094,"Because, I believe that it was found that, as far as the cost of -- as far as liquor prices are concerned, they are not so much tied in with the price -- cost of operation as they are with keeping a level -- with the prices for a brand."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6689.927,6690.314,Do you mean --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6690.314,6698.509,But I wouldn't suspect that Washington is a very low -- has a very living cost.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6726.492,6729.915,But they are going to have to get their cost back somewhere aren't they?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6729.915,6740.333,"Oh, I think they will but, beyond that, I don't think that is -- I respectfully submit the concern of the Court."
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6745.04,6763.194,"What is the concern of the -- to the Court, at least to where the argument is made by -- you're -- rather in our position is, that New York simply hasn't got the power to pass legislation that would result in raising the prices to consumers in Nebraska."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6763.194,6765.401,But the New York law doesn't help --
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6765.401,6778.812,"And the argument is made that because of the economic facts of life, that is precisely what would happen and then what -- that this New York legislation is going to result in raising prices to consumers in South Dakota, Nebraska, and what have you."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6778.812,6779.006,It --
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6779.006,6781.102,"And then, New York is without any such power."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6781.102,6783.353,"It hasn't yet, has it?"
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6783.353,6783.611,It was --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6783.611,6785.509,It hasn't yet.
1965.545,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6785.509,6786.02,"Well, it hasn't (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6786.02,6789.464,And I don't think we have to determine -- I'm sorry?
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6789.464,6791.316,"Well, the law hasn't done anything yet because the wholesaler --"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6791.316,6791.46,That's right.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6791.46,6792.65,-- has never been enforced yet.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6792.65,6812.184,That is correct and I don't think that we have a right to assume or even to accord them the right to find a way to defeat the purpose of this law by raising the price elsewhere --
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6812.184,6812.831,Do you think the --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6812.831,6814.7,-- which is exactly what they're going to do.
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6814.7,6817.998,Do you think this litigation is premature?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6817.998,6819.701,"Yes, I -- yes I do."
1965.545,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6882.443,6890.989,I heard some suggestions that the Act might be bad as confiscatory.I assume that there can be no doubt that it would be premature.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6892.335,6892.617,"Oh, assured --"
1965.545,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6892.617,6895.329,-- (Inaudible) this time it would be confiscatory.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6895.329,6896.005,Assuredly.
1965.545,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6896.005,6898.426,They don't know what it would be it -- in one month.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6904.45,6910.602,Right.
1965.545,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6927.606,6928.61,You don't think what?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6928.61,6930.804,They're going to go out of business.
1965.545,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6930.804,6932.284,(Inaudible)
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6932.284,6933.4,"I'm sorry, Justice Stewart?"

1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6938.544,6943.217,May I be permitted a witticism?
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6996.101,6997.128,Let me just ask you a hypothetical --
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,6997.128,6997.82,Yes.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6997.82,6997.984,-- question.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7020.823,7025.561,"Well, I turn to the Frankfort Distilleries case and the Frankfort --"
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7025.561,7027.938,This is a Twenty-first Amendment argument?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7027.938,7030.944,"Yes, yes, it is a Twenty-first Amendment."
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7032.619,7041.028,"Alright, aside -- aside from the Twenty-first Amendment, you wouldn't think New York could get away with that under the Sherman Act?"
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7041.382,7042.285,"Well, I wouldn't be willing --"
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7042.285,7057.402,Let's assume it wasn't liquor here that it was some other commodity that this applies to and the only way you could possibly comply with it was to violate the Sherman Act.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7057.402,7069.136,"If the Act would have to direct the conspiracy, I would like --"

1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7070.026,7071.418,-- to be excused for saying so.
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7071.418,7071.742,Yes.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7071.742,7072.261,I -- I'm now willing to say --
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7072.261,7074.535,But you rely on the Twenty-first Amendment anyway.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7074.535,7075.108,"What is it, Justice?"
1965.545,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7075.108,7077.385,Do you say the Twenty-First Amendment catches the (Inaudible)?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7077.385,7081.562,"I think the Twenty-first Amendment, yes."
1965.545,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7203.56,7208.014,When was (Inaudible) -- Twenty-first Amendment?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7224.295,7226.099,"I -- you -- Mr. Justice Black, I think --"
1965.545,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7226.099,7230.774,"I was just thinking maybe you had a better answer, at least the Sherman Act."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7230.774,7235.826,I think that's a -- it doesn't do it.
1965.545,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7239.241,7251.98,Do you think that they could get by without any reasonable field of having the sword of the Antitrust Act over them if they have made this on the ground that maybe it didn't compel them to conspire with somebody else to fix prices?
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7251.98,7253.976,"Yes, it would have to be."
1965.545,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7284.146,7301.305,"Well, you could -- you'd lose me on that argument if you're going to say that because the state passes a law of some kind which compels somebody to violate a federal law, we grew up to see whether it's reasonable."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7301.449,7302.682,"No, but isn't --"
1965.545,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7302.682,7326.326,"If you could conceive of circumstances under which your law is going to compel people, people engaged in the liquor business, to conspire with one another to fix prices, then I would say that you couldn't get out on the ground, well, it's reasonable (Inaudible) be compelled to do that because New York wants it done."
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7326.326,7328.468,"Now -- well, it doesn't compel them."
1965.545,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7328.982,7330.46,But that's what I'm talking about.
1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7330.46,7330.985,You want me to say whether --
1965.545,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7330.985,7331.469,It seems to me like (Voice Overlap) --

1965.545,3,40634,ruth_kessler_toch,,7342.047,7345.3,"Well, Mr. Justice Black, this is what I -- I've been trying to say all along."
1965.545,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7469.757,7471.206,Very well.
1965.545,4,42638,thomas_f_daly,,7474.394,7507.817,"If the Court please, on the question of prematurity I think that -- well, when this action was brought, the state was just implying -- making us file the affirmations and everybody who filed an affirmation took the risk that if the affirmation were false they might end up imprisoned for six months with a $10,000 fine and all the other consequences."
