1973.72-777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.514,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-1129, Cohen against Chesterfield County School Board."
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,13.394,16.845,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,204.424,210.152,It’s very typical is it not of Equal Protection Clause litigation?
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,238.87,242.112,It is not unusual Your Honor where it differs here.
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,242.112,252.137,"And indeed the law generally is that if any rational support can be found for the law, then it doesn’t violate the Equal Protection Clause."
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,254.8,258.414,Only if Your Honor -- only if the Court applies the rational basis test.
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,258.414,258.749,Right.
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,258.749,267.81,"The compelling interest test, as applied to this case, we submit it would never succeed, although we’d submit it won’t succeed on the rational basis test Your Honor."
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.108,305.393,"Well, those are found to be very widespread, does that evidence -- they are arbitrary or capricious?"
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,312.674,313.893,No sir I think not.
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.893,338.051,"If you found, for example, one exceptional school board in the whole country that had this kind of regulation, you’d have a pretty good case going in I should suppose that it’s arbitrary and capricious, but if you half of the school boards in the country with these sorts of regulations, I suppose the presumption going in would be that there must be some sort of rationality behind it?"
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,338.051,339.185,I would think not Your Honor.
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,430.303,433.802,And when is the noticed required in Chesterfield?
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,433.802,442.096,"Well, they require as soon as you know, but you can’t -- you must leave after the fifth months."
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,442.096,444.081,Yes but when must you give notice?
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,444.081,447.326,"I don’t have the precise date, I’ll get that Your Honor."
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,447.397,454.547,"Now you would think that would have a goody old ado, that would have a goody old bearing on the continuity argument, would it not?"
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,454.547,458.143,It would Your Honor and we don’t resist a notice.
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,471.706,473.296,And not just the day before?
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,473.296,474.415,"Oh yes sir, yes sir."
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.473,559.925,"And so that means two months notice, is that it?"
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,559.925,560.75,Yes sir.
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,560.75,561.45,Two months notice?
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,561.45,562.588,"Yes sir, at the end of the third --"
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,562.588,564.125,Two months prior to leaving.
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,564.125,572.149,"Yes sir, and we have no problem with when the notice is, they may say notice six months and notice eight months, that’s not the problem we have in this case."
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,580.954,584.535,Were there individual employment contracts in this case?
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,584.535,585.976,Yes sir.
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,585.976,589.961,Do the contracts have anything to say about this subject.
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,589.961,594.963,"The contracts have a clause, I don’t know, I tried to find, I don’t have the exact contract here, I am sorry Your Honor."
1973.72-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,616.021,628.098,"Well, you might have stipulated it but you didn’t and it might have something to do with the merits of this case whether or not this teacher agreed in advance that this would be a term and condition of her contract, do you know or don’t you?"
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,628.098,628.313,No.
1973.72-777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,771.344,791.346,Listen to the different matter when you are dealing with situation like this where as you suggest the terminal period is predictable and you have a predictable situation all the way through in terms of medical testimony.
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,806.948,807.215,Yes sir.
1973.72-777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,807.215,811.366,In terms of potential disability and limitation.
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,811.366,811.862,Yes Your Honor.
1973.72-777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,857.271,864.569,"Of course we don’t resolve the constitutional issue by taking a club beside or pool, do we?"
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,864.569,880.136,"No sir, and they amicus to the other side, but Mr. Chief Justice, we have to I think in this case that the Court has in this case decide is what this representing to us that this is really a continuity argument and all true, does it hold any water?"
1973.72-777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,928.448,938.665,"Well, is there a state -- the state action in this area to be influenced by whether their school teachers are in a buyers market or in sellers market?"
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,938.665,943.282,We’d submit that should not be Your Honor but their argument is buttress by the buyers and sellers --
1973.72-777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,943.282,951.097,"Five years ago or more or less teachers were almost impossible to come by, isn’t meant correct?"
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,951.097,952.18,"Yes sir, in certain fields especially --"
1973.72-777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,952.18,955.149,And now there maybe is somewhat of a surplus?
1973.72-777,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,955.149,966.429,"In fact in the all fields, but Your Honor, it’s their argument that I’m trying to get to that they believe you have to have the continuity because you might not have a teacher available later on."
1973.72-777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1063.759,1065.344,Mr Hixon.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1065.344,1067.834,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1149.979,1167.08,"Mr. Hixon, I could fully understand your continuity argument, if the Chesterfield County School Board had a rule that no teacher who anticipated being pregnant during that school year would be hired."
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1210.927,1211.505,Yes Your Honor.
1973.72-777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1224.502,1224.974,Right that --
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1224.974,1227.46,-- that there will be an interruption during the year.
1973.72-777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1227.46,1232.528,"Now, whether or not it could, at least your continuity argument would have great force in support of that sort of a regulation --"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1232.528,1233.135,That’s correct.
1973.72-777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1233.135,1234.779,-- which you were not faced with here.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1234.779,1242.346,But this regulation has an advantage Your Honor and that it requires only one affirmative act on the part of the teacher.
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1515.848,1530.379,"Under the School Board’s rule, after pregnancy, does the teacher have any preference for rehiring over any other applicant for any existing vacancy?"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1530.379,1540.037,"Yes she does, she will be guaranteed reemployment not later than beginning of the next year from the period of time that she is placed on maternity leave."
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.149,1548.034,Or you mean when -- at the beginning of the next school year after she’s declared eligible for reemployment.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1548.034,1549.283,Not later than that date.
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1561.113,1567.261,But she doesn’t but she’s only guaranteed reemployment as of the date of beginning of the next term?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1567.261,1569.186,"Yes sir, not later than that date."
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.186,1570.834,"Or year, school year?"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1570.834,1575.565,It’s the beginning of the next school year Your Honor.
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.758,1589.002,But she doesn’t approve that seniority once she is on leave I take it?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1589.002,1594.299,"No sir, she doesn’t, she would only accrue seniority for the period of time when she’s actually completed."
1973.72-777,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1772.245,1773.414,Mr. Hixon.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1773.414,1774.79,Yes Your Honor.
1973.72-777,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1774.79,1775.912,May I ask you this question?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1780.7,1781.562,That is correct.
1973.72-777,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1781.562,1787.019,Of whom 80% approximately are women.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1797.322,1799.778,"No, the record does not show that Your Honor."
1973.72-777,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1822.265,1831.588,"Does the record show for a full school year, for example, how many -- how many teachers were on maternity leave?"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1831.588,1836.054,"No sir, the record does not show."
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1874.185,1880.061,How many times does a person having test for allergies visit a physician?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1880.061,1881.261,I am sorry sir I didn’t understand.
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1881.261,1889.767,How many times does a person having tests for allergies visit his or her physician?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1889.767,1895.378,"Well sir, of course the record in this case won’t reflect that."
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1898.795,1902.302,"How about going to the doctor, you have mentioned that 3 times."
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1902.302,1903.588,"Yes sir, but the difference --"
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.588,1908.179,"You don’t have to go a doctor during the school period, do you?"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1913.714,1925.777,"Well sir, the record shows clearly in this case that doctor who testified here that his normal hours that he would accept patients would be between hours of 9 and 4 O’clock in the afternoon."
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.777,1930.802,Are there any doctors in Chesterfield County that have night hours.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1930.802,1933.824,I’d have no idea to answer to that Your Honor.
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1939.468,1944.034,"I know also know some doctors who don’t work for two days a week too, but I’m just thinking."
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1948.779,1949.47,"Well sir, I put --"
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1949.47,1950.518,-- regularly.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1950.518,1960.182,I put that emphasis only because it points out clearly that there is a likelihood during the last three months that a woman will be absent because of her --
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1960.182,1962.72,Are the last three months before us?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1962.72,1963.656,Yes sir.
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1963.656,1965.032,I thought it was more than three months.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1965.032,1979.04,"Well, I’m talking -- it’s in the last four months you are correct, but I use generally because the doctor seems to break it up into trimester, the first, second and third and their testimony relates only to the last trimester."
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.442,1985.772,It could be.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1985.772,1989.583,"It could be, but here we’re dealing with a question of whether or not one is grateful --"
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1989.583,1996.514,And it could be that a man could be just as unstable on his feet as a pregnant woman?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,1996.514,1996.669,That could be.
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1996.669,2001.49,And it could be that a man is just as fat as a pregnant woman.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2001.49,2001.962,Yes Your Honor.
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.962,2005.888,And it could be that a man can’t stand being pushed around in the hall.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2005.888,2011.911,"But let me point out here, we are dealing here with the problem that exist in the Chesterfield County School Board."
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2047.061,2049.525,I thought we were talking about the rational basis?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2051.13,2053.065,"Yes sir, and that’s what I have tried to --"
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.065,2064.302,"Is it rational that if 80% of pregnant women do such and such a thing, that the other 20% should be punished?"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2064.302,2065.193,"Well, I don’t see the --"
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2065.193,2068.483,"Sir, is that right?"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2068.483,2071.186,I’m sorry but I don’t understand the question.
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2071.186,2080.706,You say that normally pregnant women do this and this. Does this record show that there are some pregnant women who do not?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2080.706,2092.266,"Well, I think the school board can very clearly regulate and direct its regulations to a condition of potential import in the condition of potential disruption."
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2118.127,2127.687,Also the record shows that 80% of the male teachers in Chesterfield County are “unstable on their feet.”
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2139.106,2151.128,"I would say under those circumstances, if you could relate the condition of a man’s instability with his ability to teach which is a question in and of itself, if you could relate that matter --"
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.128,2151.505,"Well, is it?"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2151.505,2159.725,I believe that a regulation directed towards that condition and to the facts that you have given me would be a rational and reasonable regulation.
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2159.725,2163.693,All men should be denied employment.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2164.476,2166.558,"Well, of course here again --"
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2166.558,2176.031,"I have got 80% and a 100%, you said because the 80% are unstable, then you could adopt the resolution that no men could be hired."
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2176.031,2176.836,"Yes, well --"
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2176.836,2179.775,Because 80% are unstable.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2179.775,2197.033,"Well, I would say that if you could show that the instability that you are here -- that you are talking about here would have a direct effect on the ability of teachers, particularly men teachers in the school system, you could have a regulation directed towards that but we don’t have that here Your Honor."
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2197.033,2197.284,I know we don’t.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2197.284,2205.112,"We have got a condition here where a 100% of the people affected by the rule are in fact pregnant and we do know one thing, that they are going to --"
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2205.112,2209.161,But are the 100% unable to teach?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2209.161,2211.996,A 100% are not unable to teach.
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2211.996,2213.67,"Well, that’s my point."
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2213.67,2214.155,That’s correct.
1973.72-777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2214.155,2216.553,And you don’t see any problem with that?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2216.553,2231.872,"No sir, because I think that the rule here can be clearly justified on the basis that it accomplishes continuity in the educational process by having an orderly procedure for replacement of teachers who become pregnant."
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.034,2261.787,"Yes, but why do you want to -- why do you want to plan for continuity at a certain predict -- why don’t you wait until two weeks before pregnancy?"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2261.787,2263.858,"Well sir, I think that --"
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.858,2271.173,"I mean you could point out -- you could have continuity whenever, whatever the definite cut off date was?"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2271.173,2272.373,There is no question about that.
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.373,2275.18,So why do you pick five months or four months?
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2275.18,2281.552,"Well, there is one advantage to picking five months and that the elasticity provision, the additional four months."
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.834,2330.773,But you’re now -- you’re dealing with a teacher who doesn’t look at it that way.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2330.773,2333.116,"Yes sir, that’s correct."
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.262,2353.269,"Well, there wouldn’t be any disruption if you planned to have a substitute teacher come in and take over a month before."
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2353.269,2358.037,"Well, that’s exactly what the school board is trying to avoid, a substitute teacher."
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.037,2358.754,"Well, alright --"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2358.754,2372.776,"They are trying to have a replacement there who is qualified and who can remain with the school children for the rest of the year, because having one teacher throughout the year is admittedly a valid educational objective."
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.065,2388.99,"Well, this doesn’t guarantee that."
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2388.99,2392.498,"It doesn’t guarantee that, but it goes along way towards making that transition."
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.498,2396.797,"Well, maybe it guarantees it for five month rather than for four."
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2396.797,2400.885,"Well, what really is the objective here is to prevent --"
1973.72-777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.885,2405.767,And the other way it would again -- might guarantee it for eight months.
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2405.767,2426.678,"What is really the objective is to deal away with the disruption which is caused by teacher leaving without having given notice and the disruption caused by not having a replacement available who can take over them at the school, at the classroom."
1973.72-777,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2429.298,2449.037,"Mr. Hixon, does the record show whether you need any specified lead time in locating exactly the teacher you need with the requisite qualifications for the particular class to serve as a replacement?"
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2449.037,2453.371,Nothing except the facts in this particular case Your Honor.
1973.72-777,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2503.728,2521.482,"Mr. Hixon, if a teacher who wants to get married in March and she come in with the superintendent and say, I want to a leave of absence, I know I have a contract, but I want a leave of absence, I’m going to get married and I’ll be back in September."
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2521.482,2533.492,"No sir, I believe the penalties for the breach of employment contract in the sense that she agrees at the outset of her employment that she is going to teach for one year."
1973.72-777,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2548.215,2563.941,"Do you think such a teacher might have an -- I realize this is outside of our case, but would she have the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claim that pregnant teachers got a better break, get more favorable treatment than young teachers who want to get married."
1973.72-777,1,41495,samuel_w_hixon_iii,,2563.941,2583.799,"Well, I see what you’re driving at Your Honor but I wouldn’t take that position, because I believe that pregnancy is sui generis, it’s a condition that’s peculiar only to women and it’s a condition which I believe the school board is justified in treating differently than any other condition."
1973.72-777,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2685.256,2686.681,Thank you Mr. Hixon.
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,2688.759,2693.0,Yes sir.
1973.72-777,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2866.26,2879.846,"Mr. Hirschkop is your -- It’s your primary submission, as I understand it, that the compulsory termination after the fifth month of pregnancy is what violates the Equal Protection Clause, is that right?"
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,2881.925,2895.84,"Oh, no sir, no sir, for the -- the Court has raised this several times, I think we should be very clear, we do not object to the notice requirement and in fact do not object to a set date requirement, they can’t fix it by law this way."
1973.72-777,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2933.577,2938.104,"You said that is also, not just the compulsory departure date."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,2943.208,2944.692,"No sir, we have no objection."
1973.72-777,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2944.692,2950.398,"You say the notice requirement confined to pregnancy, I thought you said you don’t think it’s unconstitutional."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,2950.398,2953.884,"We think it is unconstitutional, if they confine it to pregnancy."
1973.72-777,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2953.884,2960.858,Then you were -- then I mistakenly understood you to say that your objection is the compulsory termination.
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,2960.858,2964.524,"Well, that we object to that where it’s confined to pregnancy also."
1973.72-777,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2980.944,2988.188,So it’s not only the compulsory separation after the fifth month that you submit violates the Equal Protection Clause?
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,2988.188,2988.975,"Yes sir, what we submit --"
1973.72-777,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2988.975,2989.744,It’s not.
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,2989.744,2990.508,It is not that.
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.245,3033.687,Give me example of another condition that would predictably resolve in leaving the job then about which you could give some notice.
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3033.687,3035.689,Cosmetic surgery Your Honor.
1973.72-777,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3035.689,3036.436,"Well, but isn’t -- doesn’t that --"
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.436,3042.006,"Well, that isn’t the condition; that’s just a choice that you are going to -- sometime you are going to do it."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3042.006,3045.167,"Yes, but it will necessitate you being in the hospital and being out of the job --"
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.167,3050.028,"Well, what you might do -- you mean if you plan to be away during the school year, you give notice."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3050.028,3051.157,Yes sir.
1973.72-777,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3051.157,3057.041,"But there is nothing inexorable about that as there is about pregnancy, they’re quit different, in fact different."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3057.041,3078.666,"No sir, there are some male related diseases that Judge Winter points out in dissenting opinion of Fourth Circuit, which I am not medically familiar, but there are questionably a number of medical conditions where you have a choice as to when you will have an operation and you can go to the school and say, look I am going to have an operation either in six weeks or two in months or three months."
1973.72-777,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3078.666,3085.452,"Well, the whole point is that when you -- when a woman who is pregnant, she doesn’t have a choice as to when that baby is going to arrive, does she?"
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3085.452,3085.726,No sir.
1973.72-777,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3085.726,3087.779,Short of an abortion or miscarriage.
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.779,3106.66,"And the other thing about it is that there is -- I guess part of the argument is when the woman is pregnant, the point of having or getting out to leave on at five months or four months, is it during the pregnancy she is more likely to be away from work?"
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3110.036,3110.773,That’s the argument.
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.627,3114.226,"Well I know, but that’s the argument."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3114.226,3115.063,"Oh yes sir, I exceed --"
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.063,3120.212,"Well, give me another -- give me a male related condition that’s like that."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3120.212,3121.073,I don’t have one Your Honor.
1973.72-777,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3122.713,3135.965,"Well, isn’t too Mr. Hirschkop -- isn’t one the at least contentions here that in addition to being gone during the pregnancy that the teacher herself loses some of her ability to teach?"
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3147.983,3150.66,"Your Honor I say it’s not similar, I say it’s not true."
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.318,3155.138,"Well, assume you are wrong on that."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3155.138,3157.338,"Well, the doctor said we were right in the record."
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3157.338,3161.757,"I know, but assume you’re wrong, that state says you’re wrong."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3161.757,3166.561,"Well, Your Honor they say I am wrong, neither do the doctors say, I am right, but now we look at the disabilities."
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.529,3170.858,"If you are wrong, I take it, do you think your case in trouble?"
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3170.858,3171.918,No sir.
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.918,3175.478,Well then why don’t you assume that you are wrong for a moment and then tell me what then?[Laughter]
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3175.478,3178.061,Okay.
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.319,3192.935,Yes.
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3192.935,3195.59,"Yes, but there is no special regulation on them."
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.581,3212.309,"Assuming that -- assume as you, just like doing of course, but assume that pregnancy does impair teaching ability."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3212.309,3215.421,Yes sir.
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.421,3224.495,The state you say still is disentitled constitutionally to provide for compulsory leave.
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3224.495,3228.435,"Yes sir, only insofar as they single it out from other matters."
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3232.248,3240.929,"Well, you just told me, you couldn’t find -- you couldn’t think of any other male related disease that had that -- the cosmetic surgery, that doesn’t involve any impairment."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3240.929,3243.94,"Well, it doesn’t male related then, it could be --"
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3243.94,3245.671,"Well, or yes I --"
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3245.671,3246.954,It could be a (Inaudible) Your Honor.
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3246.954,3247.192,Give me an example.
1973.72-777,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3247.192,3254.266,"Well, with a broken leg you don’t have the anticipated disability long in advance."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3279.862,3288.834,I can only refer you to Judge Winter’s dissenting opinion where he does indicate some medical disabilities that men suffer.
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3304.082,3312.639,"What do you want us to -- if there were contrary judicial finding below, you would like us to differ with that and overrule it."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3312.639,3315.725,"Insofar it’s unsupported by the record, yes sir."
1973.72-777,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3343.958,3344.691,Mr. Hirschkop.
1973.72-777,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3344.691,3350.803,"Where do you think of the constitutional line -- where do you think, Virginia couldn’t constitutionally draw the line?"
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3359.451,3361.663,They could draw a line on notice Your Honor.
1973.72-777,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3361.663,3363.023,"Well, or something about the other end --"
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3363.023,3364.778,Termination?
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3407.542,3421.049,"You’ve also, it seems to me, taken a position that would preclude the school board from saying that pregnancy, while a pregnancy goes on up until the time of childbirth, is, in any way, debilitating?"
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3421.049,3423.999,"Oh no sir, they have a state law, they could operate under that."
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.351,3428.605,"Well, I know but you won’t accept that."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3428.605,3429.798,I will accept that.
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.798,3440.016,"Well, you won’t accept that, I mean you would accept it if pregnancy as some women experience it, that is really, physically debilitating."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3449.562,3451.134,In some people it is.
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.134,3458.665,"Alright, of course it is in some people, but you wouldn’t accept a general regulation describing it as a debilitating situation."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3458.665,3459.826,It’s not for me to accept personally --
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3459.826,3463.593,"If you will accept that, then we have a different --"
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3463.593,3464.57,I think Your Honor --
1973.72-777,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3464.57,3467.688,"Certainly, a difference where the state is considerably narrow."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3467.688,3473.52,"They cannot say that a person cannot teach, because pregnant, in any way they say a person can’t teach because they got a cold."
1973.72-777,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3485.636,3505.354,"Mr. Hirschkop, as I recall the record the Cleveland case which you had argued here at any given time, they are about 10-12% of the women in the system, childbearing age who are on maternity leave."
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3521.068,3524.852,Not a surgical type leave which required an operation but of course --
1973.72-777,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3524.852,3526.348,Can you think of any?
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3526.348,3538.508,"Well of course the statistics that absenteeism itself from the Labor Department had pregnancy is one of the lower causes, but it didn’t include the actual period the woman was going for the birth itself."
1973.72-777,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3554.11,3558.182,But you’ve mentioned cancer and broken legs and cosmetics surgery.
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3572.392,3575.946,Not for operable disabilities Your Honor.
1973.72-777,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3590.644,3593.439,Like the common cold.
1973.72-777,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3593.439,3597.825,We have that statistic in the record Your Honor from the Department of Labor.
1973.72-777,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3598.782,3599.396,Thank you gentlemen.
