1994.94-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.754,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-325, Chandris v. Latsis."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,10.039,12.908,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,104.15,126.064,"Well, but I think what it didn't do was answer the question whether the employee's contribution has to be simply substantial, or a more permanent one, in effect, with regard to his maritime employment."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,126.064,128.449,--That issue was certainly left open.
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.449,150.196,"Yes, it was, and the Fifth Circuit seems to have a more restrictive test, pointing, perhaps, to permanent employment in that capacity, and the Second Circuit spoke in terms of a substantial contribution in terms of duration or nature."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,150.196,154.166,And I think that that focuses us squarely on the issue today.
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.166,159.67,And what test do you say this Court must adopt?
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,159.67,178.966,"Well, in analyzing, Justice O'Connor, those two tests, I believe that although there were some good intentions in the Latsis test, there are two fatal flaws in that test, and therefore I advocate the Fifth Circuit test which has withstood many, many years of tests under fire, under battle."
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.966,185.02,What do you say are the fatal flaws with the Second Circuit's articulation of the test?
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,185.02,194.391,The Latsis test... the problem with the Latsis test is that we do know from Wilander that Longshoreman and Jones Act seamen are mutually exclusive.
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.427,204.616,Do you think Mr. Latsis could have been covered under the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Act for these injuries?
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,204.616,205.583,--Yes.
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.583,213.139,"Did... to your knowledge, does the record disclose whether he ever made an application under that act?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,213.139,217.757,The record does not disclose whether Mr. Latsis made an application.
1994.94-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,253.264,255.882,Are engineers treated as longshoremen?
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,255.882,263.055,Traditional crew members who hold the position of engineers are not treated as longshoremen.
1994.94-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,269.125,273.593,"No, but even a land-based engineer; would a land-based engineer be a longshoreman?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,273.593,293.407,"--A land-based engineer who was performing ship repairs would be a longshoreman under the Fifth Circuit Robinson test, and in my view the correct test, because he's going to split time between shore and sea, and depending on how much time he spends at sea and how much time at shore, he could be a longshoreman."
1994.94-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,304.632,311.385,But is it not true that there are a category of personnel who are neither seamen nor longshoremen who might go to sea once in a while?
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,311.385,326.545,"--There is that category, and in that case they are entitled to traditional negligence remedies, but here, because he is performing ship repair, or species of ship repair, I believe he is covered by the Longshore Act."
1994.94-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,326.545,332.366,"Well, is that technically correct to say he was... I mean, he wasn't getting down there and soldering any wires himself, was he?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,332.366,333.132,There--
1994.94-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,333.132,334.584,He was a supervising engineer.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,334.584,344.44,--To my knowledge there are no Supreme Court cases that specifically define what a repair is for the purposes of the Longshore Act or the Jones Act.
1994.94-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.139,374.543,"You mean, he can work in a skyscraper in Manhattan... I guess the individual here worked in New York most of the time."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,375.811,387.368,"He... his residence was in New York, but he spent most of his living time in Miami, Florida, in the company offices and in a condominium that had been rented for his purpose in Miami."
1994.94-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.368,394.272,"But if you had the right computer hookup, you could really be in Manhattan in a high rise office building and still be a longshoreman."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,394.272,395.641,That's correct.
1994.94-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,395.641,398.341,Virtual reality.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,398.341,417.638,"Under that circumstance, I think to correct myself, he would not be a longshoreman, because to be a longshoreman you need to satisfy the situs and the status test, and although he would satisfy the status test, he would not satisfy the situs test, so I stand corrected on that answer."
1994.94-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,418.205,457.549,"Even though there may be difficult cases, is there a possibility here to at least carve out a category of easy cases, and that is, if we assume that the individual is employed by the vessel owner, that the vessel is on a voyage, which I take it this one indisputably was, that the person is supposed to do some work for the vessel owner on the voyage... he's not a passenger, and he's not a stowaway... would we get into trouble in carving out a central category in that case when all those conditions are met, and say anyone in that capacity is a seaman for purposes of that voyage?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,457.549,477.776,"--Justice Souter, if I understand your question correctly, you're reviewing the elements of the voyage test, which would cover the situation that you've described, and I believe not only would you create difficulties, I think you would open the floodgates to more and more litigation over this issue, and more importantly, I think--"
1994.94-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,477.776,484.282,"Well, would we open floodgates to more litigation over the issue, or just open floodgates to more claimants who would succeed on their claims?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,485.682,487.818,--I think both would occur.
1994.94-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.407,515.9,"Well, before you get to the example, I'm not following the discussion, because I had been under the impression that you can't be a long... a seaman for purposes of the voyage, that it is an employment status; that you are either a seaman, or you are not a seaman."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,523.823,525.324,"--That is correct, and--"
1994.94-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,525.324,531.245,"And if you get injured in the office building, because of that one voyage... is that what the Second Circuit does with it?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,531.245,532.78,--That's not what the Second Circuit does.
1994.94-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.882,542.786,"All right, but the Second Circuit's test would say you can be a seaman for one voyage, and then when you go back to land, you're no longer under the Jones Act and you--"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,542.786,552.594,The two flaws that the Second Circuit... the Latsis test suffers from are not the same as the voyage test that was introduced in the respondent's brief on the merits.
1994.94-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.594,554.744,--The voyage test would even be more favorable--
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,554.744,555.628,"More liberal, yes, sir."
1994.94-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,555.628,557.095,--to seamen than the Second Circuit test would be.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,560.58,573.673,"The reason why the voyage test is wrong is, it has absolutely no resolving power, and the examples of who would qualify under that test, you can go on and on and on, and in fact the justice of this Court--"
1994.94-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,573.673,575.107,"Well, we're going on and on and on now."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,583.696,593.152,"--Well, the voyage test does not comply with the requirements that were set down in Wilander, and the voyage test certainly would not be restricted to the master or members of the crew."
1994.94-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,593.152,598.055,"Well, I take it you're telling me implicitly that there's no textual reason why it's wrong."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,598.055,599.288,I'm not sure I--
1994.94-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,599.288,601.757,"I keep asking you, and you... there's nothing in the act."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,601.757,606.061,--The act unfortunately only has the word seaman--
1994.94-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,606.061,606.661,It just uses the word seaman.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,606.661,607.144,"--Yes, sir."
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,607.144,607.978,So there is no textual--
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,609.53,610.246,There is no--
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,610.246,621.338,"It's been left to this Court to define, and I guess under the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Act we've extended coverage to people who make short trips all the time."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,630.344,634.479,"--For example, the justices of this Court could be seamen under the voyage test."
1994.94-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,669.235,671.021,But you wouldn't be employed by the vessel.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,671.021,674.206,But the voyage test does not require employment.
1994.94-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.223,676.658,"Well, my hypo did."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,678.324,679.609,--Then that would--
1994.94-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,679.609,684.394,"You could be employed by the vessel, and be... and further, be at sea when you get hurt."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,684.394,719.234,"--If you impose a further duty that was not mentioned in the respondent's brief on the merits, that there be an employment relationship between the owner of the vessel and that employee, that would exclude the example of the justices of this Court, but it would not exclude the example of the general counsel of the cruise line, the CEO of a cruise line, the in-house marketing person from the cruise line, all who would have employment relationships with the vessel owner, and then you've satisfied that element, and then you go right back to the point of, they're on a voyage for the duration of the voyage--"
1994.94-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,719.234,722.036,"But those are all clearly examples of people who would not be longshoremen, I assume."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,722.036,722.819,--That's correct.
1994.94-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,722.819,725.971,So we do have a category of people who are neither longshoremen or seamen.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,725.971,727.59,There certainly are.
1994.94-325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,727.59,735.696,"I take it the situs of the injury, the fact that it occurred on a voyage, is relevant, is one of the factors?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,735.696,742.017,"In the Latsis case itself, the Longshore Act in my view does cover the situation, because he was a ship repairman."
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,751.289,752.089,I'm asking--
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,762.111,772.835,"Absolutely correct, and that is because the seaman status is not established at the exact time of the accident, or... and what you're doing immediately before the accident."
1994.94-325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,790.362,799.051,"But in a close case, where the claimant is arguing for seaman's status, is it relevant that the injury occurred on the vessel on a voyage?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,816.179,822.749,"That is certainly a complicating factor, and it makes it more difficult for us just to exclude that person."
1994.94-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.839,840.211,"Well, it's not a complicat... it seems to me, if you're being consistent to your argument, your answer to Justice Kennedy has to be no, that it is irrelevant where the injury happened to occur."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,865.178,866.378,And I agree with your summary.
1994.94-325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,883.24,897.149,"But it seems to me not only intuitive, but it has some bearing on the rationale for the act, which is that the seaman is subject to the discipline of the ship, the orders of the ship's doctor, et cetera, which is precisely why we have seaman's status at all."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,897.149,903.72,--The perils of the sea is certainly one of the policy considerations in protecting seamen.
1994.94-325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,908.874,915.361,"Well, I'm suggesting that it is a weighty factor, not the sole factor."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,915.361,925.067,"It is one of the factors involved, but, for example, as we discussed earlier, seamen who are on shore are no longer subjected to the perils of the sea, and--"
1994.94-325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,925.067,931.138,"Mr. McCreadie, I thought I had your position right, but from what you're saying now, I'm not clear."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,948.682,949.649,--That is correct.
1994.94-325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,949.649,966.978,"So that, in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, on your theory it should be irrelevant whether Latsis was injured in a sea storm, because you know from day 1, based on the obligations and duties of his job, that he will not be a sailor."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,968.596,978.951,"That is my position, and I probably confused it by, again, conceding that there are some advocates who want to just look to the place of the injury to determine whether someone is a seaman."
1994.94-325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,983.689,986.641,"But your position is, it's not even a relevant factor."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,986.641,987.724,--That is correct.
1994.94-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,987.724,988.593,Okay.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1001.051,1013.859,"Mr. Chief Justice, he can, and that's the series of Supreme Court cases that hold that you're not going to let a seaman walk in and out of coverage solely because of the fortuity of where the injury occurs."
1994.94-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1032.855,1034.155,Mr.... I'm sorry.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1084.055,1090.459,"I agree with your position, and it is a line-drawing problem we have here today."
1994.94-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1100.666,1104.201,"Justice Kennedy wasn't suggesting that, and at this point I'm not suggesting that."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1117.276,1132.269,"--I argue that that's how the tie should be broken, and that the perils of the sea that occur at sea or on vessels that are in movement, that that should be added to the Fifth Circuit test to provide the proper test for this Court."
1994.94-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.269,1134.404,"Well, you've taken several different positions here."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1148.497,1154.484,My position is that you cannot use perils of the sea as the sole basis for your test.
1994.94-325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1172.679,1173.629,Well--
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1185.92,1192.842,The test that we've advocated here would allow the employer or the court to make that determination--
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1192.842,1193.676,"No, it wouldn't--"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1206.084,1207.602,--The permanent connection--
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1207.602,1208.652,Is that right?
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1211.404,1214.09,"--The Fifth Circuit test, the first prong, or... is the permanent connection."
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1215.023,1215.423,All right.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1235.769,1236.455,--That is correct.
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.455,1243.942,"Now, neither the Second Circuit nor the Fifth Circuit use the so-called voyage test, as I understand it."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1243.942,1245.811,No port that I know of has used that test.
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1245.811,1248.179,And we're not reviewing a judgment that used that test.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1251.548,1252.215,That is correct.
1994.94-325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1282.75,1284.269,Is that one of the fatal--
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1328.398,1329.315,I think the--
1994.94-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.315,1332.35,That does not strike me as a very happy system of--
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1332.35,1357.4,"--The difficulty is, and the reason that that is a problem, is because, as this Court has pointed out, the Court has to give the law, and the jury has to make the decision, and what I'm trying to explain is that there are situations that superficially fall under the Robinson-Barrett test, and makes a longshoreman into a seaman, and that is contrary to Congress' intent as to what they want to occur."
1994.94-325,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1401.161,1404.631,--That's why I didn't really see the difference between the briefs.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1438.786,1439.888,Correct.
1994.94-325,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1456.798,1439.888,All right.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1463.503,1477.827,"The difference between the tests are that the perils of the sea is mentioned in the Latsis test, but when they use the term, regularly exposed to the perils of the sea, they did not address or use the word regularly, so under the Latsis test--"
1994.94-325,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1477.827,1478.429,Regularly.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1478.429,1482.148,"--all a person has to be is exposed at the time of his injury, he's a seaman--"
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1482.148,1483.198,"Well, now, wait a minute."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1503.061,1503.761,--That's right.
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1503.761,1508.532,"That was their express test, and that's what I hear you saying the test ought to be."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1508.532,1512.234,"But they didn't apply the ""regularly"" portion, because regularly--"
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1512.234,1514.519,"Well, did they articulate the right test?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1516.804,1518.321,--The perils of the sea prong is correct.
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1549.275,1568.92,"Well, you know, it's very hard to pin you down, because you've just wavered this way and that throughout this argument, but the Second Circuit had several requirements in its test, and one of them was that the plaintiff's contribution was substantial in terms of its duration or nature."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1568.92,1569.855,Correct.
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1569.855,1573.14,"And you take issue with that, is that where you differ?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1573.14,1574.024,That is the main problem.
1994.94-325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1601.042,1604.244,Those are the two fatal flaws that you were going to tell us about at the very beginning--
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1604.244,1604.627,Yes.
1994.94-325,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1604.627,1605.361,--of your argument?
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1622.221,1629.811,"That would be tantamount to the voyage test, and I believe there are problems with covering an employee just because he goes on one voyage."
1994.94-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1634.798,1636.765,You say that he can't go in and out.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1636.765,1638.167,That's correct.
1994.94-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.167,1644.737,"I thought your position was you cannot cover someone just for a voyage, and then when he comes back he goes out of his Jones Act status."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1647.605,1648.255,That is correct.
1994.94-325,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1648.255,1648.688,Is that--
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1660.263,1662.782,If he totally changes his job status--
1994.94-325,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1662.782,1663.132,--Yes.
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1663.132,1667.186,"--and is permanently assigned to the vessel, he changes from a longshoreman into a seaman."
1994.94-325,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1667.186,1677.292,"All right, and why do you have to say that while he's on the shore and doing the welding at the dock, he's the one thing, and then when he goes out to sea we couldn't say he's the other?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1677.292,1683.862,Because this Court and Congress have shown a disinclination to allow people to wander in and out of coverage.
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1683.862,1706.061,"Well, is part of the problem that the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Act is set up as a sort of a scheduled Workman's Compensation type program, and you calculate the benefits and the employer's liability based on predictable factors of the employment, whereas the Jones Act is just an open-ended damages cause of action, isn't that right?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1706.061,1707.077,That is correct.
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1707.077,1721.921,"And so what the courts have done, basically, is not to adopt this voyage test so that they keep a stable Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Act compensation scheme in place, is that right?"
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1721.921,1724.523,"That is correct, and that's the benefit of this system."
1994.94-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1724.523,1732.794,"But you've got problems, because the two systems are not the same, and so at the margins you run into some difficulties."
1994.94-325,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1732.794,1735.913,"I'll reserve my remaining time, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1735.913,1737.113,"Very well, Mr. McCreadie."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1770.068,1771.936,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.143,1786.043,It's not a--
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1786.043,1787.612,--no-fault system.
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1790.797,1797.701,"--And if the shipping company had nothing to do with the car that ran him over on Washington Street, it's not responsible--"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1797.701,1798.201,Exactly.
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.201,1798.901,--under the Jones Act.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1798.901,1799.487,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1805.823,1806.806,What if it was the company's car?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1808.858,1809.625,And it was negligent--
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1809.625,1810.475,And he's on land--
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1810.475,1813.477,--Then the employer would be liable.
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1813.477,1819.464,--I think Mr. McCreadie was mentioning that he would be typed a sailor for purposes of other relief like maintenance and cure.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1823.868,1824.668,"Of course, Your Honor."
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1825.685,1827.97,"Which he wouldn't have, if he didn't have sailor status."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1827.97,1828.756,--Exactly.
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1828.756,1830.089,Even though there's no question of negligence.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1830.089,1830.806,That's right.
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.416,1902.72,"Those are rather extreme decisions, though, some 30 years ago, weren't they?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1902.72,1915.862,"Well, I would not characterize them as extreme, because they've been guiding courts all along since that time, in terms of coverage, but just let's examine factually what Butler involved and see how it fits in with the situation at hand."
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.285,1981.404,Was he on the ship during the 6 months it was in the drydock?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1981.404,1987.891,"--He worked on that ship for 6 months, 7... the testimony is, 7 days a week for 6 months, from early in the morning to 11:00 at night."
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1987.891,1989.51,But he didn't live on the ship?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,1989.51,1990.526,"He didn't live on the ship, no."
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2038.324,2047.097,"But didn't Judge Oaks say that if the accident had happened while the boat was in drydock, maybe Latsis would not have been a sailor?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2047.097,2048.647,He said it was an open question.
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2056.967,2066.241,"And if it was an open question, then he had to at least have contemplated the possibility that Latsis is a seaman sometimes and not a seaman at other times."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2066.241,2076.282,"--I think what he meant by that is, how substantial was the association of Mr. Latsis to that vessel during that period of time, in the context of his whole employment?"
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.248,2080.251,How is that affected by where he's injured?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2080.251,2081.034,--Excuse me?
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2081.034,2083.37,How is that affected by where he is injured?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2083.37,2091.475,"Well, you know, there was an issue raised about the intuitive approach to these kind of cases."
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.705,2113.339,I don't find it compelling at all.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2115.241,2116.107,"--Well, because--"
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2116.107,2118.359,"--if what you're looking for is status, what--"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2118.359,2119.209,"--Certainly, status."
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.209,2120.895,--the individual's employment status is?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2120.895,2122.078,The purpose of the Jones Act--
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.078,2125.965,"It's based on his job description, not where the injury occurs."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2125.965,2132.618,"--As everyone has pointed out, Your Honor, there are close cases, a lot of close cases."
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2132.618,2133.102,Fine.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2136.087,2136.87,"Well, I don't think--"
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2136.87,2138.956,"I mean, why do you seize upon the place of the injury?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2138.956,2143.074,"--It's not merely the place of the injury, Your Honor, but the risk associated."
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2154.466,2172.16,"Well, but if he were a seaman, if Latsis is in fact, or was in fact at the time a seaman for purposes of the Jones Act, and if his retina had detached while he was sitting in his office on the dock, he would have been covered, wouldn't he, as a seaman under the Jones Act?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2172.16,2176.564,"If you assume that somehow or other the doctor was neglectful in treating him in that context, yes."
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2176.564,2180.199,"Same doctor, said don't... you know, don't worry right now."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2180.199,2180.799,Yes.
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.799,2183.051,Do you find it compelling that he was sitting at his desk?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2183.051,2185.003,No.
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.003,2188.388,Then why do you find it compelling when he's sitting on the boat?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2188.388,2189.055,Because--
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.055,2190.055,I don't see the difference.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2190.055,2192.573,"--If he was sitting on a dock, Your Honor, he would have alternatives."
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2215.788,2220.057,One of the risks of the sea is you get a bad ship's doctor?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2220.057,2220.592,No.
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2232.784,2239.404,"Now, if he's not a seaman, would he be covered under the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Act?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2239.404,2240.288,--He might.
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2245.875,2247.409,"Right, but as far as you know he would be."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2249.543,2264.353,"--He might be, but he's not a longshoreman, that's for sure, and there might be some objection to his... in terms of the employees having a choice, I'm sure he'd prefer... if the employee had control of choosing whether he would be considered a Jones Act sailor--"
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2264.353,2265.121,--Which he doesn't?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2265.121,2265.605,--No.
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2266.455,2269.59,"It's not a scheme that's set up for employee option, is it?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2269.59,2270.407,"--No, it's not."
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2270.407,2271.609,We're clear about that.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2271.609,2272.325,Most certainly.
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2272.325,2273.561,"He either is, or he isn't."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2273.561,2274.227,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.794,2275.461,Mr. Rosenberg--
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2279.798,2281.565,"Well, if the employer had a choice--"
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.565,2282.315,The employee.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2283.133,2283.733,"--No, the employer."
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.092,2304.746,"--But the choice is not perfectly clear if it's an employee, because one side you get absolute liability, and on the other hand you have to prove negligence."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2304.746,2305.246,--That's right.
1994.94-325,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2315.621,2319.506,"May I just go back to one answer, or one question you answered a moment ago?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2329.295,2329.712,--Yes.
1994.94-325,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2329.712,2337.884,"And that's perfectly consistent with answering that if a person is a seaman, and has the same eye injury on land, he will still be treated as a seaman for purposes of the act?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2337.884,2338.184,Exactly.
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2340.835,2347.673,"Of course, it's very close whether he's a seaman or not, in which case, you ought to find the fact that he was on land compelling."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2347.673,2349.275,"--It might be, judge."
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2350.425,2355.929,Does the Second Circuit's opinion say it felt this was a very close case that needed a tie-breaker?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2355.929,2356.579,No.
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2359.731,2364.368,The Second Circuit was concerned with the error in an instruction to the jury--
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2364.368,2365.051,Absolutely.
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2365.051,2365.585,--is that right?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2365.585,2366.737,"Yes, in several facets."
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2366.737,2374.557,And it happened to be the error to which you... the instruction about permanent connection to which you did not object.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2374.557,2377.276,"Yes, that's quite correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2377.276,2381.145,And so... and this case was not... it was not determined that Latsis was a seaman.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2384.096,2405.962,"Exactly, under the test of the Second Circuit as modified by this Court's holding in Wilander eliminating the requirement that the employee aid in navigation, which this Court directed no longer be part of any test for seaman status, that there are others besides blue water sailors that are covered by the Jones Act."
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.016,2447.855,"The term, ship's engineer has a somewhat different connotation, doesn't it, than Mr. Latsis' profession?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2447.855,2449.807,Mr. Latsis was a supervising engineer.
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2454.026,2462.548,"What do the nonsupervisory, laboring-in-the-vineyard type engineers do on board a vessel?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2462.548,2464.4,"Well, they operate the engines."
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2464.4,2464.966,Yes.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2464.966,2467.602,They effectuate repairs at sea when necessary.
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2489.866,2491.801,"The engineers operate the ship's machinery, don't they?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2491.801,2492.184,"Yes, exactly."
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2510.662,2511.446,"Now, Mr.--"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2518.751,2520.117,"Under the Longshoreman's Act, yes, sir."
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2520.117,2523.636,"Now, in the situs test, would he have met the situs test in this case?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2523.636,2524.503,Well--
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2524.503,2527.857,What is the situs test?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2527.857,2540.515,"--The situs is the area... the Longshoreman, as the act has indicated, is to cover principally... the impetus for the enactment was to cover people loading and unloading materials on board ships."
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.515,2543.783,"Could he be a longshoreman if he was 1,000 miles out to sea?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2543.783,2544.85,Don't think so.
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.85,2547.919,"So, I mean, it wouldn't meet the situs test."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2547.919,2548.604,"No, it wouldn't, no."
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2548.604,2548.971,So--
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2548.971,2551.087,"And in his office he wouldn't meet it, either."
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2551.087,2558.809,--So isn't it true that a lot of people who are at sea... this is following up on Justice Souter's approach... would not meet the situs test under the Longshoreman's Act.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2558.809,2572.986,"That's true, yes, and as a matter of fact, there is a case that was not mentioned so far, a recent case of this Court, Gizoni, a ship repairman, where the employer advocated that since he was a ship repairman, how could he be a seaman?"
1994.94-325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2586.377,2593.216,Do you agree that our law indicates that you cannot go in and out of seaman and longshore status?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2593.216,2593.666,"Yes, I do."
1994.94-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.666,2597.601,"Well, that's exactly what I wondered in the Second Circuit test."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2609.159,2609.725,Correct.
1994.94-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2609.725,2611.527,"So I'm thinking, what about our welder?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2630.823,2631.425,Exactly.
1994.94-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2631.425,2632.775,And therefore he would be covered.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2661.027,2675.72,"They didn't address that, no, but let me tell you that there is a case in this Court that was decided in 1959, Braen v. Pfeifer, which is cited in the reply brief... we didn't cite it in our brief, but it's in the reply brief, which involved a... the question as to whether you could step out of seaman status."
1994.94-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2705.223,2705.689,--So how could we do that?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2712.477,2713.579,I think he should be.
1994.94-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2713.579,2717.28,But I can perfectly well understand why he shouldn't be covered once he comes back to the dock.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2717.28,2718.046,"If, when he comes--"
1994.94-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2718.046,2726.902,So how does the law work in order to achieve that result without cutting off the person with the blue... you want him to be covered when he comes back to the--
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2726.902,2727.136,--Exactly.
1994.94-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2727.136,2729.254,"--So how does it work, this statute, to get there?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2729.254,2740.229,"If the... if your hypothetical welder, Your Honor, did an odd job at sea, so he wasn't regularly... that wasn't part of his regular employment, that was extraordinary."
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2764.111,2780.854,"Well, the Second Circuit test would not cover the welder who was asked to go to Hamburg, because it clearly said, you also have to find that in the course of the plaintiff's employment, the plaintiff is regularly exposed to the hazards of the sea."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2783.239,2784.023,--Well--
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2784.023,2795.364,"Now, I thought that this case had gone back to be... have the jury consider this under the Second Circuit's test."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2795.364,2795.964,"--Oh, no."
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2797.399,2798.833,But that's their plan.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2798.833,2799.267,"Oh, yes."
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2799.267,2801.134,That's what we're reviewing.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2801.134,2801.667,Exactly.
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2801.667,2804.236,And you don't like the Second Circuit test.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2804.236,2807.854,"Well, no, I do like it, but I would modify the word, regular--"
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2807.854,2809.706,But you didn't petition for certiorari.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2809.706,2810.79,"--No, I did not, no."
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2810.79,2818.912,"And as it now stands it will go back under that test, which certainly wouldn't cover the welder who's sent to Hamburg, would it?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2818.912,2821.598,"Not if that was isolated, no."
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2829.054,2834.339,You in effect accepted the Second Circuit's position for here.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2834.339,2835.124,--I think so.
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2835.124,2841.128,And you're faced with your opponent who says it should be a much narrower definition of seaman.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2841.128,2841.944,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2841.944,2846.932,"So presumably, neither of you would think it would cover the welder who went to Hamburg."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2846.932,2853.586,Unless... with the proviso that there was some recurrence to that type of--
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2853.586,2855.219,That he frequently went to Hamburg?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2855.219,2858.171,--Not necessarily--
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2858.171,2858.554,"Well, we could all agree to that."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2858.554,2859.271,"--Hamburg, but some place where--"
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2861.873,2865.658,"I said if he frequently went to Hamburg, I think we could all agree--"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2865.658,2866.425,Sure.
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.882,2882.969,"--I have really lost the thread of the disagreement, then, between you and the other side of the case."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2895.344,2899.747,"Well, we're obliged to do that because that's what the Second Circuit said, and we're supporting the Second Circuit."
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2920.244,2922.644,"Mr. Rosenberg, we're talking about a charge to the jury."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2922.644,2923.279,--Yes.
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2923.279,2925.496,Judge Oaks wrote a charge for that jury.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2930.617,2931.217,Yes.
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2931.217,2940.138,"So either the Fifth Circuit words are right, permanent, or the Second Circuit's words are right, substantial... what is it +/?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2946.728,2947.178,Exactly.
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2947.178,2951.38,"--for a jury to be given, in the words of the Fifth Circuit, or in the words of the Second Circuit?"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2951.38,2951.83,Exactly.
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2951.83,2966.99,"And nothing more elaborate is going to help this district judge, who is either going to be finished with the case, if the district judge is right, or we'll have to charge another jury, if we uphold the Second Circuit's decision."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,2966.99,2986.736,"Except, of course, that other point I brought up, Your Honor, that in addition, Judge Oaks' opinion states it was error to have excluded from the jury's consideration the period of time the vessel was in drydock from their determination whether Mr. Latsis, in his overall employment, had a substantial connection to that vessel."
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3010.434,3014.553,You say there should be a new trial even though we were to adopt the Fifth Circuit test?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3014.553,3015.238,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.613,3059.767,"May I reveal my stupidity once more, but you know, we've talked about this welder going to sea, just one example."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3079.413,3084.567,"--Well, if the hypothetical we presented was just one isolated instance--"
1994.94-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.567,3089.619,"Well, it's one long voyage from, you know, here to Tokyo... or Yokosuka, I guess."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3089.619,3095.689,"--I had assumed that since there was a port mentioned that he worked only at that destination, and not en route."
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3100.577,3100.943,The--
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3120.406,3120.923,Yes.
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3120.923,3123.608,So the Second Circuit had an additional requirement.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3123.608,3124.442,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3124.442,3128.929,And the welder on a one-time trip would not be covered under that test.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3128.929,3143.689,"Assuming a trip was finite, it wasn't a long, you know, worldwide cruise kind of thing, he would or wouldn't be covered under that test, but you have to employ that term to ascertain whether or not that requirement was made, that fourth requirement."
1994.94-325,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3143.689,3174.541,"Is it possible to read the Second Circuit test and to answer Justice Breyer's question in some such way as this: we will start with agreement that once a person has attained seaman status, he doesn't lose that status by going ashore for a month or something of that sort, he doesn't become a nonseaman when he crosses the gangplank, and we will assume that when someone does not have seaman status, mere presence fora short time, perhaps even as an employee on the ship, may not be enough."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3233.263,3233.846,I think that is--
1994.94-325,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3233.846,3235.448,--and answer what is bothering all of us?
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3235.448,3238.483,"--I think that does, because that clearly defines it at that point."
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3238.483,3241.435,"Well, except that the Fifth Circuit would say no."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3241.435,3242.135,That's right.
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3242.135,3245.554,That you look at the permanent job assignment--
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3245.554,3245.987,Well--
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3245.987,3265.218,"--and if the permanent assignment is to be in an office and supervise the engineering on the whole fleet of ships, even though occasionally having to make a trip at sea in doing that, the permanent assignment is not that of a seaman."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3265.218,3265.851,--I think--
1994.94-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3265.851,3268.419,"I mean, you would have a difference in the circuits on that."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3268.419,3270.621,"--I think that Justice Souter's put his finger on something, though."
1994.94-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3279.394,3284.446,"Well, that's nifty, but people always come in and say, whenever they go to sea, they say, well, this was a new job."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3293.552,3296.57,"Well, judge, there are other requirements besides being assigned to the ship."
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3298.372,3298.756,Mr. Rosenberg--
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3306.312,3306.728,--Right.
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3306.728,3310.846,"He's assigned to land for 2 months, he remains, he's ever and always a sailor."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3353.442,3367.183,"Traditionally, it has been that once you achieve the status of seaman, you don't step out of it, as long as that continuity of the duties related to that employment continue, but people do change jobs."
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3367.183,3368.535,But his job hasn't changed.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3388.68,3394.85,"Oh, he'd still be a sailor, yes, but there's no negligence of an employer in the office in Miami, so he would--"
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3394.85,3405.391,"I'm assuming that the office is ill-equipped, or the stairs in the property that was rented by the employer were defected, so the negligence is still there."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3405.391,3407.041,"--If there's negligence, if he's a seaman--"
1994.94-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3407.041,3416.764,"You're saying that this man... you two seem to agree, then, that either you're a sailor, or you're not a sailor, and there's no in-and-out."
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3422.668,3424.186,--That's... that's--
1994.94-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3424.186,3434.626,"So if you don't permit the in-and-out, then a person who goes on one trip to Hamburg, and he has a blue suit, he puts up the sails, he steers the ship, he repairs the engine, he rows half the way--"
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3441.147,3443.047,"--I agree, it doesn't seem to make any sense."
1994.94-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3443.047,3443.381,All right.
1994.94-325,1,35006,lewis_rosenberg,,3447.301,3451.003,"It does, but there's another factor I think we're overlooking."
1994.94-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3486.743,3487.643,"Thank you, Mr. Rosenberg."
