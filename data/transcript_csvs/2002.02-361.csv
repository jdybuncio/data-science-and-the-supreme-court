2002.02-361,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.352,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 02-361, the United States v. the American Library Association."
2002.02-361,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,10.733,13.651,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,65.129,69.806,"Mr. Olson, you have a number of important legal concepts to address."
2002.02-361,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,87.162,88.054,No.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1552.024,1559.362,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1577.436,1586.918,What... what cases are you relying on to say that the libraries would be required to engage in... in conduct that is presumptively unconstitutional?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1586.918,1595.124,"--This Court's whole series of cases involving the public forum doctrine, Your Honor, which I noticed was... was not really mentioned by my colleague, Mr. Olson."
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.898,1609.9,"Yes, but it begs the question."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1623.368,1629.09,"Well, Your Honor, the whole question about whether the library could do it this way depends on how you view the public forum doctrine."
2002.02-361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.158,1645.14,"You're not relying, at any rate, on cases dealing with libraries as such."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1645.14,1645.711,--No.
2002.02-361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.979,1648.217,You're relying on a more general--
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1648.217,1655.888,"Applying the Court's general holdings in... in a whole series of cases to try to decide whether this is a public forum, a designated public forum, created--"
2002.02-361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.888,1660.117,--You conclude that... you conclude that a library is a designated public forum.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1660.117,1663.454,"--The Internet terminals in the library are a designated public forum, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1663.454,1665.096,Not the whole library?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1665.096,1665.922,Certainly not.
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.765,1687.167,Not--
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1687.167,1688.463,--by the library in any way.
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1688.463,1689.109,--Not necessarily.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1720.129,1738.84,"That... that... with respect, Justice Scalia, the way the public forum doctrine works in our judgment... and we're basing this as... as close as we can on this Court's cases... is that the one thing that Government can't do is allow all content under the sun, not even knowing what content is there, and then exclude, cull out one area of disfavored content."
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1750.244,1753.426,Is it also a public forum if it's a public school library?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1753.426,1758.163,The... the case of a public school library is a... is a more difficult case.
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1758.163,1759.451,I just want a yes or no answer.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1763.431,1765.148,"I think, Your Honor, I can't give you a yes or no answer."
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1765.148,1766.114,"Well, I need a yes or no."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1768.784,1771.801,I would have to know how the policies are of the school--
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1771.801,1772.092,"No, no."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1787.291,1789.416,"--Then I... then I do say it's a public forum, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1790.424,1790.633,All right.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1791.403,1791.576,--Yes.
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1791.576,1802.972,"--then if it is a public forum, the elementary school, Addison Hill Elementary School, has to let the worst possible pornography go over the computers that come into the public school library."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1802.972,1803.696,"Certainly not, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1803.696,1804.082,Because?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1804.082,1805.338,Certainly not.
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1805.338,1806.679,That's what I want my answer to--
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1806.679,1812.304,"First of all, all that holding that it's a public forum does is... is give you the level of scrutiny that applies to the rule."
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1818.26,1818.526,--No.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1832.358,1836.567,"--But I think the Constitution analysis may well come out differently with respect to young children, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1836.567,1856.724,"Well, but I... I need to know fairly specifically because I don't want if there... if... to me frankly if... if your theory of it means that every public school has to have a computer attachment which bring this material into the school, I suppose a lot of schools wouldn't have computers at all in their libraries."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1859.687,1859.839,Well--
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1859.839,1861.396,--a fairly definite answer on this.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1861.396,1871.224,"--Your Honor, I think that... that, first of all, classrooms are different from libraries even in the school context because a school classroom... library... a computer is obviously not used for independent research."
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1882.655,1890.755,So your answer is that in your opinion now you think it probably would be constitutional as applied to school libraries but not as to public libraries?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1890.755,1897.848,"--It... it may well be, Your Honor, depending on the age group, depending on the circumstances, depending on the way the... the library is used by the students."
2002.02-361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1897.848,1922.905,"Mr. Smith, why shouldn't we be conscious of the holding of this Court in Denver Area v. the FCC where the Court concluded it might be premature to apply forum analysis due to changes taking place in the law, the technology, and the industrial structure related to telecommunications?"
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1933.615,1934.391,"Well, Your Honor--"
2002.02-361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1934.391,1937.824,I would think Denver Area would have some bearing on that.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1937.824,1944.034,--Denver Area has a substantial bearing and I think it's one of the strongest cases supporting our position.
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1980.727,1992.911,"But the... the other part... assuming it's some kind of stricter than just reasonable, however that is brought about, the... I'm very much concerned also about something Justice Kennedy raised."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2036.599,2037.818,"Well, Your Honor--"
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2037.818,2042.902,"Now, if all that's necessary, you have to go to the desk, what is the great burden on speech?"
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2051.295,2061.681,"--Well, Your Honor, the... the way the disabling provision is set up, first of all, is it's designed to give the library some job to determine whether your purpose is bona fide or not."
2002.02-361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2073.803,2075.714,"General Olson said no, you don't have to explain."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2075.714,2090.833,"--Well, the... the statute on the face of it says the library is required to inquire into your purpose and make a decision about whether it is a bona fide research purpose or other lawful purpose for looking at the material which has been filtered out by the... by the filter."
2002.02-361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2097.492,2104.422,"But not if you read other lawful purpose to mean everything except the specific categories, child pornography, obscenity."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2104.422,2112.14,--They will presumably have to have some information about what sites you're interested in looking at in order to determine whether that would be lawful or not.
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2118.215,2120.253,It doesn't say that in the statute.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2143.524,2148.424,"Well, clearly the library is responsible for determining whether or not you fall within the exception."
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2167.389,2167.824,Is there any other problem?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2167.824,2173.778,"--There's a third problem, which is you have... a lot of times this will only come up in the middle of your research session."
2002.02-361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2194.427,2203.185,"But in a library, when you're looking for a book, it might not be there, and you might have to go to the librarian and order it or borrow it from another institution."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2207.704,2208.953,"--But certainly, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2225.68,2231.976,"But in this context, perhaps we should not import public forum analysis."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2234.199,2234.891,"--Well, perhaps--"
2002.02-361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2234.891,2238.987,"--for instance, in public schools, as has already been discussed."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2249.566,2250.581,"--Indeed, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2292.878,2306.349,"Well, if you say that the world we look at is the people using these programs under the Federal law requirements in libraries, then it isn't a public forum."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2306.349,2330.522,"--Well, Your Honor, if you allow the Government to define its forum as all content under sun... under the sun ever invented by mankind except the piece that they don't like, then I submit that... that will be the end of the public forum doctrine because there will never be any situation in which the Government will be constrained in any way to censor out a particular piece of content that it... from the public forum."
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.522,2332.267,Designated public forum doctrine.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2332.267,2332.916,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.916,2334.924,Traditional public forums will always be public forums.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2334.924,2337.884,"Right, but I'm... we're here in the context of designated public forums."
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.449,2341.071,I've always had trouble with that doctrine anyway.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2341.071,2342.537,--If... if you allow the content--
2002.02-361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2347.335,2353.2,So... so a... a library that chooses not to get the Internet at all is not a public forum.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2357.329,2359.747,"Well, and it... and then it has to make another decision."
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2371.657,2377.071,"But I thought... you said there are two reasons why you should prevail, and we're still on the first."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2377.071,2378.076,"I appreciate that, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2378.951,2388.247,"But... but you... you said at the... at the outset that it would be... as I understood it, that it would be unconstitutional for you to do this on your own initiative."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2390.224,2391.626,"No, no, no."
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2408.423,2409.747,I just want to be... I just want to be clear.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2412.577,2413.266,"--Yes, sir."
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2413.266,2417.22,Could it voluntarily do exactly what the statute tells it it must do?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2417.22,2423.635,Our position is that that would trigger strict scrutiny that they would then have to satisfy and--
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2423.635,2424.356,"Well, and how would the strict scrutiny come out?"
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2424.356,2425.745,--Excuse me?
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2441.39,2451.91,And that... and that is... and that is because legally you would be a state entity denying access to a designated forum to a... a listener who is a member of the public.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2451.91,2453.218,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2453.218,2453.419,Okay.
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2453.419,2454.412,What was your--
2002.02-361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2454.412,2456.114,--What if the... what if the facts were changed in this way?
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2460.395,2460.98,No.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2462.258,2463.135,Yes.
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2464.204,2465.485,"--Sooner or later, I want you to get to the second--"
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2465.485,2466.641,"--I appreciate it, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2466.95,2467.073,--Okay.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2491.379,2492.22,"Clearly not, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2492.22,2492.417,Okay.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2492.417,2496.525,There's no... there's no argument that we... we'd make that that would be unconstitutional.
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.257,2507.899,"But... but how did... I mean, it's fine to say it's no violation of the Constitution."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2512.857,2513.95,"No, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.95,2517.1,"Oh, it... you agree it would not be a designated public forum."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2517.1,2517.999,Absolutely not.
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2523.004,2526.829,"But don't... don't many libraries already exclude, for example, chat rooms?"
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2526.829,2528.636,It's not a question of exclusion.
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2531.327,2531.734,"No, no."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2549.289,2550.452,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.083,2552.599,I didn't think you would.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2552.599,2555.015,--excluding an area of content can take it out of the forum doctrine.
2002.02-361,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2556.81,2564.247,"When you start on your second point, let me just ask you to comment on one thing because I want to be... I want the Solicitor General also to comment on the same thing."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2574.647,2575.92,"--Oh, clearly, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2584.412,2586.055,What is point two?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2586.055,2587.853,--It is that libraries--
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2640.63,2647.8,Is this a federalism concept and you... and you would cite our cases like Printz and so forth?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2647.8,2648.385,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2663.788,2668.359,So... so your argument would be the same if the... if the State of California were doing it.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2669.604,2670.651,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2681.874,2683.606,How about... can the board of regents set the curriculum?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2683.606,2688.151,"--I think it... when you get to the people who run the... run the university as their job, that's fine, yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2688.151,2689.59,"I mean, that's pretty far-reaching."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2719.663,2720.433,"Certainly not, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2720.433,2721.487,"Certainly not, okay."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2732.585,2733.183,Well--
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2733.183,2734.244,That's your objection.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2734.244,2735.789,"--first of all, let me address the book question."
2002.02-361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2769.88,2780.702,"Well, what if... what if the Federal Government said, we're going to give you 10 percent of your annual appropriation and you can't use that money to acquire a particular class of books?"
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2780.702,2785.54,"--I think as long as it was viewpoint neutral, Your Honor, and otherwise a legitimate line, that would be not a problem."
2002.02-361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2787.116,2792.048,"Well, supposing you... you can't use it to acquire soft pornography."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2792.048,2812.623,"--To the extent one could define that concept, I think that generally the Government... the Court has said the Government can decide what... what the money that it uses to subsidize the... the local government with... what it will be spent on, but it can't, I think, then expand the subsidy into attempting to regulate things like the other book decisions that the library might make."
2002.02-361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2812.623,2821.239,"Well, even in areas where it's already against the law to have materials that are obscene or harmful to minors?"
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2828.64,2830.234,"Of course not, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2837.496,2837.751,Right.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2858.333,2859.096,--Well--
2002.02-361,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2859.096,2863.389,"Should... should our doctrine take that into account, do you suppose?"
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2863.389,2873.04,"--If... if I might, just in answer to that question, Your Honor, take a moment to describe what... what it really is that the record shows about how these filters operate because I... I think that that's really very helpful."
2002.02-361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2952.685,2955.215,"Mr. Smith, you used... you said perhaps 50 percent."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2963.084,2964.288,--Well--
2002.02-361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2964.288,2966.052,--in relation to the Internet.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2993.374,2995.515,"--If I could... if I could address that, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3035.509,3036.119,Mr. Smith--
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3036.119,3037.211,"--Oh, you mean the Government--"
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3037.211,3041.363,--can I ask you a question about... about the public forum doctrine?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3053.984,3056.049,"No, that is not my answer."
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.049,3056.808,"Oh, that isn't your answer."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3056.808,3057.136,No.
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3058.008,3061.555,"It... it remains a designated public forum even if you don't take all of it, you say."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3063.326,3073.627,"--The way for it not to be a public forum is for them to decide affirmatively what they do want to include, not simply to say we'll take the... the content of 400 million people contributing to the Internet, but we'll carve out one thing."
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.318,3089.822,Why isn't that selective access?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3097.303,3101.665,--Maybe chat rooms are okay because the question is whether that's a content-based exclusion.
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.943,3104.226,It isn't content-based.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3106.284,3106.416,And it--
2002.02-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.416,3112.25,"--Now, so if they say no chat rooms, it doesn't become a designated public forum."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3151.744,3156.547,"--The fact that they may... may or may not think they have a good reason for doing it can't factor into the analysis, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3170.178,3179.006,"And that would also be a violation if the Government paid for 100 percent of the cost of the computer, both the hardware and the monthly billing for the Internet."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3179.006,3181.633,"Yes, because it lets in everything in the world."
2002.02-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3201.423,3201.796,"Well, you can have it."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3203.459,3210.802,And you have to deal with exactly the... the discretion of... of the librarian and about whether or not he or she is going to allow you... allow it.
2002.02-361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3233.078,3239.359,"What would your response be if... if you start where Mr. Olson started and said, you don't have to go through all of this?"
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3247.766,3250.17,"Well, it's not clear that the librarian would say yes."
2002.02-361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3252.936,3259.691,"I... I think Mr. Olson's suggestion was that the librarian, absent some extraneous reason, would say yes."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3265.247,3267.004,It seems he's on a horn... the horns of a dilemma.
2002.02-361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3273.885,3274.663,Is that your position--
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3274.663,3275.522,--That is my position.
2002.02-361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3275.522,3276.456,--that even to do that would be stigma?
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3276.456,3276.724,Yes.
2002.02-361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3276.724,3277.902,So that doesn't solve the problem.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3277.902,3278.295,Sure.
2002.02-361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3280.407,3281.653,That isn't what he says.
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3281.653,3282.302,"Well, that's what it is."
2002.02-361,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3282.302,3283.631,"He says, look, you block a lot of stuff."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3286.044,3301.324,"Well, if it turns out that people wouldn't be stigmatized by that... and I think the court below was correct to conclude that they will be... then... then there's the second problem, which is what... what is the purpose that you've accomplished by requiring people to go through this meaningless exercise other than to deter them."
2002.02-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3303.571,3305.674,"Well, it distinguishes an adult from a child."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3305.674,3310.215,"--You can do that in many different ways, Your Honor, that don't require anybody to approach anybody."
2002.02-361,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3373.466,3382.843,"Mr. Smith, this... this law covers elementary and secondary schools as well, but this challenge relates only to libraries."
2002.02-361,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3382.843,3385.143,"Only to public libraries, Your Honor."
2002.02-361,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3385.143,3386.999,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
2002.02-361,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3389.526,3402.763,I would like to invite the Court's attention to page 37a of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement which is the decision of the court below.
2002.02-361,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3502.997,3506.186,"General Olson, I hate to use part of your rebuttal time."
2002.02-361,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3515.761,3528.126,"I... we have no problem if the Court decides it, although it wasn't briefed and it wasn't the decision below, but we don't think it's remotely possible for this Court to decide that question in this context against the Government."
2002.02-361,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3676.475,3677.639,"Thank you, General Olson."
2002.02-361,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3677.639,3677.921,--Thank you.
2002.02-361,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3677.921,3678.907,The case is submitted.
