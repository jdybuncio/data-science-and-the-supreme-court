1966.103,0,36819,michael_traynor,,227.795,242.937,This Court -- the petitioner here relies on the rule of the coerced confession cases and the many other cases that this Court has decided in which the violation of the constitution has not been considered harmless.

1966.103,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1372.252,1373.398,What page is that on?
1966.103,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,1373.398,1379.234,"That's on page 253 of the printed record, Your Honor."
1966.103,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1392.184,1398.059,"I don't find that -- oh, you -- you're reading the title of it --"
1966.103,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,1398.059,1398.798,Yes that's correct Your Honor.

1966.103,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,1404.119,1407.005,-- start and that's what this part of the brief is addressed to.
1966.103,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1407.005,1408.254,Yes.
1966.103,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,1408.254,1414.995,And this was an argument made in that court as we're arguing here that the error was not prejudicial assuming there was any error.
1966.103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1591.957,1597.482,May I ask you if that's the only piece of evidence that can be viewed involved in there?
1966.103,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,1597.482,1598.667,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1966.103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1601.109,1610.562,"No one has stated in short, crisp term just what the fact is and what it is, you applied in the (Inaudible), would you mind doing that?"
1966.103,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,1610.562,1613.739,"I'd like to do that very much, Your Honor."
1966.103,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1623.363,1624.381,Heroine?
1966.103,1,16155,albert_w_harris_jr,,1624.381,1626.235,"Heroine, Your Honor, the narcotic drug."
1966.103,2,36819,michael_traynor,,3576.287,3579.646,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.103,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3784.199,3806.514,"Mr. Traynor, do you think it's clear that the Supreme Court of California held that this paper was seized unlawfully in reliance upon the federal constitution?"
1966.103,2,36819,michael_traynor,,3806.514,3812.504,"I think there's two parts to that answer, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1966.103,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3835.185,3835.979,In lawful custody.
1966.103,2,36819,michael_traynor,,3835.979,3840.035,In lawful custody and they said so in their opinion.
1966.103,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3848.063,3849.529,Lawful custody of whom?
1966.103,2,36819,michael_traynor,,3849.529,3852.267,"Lawful custody of the police, Your Honor."
1966.103,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3853.234,3865.314,"But after construing the state law, then you think it is clear that they based their ultimate decision on the United States Constitution."
1966.103,2,36819,michael_traynor,,3865.314,3865.971,I think that's right.
1966.103,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3867.674,3875.027,"Well, I suppose your -- the California constitution has some sort of an -- quite equivalent to the Fourth Amendment, isn't it?"
1966.103,2,36819,michael_traynor,,3875.027,3888.934,"That's right, Your Honor and they relied on both the Preston case and the case in California called the Burke case which followed Preston which involved the obtaining of a car under the vehicle code when a man's arrested on the highway obtaining and putting him on custody."
1966.103,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3888.934,3898.095,Was the Burke case decided under the thought that it was -- that that result was compelled by the federal constitution?
1966.103,2,36819,michael_traynor,,3898.095,3901.168,"That's my reading of the Burke case, Your Honor."
