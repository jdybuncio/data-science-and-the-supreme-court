1960.182,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,22.614,"Number 182, Bernard Wilson, Petitioner, versus Donald F. Schnettler et al."
1960.182,0,29858,james_j_doherty,,41.412,42.698,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
1960.182,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,135.133,138.88,Do we have here any record of those state court proceedings?
1960.182,0,29858,james_j_doherty,,138.88,159.746,"We have not -- not as a part of this record, Your Honor, however, we have a copy, a transcript of the copy and the Solicitor General has a transcript, I know because the Court reporter either lost her notes or something but she copied mine to give it to them so we'll stipulate to the conduit of the record if they want to after this."
1960.182,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,159.746,160.679,There's no objection?
1960.182,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,161.303,163.241,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1960.182,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,163.241,165.709,"Thank you Mr. Friedman, you may get it to the Court with the proper time."
1960.182,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,165.709,167.804,"Surely, yes, Your Honor."
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,167.804,174.81,Now the -- we went over to the Federal District Court and we made a petition for declaratory judgment.
1960.182,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,187.804,200.534,"Can you tell me this much about the state court proceedings, was the motion to suppress the evidence denied because it was not an unlawful procedure or because this had been done purely by federal officers or for what reason?"
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,200.534,212.446,"The -- the state court denied the motion to suppress and they said that the authority for doing so was the case of Draper versus United States, ruled on the merits."
1960.182,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,221.347,224.779,(Inaudible)
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,224.779,226.019,It was an arrest case.
1960.182,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,226.019,228.09,(Inaudible)
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,228.09,243.54,The facts precisely as are in the transcript of record are that they had a building under surveillance where they had information that narcotics were being sold.
1960.182,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,326.65,328.515,He is not yet been tried there (Voice Overlap) --
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,328.515,329.465,"No, he hasn't, Your Honor."
1960.182,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,333.782,334.531,Yes.
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,334.531,335.464,-- and his awaiting trial.
1960.182,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,335.464,337.216,Yes.
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,337.216,367.198,"Now, as I say the case was dismissed in the District Court and it went up to the Court of Appeals in the form of conference and the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal and I think in examination of the decision will reveal that they assigned two reasons for affirming this case and you'll find this at the bottom of record, page 15."
1960.182,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,466.849,471.201,What rules do you think the Court is speaking about in Rea?
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,471.201,475.017,I think the Court was speaking about all of the rules.
1960.182,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,539.282,545.554,"What did the judge -- what reason did the judge give for that, do you recall?"
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,545.554,546.477,"No, I don't Your Honor."
1960.182,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,546.803,551.166,"Well, we will have the transcript, we will have them."
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,551.166,551.581,Alright.
1960.182,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,551.581,553.266,Don't -- don't take your time.
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,553.266,554.383,"Don't take the time, alright."
1960.182,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,554.383,555.638,Yes.
1960.182,2,29858,james_j_doherty,,555.638,557.687,But he just said “I'll see what difference that makes?”
1960.182,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,942.029,942.994,Thank you Mr. Doherty.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,945.181,951.129,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1049.534,1053.218,"Well, that's what they want a hearing on it as I gather."
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1053.218,1053.853,They wanted a hearing on --
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1053.853,1055.825,Whether what you say is true.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1055.825,1062.174,"That's correct, Mr. Justice but that is the issue which they have previously litigated in the state court."
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1062.174,1069.044,Has there been a hearing on -- in the state court on the -- whether the Rule 41 (e) has been complied with?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1069.044,1070.7,There has been a hearing Mr. Justice --
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1070.7,1072.864,Those rules certainly are -- aren't finding on (Voice Overlap) --
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1072.864,1078.28,"No, there has not been a hearing in terms of whether Rule 41 (e) has been complied."
1960.182,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1117.249,1128.496,Have they also said Mr. Friedman that they will apply their rule on a search and seizure when the alleged unlawful seizure was made exclusively by federal officers?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1128.496,1130.547,They have not decided that question.
1960.182,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1130.547,1132.054,Some states have decided that.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1132.054,1135.129,They have not -- let me say this as far as I can tell.
1960.182,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1162.192,1174.536,Did the -- did the trial court here on the motion to suppress assumed that the rule in Illinois was that the evidence if unlawfully seized would be suppressed even though the seizure were entirely by federal officers?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1174.536,1178.924,I think I have to say clearly so Mr. Justice if I may without --
1960.182,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1178.924,1180.122,We'll read that on the time.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1180.122,1180.968,"-- yes, but they may --"
1960.182,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1180.968,1182.366,But that is your understanding?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1182.366,1182.682,That's right.
1960.182,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1188.175,1199.088,(Inaudible)
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1199.088,1200.952,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1960.182,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1200.952,1203.291,Decision was made on the merits of the seizure.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1203.291,1210.122,On the merits of the seizure and the Court stated he believe this case was controlled by the Draper decision of this Court.
1960.182,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1210.122,1214.855,"Presumably they held it was a lawful arrest, therefore, lawful search and therefore --"
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1214.855,1215.94,That is correct.
1960.182,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1215.94,1245.96,"Is there anything in the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois to indicate that having adopted wholeheartedly, as I believe they have, the so-called which rule that they were to make a distinction regarding the authority that does recieve him, the source of the authority but they would make a distinction that they would give greater leeway to federal officials in their courts and they would for the state --"
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1245.96,1246.224,No.
1960.182,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1260.155,1266.523,"What I was meant to say as far as I remembered, the Illinois Supreme Court decision aren't negatively on this subject matter."
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1266.523,1280.81,"No, they are very frequent and they have a number of cases I might mention in which the Illinois Supreme Court has reversed criminal convictions because the arrest without a warrant was not based on probable cause."
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1319.676,1325.292,These findings are -- are rather short from the brief that the state court made.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1325.292,1326.152,I'm sorry I didn't hear your question.
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1326.152,1329.618,These findings that the state court made are rather short from the brief.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1329.618,1330.864,"Yes, they're not really --"
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1330.864,1342.943,They're on Page 8 and you say that they applied the federal standards but it's very difficult -- needs -- to see what standard they apply?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1350.627,1354.283,"Are you -- I'm sorry Mr. Justice, you're referring to Page 8 of the record?"
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1354.283,1354.548,Yes.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1354.548,1355.113,Yes.
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1371.025,1375.993,Where is the evidence and you -- I just go -- I'm referring to citations in your brief --
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1375.993,1376.126,Yes.
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1376.126,1377.964,-- and it takes me to -- to this.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1377.964,1385.848,"Well, Mr. Justice, it's been agreed that the Court may consider this transcript of the proceedings before the Illinois trial court."
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1385.848,1387.864,They're not cited in your brief.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1387.864,1392.027,"No, because at that point, they have not been before the trial court in this case."
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1483.157,1489.824,"I suppose then you had said that if he got to the federal court first, he then would have been out because he should have gone with the state court."
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1495.138,1497.066,I -- I would -- I would say yes if he had --
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1497.066,1499.971,"Well, that -- that of course would answer Rea too."
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1499.971,1501.01,"No, I shouldn't Mr. Justice --"
1960.182,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1501.01,1503.557,And he could've contested that in the state.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1503.557,1524.996,"I'd like to distinguish really because we think that the general supervisory authority over federal officers which this Court refers to and based its decision in Rea and which petitioner here invokes, we think does not entail any general authority in the federal courts to supervise federal officers."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1592.624,1598.407,When does he -- when does the supervisory power attached for the first time?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1598.407,1610.877,"Well, I would say Mr. Justice, once the man is arrested, once the man has been arrested by federal officials at that point under the rules he can go in to the Federal District Court and move to suppress."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1610.877,1614.152,Had he not been arrested by federal officials here?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1614.152,1615.191,He had been Mr. Justice.
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1615.191,1616.628,Why couldn't he go in then?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1616.628,1633.768,"Because Mr. Justice, the federal officials immediately turned him over to the state prosecution and since there was no other connection of the federal courts with this matter, there was no federal order, there was no federal process involved, we think at that point this was a matter for the state."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1634.701,1660.374,Do you mean that even though the power of the federal court's supervisory power attaches when a federal agent arrest a man that was done in this case; that supervisory power can be defeated solely by the agent taking him to the state courts instead of to the federal courts?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1660.374,1682.578,"Well, I -- Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that issue was posed by this case because I don't think here although there were allegations that he was taken over to the state court, the fact of the matter is that the usual policy of the Bureau of Narcotics is to cooperate and to transfer a lot of minor offenders over to the state court."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1682.578,1694.978,"What is -- what -- under our rules, under this rules of criminal procedure, what is the duty of a federal agent when he arrest a man for a federal crime?"
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1694.978,1697.308,The duty is to take him before a commissioner --
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1697.308,1697.488,All right.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1697.488,1698.78,-- if he is -- but I would suggest --
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1698.78,1700.16,Did he do that?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1700.16,1701.042,"No, he didn't Mr. Chief Justice."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1701.042,1706.442,Then -- then can he defeat the rules of the -- of the Court merely by doing something different?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1706.442,1706.587,"Well, --"
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1706.587,1707.861,-- take him over to the state?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1707.861,1710.916,"If I may answer that in two ways, two ways (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1710.916,1712.016,Sure.
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1712.016,1723.839,"First, I think that that provision on arraigning him promptly must be read in the light of the provision of the statute authorizing the cooperation in returning him over."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1734.176,1751.841,Do you think that the -- that the general statute authorizing the cooperation of federal officers or state officers supersedes the rules of this -- of this Court or the administration if justice in federal courts?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1751.841,1753.194,"No, I don't say that Mr. Chief Justice."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1753.194,1754.385,"Well, how do you avoid it?"
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1755.5,1769.439,"Well, I avoid it basically because I think that even assuming in this case even let's assume for the sake of argument that the agent's refusal, failure to arraign this man were violation of the rules."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1769.894,1772.367,"Well, isn't it?"
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1772.367,1773.967,"No, I would not concede that Mr. Chief Justice."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1773.967,1779.099,"Well, there is no use of argument if you're -- if you're not going to concede that."
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1782.562,1792.484,"Because I think these rules, these rules are written in the contemplation of the procedures of the federal courts and there was here no procedure involved in the federal courts."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1803.129,1819.881,"Well, then -- then it's your position that any time a federal officer arrest a man for a federal crime, he can, instead of taking to the commissioner, can turn him over to the local authorities for prosecution."
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1819.881,1824.616,Without -- Without on due delay and no attempt to evade I have to add this quote --
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1824.616,1830.95,"Well, why do you say without attempt to evade, is there any proof that there was no evasion of the rule?"
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1830.95,1840.558,There's no -- there's no proof and there's -- there's nothing but the naked allegation that there was an attempt to turn him over to avoid the harsher and stricter rules of the federal court.
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1840.558,1842.964,"All right, they want a hearing on that."
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1848.299,1857.457,"Well, I think Mr. Chief Justice, they're not entitled to a hearing here because first, this very issue has already been litigated in the state court."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1857.457,1864.636,Can they determine for the federal courts whether the federal rules have been respected?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1864.636,1865.725,"No, they cannot."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1865.725,1868.432,Was that issue raised in that court?
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1868.432,1878.657,It's my understanding that he's based -- his motion to suppress was not based on the failure to arraign but rather on the failure to have any reasonable grounds for the search and seizure.
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1878.657,1880.728,"Well, that's the other arm of the dilemma."
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1880.728,1911.403,"But I would like to suggest this, Mr. Chief Justice that the reason in this case, the federal courts should not be open to litigate these issues, is because the power and the interest of the federal courts in enforcing compliance with the federal rules is basically a power and an interest to supervise federal officers insofar as their conduct involves the federal courts themselves."
1960.182,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1926.711,1939.339,"Well, you just said to me a few moments ago that our supervisory process attached the minute an agent arrested the man for federal crime."
1960.182,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1939.339,1947.542,"It attaches in that if there has been nothing else done, the man can promptly move in the federal courts."
