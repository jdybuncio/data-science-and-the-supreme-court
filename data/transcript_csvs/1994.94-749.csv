1994.94-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.724,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 94-749, John J. Hurley and the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council v. the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,15.36,19.212,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.637,129.616,"Well, Mr. Darling, my recollection is that the trial justice in this case made a finding that that was not... that based partly on his, I guess, disbelief of one of the witnesses, or doubt about the witness' credibility, this was not kind of an idea-centered parade."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,129.616,143.542,"Your Honor, the facts in this case, where we have raised a claim, a First Amendment claim, and where the expressions of my client have been altered, we're asking that strict scrutiny be applied."
1994.94-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.118,170.276,"Well, you're entitled to more careful review on a First Amendment factual issue, certainly, than otherwise, but still credibility issues have been traditionally for the trier of fact, even in that area."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,170.276,186.137,"Mr. Chief Justice, as far as the credibility of Mr. Hurley was concerned, that related to testimony that he gave in response to questions asking at what stage did they reject and why did they reject the group as a marching unit."
1994.94-749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,186.137,189.423,But the Chief Justice's question interests me also.
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,196.077,201.481,"The parade is inherently expressive, Justice--"
1994.94-749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.481,207.818,"Well, do you want us to make a finding, than, that a parade is per se an expressive activity?"
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,207.818,209.568,"--Yes, I do, Your Honor, and--"
1994.94-749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,209.568,211.186,Does your case depend on that?
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,211.186,256.548,"--No, sir, but what follows is that unless my clients or future parade applicants receive the protection of this Court they will be exposed to the injunction and the onerous terms that have been applied by both the trial court and affirmed by the supreme judicial court in compelling them to either voice a message that's mandated by the State or remain silent, or in order to modify the injunction, to return to the court with hat in hand asking if their speech finally met the focus and diversity and inclusiveness that this case mandates in my client's First Amendment parades."
1994.94-749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,256.548,268.44,"Mr. Darling, you've answered, I guess, two questions, and I want to make sure that you stand by the answer in each one, and I want you to comment again on the relevance of each one."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,311.718,313.701,"I would think not, Justice Souter."
1994.94-749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,313.701,314.17,Okay.
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,314.17,326.645,"The fact that any parade is inherently expressive, coupled with the fact that realistically nowadays people make applications for parade permits, as has been done in this case--"
1994.94-749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,326.645,331.347,May I just interrupt you and get to another point?
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,340.453,341.521,--That's correct.
1994.94-749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,341.521,345.457,But is it essential to your case that the parade be expressive?
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,345.457,347.309,"No, it's not."
1994.94-749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,366.921,368.805,"No, but let's assume they are wrong."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,381.546,390.386,"--If it was a permitted activity and there was no expression involved, probably not, Justice--"
1994.94-749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,390.386,390.786,Okay.
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,400.342,403.562,"--They do indeed, Justice--"
1994.94-749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,403.562,417.053,"And it seems to me that your answer would be that even if your parade is nonexpressive in its history and in its tradition, that you have the right to keep it that way."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,417.053,419.922,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1994.94-749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,419.922,422.44,Or is that your... it seems to me that's a plausible position.
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,422.44,451.543,"--We have a judgment that made a finding that it was impossible to discern any specific expressive purpose in my client's First Amendment activity, but this Court has access to the exhibits, and particularly a video tape that demonstrates without question that my clients are engaging in a First Amendment activity with viewpoints and political messages and celebrating their religious values."
1994.94-749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,458.613,467.802,"Well, just hypothetically, let's assume, following Justice Souter's line of questioning, that this parade was like a picnic or something that had no expressive purpose whatsoever."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,485.014,488.299,"Well, we've described a group of people--"
1994.94-749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,488.299,489.499,You don't have to take the argument if you don't want to.
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,489.499,492.184,--We've described a group of people--
1994.94-749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.184,494.12,"I thought you made that argument in your brief, frankly."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,497.588,511.581,"--Well, I'm sorry if I misspoke, Justice Scalia, but the fact is that any group of people or any individual cannot be compelled to speak in behalf of the State or be the courier for the State's message."
1994.94-749,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,511.581,518.818,"Mr. Darling, I understood your brief to say this is your parade and you can do with it what you will, somebody else can do what they will with their parade."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,524.739,525.722,"That's correct, Justice."
1994.94-749,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.701,543.351,"Well, you--"
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,545.819,547.437,Yes.
1994.94-749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.018,572.47,"Mr. Darling, I thought you said you couldn't do whatever you wanted with a parade."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,603.857,606.793,"No, that's correct, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,621.369,623.369,What is the message in this case?
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,630.689,636.093,--GLIB had three purposes that were found as expressive during the trial.
1994.94-749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,687.492,689.644,"The message is, it's great to be Irish."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,689.644,692.096,"--That's one of them, Justice Souter."
1994.94-749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,692.096,692.862,"That's enough, isn't it?"
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,693.229,693.896,One of them.
1994.94-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,730.119,737.291,"Well, what you're saying, I gather, Mr. Darling, is it isn't just a message it's great to be Irish, but that it's great to be Roman Catholic, too."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,737.291,748.433,"Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, the messages contained in my client's parade are numerous and powerful messages."
1994.94-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,765.208,767.06,"Well, could you answer my question more directly?"
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,771.881,776.6,"It certainly is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,804.352,807.554,Why do they let the Baptists join the parade if it's a Catholic parade?
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,807.554,815.208,"Well, it's part of their cultural expression, Justice Stevens."
1994.94-749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.91,818.693,Up to a point.
1994.94-749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.978,836.119,"Well, as I recall, the district court found that St. Patrick would not have excluded the homosexuals, lesbians, and bisexuals, isn't that right, something to that effect."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,846.01,873.761,"--I believe that was a homily that was added at the end of the judgment in the superior court decision, but clearly the fact that homosexuals and bisexuals and lesbians have marched in my client's parade for years is of no great consequence to my clients, that a gay city councillor who is openly gay who marched, and that appears in the record, and he was not disturbed."
1994.94-749,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,939.888,948.911,"So what are we supposed to do... I take it that you concede, or do you not, that if your groups want to... your group cannot discriminate on the basis of race, can it?"
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,948.911,950.128,It can in its--
1994.94-749,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,950.128,954.113,"Just... you wouldn't let a person in just because he was Afro-American, that was your only reason?"
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,954.113,969.324,"--Justice Breyer, my clients, if they wish to discriminate on the basis of their speech, in their speech they can, but as far as discriminating independently of their speech, that is conduct, and--"
1994.94-749,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,969.324,970.407,"No, no, that's not my point."
1994.94-749,0,18778,chester_darling,,1020.405,1029.844,"--I'm suggesting that the finding of discrimination, Justice Breyer, was made inappropriately on the very basis of the words you have just read."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1531.413,1533.063,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1544.721,1551.826,"Well, we can affirm on an alternate grounds, but not one that you have not advanced in your brief."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1551.826,1556.897,--We dropped a footnote acknowledging amicus' position.
1994.94-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.263,1560.432,An amicus cannot raise a separate issue.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1560.432,1562.801,"--We do not press that position in this Court, Your Honor."
1994.94-749,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1584.465,1598.307,"Well, do you agree that we can review that in a First Amendment case, that we can review that finding and address Justice Breyer's question so that perhaps that finding is in fact not dispositive for us?"
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1598.307,1605.794,The Court can certainly review the facts in a First Amendment case to determine whether or not First Amendment rights have been violated.
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1618.888,1629.91,"Well, do you contest... I assume you concede that your clients wanted to be in the parade because they wanted to proclaim a message."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1629.91,1638.182,"Well, I think the term ""message"" as it's been used in this case really is more confusing than illuminating, Justice Kennedy."
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1657.946,1665.083,Do you think it's a fair conclusion from this record that the plaintiffs had no interest in proclaiming their message in this event?
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1665.083,1669.571,I think that there is a difference between who someone is and what their message is.
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1672.273,1677.24,"Precisely, but the First Amendment is concerned with the latter."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1677.24,1677.926,I'm sorry.
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1677.926,1687.782,"The First Amendment is concerned with the latter, and if messages are the grounds for the exclusion from the parade, it would seem to me that that is the end of it."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1687.782,1694.786,The council has the right to exclude on the basis of viewpoint.
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.223,1710.481,"To get back to the question of why GLIB wanted to be in the parade, they didn't want to be there to recreate, as was found by the Massachusetts supreme court."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1731.227,1737.631,"Justice Scalia, I think that when Linda Brown went to school in Little Rock her going in there was expressing something."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.671,1748.671,But it's not incidental.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1756.591,1757.86,"There was no finding about that, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.86,1758.71,--No finding at all.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1758.71,1762.162,"No, there was no finding that they were let in in other units."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.162,1763.431,"No finding that they weren't, either."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1763.431,1763.981,"No, that's--"
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.981,1774.202,"Was there any evidence whatever that a person would be excluded from the parade, marching in another unit, if that person was homosexual or lesbian or bisexual?"
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1776.738,1780.706,"--There was only Mr. Hurley's testimony which the trial judge disbelieved, but I think the point is, Your Honor--"
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.706,1782.308,Which was the opposite.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1782.308,1783.474,--Which was he said I never--
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.474,1786.593,"And that's the basis on saying that this existed, that somebody else said it didn't exist."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1786.593,1793.014,"--He said, I never knowingly excluded someone on the basis of their sexual orientations, which is not the same thing as saying, I knew that so-and-so was gay and let him in."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.014,1797.834,It's also not the same thing as evidence that somebody was excluded simply because of his sexual orientation.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1797.834,1814.945,"The... I think that the point here, Justice Scalia, is that one... under the antidiscrimination laws one cannot be penalized for merely self-identifying any more than the... when a discriminator excludes--"
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.945,1816.695,Why is that?
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1828.77,1839.478,"--For the same reason that if the council had said, we don't object to the presence of Jews, just Jewish surnames, or we don't object to the presence of blacks provided they somehow conceal who they are."
1994.94-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.872,1880.138,"That may be the rule for the Massachusetts antidiscrimination law, but if Massachusetts antidiscrimination law results in forcing parade organizers to allow people with signs and placards that are inconsistent with what the parade says its message is, then it's a problem under the First Amendment, isn't it?"
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1880.138,1881.972,"That is correct, but what I... I think I--"
1994.94-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.972,1883.423,You're saying that didn't happen.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1883.423,1886.291,"--I'm saying that didn't happen, and I'm saying it for two reasons, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-749,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1890.743,1895.231,"Well, let's pose it in a different context."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1924.417,1935.106,"--Justice O'Connor, I see a very clear distinction between viewpoint discrimination and discrimination against people simply for being who they are."
1994.94-749,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1935.106,1942.628,"Yes, but a Barnum and Bailey parade doesn't have any viewpoint other than just, gee, the circus is in town and everybody come."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1943.295,1945.43,I think that if the issue here--
1994.94-749,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1945.43,1947.464,A public event.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1947.464,1960.59,"--A public accommodation, right, but what the council is saying is that they're reading into the mere presence of a group that's protected under the Massachusetts statute, a message."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.959,1963.559,They're not reading into it.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1986.157,1996.18,"--Because whatever the group had as its expressive notion when it formed, all it said in the parade is, we are Irish-American lesbians, gay men and bisexuals."
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1996.18,1998.28,But the point... suppose that were true.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,1999.732,2000.282,Of course.
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2000.282,2003.667,--the driver's license that said live free or die?
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2003.667,2004.167,Right.
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2004.167,2008.571,The driver of that car was not engaged in expression.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2023.163,2025.949,"The difference, I think, Justice Kennedy--"
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2025.949,2041.542,"And the point is that even if the parade were not expressive earlier, and I doubt that, but even if it were, I should think the organizers could say we don't want it turned into an expressive activity, and that this case is much easier than a driver's license case."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2041.542,2049.462,"--I think, Justice Kennedy, that GLIB is like the numbers, it's not like the sign."
1994.94-749,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2057.885,2060.004,"But Mr. Ward, what about this--"
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2060.004,2061.82,"--Well, can we just get one thing established."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2076.696,2078.38,"--However, there was no message in that sense."
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2078.38,2080.214,Would you agree with that proposition?
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2080.214,2084.166,I would agree that the council is free to discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2084.818,2086.418,Including your client's viewpoint.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2086.418,2087.82,--Correct.
1994.94-749,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2097.959,2108.115,"Mr. Ward, there is... there are three... there's a statement I think in the court of first instance and in the supreme judicial court of three purposes."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2122.791,2127.111,"--I don't disagree that each of those purposes is expressive, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-749,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2133.699,2142.121,"Well, none of the parade's messages were, either, and we're talking about that which is kind of reasonably implicit and reasonably conveyed throughout."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2151.56,2167.605,"I'm taking the position that when all other groups in the parade are allowed to simply self-identify, that the act of my client in simply self-identifying, which is all they did, is not the expression of an antithetical message in that sense."
1994.94-749,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2168.805,2188.536,"So you are then saying that... I guess you're saying that in the absence of an express declarative statement, none of these three purposes to which Justice Ginsburg has alluded and the Massachusetts courts found as your expressive point is in fact a point being expressed at all."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2188.536,2192.637,"--I'm saying... no, they certainly did not find any expression in the parade."
1994.94-749,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2195.372,2204.378,"Well, didn't they find that your three purposes were expressed by you marching, by your group's marching with self-identification?"
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2204.378,2205.811,"--No, they did not find that, Justice Souter."
1994.94-749,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2209.763,2210.448,Yes.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2210.448,2221.554,"They found that the group marched in the parade, that they were discriminated against because of their sexual orientation, not because of any extrinsic message that they sent, or that they conveyed."
1994.94-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2221.554,2224.59,"Well, what did your group's sign say?"
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2224.59,2226.974,"It said simply, Mr. Chief Justice, it said"
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.182,2246.455,"That is enough to show that you are proud of that fact, which is what their object is to express their pride in those dual identities."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2252.109,2257.227,"In the same sense that a black person marching in the parade, I take it, would be proud of his or her identity."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.227,2264.75,"That's right, and if that person held up a sign and said, black unity, that would be an expression of pride in blackness."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2264.75,2271.837,"Except that generally speaking, lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people are not immediately evident to the--"
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2271.837,2273.022,Exactly.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2285.163,2288.448,"--I would call it self-identifying, just as a Star of David, just as--"
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2288.448,2291.817,"So long as you mean, by self-identifying, pride."
1994.94-749,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.8,2294.7,"May I ask you a question, Mr. Ward?"
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2320.784,2321.852,--I think it's objective facts.
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2364.763,2369.817,"Well, I don't know that seriously disable is found in any of our cases."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2378.506,2380.458,"--Except that, Justice--"
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2380.458,2385.843,"Newspapers, for instance, can't be required to print retraction articles."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2385.843,2387.195,--Exactly.
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2399.919,2405.49,"Well, but I think even if that were so historically they could change their position when another group wants to have a message."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2405.49,2415.429,"--Well, I think that clubs often did that when they wanted to exclude black people, and this Court consistently said you can't reorganize around a racist purpose and become thereby a private club."
1994.94-749,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2417.481,2420.683,"Mr. Ward, can I ask another question, following up on my preceding question?"
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2438.727,2441.512,"Well, it controls as to the finding of discrimination."
1994.94-749,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2443.412,2447.833,"Yes, but it would be permissible discrimination if the objective observer--"
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2447.833,2448.466,Oh--
1994.94-749,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2448.466,2451.618,--would think that there's a message there they don't like.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2457.672,2461.926,"--I think what that really means, Justice Stevens, is there are some circumstances under which discrimination is incidental."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.4,2526.083,"--Well, they didn't."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2532.689,2536.141,"On the basis, Justice Scalia, that they can discriminate on the basis of viewpoint."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2539.026,2543.878,"Oh, well, if you assume that there's no expression going on here I think that's probably right."
1994.94-749,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.497,2546.964,--Could I just ask one quick question?
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2551.234,2552.351,"Anything they want to, sure."
1994.94-749,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2552.351,2555.036,But why is that different from self-identification?
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2555.036,2561.923,"Because that goes to the essence, otherwise you would give a discriminator an objector's veto."
1994.94-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2570.279,2577.635,"Yes, but the person with a Jewish surname has got that Jewish surname permanently, but a Klansman doesn't necessarily have to wear a robe."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2578.901,2613.641,"No, but we... under the Massachusetts statute sexual orientation is what it is, and to say that merely announcing it disentitles you from exercising the right of equality... I mean, for example, in an employment situation, the employer could say, I never knowingly fired a gay person, but then if somebody finds out that the employee is gay and the State law bans discrimination on that basis, nobody would say that, well, okay, you weren't kicking him out for his sexual orientation but simply for announcing that fact."
1994.94-749,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2614.408,2616.593,But that's very different than compelled speech.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2632.77,2633.805,--It isn't Your Honor.
1994.94-749,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2660.639,2665.007,"Well, the trial court says the veteran's position is paradoxical."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2680.619,2686.772,"--Your Honor, I think that what the trial justice was doing was characterizing their position, not dictating it to them."
1994.94-749,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2686.772,2705.084,"But Mr. Ward, you agree with that, don't you, because you urged, did you not, that this case was now moot, because you now concede that this parade has an expressive purpose and therefore they can take the position that you're opposing... they can now take it... your conduct hasn't changed."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2716.042,2720.494,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, we don't say that they win."
1994.94-749,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2727.683,2737.805,"But I thought you said the reason this case is moot is that you're not contesting that, that you did not contest... after the district court ruled against you, you didn't appeal."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2737.805,2738.589,"--No, we have appealed."
1994.94-749,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2738.589,2739.241,You have.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2739.241,2740.307,That fact has changed.
1994.94-749,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2743.276,2758.553,"I wanted to ask you, I'm having trouble with your Ku Klux Klan example, because there is no State law that says we're going to protect members of the Ku Klux Klan the same way we protect sexual orientation."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2767.991,2768.474,Correct.
1994.94-749,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2768.474,2769.426,And we take that as a given.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2769.426,2769.926,That's right.
1994.94-749,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2769.926,2775.997,"So as far as we're concerned, it has to be exactly the same as if we're saying, no African Americans, or no Irish, or whatever."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2775.997,2776.697,Exactly.
1994.94-749,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2776.697,2777.699,That's the given.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2802.082,2802.348,Right.
1994.94-749,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2802.348,2803.398,"--the sign that says GLIB> [""]."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2803.398,2803.732,Right.
1994.94-749,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2803.732,2804.516,That's your... all right.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2841.872,2854.013,"Well, I think the most recent case, at least the most recent case that I've come across, is Hernandez v. New York, the jury selection case in which the trial judge made a finding of no discrimination, and what this Court says was, because this is a who-did-what-to-who question--"
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.013,2856.563,It wasn't a First Amendment case.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2856.563,2857.979,"--No, it wasn't."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.979,2858.863,Try Bose.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2858.863,2859.329,Correct.
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.329,2860.781,Bose was a First Amendment case.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2860.781,2869.537,"Bose was a First, but even in Bose, Justice Scalia, great deference is given to factual questions, particularly a question like discrimination, which depends largely on credibility."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2874.441,2881.928,What evidence was there for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation as opposed to expression?
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2881.928,2890.034,The shifting rationales given by the chief witness for petitioners was the basic evidence that the trial justice relied on.
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.034,2894.169,Why does that show discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation?
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2894.169,2895.604,Because--
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2895.604,2900.306,It might show casting about for something that the trial court would accept.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2900.306,2913.4,"--To the trial judge and to me it shows that the person was not being credible in his explanations, that his real basis was discrimination based on sexual orientation."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2913.4,2914.8,I don't see how it leads to that conclusion.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2918.969,2922.338,"I think it's typical of what discriminators always do, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.325,2930.444,How did this shift?
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2932.661,2933.729,They started out with safety reasons.
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.704,2957.679,"But the trial judge finds that G-L-B would be excluded because of its values and its message, i.e., its members' sexual orientation."
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2961.296,2962.646,"Justice... excuse me, Justice Scalia--"
1994.94-749,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.646,2962.915,--Yes.
1994.94-749,1,33466,john_ward,,2962.915,2963.698,--That's not what he found.
1994.94-749,2,18778,chester_darling,,3100.918,3124.367,"Again, I would urge, Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors, that any review of the record will reflect that there is absolutely no evidence of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by my clients in this record... in the whole enterprise."
1994.94-749,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3138.976,3150.184,"Mr. Darling, would you comment directly on your opponent's argument that the particular signs they were going to carry, and it's all... forget your motive in letting them out and they're motive in doing it, but just, I want to watch the parade."
1994.94-749,2,18778,chester_darling,,3156.255,3164.944,"--A sign that stated, Irish-American, Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston."
1994.94-749,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3164.944,3168.829,"Is that self-identification, or is that message, and if so, what is the message?"
1994.94-749,2,18778,chester_darling,,3168.829,3188.642,"It's a message, it's an identification, it's a proclamation, and it is a message that my clients did not deem appropriate including in their expression of their version of a celebration of a St. Patrick's Day parade, however they designed it."
1994.94-749,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.428,3195.713,"It seems to me that there's some... I'm wrestling with this, to be very honest with you."
1994.94-749,2,18778,chester_darling,,3206.354,3216.995,"--What my clients do, Justice Stevens, is evaluate a group on the basis of their message and what they'll contribute to my client's speech, their overall celebration."
1994.94-749,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3216.995,3228.017,"But what do we look at... would you agree that to decide what their message was we should just look at what they purported to carry in the parade, not all this other evidence about, they thought it might give moral support to people in New York, or something like that?"
1994.94-749,2,18778,chester_darling,,3228.017,3233.755,"In my opinion, they wouldn't exclude Jewish people that wore yarmulkes."
1994.94-749,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.171,3246.163,"No, but my question was, in trying to decide what the message is, do we just look at what they were going to do in the parade, or do we look at their testimony that I think this will also give moral support to other groups around the country, and so forth and so on?"
1994.94-749,2,18778,chester_darling,,3252.967,3255.768,"--Well, it's also a distinction, too."
1994.94-749,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3286.604,3293.043,Suppose that their actual reason was that the sign calls attention to a fact that makes them feel uncomfortable.
1994.94-749,2,18778,chester_darling,,3295.477,3296.995,--Any--
1994.94-749,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3296.995,3298.095,Where does that stand?
1994.94-749,2,18778,chester_darling,,3298.095,3300.297,--As far as my clients are concerned?
1994.94-749,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3300.297,3302.53,"No, where does it stand as far as the law is concerned?"
1994.94-749,2,18778,chester_darling,,3302.53,3303.815,My clients--
1994.94-749,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3303.815,3309.819,"Suppose that what happens is that that just makes them feel uncomfortable, since it's public, and they don't like it."
1994.94-749,2,18778,chester_darling,,3313.255,3314.405,--My clients can exclude it.
1994.94-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3320.558,3321.993,"Thank you, Mr. Darling."
