1987.86-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.67,"We will hear argument now on No. 86-964, David A. Thompson v. Susan A. Thompson."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,123.045,131.365,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,386.064,403.693,"Mr. Weiss, in your application here and your presentation of the question to us, you appear to have raised only the issue of whether there is an implied cause of action on behalf of your client under this Federal Act."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,404.31,405.645,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.745,421.421,"You did not raise below or raise in your cert petition, I gather, that there is Federal question jurisdiction in any event quite apart from any implied cause of action."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,421.421,430.443,"Well, we raised under 28 US 1331 that there is Federal jurisdiction."
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,430.443,436.681,You raised the issue of whether there was Federal question jurisdiction quite apart from an implied cause of action?
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,436.681,439.383,"Yes, we did, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,439.383,442.668,You didn't present that question to us in the cert petition; did you?
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,442.668,445.77,"I don't believe we did, no."
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,445.77,448.405,No.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,448.405,449.005,We raised it--
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,449.005,459.696,"And, yet, most of the cases below dealing with this question have gone off on the theory of Federal question jurisdiction: its existence or the lack of it."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,459.696,473.206,"--Existence or the lack of it, but most of the cases, as I read them, dealt with the implied provision as opposed to the actual because of the fact that it is a state cause of action."
1987.86-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.206,478.174,"Well, isn't that a form of Federal question jurisdiction and implied cause of action?"
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,478.174,481.693,"That is a form of Federal question... yes, Chief Justice."
1987.86-964,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,481.693,486.014,"Well, I have the same concern Justice O'Connor has."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,492.183,500.189,"Yes, we raised it in our original complaint to the lower court."
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,500.189,511.331,Did the courts below deal with that?
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,511.331,527.341,"As I recall, the lower court just summarily dismissed it saying that there was no jurisdiction whatsoever because it was within a domestic relation exception."
1987.86-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,643.899,658.927,"But that is quite consistent with the Ninth Circuit's majority's view that what this is... the PKPA is a rule of decision for state courts, like the AVLA, rather than creating a separate cause of action in Federal Court."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,658.927,672.068,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, if you read it literally, the problem is the Act, itself, speaks in a positive affirmative manner."
1987.86-964,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,696.1,703.104,"All that means is that... that might make it very clear that... the Louisiana court, is that the one?"
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,703.104,704.806,Yes.
1987.86-964,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.806,706.241,That the Louisiana court made a mistake.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,711.293,721.501,That's one of the arguments raised that a person should travel to the other state court and go through the state system.
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,774.718,795.066,"Well, the legislative history, though, is really pretty clear, isn't it, that Congress directly considered this and recognized the problem and simply decided to go slowly in this area and not to make it a matter of Federal question jurisdiction."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,795.066,797.834,"Well, there was discussion of Federal--"
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,797.834,802.453,"You seldom see a legislative history this clear, I think."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,802.453,814.76,--There was some discussion by Senator Cranston referring to the attention being directed at the problem in the Federal level.
1987.86-964,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.469,938.158,"Wasn't this Federal suit dismissed for want of personal jurisdiction, also?"
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,938.158,939.074,"No, it was not."
1987.86-964,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.074,946.68,"Well, how were you going to proceed in California to get jurisdiction over somebody in Louisiana?"
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,946.68,963.226,"Well, the Ninth Circuit addressed that problem and talked about the type of acts that Dr. Clay had committed in the jurisdiction."
1987.86-964,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.053,1011.873,"Again, in California?"
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1011.873,1015.592,The child?
1987.86-964,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.592,1016.86,Yes.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1016.86,1029.584,That is a problem that the PKPA can solve.
1987.86-964,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1047.13,1050.832,How could we get it to the Federal court in California?
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1050.832,1056.069,--Hopefully with a Federal court order that will be obeyed.
1987.86-964,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1056.069,1057.603,What is the order going to be?
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1057.603,1059.47,I'm sorry?
1987.86-964,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1059.47,1060.555,What kind of order is it?
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1060.555,1082.303,"Well, if it is determined that California was the appropriate jurisdiction and Louisiana is restrained, then California would, in all probability, issue an arrest warrant like was done in Samolian by the Louisiana State."
1987.86-964,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1082.303,1085.255,You would have extradition?
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1085.255,1088.04,"For Dr. Clay, probably."
1987.86-964,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1088.04,1089.44,You would have extradition?
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1089.44,1089.992,Yes.
1987.86-964,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1089.992,1093.194,To the Federal court?
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1093.194,1094.777,No.
1987.86-964,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1095.813,1097.279,You don't have extradition in the Federal court.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1099.18,1099.964,Through the state court.
1987.86-964,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1102.966,1105.251,I just want to know how you are going to get a hold in.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1105.251,1116.274,"--We are going to do it by trying to get the state court to issue a writ of extradition for Dr. Clay and, hopefully, she would bring the child rather than go through that."
1987.86-964,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1120.161,1123.13,The only thing we have here is the jurisdiction of the Federal court.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1123.13,1123.646,--That's correct.
1987.86-964,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1123.646,1133.152,And I am asking you how can the Federal court pick him up in Louisiana and bring him to California.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1133.152,1140.591,"They cannot, but the Federal court can determine that California was the proper court for jurisdiction of the custody case."
1987.86-964,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1146.328,1151.613,"Well, this is unbelievable to me."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1161.921,1177.348,"Well, now, as discussed, what the Congress did was they passed the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and they passed it in positive terms."
1987.86-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1214.556,1219.342,"I don't think that is entirely true, Mr. Weiss."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1243.992,1268.274,"The problem is that the PKPA, if as some of the writings have suggested is strictly advisory, are an extension of the UCCJA, then in a lot of states there will be a conflict between the UCCJA and the PKPA."
1987.86-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1268.274,1272.742,But the PKPA is an act of Congress.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1277.38,1278.096,No.
1987.86-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.096,1279.665,I would think the PKPA would prevail then.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1282.117,1289.604,"That would be my assumption, but it would be up to the interpretation of the state court."
1987.86-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1289.604,1291.14,"Well, not ultimately."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1315.138,1317.021,I have heard that argument.
1987.86-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.021,1318.573,From the Ninth Circuit.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1318.573,1321.492,From the Ninth Circuit.
1987.86-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.502,1366.687,"Yes, but you cannot presume that every case will be a test case."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1392.586,1395.038,"Well, in this particular case--"
1987.86-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1395.038,1402.209,"Maybe they made a mistake in this one case, but does that mean that they always are going to make mistakes and rule in favor of the local parent?"
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1402.209,1404.994,"--Well, it is not even a mistake."
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1418.654,1432.312,"Well, Mr. Weiss, maybe we just need a test case from Louisiana, but I think for you to make the assumption that no state court is going to apply the Parental Kidnapping Act properly is unwarranted."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1432.312,1435.43,--I will agree and I am sorry if I made that assumption.
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1491.517,1494.885,"Well, that's why this Court sits: To resolve conflicts like that."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1494.885,1495.902,"I understand that, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1495.902,1496.402,All right.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1496.402,1539.331,"Well, if you review the minority decision in the Ninth Circuit, Justice Alcorn makes some comments about the failure to recognize a Federal jurisdiction and I think the comments reflect that he found an intent of Congress to create the Federal jurisdiction."
1987.86-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.408,1585.979,Full faith credits that there in the same way.
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1585.979,1600.053,"Well, full faith, Justice Scalia, the full faith credit statute is a little different in that the PKPA 1738A sets standards."
1987.86-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.489,1614.296,"Is not the full faith and credit statute, indeed the full faith and credit provision of the Constitution which says that each state shall give full faith and credit to the judicial decrees of the other states."
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1618.633,1634.46,"On the full faith and credit, you also have the problem that this is a child custody determination and full faith and credit only has to be given by one state to the other state to the same enforceability that other states order."
1987.86-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.232,1647.701,But that is what Congress sought to change in the PKPA; is it not?
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1647.701,1669.549,"That's... if you take that position, Chief Justice, then what are we going to do with the modifiability aspect of the child custody decision because full faith and credit is given to a final judgment."
1987.86-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.101,1677.303,"But here Congress... as I understand it, Congress has said in the PKPA,"
1987.86-964,0,40726,ronand_w_weiss,,1698.549,1699.482,"No, it is not, Chief Justice."
1987.86-964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1782.937,1785.172,"Thank you, Mr. Weiss."
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,1787.19,1794.594,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-964,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1859.787,1864.108,"Well, do you think that is really the correct way of putting it?"
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,1870.777,1876.581,"That is the way Thompson, the Ninth Circuit interpreted."
1987.86-964,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.889,1896.329,"Well, I know, but do you agree that this Federal act would be enforceable in a state court?"
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,1896.329,1896.795,Yes.
1987.86-964,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1899.614,1916.556,How would a parent who claims the benefit of that Act get into a state court to enforce it without having... without being able to say that: Congress intended me to have the right to enforce this statute in a state court?
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,1916.556,1926.764,Because it is a direction to the appropriate authorities of each state: shall enforce and shall not modify.
1987.86-964,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.764,1931.668,But a parent who claim is a benefit of the Act would have to be able to get into court.
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,1931.668,1932.585,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-964,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1932.585,1940.608,And be able to say the Federal Act intends me to have the right to enforce this in a state court.
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,1943.208,1943.71,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.819,1961.021,Is that even right?
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,1970.46,1974.095,That may very well be a correct analysis.
1987.86-964,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.018,1988.839,"In this case, there has been a Louisiana custody order; hasn't there?"
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,1988.839,1989.405,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-964,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1989.405,2010.335,"And if this parent is told you must enforce this Act if you have any right under it at all in the Louisiana court, he's going to have to go down there and assert some right under this statute to get that custody order overturned."
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,2010.335,2011.37,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.37,2014.922,I don't understand this discussion.
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,2019.774,2020.726,"No, sir."
1987.86-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.726,2025.845,"For example, it is a Federal right to have Federal... Federal law supersedes state law."
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,2027.23,2027.93,Right.
1987.86-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.93,2031.099,But that doesn't give me a cause of action to sue for Federal pre-emption.
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,2045.608,2046.627,"That's correct, sir."
1987.86-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.627,2061.637,"We are talking about here whether there is a cause of action to have the PKPA applied or rather whether that is just a rule of law which will be applied in other suits: custody and torque, contract or whatever."
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,2061.637,2063.786,I would agree with that analysis.
1987.86-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.493,2118.139,"So, I suppose then the answer would be to this person that if you wanted to prevent the issuance of this Louisiana custody decree because of this Federal statute, you should have gone to Louisiana and a time and defended on the grounds of the Federal statute."
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,2118.139,2118.623,That's right.
1987.86-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.106,2119.723,"And now, it is too late."
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,2119.723,2120.675,"--No, sir."
1987.86-964,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.258,2123.793,"Well, how will he enforce it now, the statute?"
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,2123.793,2138.97,"Dr. Thompson can bring an action in the Louisiana court based upon his California decree, contend that the Louisiana court lacked jurisdiction under PKPA to enter its decree, which, incidentally, was the--"
1987.86-964,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.97,2140.587,"So, he will be asserting his right in that action."
1987.86-964,1,33958,kenneth_rigby,,2140.587,2141.505,--That's correct.
