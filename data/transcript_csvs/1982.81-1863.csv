1982.81-1863,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.576,We will hear arguments first this morning in United States against Grace.
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,24.584,26.77,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1863,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.069,153.048,"Generally, do you think that a regulation which in effect says no time, no place, no manner can really be called a time, place, and manner regulation?"
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,153.048,161.873,"Clearly, where it leaves open, if that is the reason for the alternative... adequacy of the alternative channels inquiry."
1982.81-1863,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.416,175.961,"Well, I for one wouldn't think of Greer versus Spock as a time, place, and manner restriction."
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,178.179,183.831,"Well, it... it may be... it may be that in addition."
1982.81-1863,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,347.64,351.357,"Well, does the statute do that, or the person who pickets do that?"
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,351.357,353.545,--It is just--
1982.81-1863,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,353.545,359.214,What... what infers that this Court would be influenced by one person holding a sign?
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,359.214,380.3,"--The inference against which Congress may legitimately protect is the inference that would be drawn by the people that because of the mere existence of picketers on the Supreme Court grounds, that the Court's decisions are in fact influenced by that kind of process."
1982.81-1863,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,381.455,382.939,"Well, is that what Congress has said?"
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,382.939,398.074,--What Congress has said is that picketing and demonstrating activity within the narrow space of the Supreme Court block is incompatible with the traditional purposes for which this Court is to be used.
1982.81-1863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,504.968,516.136,"Mr. Solicitor General, how can that interest justify prohibiting the leafletting in this case involving some Central American political situation?"
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,516.136,518.807,"That is precisely my point, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-1863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,527.038,531.161,"But that leafletting couldn't even affect the appearance, which is your present justification, I understand."
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,531.161,541.407,"--No, but it could affect the appearance, because permitting the leafletter and the demonstrator, the sign carrier and the leaflet distributor on the grounds of the court--"
1982.81-1863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.407,544.0,"Just confine it to the leafletter about South American politics, where you have no cases--"
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,544.0,576.33,"--Whether it is about South American politics or whatever, the mere presence on the grounds of that person engaging in that kind of activity leads to a possible inference that that kind of activity may influence the Court's decisions, because passersby, observers of that activity, may very well not read what is in fact on the leaflet and only draw the inference that leafletting is in fact occurring and may have an influence on the Court's decision, regardless of the content."
1982.81-1863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.873,588.139,"--Well, if that's a sufficient justification, I suppose the statute could extend across the street, too."
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,588.139,595.058,The matter of linedrawing is a difficult one.
1982.81-1863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.502,654.642,"Mr. Solicitor General, they haven't had to raise it in this case."
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,663.482,667.481,I have some question of whether--
1982.81-1863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.481,668.138,And that statute may do that.
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,668.138,668.778,--Yes.
1982.81-1863,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,689.16,699.702,"That touches, does it not, on another argument raised by the Appellees, which is the argument that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, in any case?"
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,699.702,700.186,Yes.
1982.81-1863,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,764.222,771.595,"Mr. Solicitor General, is there any other building in this city that has this special protection?"
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,771.595,775.547,"To my knowledge, there is not, Justice Marshall."
1982.81-1863,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,775.547,777.421,"Well, how do you single this one out?"
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,777.421,788.744,Because that is in its very nature the kind of judgment that we entrust to legislatures for several reasons as a matter of linedrawing.
1982.81-1863,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1031.585,1035.317,"Well, those people couldn't have come in here and talked to us."
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1035.317,1040.877,"--Well, even the Court of Appeals and--"
1982.81-1863,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1040.877,1042.83,"I am not talking about the Court of Appeals, I am talking about my own opinion."
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1042.83,1043.409,"--Well, of course."
1982.81-1863,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1053.247,1055.699,"I also would not go to one of their meetings, either, I give you my word."
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1055.699,1057.074,I understand.
1982.81-1863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1096.745,1097.933,Mr. Solicitor General--
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1097.933,1098.214,Yes.
1982.81-1863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.214,1098.98,--may I ask one other question--
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1098.98,1099.48,Yes.
1982.81-1863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.48,1100.433,--on this appearance point?
1982.81-1863,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1121.815,1125.343,"Only this, Justice Stevens... I guess two things."
1982.81-1863,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1175.746,1178.026,"Very well, Mr. Solicitor General."
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1182.307,1185.133,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1499.493,1513.612,"Mr. Graber, would you be here if the statute just forbad what it forbids now on the... inside the building or on the steps?"
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1521.156,1522.795,We would have no quarrel with that.
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1526.231,1530.293,"Well, why should the statute be held unconstitutional on its face then?"
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1530.293,1540.508,"--Because the statute is not, we submit, subject to a limiting construction, both because of its vagueness... namely, the time to define--"
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.508,1543.788,"Well, I know, but what... this is a federal statute, and it's a federal court."
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1569.917,1575.384,"--Well, we would submit, Mr. Justice White, that Section 13l--"
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.384,1576.868,Your client would win his case.
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1576.868,1577.837,--Yes.
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.837,1583.149,But the statute wouldn't be... wouldn't be unconstitutional on its face.
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1583.149,1610.481,"We would certainly accept a limiting construction that would make 13k inapplicable to the sidewalk surrounding the Court, but I submit that the better disposition would be to hold that rather than this Court rewriting the statute, that the marshal is provided under 13l with ample authority to promulgate regulations to preserve the decorum and dignity of this Court."
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.368,1634.643,"Why do you think that's a better... better mechanism than to... if Congress could just repass the statute and it's the very same statute but limit it to the steps and the inside of the building, why should we send it back to Congress and make them do that?"
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1634.643,1635.784,--The basic reason--
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.784,1642.282,Because all... all they'd do is say... say the statute is unconstitutional as it might be applied to the sidewalks.
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1642.282,1649.624,"--The basic reason, Your Honor, is that I don't believe this Court's function is to rewrite statutes."
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.747,1657.402,"Well, this Court, after all, the overbreadth doctrine is an invention of this Court."
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1673.91,1675.05,--Yes.
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1683.798,1685.125,But you want more than that.
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1685.125,1698.121,"--Well, I think the first part of this statute presents a prohibition against assemblages and processions, no matter the purpose."
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.496,1737.73,"May I ask, Mr. Graber, what standing do you have to quarrel with the first part of the statute?"
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1738.915,1745.834,"Well, my client has in the past in fact been charged under the first part of that statute."
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.834,1750.536,But none of the incidents in the record would violate the first part of the statute.
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1750.536,1751.442,That's correct.
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.442,1754.956,"In fact, I wonder if they violate the second part of the statute."
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1754.956,1756.455,"I do, too."
1982.81-1863,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.455,1761.048,Did you... did you take the position in the lower court that you didn't even violate the statute?
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1761.048,1770.794,"Well, in fact, Judge Oberdorfer, the District Court Judge, pointed out in his opinion that he did not feel that our client's conduct was--"
1982.81-1863,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1770.794,1772.075,"Well, then how do we even get to a constitutional question?"
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1772.075,1779.118,--Because the marshal's interpretation of the statute is that it does--
1982.81-1863,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1779.118,1779.868,Are we bound by the marshal?
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1779.868,1782.148,"--No, but the--"
1982.81-1863,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1782.148,1791.457,"Because if it's perfectly clear on the face of the statute that your clients didn't violate it, why do we have to have a major constitutional case out of a very petty dispute?"
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1791.457,1801.0,"--Because the fact of the matter is that when my clients are outside on the Court sidewalk, the marshal has told them they have to leave and--"
1982.81-1863,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.0,1808.544,"You then went into a District Court and said he shouldn't do this, and the Judge could have said, you're absolutely right, but he didn't have to decide any constitutional question, did he?"
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1808.544,1817.743,"--No, but if the marshal and the Supreme Court police are free to apply the statute--"
1982.81-1863,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1817.743,1820.055,"Well, they're not if they obey the District Court order that tells them not to."
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1820.055,1825.506,"--Well, the Superior Court placed a limiting construction on the statute, limiting it to the intent to influence."
1982.81-1863,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.881,1828.254,"No, but I am leaving out the intent to influence."
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1843.436,1843.998,"--Well, I agree."
1982.81-1863,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.061,1846.98,So how do we get to any constitutional question?
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1846.98,1851.916,"--Well, the statute is overbroad, we believe, and on its face can be attacked--"
1982.81-1863,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.916,1857.899,"Well, but can some stranger come in and just say, I want to have a statute held unconstitutional even though I didn't violate it and there's no basis for prosecuting me under it?"
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1857.899,1873.643,"--Well, Your Honor, after being threatened with arrest repeatedly, we believe that our client had... has standing under the overbreadth doctrine to attack the statute on its face as applied to persons whose situations are not before the Court as well as to their own situation."
1982.81-1863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.643,1875.736,"Well, you really just want to win your case, don't you?"
1982.81-1863,1,41373,sebastian_kd_graber,,1875.736,1876.251,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1863,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2736.207,2738.612,"Just very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.186,2791.889,"Mr. Solicitor General, do you think these people violated the statute?"
1982.81-1863,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2791.889,2801.711,"I think, Justice Stevens, that insofar as Ms. Grace and her sign are concerned, I think she did."
1982.81-1863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.571,2806.726,"And what is the party, organization, or movement?"
1982.81-1863,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2806.726,2807.007,The device.
1982.81-1863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.007,2812.442,"There is a device, but what did it... was it apt... did it bring into public notice any party, organization, or movement?"
1982.81-1863,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2816.128,2820.659,"The movement, I would say, the party or the movement is the movement that her papers--"
1982.81-1863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2820.659,2822.048,Her sign just quoted the First Amendment.
1982.81-1863,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2822.048,2822.532,--First Amendment.
1982.81-1863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2825.469,2826.11,The First Amendment Movement.
1982.81-1863,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2826.11,2827.796,--The First Amendment Movement.
1982.81-1863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2827.796,2828.999,That's subversive.
1982.81-1863,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2833.355,2850.1,"Her individual view, her individual view, which may have been shared by other people, that this Court is not... is not interpreting in the proper way the provisions of the First Amendment."
1982.81-1863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2850.1,2851.785,Maybe she was applauding our interpretations.
1982.81-1863,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2851.785,2853.348,That is very possible.
1982.81-1863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2857.331,2863.875,"It's certainly difficult for me to identify the party, organization, or movement that that sign... that that sign brings into public notice."
1982.81-1863,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2863.875,2865.5,--Let me say two things.
1982.81-1863,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3117.085,3118.085,"Thank you, gentlemen."
