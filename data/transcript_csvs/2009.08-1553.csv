2009.08-1553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.274,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1553, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. v. Regal-Beloit Corporation, and the consolidated case."
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,12.292,14.382,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,26.723,33.22,"Are you taking -- are you taking a position different than the U.S., that it applies to exports but not imports?"
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,43.542,44.888,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,56.492,57.709,Could you tell me something?
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,69.563,72.296,"There certainly are rail connections between the United States and Mexico, yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,72.296,72.671,There are?
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,72.671,73.544,"Yes, absolutely."
2009.08-1553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,86.994,95.319,I thought the government told us in this -- in that case that Carmack wasn't in the case because it was either waived or something.
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,103.504,105.798,"That's correct, Justice."
2009.08-1553,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,133.85,140.612,"Yes, but uniformity is one thing when you are talking about 50 States and another when it's just two Federal statutes."
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,140.612,142.768,"--That's absolutely true, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,169.24,170.41,"Well, what if -- what if Congress was wrong?"
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,186.012,197.398,"--Your Honor, I think that this Court's task, as always, is to read the statute as a whole, which includes that language that Your Honor characterizes as boilerplate, and also includes the language that we are here to construe."
2009.08-1553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,242.099,247.61,"Those are -- those are two different arguments, right; your rail carrier argument and your pre-1978 argument?"
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,247.61,248.861,"--They are, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,288.032,289.424,So your -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,293.998,300.308,"I -- my client is Union Pacific, but I am here today speaking for both of the Petitioners, ""K"" Line and Union Pacific."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,300.308,301.622,"You have a bit of a conflict, don't you?"
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,308.04,312.35,"For both of us, Your Honor, because that resolves -- actually resolves the case for both ""K"" Line and Union Pacific."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,312.35,314.113,--If it's considered what?
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,315.017,321.283,"""K"" Line -- the statute requires -- to be triggered, it requires a receiving carrier that is a rail carrier."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,345.519,349.095,--Where is that defined in Carmack?
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,357.732,362.945,"--Well, there are -- there is not an explicit definition of the term ""receiving carrier"", Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,371.489,372.959,"That's -- I am trying to find it, statutorily."
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,385.454,388.843,"Well, let's start with the statutory language, if we may."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,400.819,401.134,The only one--
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,401.134,401.696,--That's how--
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,401.696,406.571,--The only one who has -- the board has jurisdiction over is the railroad.
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,410.239,411.893,"--That -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,412.505,417.937,"And so you are the -- you have to be the person -- the railroad has to be the person receiving the goods, correct?"
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,417.937,418.44,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,426.591,427.34,But you are not reading the language.
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,432.292,433.181,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,449.083,453.999,I -- I keep going back to: What language tells me that particular point in the statute?
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,453.999,457.361,--Because otherwise the whole structure of the statute doesn't work.
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,476.149,476.82,That's my problem.
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,476.82,480.241,"--""Receiving carrier"" has always been a term of art in this statute."
2009.08-1553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.437,506.851,"Yes, but not -- not every -- where you are dealing with -- with intermodal transportation, not every receiving -- not every rail carrier would be the receiving rail carrier."
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,508.945,509.288,That--
2009.08-1553,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.288,515.474,"--Your client is the first rail carrier to receive, right?"
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,515.474,518.082,"--It's not how -- that's not how the statute is worded, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,518.616,519.287,Is this the language?
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,535.622,537.029,--Correct.
2009.08-1553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,537.029,538.48,And so that's what it has to do.
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,544.524,545.507,It has always--
2009.08-1553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,545.507,548.491,It does not mean receives from another carrier.
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,548.491,549.645,--It has always meant that.
2009.08-1553,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.645,550.288,Is that right?
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,550.288,551.318,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,608.419,626.473,"I always thought that the purpose of Carmack was to ensure rail responsibility, rail carrier responsibility, so that it was one bill of lading with respect to all railroad connections."
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,630.443,632.958,"That's not quite correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,652.807,653.7,--But on the rail line.
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,653.7,654.901,--On--
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,654.901,657.697,On rail -- on rail transportation.
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,657.697,659.618,"--On any transportation, actually, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,662.582,663.787,Historically you say that?
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,663.787,664.598,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,664.598,685.543,"In the pre-1978 Carmack, there is a -- if you want to take a look at it, it is in page 99a of your petition."
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,709.58,710.581,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,710.581,710.846,So--
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,710.846,713.783,That provision was introduced in the Transportation Act of 1920.
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,727.654,733.604,--So explain to me what happens in domestic water cases.
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,747.346,753.39,"In domestic -- Congress drew a distinction between foreign and domestic commerce for a very long time, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,771.995,775.946,And the railroad is covered by any damage that occurs on land?
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,775.946,789.394,"The railroad is liable on a through transportation basis for the entire trip, but if the damage occurred during the water leg its liability is limited and confined by the law that governs the water leg."
2009.08-1553,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,789.394,795.985,So there already is domestically two different forms of liability protection?
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,795.985,810.523,"Congress made that compromise, because Congress was forced to choose between not having through bills of lading at all domestically or making -- or essentially repealing the Harter Act in circumstances where rail carriers interact with them."
2009.08-1553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,826.097,827.813,Prior to 1978.
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,847.372,851.713,"Your Honor, we don't think that this Court has ever interpreted language of that nature."
2009.08-1553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,865.911,880.343,"It's kind of a difficult -- I mean, if you are a shipper and you are trying to figure out, okay, let's ship some goods, and you pick up the law and it says, well, this is what the law says, who's going to tell you that, well, you may think that's what the law says, but you are really governed by the pre-1978 law."
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,880.343,890.493,"Well, Your Honor, we don't think that it is necessary for this Court to read the statute in a countertextual way."
2009.08-1553,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,927.664,931.24,"I have one question, and I know that your white light is on."
2009.08-1553,0,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,961.351,970.094,"Not exactly, Your Honor, because of course Respondent's position is that Carmack is a mandatory regime; there is no way to contract around it if it applied."
2009.08-1553,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,989.962,992.789,"Thank you, Mr. Ballenger."
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1004.738,1007.58,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2009.08-1553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1106.662,1113.689,"I read -- I read your brief, like your friend's, as relying almost exclusively on the pre-1978 language."
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1113.689,1118.204,"Our brief addressed the first sentence briefly in, I believe, the prior page."
2009.08-1553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.345,1149.688,"Excuse me, what -- what are you referring to now?"
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1149.688,1152.048,62a of the petition appendix.
2009.08-1553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1159.828,1162.027,The Union Pacific petition appendix?
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1162.027,1164.433,--They are both -- both of them are actually the same.
2009.08-1553,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1243.944,1246.537,"We are looking where, now?"
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1246.537,1249.88,--This is back to 69(a) of Carmack.
2009.08-1553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.071,1326.689,"But why -- why doesn't the (2), (a)(2), the delivering rail carrier -- if what you say is true, that should be the delivering rail carrier delivering in a -- in an adjacent foreign country."
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1326.689,1327.753,Correct.
2009.08-1553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.753,1331.282,That -- that limitation is strangely missing from (2).
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1331.282,1337.56,"Well, we believe the portion of (a)(3), which now looks like it's in (a)(3), the"
2009.08-1553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.303,1351.083,Okay.
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1351.676,1356.254,I'm sorry--
2009.08-1553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.254,1357.99,The paragraphing you say is wrong?
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1357.99,1368.687,"--From 5a to 6a, you will see 5a is the 1978 version of Carmack that was enacted in the 1978 codification."
2009.08-1553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.687,1368.889,Right.
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1368.889,1372.796,The current version is reflected on the facing page.
2009.08-1553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.743,1398.05,So all -- you are saying that -- I think what you are saying is that all we have to use the statutory statement that
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1405.892,1408.342,"--Well, I don't know -- you mean the indentation?"
2009.08-1553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.342,1408.938,The indentation.
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1408.938,1410.295,The indentation was inadvertent.
2009.08-1553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.455,1436.437,I'm losing you.
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1437.327,1438.372,--73a.
2009.08-1553,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1445.98,1446.76,Rail carrier.
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1446.76,1448.367,It's a single paragraph.
2009.08-1553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1493.941,1496.534,This may not have anything to do with anything.
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1499.486,1503.016,The STB does not appear in our brief--
2009.08-1553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1503.016,1505.312,It did in the Kirby case just a few years ago.
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1505.312,1506.155,--It did.
2009.08-1553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1516.992,1521.161,Is -- is there a way to -- are you finished?
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1521.161,1521.832,No.
2009.08-1553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1548.223,1555.956,We don't even get into this problem if -- unless the ship line is a rail carrier?
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1555.956,1558.047,In part.
2009.08-1553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1558.873,1559.482,"Well, it says"
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1567.184,1574.226,"--That would take care of the initial carrier, what we believe is the initial receiving carrier in the case, ""K"" Line."
2009.08-1553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1583.16,1586.267,"But mid-carriage -- it only talks about -- they use that word ""received""."
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1590.982,1597.244,I believe the argument is that the first carrier who receives property in the United States would be deemed the receiving carrier.
2009.08-1553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1597.244,1597.962,--That's a separate argument?
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1597.962,1599.148,That's a separate argument.
2009.08-1553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1599.148,1600.334,Did the Ninth Circuit pass on that argument?
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1600.334,1601.523,You would have -- excuse me?
2009.08-1553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1601.523,1603.882,Did the Ninth Circuit pass on that argument?
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1603.882,1605.021,It did not.
2009.08-1553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1605.021,1606.019,It did not.
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1606.019,1607.017,It did not.
2009.08-1553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1607.017,1607.832,So that's not right in front of us?
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1607.832,1609.204,That is correct.
2009.08-1553,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1609.204,1610.016,It's quite different.
2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1610.016,1615.171,It is a different -- but we think it's clearly wrong in light of Carmack's historic purpose.

2009.08-1553,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1621.808,1624.292,Thank you.
2009.08-1553,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1624.292,1639.114,Mr. Frederick.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1639.114,1640.974,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1701.136,1715.443,"Then under that view, I guess that -- that any intermodal transport, China, all the goods coming from China, which tend to move under a single bill of lading, as soon as they get to the United States and go on a train for 50 miles a new bill of lading must issue?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1715.443,1716.02,No.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1717.131,1717.584,Why?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1717.584,1720.239,"--explicitly says, quote:"
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1727.453,1728.998,"All right, so you're saying they don't have to issue--"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1728.998,1729.871,--They do not have to issue--
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1729.871,1730.651,--Fine.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1737.352,1739.133,--That's correct.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1739.133,1739.57,All right.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1770.808,1771.495,That's correct.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1771.495,1772.259,And it's the words
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1816.757,1818.348,"No, it won't, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1818.348,1820.255,"Now, first, is it true what I said?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1825.722,1830.609,"It is not -- it is true and not true, but for different reasons."
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.824,1875.34,So why don't they have to issue a bill of lading?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1896.943,1911.153,"Let me go back -- let me go back to the international point, Justice Breyer, because the railroads argued against an international uniform rule that would apply both to ocean carriage and inland carriage in the Rotterdam rules."
2009.08-1553,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.974,1937.376,"What are you arguing, estoppel?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1937.376,1944.824,"--No, I'm arguing that their position is inconsistent with their representations, and therefore the plain language of the statute--"
2009.08-1553,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.824,1945.292,Which one is right?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1946.197,1946.852,--What I'm--
2009.08-1553,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.852,1947.601,Which one is right?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1951.82,1955.646,--Their earlier -- their earlier position was correct under the plain language of--
2009.08-1553,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.646,1958.8,Why don't you speak to that rather than the fact that they had an earlier position?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1958.8,1966.798,"--The plain language, Justice Scalia, as it is currently enforced I think disposes of the case without any real argument."
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1966.798,1969.874,"Excuse me, can I go back to Justice Breyer's question?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1969.874,1970.342,Yes.
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1970.342,1988.507,"And perhaps, as I understand this, I think we are all forgetting that none of these liability provisions come into play until there is proof that an incident has occurred somewhere, either on a railroad or on the ocean, correct?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1988.507,1989.1,Correct.
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1989.1,1995.815,And so the issue becomes which set of rules governs that particular incident--
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1995.815,1996.833,Correct.
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1996.833,1997.441,--where it happens.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1997.441,1998.252,Correct.
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1998.252,2017.231,"I think Justice Breyer asked you why it made sense that there would be two rules in effect for what happens on the ocean and what happens on land; and if we had it, wouldn't it create great difficulty."
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2019.493,2019.992,Your point was--
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2019.992,2020.932,That's how the world--
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.932,2023.29,"--if it creates such difficulty, why were the railroads in favor of it before?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2023.29,2023.602,--Correct.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2036.737,2037.832,Anything here that says on land?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2041.502,2042.485,"--Well, it's transport--"
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2042.485,2043.877,"In other words, if it's in a ferry boat?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2067.211,2071.567,"--It's the Surface Transportation Board, Justice Breyer, that has the jurisdiction here."
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.567,2075.159,"Yes, but they can't get rid of the thing you like."
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2075.159,2075.705,"No, they can."
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2075.705,2075.97,And--
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2075.97,2076.563,They can.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.563,2077.546,--How do they do it?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2077.546,2079.0,And I want to answer Justice Kennedy's question.
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2103.738,2104.331,Counsel--
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2104.331,2110.594,--is whether there's an American forum for American cargo interests for an American train that is derailed in the United States.
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2111.923,2119.668,--But part of your argument -- you don't rely heavily on your plain language argument when it comes to deciding that these huge ocean vessels are rail carriers.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2119.668,2122.823,"Let me go to that point now, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2172.804,2180.848,So that's a little bit different from your argument that they are a rail carrier because their bill of lading would cover the train ride to Chicago.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2180.848,2182.392,--We didn't make that argument.
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2194.31,2199.789,"If it weren't -- if it weren't for the -- for the track from Long Beach to Los Angeles, you would say then they are not a rail carrier?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2199.789,2212.506,"The argument as the ICC is defined it also looks at things like the multimodal facilities, like the containers, and -- and the holding themselves out as a rail carrier in their advertising."
2009.08-1553,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2215.082,2218.986,"Well, how -- how does the Chief Justice's hypothetical work with the language of the statute?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2228.685,2233.434,"Well, there are -- there are two ways to read the text and resolve the case."
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2267.278,2272.196,"Is your case -- does your case end if we hold that ""K"" Line is not a railroad carrier?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2272.196,2272.586,No.
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2272.586,2273.837,All right.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2273.837,2275.069,"""K"" Line gets out of the case."
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2284.456,2286.955,As a delivering carrier.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2286.955,2287.345,Correct.
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2287.345,2294.188,"Well, unless we hold, as your friends argue on the other side, that they can opt out under 10709."
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2294.188,2303.834,"Well, you would need to reach the question of whether or not exempt carriage under 10502 takes away the option of a 10709 contract."
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2303.834,2308.58,And that's a different question with respect to liability and claims than with respect to venue.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2308.58,2309.126,Correct.
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2311.173,2316.874,Could I just -- just briefly before you answer the Justice -- the Chief.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2316.874,2317.795,Sure.
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2317.795,2325.386,"In what capacity -- ""K"" Line is the contracting party with Union Pacific."
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2330.807,2332.289,Under the--
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2332.289,2335.63,"If ""K"" Line is -- is the shipper."
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2335.63,2337.709,--Directly under the Carmack Amendment.
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2377.679,2380.786,Regardless of whether the shipment was by them directly or not?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2380.786,2382.736,"Correct, if they caused the damage."
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2385.096,2391.031,Maybe now you could respond to my question about the distinction under 10502 between claims and liability and venue.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2391.031,2391.499,Yes.
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2481.413,2492.254,"Well, but it's a little -- I mean, am looking at page 64a of the petition appendix, where they are saying you can't exempt through contractual terms for liability and claims."
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2503.094,2509.044,"No -- well, liability, Your Honor, is where you can bring your suit and what your suit--"
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2509.044,2511.056,"No, the liability is not where you can bring your suit."
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2514.839,2536.267,"--The -- the way the board has construed this in the letter brief that they filed in the -- in the Second Circuit, which is entitled to our deference, says the Ninth Circuit in Regal-Beloit got it right with respect to the interplay between 10502, 10709, and -- and contract carriage."
2009.08-1553,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2536.267,2536.704,Wait.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2542.514,2542.639,No--
2009.08-1553,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.639,2548.932,I think most of my colleagues would not defer to a letter brief in this case.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2553.604,2557.865,--That is what this Court held--

2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2571.533,2572.672,--In that case.
2009.08-1553,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2572.672,2573.421,In that case.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2575.047,2584.979,"But I don't know why -- it's a distinction without a difference, because here the Second Circuit invited the views of the STB to tell us: What do you think is the interplay between these various provisions?"
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.291,2594.697,There are two things here I don't understand.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2620.839,2622.2,Those are the chassis.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2625.605,2625.839,Okay.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2702.304,2702.413,--No.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2702.413,2704.66,"Now, explain to me: What is it that gets us out of that?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2704.66,2708.301,There -- the -- COGSA applies tackle to tackling.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2710.641,2711.503,Yes.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2711.503,2713.469,The STB has no jurisdiction over that.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2717.123,2718.172,"Well, where does it say that?"

2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2732.803,2733.427,--Good.

2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2749.407,2750.452,That's COGSA.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2751.591,2751.968,--Right.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2751.968,2753.7,So what gets us out of Carmack?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2753.7,2760.778,Carmack only applies if it is carriage and transportation within the STB's jurisdiction.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2765.445,2771.942,Then why are we suing -- why are we suing -- why does the ship being sued here?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2771.942,2775.596,"The ship is performing two different functions, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2789.619,2791.776,Is that because they have contracted for them?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2791.776,2792.962,They own them.
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2792.962,2796.679,"Well, they don't own Union Pacific's rail line."
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2796.679,2799.599,"No, they own the containers that Union Pacific is pulling."
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2799.599,2806.802,"So if I -- if I own a container being pulled by somebody else's train, I'm in the train business?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2806.802,2813.938,"Under the definition of functionality, where that is part of how the STB regulates."
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2823.416,2823.728,"No, it wouldn't."
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2833.162,2849.813,"But they -- well, at one level, Mr. Chief Justice, it's sort of academic, because the STB exempted from Part A, which includes the Carmack Amendment, those containers, and it did so in an exemption order which we cited in our -- in our brief."
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2853.092,2856.905,I think -- I am a little bit confused now.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2877.601,2878.428,No.
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2882.845,2889.83,So what about -- what is it that you're arguing makes them a railroad carrier once they put it there.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2916.038,2927.831,"--And can I just add to the hypothetical the fact, which is an important fact: Did the rail carrier hold itself out to the public as a rail carrier in making the contract with the original shipper?"
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2949.929,2954.334,So it's not merely that it has possession of the container that it has dropped somewhere.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2959.018,2962.657,--I think that's the best way to understand the statute.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2962.657,2965.032,Can we go back one more second?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2998.427,3003.064,"Well, the -- on 62A, the petition appendix defines the general jurisdiction."
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3003.064,3012.356,And it includes transport just as you defined it between the United States and another place -- United States and a place in a foreign country.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3012.356,3012.73,Yes.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3012.73,3013.624,So that's what this is.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3016.683,3019.167,"And at (a)(2) -- will you look at (a)(2), please?"
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3026.507,3032.127,"Oh, sorry, between a place in -- oh, transportation in the United States."
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3032.127,3032.63,In the United States.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3032.63,3033.925,Between a place in.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3033.925,3034.33,Exactly.
2009.08-1553,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3034.33,3034.845,Thank you.
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3034.845,3036.096,"Yes, thank you."
2009.08-1553,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.144,3214.722,Can I ask you a question about -- about whether -- whether the shipper becomes a rail carrier?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3250.286,3255.425,"I would -- I would concede the point of interchange at the port, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1553,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3269.948,3273.589,And you say here they own rail lines that--
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3273.589,3274.993,There are 60--
2009.08-1553,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3274.993,3275.648,--that go for--
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3275.648,3279.352,"--Well, there was no discovery because this was decided on the pleadings as a matter of law."
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3295.875,3299.482,"When you say ""engaging in"", are you talking about vis-à-vis this shipment?"
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3299.482,3300.39,Yes.
2009.08-1553,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3300.39,3301.077,Or is it just in general?
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3302.06,3303.451,That's correct.
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3348.994,3355.084,"Well, they -- they can't contract around liability for an event such as the one that happened here."
2009.08-1553,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3367.08,3367.969,--That's correct.
2009.08-1553,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3443.109,3443.83,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-1553,3,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3446.061,3449.762,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2009.08-1553,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3595.369,3606.159,How -- how do you get out of the language that says that a rail carrier providing transportation shall issue a receipt for property it receives?
2009.08-1553,3,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3610.296,3611.248,--The--
2009.08-1553,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3611.248,3624.651,"And therefore, it should have issued -- since you agree it's the receiving character, it should have -- it should have issued a -- a bill of lading, that then, if it's within Carmack as I've just tried to put it, requires it to have certain things in it that they say aren't there."
2009.08-1553,3,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3624.651,3628.43,--Under the definition a rail carrier is a party providing railroad transportation.
2009.08-1553,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3628.773,3640.706,"Yes, right; and now we see a rail carrier; we've got the definition there; and it includes somebody who provides intermodal equipment and you look at transportation and transportation includes services related to that equipment."
2009.08-1553,3,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3640.706,3647.533,--The definitions of railroad and transportation have always been defined to include all of the equipment used by a real railroad.
2009.08-1553,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3651.967,3653.168,"Ah, now all right."
2009.08-1553,3,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3653.531,3660.012,--the purpose of -- the purpose of those definitions from 1906 on is to make sure that railroads couldn't evade rate regulation by overcharging for the use of a bridge.
2009.08-1553,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3660.012,3673.192,"But, now just give me how -- what I would write in the opinion that would in fact -- because what they did here, the ship, is it took the container and put it on the train."
2009.08-1553,3,29030,j_scott_ballenger,,3678.207,3688.876,"A party providing rail common carrier transportation, the scope of the -- of that transportation is defined to include a container."
2009.08-1553,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3703.351,3704.162,"Thank you, counsel."
