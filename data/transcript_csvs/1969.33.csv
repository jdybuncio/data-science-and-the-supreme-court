1969.33,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.405,Sullivan against Little Hunting Park Incorporated.
1969.33,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,14.829,18.809,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,421.058,423.82,Was this the first time he had rented that house?
1969.33,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,423.82,441.909,"No, this was not, he would have three prior tenants and on one and he had made a practice of assigning the swimming -- or the association membership share and at least the record shows that share has always been -- the assignments had always been approved by the Board of Directors."
1969.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,441.909,443.725,With respect to three previous times?
1969.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,443.725,447.668,Yes.
1969.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,470.671,482.676,Is there any remaining issue as to the question of the motivation for disapproval?
1969.33,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,483.205,485.299,"No, there is no question -- I beg your pardon."
1969.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,485.299,492.656,Is there any claim now there was any reason other than the fact that the applicant was a Negro that the membership --
1969.33,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,492.656,495.808,"So far as I know, there is no such claim sir."
1969.33,1,30693,john_charles_harris,,1418.23,1420.194,May it please the Court.
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3362.798,3381.496,I would simply like to say that with respect to the question of the attributes here that suggest that this membership in this association maybe an incident of land or real property.
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3390.635,3395.264,But the bylaws don't say that being a resident in the area is the only qualification for membership.
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3395.264,3397.288,"No, they do not."
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.288,3406.981,And the Board of Directors still has to pass on applications for membership although applications according to bylaws are limited to residence.
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3406.981,3408.676,"That's correct, yes sir."
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.604,3425.095,"Because there is something in the record that indicates that residents of these areas, specified areas automatically qualified for membership?"
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3425.095,3430.359,"No, they do not automatically, they were always subject tp condition of approval by the board, is that what you mean?"
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3430.359,3441.135,"Yes, but at also -- but is there something in the record indicates that the board automatically gave approval to residents?"
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3441.135,3444.319,"Well, record shows that --"
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3444.319,3454.062,May perhaps the board had the right to approve them but does the record shows that this is an automatic matter residence of these specified areas qualified in membership without more?
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3454.062,3465.875,"Well, going to the -- to be accept that we pointed it out on page seven of our brief that there had been 1183 shares, membership shares issued in this corporation."
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.875,3467.3,Is that in the record?
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3467.3,3472.15,"Yes sir, pages 125 to 126, I believe."
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.713,3476.368,Has there ever been any rejections?
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3476.368,3486.998,Only the -- the record only suggest as Mr. Harris indicated that there was one possible rejection at one time because there is no indication of the record is why that rejection occurred.
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.998,3492.635,Do you agree with him that people who are not residents of these specified areas may apply for membership?
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3492.635,3502.228,"There is some evidence in the record, yes that people who do not belong why residence in those areas may apply."
1969.33,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3596.975,3604.126,"May I ask you a question, I don't hink on the merits, but how far is this club of Hunting town?"
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3604.126,3621.372,It's about four miles south of there -- sir about three or four mile south near Fort Hunt Road and it's about half way between Hunting Towers and Mt. Vernon off of Fort Hunt Road.
1969.33,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3636.513,3638.784,Is that the name of the locality of Buck Hill?
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3638.784,3640.069,"No, Bucknell."
1969.33,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3640.069,3640.798,Bucknell?
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3640.798,3644.389,"Yes, it -- that's correct Bucknell."
1969.33,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3644.389,3648.07,"Before we get away from that procedural point, could you tell me this."
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3669.168,3682.523,"Well, the question I think as I would read the decisions is whether the State Court denied the appeals in this case on arbitrary grounds."
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3705.164,3713.066,"But the consequences if we don't agree for the State Court what we would say is, this not an adequate state ground and we didn't get to the merits here."
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3713.066,3713.76,Correct.
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3713.76,3715.317,They would be remand it.
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3715.317,3717.052,"That's right, that's correct."
1969.33,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3791.758,3802.812,"For you to have a decree I understood from your adversary that the Court haven't pass on the merits of the case, is that right or not?"
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3802.812,3819.89,The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals refuse to accept the appeals and therefore it's no different in a situation where a highest Court in the exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction decides that it won't review the case and that's what the Court did here in effect.
1969.33,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3836.184,3842.463,But the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia has never touched the merits.
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3850.658,3855.097,"So, the Court -- you already tried to do that once with all due regard due respect."
1969.33,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3855.751,3855.906,"Well, sometimes that --"
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3855.906,3868.978,You try that once you told the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals to take the case back reconsider it on the merits in the light on Jones versus Alfred H. Mayer Company and that Court refused to comply with this Court's mandate.
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3899.489,3906.339,Could I ask you how may other swimming pools there are in the subdivision listed in the bylaws?
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3906.339,3911.577,There are none and to my knowledge in the subdivisions listed in these bylaws.
1969.33,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3911.577,3913.673,Private or public either one?
1969.33,2,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3913.673,3919.338,Private or public neither.
1969.33,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3919.338,3920.069,Thank you.
