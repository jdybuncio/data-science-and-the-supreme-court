1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,110.988,116.346,Litigation arose by a voluntary faction upon the part of the Reid's.
1974.73-1541,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,121.742,124.714,After they had two children?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,124.714,140.954,"Yes, Yes after they had two children, they presented themselves in Hartford before the service and since that date they have filed their annual report."

1974.73-1541,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,163.209,165.018,Three or four years?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,166.699,170.627,"No, about two years after their entry."
1974.73-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,200.362,207.951,Does the record show either why they happened to come in at Chula Vista or how they ended up in Connecticut?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,207.951,213.462,The record does not show.
1974.73-1541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.711,336.775,What have they been employed in?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,338.267,348.094,"They are working in factories, bench hands, machine hands and they've been gainfully employed at all the -- there throughout the period."
1974.73-1541,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,348.094,350.579,"How long they had been in Hartford, have they been in Hartford the whole --"
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,350.579,352.188,"They are in Danbury, Connecticut."
1974.73-1541,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.188,352.235,Alright.
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,352.235,356.048,They've been there since very shortly after their entry.
1974.73-1541,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,356.048,357.484,They entered --
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,357.484,359.539,"They entered at Chula Vista, California."
1974.73-1541,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,359.539,360.582,"From Mexico, did they not?"
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,360.582,362.177,That's correct.
1974.73-1541,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,362.177,365.797,And does the record show what brought them up to New England?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,365.797,378.22,The record does not show but they have had friends in the area and after they entered they've decided that they would make their life in the Connecticut area where they have friends.
1974.73-1541,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,378.22,382.422,Exactly what was the fraud?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,382.422,391.382,"That they were claimed to be US citizens when in fact they were not US citizens and on the basis of their claim, they were admitted."
1974.73-1541,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,391.382,394.214,They claimed that to the immigration authorities?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,394.214,406.556,"Yes, they presented themselves to the US immigration authorities at Chula Vista and announced themselves as US citizens and were then admitted."
1974.73-1541,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,406.556,412.159,I suppose there's no official contemporaneous record of that is there because that would just be an oral representation?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,412.159,413.643,"That's correct, an oral representation."
1974.73-1541,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.643,418.23,"So, what we have is their -- is their statement that that is what they announced --"
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,418.23,418.919,That is correct.
1974.73-1541,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.919,419.738,-- is that it?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,419.738,429.284,That is correct but this has been found in the record by the special inquiry officer that they were --
1974.73-1541,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,429.284,430.657,That that is in fact how they --
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,430.657,431.032,That is correct.
1974.73-1541,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,431.032,433.049,-- entered the United States?
1974.73-1541,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,433.049,449.668,"Now, if they had disclosed at that time that they were citizens, British citizens of Honduras, then what would have happened to them at that time?"
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,449.668,452.768,Then they probably would not have been admitted.
1974.73-1541,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,458.365,460.604,They have to go back to the consul and --
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,460.604,462.01,To the US consul in --
1974.73-1541,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,462.01,462.167,Honduras --
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,462.167,463.022,British Honduras.
1974.73-1541,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,463.022,464.26,And try to get a Visa?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,464.26,465.384,That is correct.
1974.73-1541,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,465.384,474.184,"They definitely show that they either had employment assured here or that they had means of support here and a great many other things will have to be demonstrated, would they not?"
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,474.184,474.97,"Well, yes."
1974.73-1541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.051,760.85,How were the petitioners otherwise admissible for purposes of the statute?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,760.85,763.663,"In the record, --"
1974.73-1541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.663,769.804,Now you told us earlier that they could -- not possibly qualify for a Visa even if they've had laborers?
1974.73-1541,0,17640,benjamin_globman,,769.804,801.594,"Only under labor certification that they would have had to wait for a Visa until sometime late in the future but at the factual situation, at the time of their entry, the quota for six preference, they had to come in under the sub quota of Great Britain and there are only 200 Visas issued annually under this sub quota and they would be in the six preference have they had a labor certification."
