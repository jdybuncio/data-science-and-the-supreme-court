1989.88-1198,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.31,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1198, Federal Trade Commission v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association and vice versa."
1989.88-1198,0,22519,ernest_j_isenstadt,,28.6,31.793,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,222.837,225.037,"Counsel, could you... just a preliminary question."
1989.88-1198,0,22519,ernest_j_isenstadt,,228.6,229.571,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,229.571,232.413,Suppose just three attorneys agreed that they would do this.
1989.88-1198,0,22519,ernest_j_isenstadt,,235.325,256.319,"Technically, Your Honor, if three attorneys agreed among themselves, of course any attorney in the exercise of his own individual judgment may refuse to accept case assignments, but if three attorneys agreed, that would be per se unlawful... agreed that they would not accept assignments until the price was increased."
1989.88-1198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,260.652,270.438,"Well, the reason I ask it, because you do indicate that you had looked to the actual market effect of what occurred in order to prove that there was a boycott."
1989.88-1198,0,22519,ernest_j_isenstadt,,270.438,281.705,"Your Honor, the Commission found both that the boycott was unlawful per se and under rule of reason analysis, and we think it was correct on both counts."
1989.88-1198,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.922,318.38,xxx boycott do you... you just have an agreement... we just won't work for any less than a certain amount?
1989.88-1198,0,22519,ernest_j_isenstadt,,318.38,320.04,"It's price-fixing boycott, Your Honor."
1989.88-1198,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,592.348,599.541,"If you show... if that is shown before the Commission pursuant to the court of appeals' remand, the Commission would prevail, I guess."
1989.88-1198,0,22519,ernest_j_isenstadt,,599.541,604.055,"The problem, Your Honor, is it was shown in the court of appeals."
1989.88-1198,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,611.64,614.672,What did the court of appeals say you would need to show?
1989.88-1198,0,22519,ernest_j_isenstadt,,614.672,618.245,We're not really certain.
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1282.701,1290.315,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1382.926,1385.928,"What types of boycotts, Mr. Tom?"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1395.254,1404.75,"--Well, the FTC approaches the characterization of this conduct as... as price-fixing in a somewhat peculiar fashion."
1989.88-1198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1404.75,1408.543,"Well, both the Federal Trade Commission and the court of appeals found it was price-fixing, did they not?"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1408.543,1411.254,Your Honor--
1989.88-1198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.254,1412.195,Did they not?
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1412.195,1413.177,"--Your Honor, they did."
1989.88-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1481.03,1498.693,"Mr. Tom, if we take that approach, your... brief suggests that, you know, it can sort of be limited to these situations where the government is somehow the objective, or the object of the activity, so that it has a Noerr coloration to it."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1543.432,1578.886,"Justice Scalia, the Noerr doctrine is based both in the First Amendment and in an examination of the Sherman Act and its legislative history and its purposes, and I think it recognizes that there is something special about the legislative process, and that the types of consequences that are likely to flow from conduct directed at the legislature is different from the kinds of consequences that you see in private commercial markets."
1989.88-1198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.44,1616.87,"Do... it would be all right for a bunch of steel suppliers to boycott the legislature, to boycott selling to a particular state, even though... as long as they had a campaign going on to raise the prices that that state would pay for the steel?"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1620.934,1645.731,"Your Honor, under... there is a rule which is one that we did not... that my client, the Association, did not propound, did not urge on you in the brief, that would say that if you have a public boycott aimed at the legislature, it is by that fact alone simply not within the scope of the antitrust laws."
1989.88-1198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.731,1647.531,You say there is a rule.
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1648.272,1649.972,I would say it is a potential rule--
1989.88-1198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.972,1651.784,"--Oh, a possibility of a rule."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1651.784,1671.788,"--one that could be adopted, and one that could reasonably be adopted because it is limited first by the fact that Congress, or any legislative body, could draw the line in a different place, that is, it is a rule of statutory construction and does not require you to reach the constitutional question in the first instance."
1989.88-1198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.909,1702.088,"The situation here is where a public body is going to set the price that is going to be paid for services it gets, so there is just only going to be one price."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1730.075,1732.756,"That... that is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.802,1764.977,"But the per se rule, I take it is... is... it is so often that price-fixing is so often fatal to competition, that what is treated per se."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1764.977,1766.179,--That is right.
1989.88-1198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.702,1775.895,Because these... these lawyers just aren't... don't compete.
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1775.895,1778.517,These lawyers don't compete.
1989.88-1198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.14,1803.683,"Well, who... how are individual lawyers chosen for individual cases?"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1803.683,1817.871,"The lawyers call in in the morning to volunteer for new cases, and assuming that they are... at the time of this case, they would generally get a case in response to any volunteering."
1989.88-1198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.213,1839.787,"So there is some degree of competition among the lawyers, who calls first on the telephone?"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1839.787,1842.779,"Well, that was about the extent of the competition, Your Honor."
1989.88-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1842.779,1852.326,"May I ask, on this no competition principle, what about doctors supplying services for Medicaid or something like that?"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1866.036,1868.617,They are in competition in a sense.
1989.88-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1873.069,1876.662,Is it a different sense from the way in which these lawyers are in competition?
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1876.662,1895.085,"--I think the difference, Your Honor, is not so much whether they were in competition in a formal sense, but... whether the facts and circumstances here indicate any possibility of the exercise of market power."
1989.88-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.266,1900.448,"Well, how can you say there is no possibility?"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1902.378,1903.569,--Well--
1989.88-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1903.569,1908.913,"I mean, maybe it wasn't caused by it, but surely there is a possibility there was some causal connection between the two events."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1908.913,1909.674,--That is right.
1989.88-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.649,1920.1,Right.
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1926.154,1928.756,The rule--
1989.88-1198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1928.756,1932.989,Performing services pursuant to a statute that authorizes reimbursement pursuant to fixed schedules.
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1932.989,1947.688,"--The bright-line rule that... that I stated a moment ago, which was urged on you by the individual Respondents in this case, would include those... that kind of hypothetical."
1989.88-1198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1947.688,1952.052,"Well, but at least in the doctors case the patients are choosing the doctors--"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1952.052,1953.162,That is true.
1989.88-1198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.162,1956.725,--And the doctors are competing with one another to be chosen by patients.
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1961.857,1967.291,"That is correct, Your Honor, and that is why I think there is a third potential rule--"
1989.88-1198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.291,1972.726,"And so, this case is no different than we are choosing lawyers by lot."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,1976.477,2000.804,"--And that distinction, I think, is only one of may distinctions that could be drawn here, which is why the Association proposed in its brief a third possible rule: that one could hold that while lack of self interest or lack of market power should each be sufficient to characterize the conduct as political, they should not be the only means of demonstrating the political context and nature of the conduct."
1989.88-1198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2000.804,2005.215,Who is in competition with the court?
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2005.215,2009.068,"There is no one in competition with the court, Your Honor."
1989.88-1198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2009.068,2011.109,Who is in competition with the lawyers?
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2011.109,2019.627,"The... there is no one in competition with the lawyers, except in the sense--"
1989.88-1198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2019.627,2025.129,"Well, don't we have somebody to be in competition, to get you involved?"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2025.129,2030.393,"--That... there are... I... I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last part of the question."
1989.88-1198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2030.393,2036.887,Don't we have to have somebody in competition with somebody in order to get you involved?
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2036.887,2039.289,In order to get the antitrust laws involved?
1989.88-1198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2039.289,2039.89,Yes.
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2039.89,2042.221,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2044.041,2049.166,"Well, now, tell me... tell me who is in competition with who, that gives you a standing?"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2049.166,2064.868,--The FTC's position is that all of the CJA lawyers were in competition with each other in the sense that they could decide or not decide to offer their services.
1989.88-1198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2064.868,2068.6,The group that raises the competition point is all in competition with itself?
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2075.925,2080.009,"Your Honor, I am sorry, I don't entirely understand the import of your question."
1989.88-1198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2082.261,2089.313,"Well, isn't competition necessary for you, the antitrust division--"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2091.877,2098.209,"--I am representing the lawyers, Your Honor, the... people who went on strike in this case."
1989.88-1198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2098.209,2101.531,"--Well, you can give me... there is no bar to you giving me some help."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2103.334,2119.283,"I confess, I don't fully understand why the FTC thinks that there is the kind of competitive harm here that calls the antitrust laws into play entirely."
1989.88-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.283,2119.824,That makes two of us.
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2166.804,2169.156,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2181.394,2193.301,"Well, that may be, but... but it regards people as being in competition with one another, and proper subjects for application of the common law, whether or not they effectively can compete."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2195.142,2212.476,"Whether or not, Your Honor, the lawyers are regarded as being in competition in some form, I would suggest that the principles of Noerr and Allied Tube would characterize this conduct as political, regardless of whether it is in competition or not."
1989.88-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2212.476,2218.867,"All I am saying is, you... you have been talking about whether they are in competition as equating that with whether they have market power."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2221.281,2225.332,"If I said that, Your Honor, I misspoke."
1989.88-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2225.332,2226.975,--That is what I... that is how I thought this discussion was going.
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2226.975,2227.974,I think they are separate points.
1989.88-1198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.857,2270.832,"Is market power... if you don't have market power, you haven't violated the rule of reason?"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2275.946,2277.578,--No.
1989.88-1198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.105,2314.0,But it... it rejected the claim that this kind of an agreement was a per se violation of the antitrust laws?
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2314.0,2319.235,"In effect, that... that is the result of what it did."
1989.88-1198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.898,2338.085,"I would think that if on remand they can't, unless market power, whatever that means... if that isn't proven, there is no violation of the antitrust laws at all?"
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2338.085,2341.448,"--Your Honor, I think that would be the appropriate result here."
1989.88-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.448,2366.635,"Mr. Tom, under... I don't see why, under O'Brien, it isn't equally attractive to say if you have a people, a group of people who have no market power staging a buying or a selling boycott against a particular private company, just to get press attention, that that should be immune from the normal per se rule."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2366.635,2368.477,But I don't think you have--
1989.88-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.477,2370.948,"Not just the government, but any private company."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2374.291,2380.584,--But I don't think you have to reach the O'Brien analysis because this case can be decided under Noerr.
1989.88-1198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.584,2396.095,"Oh, I suppose, but the principle, the principle you are asking us to buy into is as applicable to the... to the First Amendment expression of objection to what a private individual is doing as it is to the First Amendment expression of the right to petition the government."
1989.88-1198,1,46378,willard_k_tom,,2396.095,2410.196,"Well, and yet Trucking Unlimited said that the legislature is unique and that the... that even administrative bodies or courts are different from legislatures in that regard."
1989.88-1198,2,22519,ernest_j_isenstadt,,2963.596,2969.81,"I won't use them all, Your Honor, but there was some discussion as to whether the lawyers competed here."
1989.88-1198,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3012.567,3019.411,Back in the '30s they paid the lawyers nothing in the District of Columbia.
1989.88-1198,2,22519,ernest_j_isenstadt,,3019.411,3020.854,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
1989.88-1198,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3020.854,3022.725,So you don't need any money to get them.
1989.88-1198,2,22519,ernest_j_isenstadt,,3022.725,3034.943,"--The... I think the question here, Your Honor, is not how much the District ought to be paying lawyers under CJA, it is the process by which those rates are established."
1989.88-1198,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3114.234,3115.827,"Thank you, Mr. Isenstadt."
