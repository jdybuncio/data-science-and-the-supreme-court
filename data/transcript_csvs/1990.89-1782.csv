1990.89-1782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.089,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1782, David Hoffman v. Native Village of Noatak and Circle Village."
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,30.957,35.018,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,126.794,132.104,"Mr. Lee, you are addressing, of course, the sovereign immunity point."
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,162.341,163.684,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.706,190.533,Is injunctive relief sought here?
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,196.717,197.998,--We think not.
1990.89-1782,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,322.168,323.791,But isn't it true--
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,327.352,328.149,That is correct.
1990.89-1782,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,328.149,330.023,And I really wonder why.
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,330.023,350.764,"Coming back to this concession, and I really do regard it as a concession by the respondents, that the Constitution makers simply did not have the Indian tribes in view, that acknowledged fact supports the petitioner and not the respondents."
1990.89-1782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,361.683,363.276,"Mr. Lee, can I ask this question?"
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,369.851,370.21,Both.
1990.89-1782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,370.21,377.441,"Because if it's the latter, then of course the, the Constitutional Convention business would be irrelevant."
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,377.441,378.191,That is correct.
1990.89-1782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,378.191,378.629,Yeah.
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,378.629,379.707,That is correct.
1990.89-1782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.578,435.794,"The States were at least as... at as high a degree of dignity, so to speak, as the Indian tribes?"
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,435.794,436.824,"Oh, much higher."
1990.89-1782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.824,438.683,"Well, but all you have to show is--"
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,438.683,439.979,Insofar as the plan of the convention is concerned.
1990.89-1782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,439.979,440.229,--Yes.
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,440.229,440.713,"Yes, yes."
1990.89-1782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,443.4,447.32,Of course States can sue each other.
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,447.32,448.553,That is correct.
1990.89-1782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.062,468.638,Of course that one is specifically referred to in the Constitution.
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,468.638,469.763,--What is that?
1990.89-1782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.763,472.075,The fact that States can sue each other.
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,472.075,472.981,That is correct.
1990.89-1782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,528.053,530.24,Monaco against Mississippi was wrongly--
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,530.24,530.832,--Exactly.
1990.89-1782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.287,840.66,"--Mr. Lee, do you think your argument is entirely consistent with our holding in Nevada against Hall?"
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,840.66,844.659,--Now that's one I hadn't thought of.
1990.89-1782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,850.891,851.282,The citizen of--
1990.89-1782,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,851.282,851.828,"--Yeah, I remember."
1990.89-1782,1,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,1194.673,1200.437,May it please the Court.
1990.89-1782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1286.385,1290.728,Or on any other claim that the United States chooses to bring.
1990.89-1782,1,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,1290.728,1291.29,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1291.29,1293.368,It isn't peculiar to Indian claims.
1990.89-1782,1,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,1293.368,1293.79,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1318.499,1324.98,"You say that it makes no difference who the plaintiff in those suits is, whether it's the United States or some group of Indians?"
1990.89-1782,1,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,1324.98,1325.855,That is correct.
1990.89-1782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.785,1428.814,"I don't think they really expected the Creeks and the Choctaws to hire a lawyer, do you?"
1990.89-1782,1,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,1428.814,1438.966,"I think they did, Your Honor, for this reason, and I cite Justice Stevens' dissent in Oneida v. Oneida, where they quoted George Washington's speech to the Senecas."
1990.89-1782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1517.42,1518.029,Pardon me.
1990.89-1782,1,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,1530.538,1553.732,"--That is true, Your Honor, but following that reasoning, one could say that State versus State... Federal jurisdiction over State versus States disputes was not essential to the constitutional plan either, because it took until 1892, 100 years later, before you first decided that one."
1990.89-1782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.732,1557.105,Maybe we should recognize one set each 100 years.
1990.89-1782,1,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,1557.105,1558.589,This is the year.
1990.89-1782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.834,1613.973,"You mean suing on behalf of the Indians, don't you?"
1990.89-1782,1,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,1613.973,1614.348,Yes.
1990.89-1782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.438,1707.202,"Mr. Aschenbrenner, does your... is this a two-way street that you're urging?"
1990.89-1782,1,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,1711.934,1714.214,"All right, we'll get to that point right now, Your Honor."
1990.89-1782,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2934.223,2940.048,"I'll only use one of them for just two brief points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.765,3024.966,"May I ask you one question, Mr. Lee, since you've got a couple of minutes left?"
1990.89-1782,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3034.447,3036.618,It would make it completely comparable to Nevada v. Hall.
1990.89-1782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3036.618,3036.868,--Correct.
1990.89-1782,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3045.865,3050.675,"I will give you the answer, though I will say that I am uncertain."
1990.89-1782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3050.675,3051.19,Right.
1990.89-1782,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3051.19,3056.516,My... my reaction is it would probably be California law.
1990.89-1782,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3056.516,3059.343,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
