1970.507,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.413,"We'll hear arguments next in Number 507, California against Judith Java and others."
1970.507,0,16803,asher_rubin,,35.869,41.183,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.507,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,227.449,229.707,"That is not an issue for as, is it?"
1970.507,0,16803,asher_rubin,,229.707,230.358,No Your Honor.
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1551.497,1554.599,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1600.833,1602.442,Yes we do.
1970.507,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1602.442,1603.702,What's that figure again?
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1603.702,1611.672,"Well, first it takes three-and-a-half to three to -- three to four-and-a-half weeks for an initial eligibility determination to be made."
1970.507,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1633.704,1640.897,"Now this delay is limited to this margin of 2% of the cases, is that, is that correct?"
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1640.897,1643.512,This delay is limited at present.
1970.507,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.915,1661.693,But the other 98% involves many more hundreds of thousand maybe.
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1661.693,1663.564,That's correct.
1970.507,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1663.564,1668.041,"Let me ask the same question, I asked your opponent."
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1675.696,1678.657,That of course is not this case where payments are commenced.
1970.507,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1678.657,1680.601,I'm asking you the question however.
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1680.601,1683.549,I believe that would be unconstitutional in California.
1970.507,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.352,1712.331,"You disagree with your opponent, when you say this is a thorough investigation, he says it's an interview in an office desk."
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1712.331,1719.076,"Yeah, I disagree completely and the District Court made a finding of fact that it was indeed a thorough investigation."
1970.507,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.199,1774.029,(Inaudible)
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1774.029,1777.325,"Well, the statistics seem to indicate that it's done as a --"
1970.507,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.325,1784.194,(Inaudible)
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1784.194,1785.235,"No, not at all."
1970.507,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.025,1809.267,"Well, so how thorough is that investigation, that the employer lost most of their appeals?"
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1809.267,1815.102,"The fact that employers lose most of their appeals Mr. Justice White, means that the investigation is very thorough."
1970.507,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.796,1831.49,"When you use the term “most” you say, what does it amount in fact, two-thirds?"
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1831.49,1835.548,"In 1969, 64% of employer appeals were denied."
1970.507,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.548,1840.197,"Well, it's a majority but it isn't 98%, is it?"
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1840.197,1856.499,"No it's not but -- that means that those 5,900 claimants in 1969 who were found ineligible at the initial determination and then were found eligible again upon the referee's appeal, received no benefits during the time they were entitled to receive them."
1970.507,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.499,1860.388,Well you‘re using big figures here because California is a big state.
1970.507,1,41009,stephen_p_berzon,,1864.923,1866.436,That's correct.
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3325.904,3329.042,Thank you Your Honor.
1970.507,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3348.238,3349.651,When the state does what?
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3349.651,3358.392,When the state suspends payments to the claimants after the initial interview once the employer appeals.
1970.507,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3358.392,3366.762,(Inaudible)
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3366.762,3374.201,"Your Honor, you asked that question of Mr. Berzon, the answer is that the employer is definitely affected."
1970.507,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3403.769,3405.391,This is true for every individual employee--
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3405.391,3409.854,"Just for the -- for all the employers, not his individual account."
1970.507,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.854,3411.52,(Inaudible)
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3411.52,3424.021,"That's correct our Honor but let me just refer you to a, the appendix 50 to 52, and the appendix 75 to 76."
1970.507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3455.678,3468.67,"Well, if we assume that that's the central issue, Mr. Berzon doesn't reach that statute on the statutory scheme before it's a basis for disposing the case, of course, we're going to dispose it on that basis."
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3468.67,3476.872,"Yes Your Honor, and Mr. Justice Harlan opposed that early in my argument and I've been considering that."
1970.507,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3505.956,3514.552,Do you mean that it violates the due process when the person against whom a the judgment is rendered and paid off that second?
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3514.552,3516.807,"Well Your Honor, no."
1970.507,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3520.333,3524.308,You are just talking about due process so that was what you are arguing.
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3524.308,3537.205,"Well, Your Honor we are saying that when a person wins at a Trial Court let's say and gets a judgment, he's not entitled to be paid right then in a tort judgment let's say."
1970.507,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3547.035,3552.949,"I can understand your argument now, that -- I didn't understand what you said --"
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3552.949,3554.333,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1970.507,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3603.832,3614.099,"What is the subject matter at most, what is the claim of most of these employer appeals, does it have to do with the circumstances under which the employment was terminated?"
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3614.099,3615.801,That's correct Your Honor.
1970.507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3615.801,3618.619,Employer claims he was discharged for cause --
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3618.619,3618.951,Correct.
1970.507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3618.951,3624.378,The employee claims that he was justified in his conduct as here.
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3624.378,3625.149,Exactly Your Honor.
1970.507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3625.149,3626.16,Wouldn't it?
1970.507,2,16803,asher_rubin,,3626.16,3627.587,That's exactly.
1970.507,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3666.654,3667.259,Thank you gentleman.
