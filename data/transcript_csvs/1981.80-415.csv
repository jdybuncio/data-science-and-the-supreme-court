1981.80-415,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,77.914,We'll hear arguments next in Railway Labor Executives' Association against Gibbons.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,82.619,87.21,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1981.80-415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.835,343.044,"Mr. Clarke, do you think that Congress Acting under its commerce power can impair the obligation of contracts which the -- a State is specifically prohibited from doing by the -- by the Constitution?"
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,343.044,360.104,"No, Your Honor, we do not believe that Congress has that power under the Commerce Clause to impair the obligation of contracts, but the problem in this case is, first of all, is that issue really before this Court that's basically in the taking issue, and the second point is, are the obligations of contract being impaired?"
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,441.093,442.344,May I ask you a question there?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,442.344,442.846,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,442.846,455.497,Does everyone agree in this case that assuming there was a taking in the sense that you are taking money out of the estate that it was a taking for public use rather than a transfer of property from one group of private people to another group of private people?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,455.497,458.016,"Your Honor, I do not believe that everyone agrees to that."
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.222,489.367,"But for -- there could be a Tucker Act remedy, I take it would have to be not really a taking in the sense you take it from X but a taking for public use, otherwise it wouldn't be a Tucker Act remedy, would there?"
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,497.764,498.198,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,502.107,503.462,Even if not for public use?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,503.462,504.742,Even if not for public use.
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,513.414,513.698,What --
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,513.698,513.739,-- a violation.
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,513.739,520.461,--what is the authority for the proposition that even if it's not for a public use and nevertheless is a Tucker Act remedy?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,520.461,523.984,"Your Honor, basically, if you take a look at the Rail Act cases where the Court --"
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.984,527.667,But there is a footnote in that opinion that says everybody agreed it was for public use.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,527.667,528.983,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,554.532,557.0,But you don't have any authority right on that proposition?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,557.0,558.03,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,558.03,568.259,"Well, did you read the Fifth Amendment to provide that in the event that the taking is for private use rather than public use no compensation need be provided?"
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,568.259,569.401,"No, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,634.397,637.983,And what is your submission as to where that should be determined?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,637.983,640.065,And basing it under the Tucker Act provisions --
1981.80-415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,640.065,640.211,Before the Court of Claims?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,640.211,641.389,-- in the Court of Claims.
1981.80-415,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.405,710.728,"Mr. Clarke, it may be that if the United States takes a property for public use that the taking is not subject to an injunction because there is -- compensation has been promised, but how about the situation where there is a taking -- say the United States, actually we are taking your property but we are going to take it for private use, and you can't complain now because you can go to the Court of Claims and get paid for it?"
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,725.624,726.51,"Your Honor, we will submit --"
1981.80-415,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.51,727.854,Do you have some authority on that point?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,727.854,728.273,"No, I do not."
1981.80-415,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.273,733.113,I don't think you do if you don't have on the point that Justice Stevens asked you.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,733.113,736.209,The only authority that might come close to that point is the case --
1981.80-415,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.209,738.048,That's what at issue here.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,741.108,745.148,"That's correct, Your Honor, and we submit that it should not have been enjoined because the Tucker Act was available."
1981.80-415,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,787.117,801.81,"But if the District Court thought of that -- that it was entitled to give an injunction if there was a taking for private use, it seems to me the taking issue is fairly opposed here."
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,811.298,822.226,"Your Honor, we're still back to -- it goes back to the question, it's not so much the taking issue because the taking issue in this case is really when does a regulation become a taking?"
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.444,976.079,Is that correct the March 4 agreement related to employees continued to work?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,976.079,976.789,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.789,979.445,Whereas this protection is for people who were terminated.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,979.445,982.878,That's the second half of the -- of the protection.
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.439,996.96,Right.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,996.96,1000.138,And then when they are hired to give them some form of protection.
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.138,1009.489,"But is it not true that the benefits of the statute, if it's held valid, will all go to terminated employees not to the same people who benefit from the March 4 agreement?"
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1009.489,1014.145,Terminated employees but who are still available for continued rail service in that area.
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1014.145,1015.102,"Well, yes, but --"
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1015.102,1015.863,There is another advantage --
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.863,1020.554,But the purpose of it is to protect them in the event they don't get further jobs.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1020.554,1037.233,"Yes, but that purpose, -- that -- that's immediate, I mean, that's the way Congress -- the end that Congress used to accomplish its purpose but it's a purpose that Congress said it was doing was to provide a protection for employees to enable the continued operation of lines."
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1037.233,1038.99,But -- but it just doesn't fit the facts.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1038.99,1049.277,"But we submitted those, Your Honor, when you look at the -- the agreement, the March 4 hiring agreement together with the Rock Island protection just like the Milwaukee situation."
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.674,1057.828,Those are all for people who are still working.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1058.833,1061.013,"But not on the Milwaukee agreement, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1094.817,1097.338,Is the railroad Patent Act gone?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1097.338,1099.136,"It's not gone, Your Honor, but the benefits --"
1981.80-415,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1099.136,1102.067,But I thought you said they had no protection at all?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1102.067,1103.014,The only protection they have is --
1981.80-415,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1103.014,1104.291,But that is a protection though.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1104.291,1109.848,"-- $25 a day for five days a week, and those benefits are almost exhausted for most of them."
1981.80-415,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1109.848,1110.83,Certainly.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1110.83,1112.782,That's a $125 a day --
1981.80-415,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1112.782,1113.043,It is --
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1113.043,1113.779,$125 a week.
1981.80-415,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1113.779,1115.234,It is something.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1115.234,1116.281,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1116.281,1118.251,That's all I'm trying to get you to say.
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1118.251,1126.955,There is a protection of that sort but the guaranteed job security that these people have enjoyed over the years guaranteed them more than that type of protection.
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.813,1155.564,May I ask you a question --
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1155.564,1155.84,Yes.
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1155.84,1157.906,-- without intruding on your time because I --
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1157.906,1159.44,I appreciate that.
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.44,1167.995,"If it's all right with the Chief Justice, because I -- I -- you -- your position in part is that this did not create a new obligation but merely compromised a preexisting obligation."
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1167.995,1168.988,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1168.988,1175.519,Could you tell me what in your view the magnitude of the preexisting obligation was and was it larger or smaller than the new obligation?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1175.519,1219.565,"Your Honor, it's hard to place a -- an actual figure on it but the levels of protection which we submit, 11347, require that the Interstate Commerce Act was made mandatory here by 17(a)(1) of the -- 17(a) of the Milwaukee Act, is that there'd be guaranteed income for six years with all cost-of-living adjustments added into it, in other words 100% of your income for six years from the date of your effect, or an option on the employee to take a separation allowance was equals three and for people with over ten years -- five years of service, 360 times your last daily rate of pay."
1981.80-415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.565,1225.975,And is it your position that -- that the employees would have been entitled to that if this statute had never been enacted?
1981.80-415,0,29579,john_ob_clarke_jr,,1225.975,1226.845,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1286.905,1288.566,Ms. Stillman.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1288.566,1307.98,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the federal appellees appeared here today in the support of RLEA's appeal from the October order from the Seventh Circuit's affirmance of the District Court's October order holding an Act of Congress -- enjoining an Act of Congress on grounds of its unconstitutionality."
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.06,1475.977,But Congress didn't attempt to intervene in the proceeding to save that Rock Island -- should continue to operate.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1475.977,1478.426,"No, no, it gave certain directed service --"
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1478.426,1478.837,It just --
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1478.837,1479.698,-- authority to the ICC.
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.698,1482.675,It just accepted what the reality was.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1482.675,1489.831,"Well, it was trying -- what Congress was really trying to do here was create a situation which would encourage buyers for these lines."
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.856,1530.939,What did --
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1530.939,1533.291,"They regarded it, I think, as part of a package."
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1541.43,1541.829,Well --
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1541.829,1542.367,But they didn't.
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.367,1552.205,-- my suggestion -- my question really is do you think Congress intended to amend or repeal any part of the reorganization law?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1552.205,1557.008,"No, I think Congress -- here, what I would like to say --"
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.008,1561.68,It didn't attempt to intervene in the preceding to overturn any insurance?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1561.68,1576.267,"No, I don't believe Congress thought it was overturning anything as -- as the counsel for RLEA has suggested, Congress is -- they looked at the law affecting employee protection arrangements when they were -- when they were devising the statute."
1981.80-415,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.704,1667.977,"Ms. Stillman, a moment ago you used the term “federally guaranteed loans.”"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1667.977,1668.328,Yes.
1981.80-415,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1668.328,1687.698,"Does that mean that if the original obligor defaults and the Federal Government has to come in and make good on its guarantee, the Government has recourse against the original obligor?"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1687.698,1692.134,Yes.
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1707.426,1711.051,"Well, it's now been decided that there was no such viability, isn't it?"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1711.051,1712.701,"Well, this is after the fact --"
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1712.701,1712.795,Right.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1712.795,1714.734,-- that the time Congress was legislating this there was --
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1714.734,1718.264,"But you are not suggesting that the unions didn't really want this legislation, right?"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1718.264,1729.7,"No, I -- I will say that neither the unions nor the estate had any concrete, absolute guarantee that that --"
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1729.7,1733.235,"No, but there was a history of ICC total abandonments where they had --"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1733.235,1733.415,Yes --
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1733.415,1733.966,-- not been imposed (Voice Overlap) --
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1733.966,1738.498,"-- but the ICC had always said, “Well, we -- we make exceptions in appropriate cases,” and the ICC had never --"
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1738.498,1740.487,But the union really didn't want to take the risk.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1741.042,1743.016,"Well, there were risks on both sides -- and the Congress --"
1981.80-415,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.016,1743.202,"Well, the other --"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1743.202,1743.525,and the Congress --
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1743.525,1745.066,-- side doesn't think there was much --
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1745.066,1762.738,"Congress addressing these risks and -- and I might say again in terms of the amount of money that they were talking about here, Footnote 27, on the private appellees' brief says that it was calculated for the Milwaukee Railroad that if New York Dock conditions had been -- been applied there, the liability might have been anything up to $1 billion."
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1831.647,1831.75,Was the --
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1831.75,1832.028,-- of other marginal carriers.
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1832.028,1838.817,-- March 4th agreement intended to enable sale of the lines by reducing the obligation of the employees?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1838.817,1840.369,"That's -- that's true, that's true."
1981.80-415,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1840.369,1861.424,"Ms. Stillman, supposing the Rock Island had been a going concern, do you think Congress could have singled it out and said to its management, every employee on the Rock Island shall receive hourly wage of $5 an hour or more?"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1861.424,1880.076,"Well, that would be an exercise of Congress' commerce power which as -- always would have to be tested for a rational basis as to whether that was a rational decision or a reasonable consideration of the class."
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.848,1915.167,"In that subject, let me just pose a question because I'm glad you are getting that."
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1935.858,1936.075,I think --
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.075,1938.409,You contend this case comes within that sentence?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1938.409,1941.987,I think there are two ideas there that are included there in the sentence.
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.183,1948.294,Is this an adjustment between private parties?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1948.294,1952.674,An adjustment between private parties which is critical to the public interest.
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1962.958,1967.775,"Well, I first like to know whether you think that sentence applies to this case."
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1967.775,1968.633,"Yes, I think it does."
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.633,1969.885,You do --
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1969.885,1971.824,But then I'd like to explain where I think --
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.824,1971.863,And you think --
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1971.863,1972.314,-- that's not applicable.
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1972.314,1977.328,"-- Congress should be given a chance to decide whether or not if it is a taking, they want to pay for it."
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1977.328,1978.134,"Yes, yes, yes."
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.134,1980.947,And that they have not yet made an unequivocal determination of this.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1980.947,1982.397,"Well, let me say this."
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.555,1992.815,But it isn't paid out yet.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1992.815,1993.731,It isn't paid out yet.
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.731,1998.354,"And if we said there was a taking, you think -- you would like to know whether it's a taking and that so --"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1998.354,1998.552,That's correct.
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.552,2000.643,-- Congress could know whether to repeal on the --
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2000.643,2002.754,"Well, that's correct, yes."
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.754,2005.343,They have to Act within 15 days as I understand it.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2006.658,2007.126,Excuse me?
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.126,2011.124,"But they would have to Act within 15 days, would they not?"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2016.92,2018.326,"Well, well, that's right."
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.731,2025.738,But it's a rather accelerated time schedule.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2025.738,2027.242,"Yes, that's true, that's true."
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.087,2149.447,"Well, if -- do -- do you see this case as one that's within the Tucker Act if we, (a) said there was a taking, or (b) we said there was not a taking?"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2149.447,2153.444,"If you say there is a taking, it's within the Tucker Act."
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.444,2158.94,"Alright, suppose we just pass the questions, say -- say--"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2158.94,2161.101,The Tucker Act is there.
1981.80-415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.101,2164.154,Would you -- I suppose that would bind the Government?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2164.154,2166.896,It will bind the Government if they do nothing.
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2179.638,2185.411,"But -- but, Ms. Stillman, what if we say it's a taking for private use then what happens?"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2185.411,2203.444,"This is a somewhat more difficult question because of course under United States against Testan, this Court has said that there is no liability against the United States in the Court of Claims except where there is a right for damages and of course the Just Compensation Clause provides such a right."
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2210.385,2210.491,In which --
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2210.491,2210.78,Court of Claims.
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2210.78,2213.0,-- event the question of an injunction comes up.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2213.0,2226.422,"Yes, in which account then but we -- but we very strongly argue here that there -- there's -- is no serious question that there has not been a rational -- in rational terms, some benefit to the public interest."
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2226.422,2235.438,Do you think the United States would be foreclosed from arguing in the Court of Claims that it was a taking for private use and therefore the remedy is not available?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2243.272,2243.591,But we --
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.591,2255.551,"But would not the United States have the right to argue, “Oh, no, this was a taking for public use, the -- this -- there was evidence of Congressional intent to make it -- administer of expense and not incur an absolute liability”?"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2255.551,2261.455,"Your Honor, Congress made a finding in this legislation that it was in the public interest."
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.058,2262.475,Was that the same --
1981.80-415,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.475,2267.66,That -- that's not the same as the taking for public use.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2267.66,2268.858,I think it is.
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2269.722,2277.943,"Well, supposing Congress made a finding that the General Motors could run the Ford Company better than Ford does and transfer their assets to General Motors out of the public benefit."
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2286.024,2290.893,I guess one reason this is difficult is because that's a sort of substantive due process to us (Voice Overlap) --
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2290.893,2293.495,"Well, I think it is difficult because there is no precedent --"
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2293.495,2293.773,Yes.
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.95,2294.392,-- that really supports your position.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2294.392,2306.8,"Well, you have suggested I think in your opinion in Moore against City of East Cleveland that what the Court has done sometimes in the past is apply what you call a huge test of substantive due process test or the taking test."
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2318.248,2318.948,Right.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2329.095,2331.558,"Well, I don't --"
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2331.558,2333.45,Can you?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2333.45,2339.172,It seems to me that it is so clear here that there is a public -- that the public use of this --
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2339.172,2339.597,(Voice Overlap) --
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2339.597,2341.15,-- money is to benefit the public.
1981.80-415,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2343.5,2348.299,Your avoidance of the question as I have taken it an answer.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2348.299,2359.758,"Well, I'm reluctant to recklessly open up the treasury in the Court of Claims but on the other hand, I don't want to suggest that this injunction should stand because we think, clearly, there is no basis for standing."
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.758,2361.966,May I ask this question?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2385.643,2385.944,Yes.
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.944,2390.912,Do you think anybody would have invested in another railroad if this can happen?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2390.912,2391.729,Well --
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.729,2402.917,"The Government could -- on your theory, the Government could have said it or approved or authorized an administrative claim, a brand new one of $204 million."
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2408.162,2418.581,"Well, under our theory the existing law authorized the imposition of a -- a much larger liability, a law that was on the books, a law that the investors were aware of and --"
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2418.581,2424.093,But is -- is the Government interested in encouraging people to invest in railroads?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2424.093,2425.186,"Well, railroad invest --"
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2425.186,2428.436,What if the Government wants to take them over?
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2428.436,2430.534,"Your Honor, I can't speak for the Government on that point."
1981.80-415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2430.534,2432.466,Right.
1981.80-415,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2432.466,2444.767,"But I would simply say that we believe that the injunction here was erroneous on both grounds that is -- that it is not a taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment and that if it is, the Tucker Act remedy prevents the injunction."
1981.80-415,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2454.574,2456.361,Mr. Murray.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,2456.361,2483.369,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the principal issue presented in this appeal is whether by special legislation Congress can impose upon a bankrupt railroad already in liquidation a new obligation solely for the benefit of its former employees who are no longer going to be working in the railroad industry, an obligation that will displace the interest of the creditors and the shareholders of that railroad."
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2758.437,2763.975,This Act didn't reactivate the operations of the Rock Island.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,2763.975,2767.808,They did not reactivate the operation by the trustee.
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.162,2863.238,"Mr. -- Mr. Murray, do you think that the -- do you think the ICC could have imposed any kind of a -- of a -- a termination burden on the estate?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,2863.238,2865.184,In the event of a total liquidation?
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.184,2865.87,"Yes, which --"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,2865.87,2871.655,"In the event of a total liquidation, we would say it could not and that is the position that the Seventh Circuit took in connection with --"
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.655,2883.705,Do you just flatly disagree with the Government's position and your opponents that there was any room at all in this reorganization proceeding to impose any termination pay.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,2883.705,2884.766,"That is correct, Justice White."
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2885.149,2887.836,No labor protective provisions were -- were --
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,2887.836,2891.765,"In the event of a total abandonment by a railroad, that was in liquidation."
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2915.056,2929.121,"Well, if the -- if the Interstate Commerce Commission had some authority to impose some labor protective provisions in this case on the facts of this case, they had just discretion to do so."
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,2937.031,2941.989,"Well, I submit that in this case they did not have any discretion on the context of a railroad in liquidation."
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.989,2946.389,"We have to decide that to -- to hold for you, I guess."
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,2946.389,2954.483,"Well, I think that's an -- that's an important question in this case and I think the Seventh Circuit has already indicated its position on the case (Voice Overlap) --"
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.483,2955.617,"It's for us, too."
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,2955.617,2957.616,"I understand that, Your Honor and --"
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2957.616,2962.164,How do you -- how do you distinguish the Dayton-Goose Creek case?
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,2962.164,2974.533,"Well, that was a case where a railroad that was ongoing was required to share its excess profits with other railroads and I think it's understood that all railroads operate in a kind of a community of interest."
1981.80-415,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3056.393,3059.873,Let me if I understand your earlier point.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3083.796,3085.314,"Absolutely, that is correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3085.314,3090.161,What -- is there any relationship between that?
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3099.958,3119.711,"We would be in the position, for example, of the Milwaukee Road which is an ongoing rail operation and it is in the process of contracting and it does have a labor protection obligation under the traditional form of labor protection and the Milwaukee Railroad Restructuring Act does benefit it because it takes what would be a larger obligation and scales it down."
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.199,3160.409,"What -- what if it is just a total abandonment, just a withdraw, no liquidation or no -- it is not in Section 77 reorganization and it's not -- it's not liquidating under -- in it?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3160.409,3166.156,I think that is the exception I posed earlier that there might be a situation where a perfectly healthy railroad for whatever reason --
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.156,3166.411,Yes.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3166.411,3166.942,-- is withdrawn.
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.508,3176.588,So if the railroad says --
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3176.588,3177.794,-- say so that it would not be operating it.
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.794,3183.965,"-- that we are going to withdraw from the railroad business, but we have got a lot of money.We are going to go to some other businesses, do you think that (Voice Overlap) --"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3183.965,3185.487,That would be a different case.
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3185.487,3186.893,Yes.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3187.928,3189.263,That's not the Brooks-Scanlon case.
1981.80-415,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3203.872,3217.984,"But what about an employer who is on a -- in a losing situation when the Fair Labor Standards Act was provoked -- passed, provided from minimum wages?"

1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.322,3280.971,"But if the employer in Justice Rehnquist's examples said, “Well, as long as I operate, I have to live up to the law but if it's too expensive, I'm going to quit,” and if he quit, there'd be different questions."

1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.026,3289.542,"Well, that's -- that's what your case is."
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3289.542,3290.544,Yes.
1981.80-415,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3324.04,3338.405,We will resume at one o'clock.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3342.039,3345.663,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3503.873,3506.454,The ICC said it was forbidden.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3506.454,3508.811,The ICC indicated that they would not impose it.
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3510.435,3511.961,"Well, you're saying it's forbidden."

1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3518.937,3521.022,"Well, the ICC has never said that."
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3521.022,3521.894,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3521.894,3525.004,That's a -- a new question.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3525.004,3528.943,It has been indicated by Judge McGarr in his abandonment order and that's correct.
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3595.582,3606.424,"That -- that's true of all investors in any corporation prior to 1938 in the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act, isn't it?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3622.547,3637.519,It's true that that was the situation with the Fair Labor Standards Act but what we are saying here is that this is a -- a substantial obligation that's being imposed upon this particular railroad estate that has already served the public interest for five years with $210 million.
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3686.749,3686.837,What if --
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3686.837,3687.347,-- Fair Labor Standards Act.
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3687.347,3709.954,"What if congress in 1970, say prior to the Milwaukee liquidation, prior to the Rock Island liquidation, had said affirmatively there will be labor benefit programs for all railroads that subsequently go into liquidation?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3709.954,3712.179,That would clearly be a more difficult case for us.
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3743.721,3745.172,Lawyers?
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3745.172,3759.023,Anybody that would be on the assumption that they would be entitled to priority under the Railroad Reorganization Statute under Section 77 and under the very first order that Judge McGarr entered in the case.
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3811.467,3823.548,"Well, are you really suggesting that the -- that the estate is so depleted that it would not cover all administrative expenses including the $75 million if it is imposed?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3823.548,3825.113,"Your Honor, at the present time --"
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3825.113,3826.37,Or do you know?
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3826.37,3833.241,"We do have some idea, Your Honor, that at the present time, there are over -- there are $250 million of expensive administration claims."
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3844.678,3846.732,"So, what is the estate valued at?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3846.732,3853.632,"At the present time, the escrow fund amounts to approximately $130, $135 million and there are no major sales pending."
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3853.632,3857.583,But there certainly is a liquidation value on the remaining assets.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3857.583,3859.015,We have -- we --
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3859.015,3862.731,"Except we can't find any value in them, I guess."
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3862.731,3863.565,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3864.595,3880.878,"So you're really saying if the $75 million is imposed, if it is going to be paid in total, it necessarily will be a priority administrative expense and will dilute to the other claims to administrative expenses."
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3880.878,3886.668,At least dilute them and perhaps displace them depending upon the priority that is accorded by the reorganization court.
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3886.668,3893.385,"Mr. Murray, how realistic is the $7500 figure?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3893.385,3911.57,"Your Honor, we have in the record an affidavit by the trustee indicating that assuming 3,700 eligible employees, this appears at page 122a of the joint appendix, there would be an immediate pay-out of $46 million and a total pay-out of $69 million."
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3935.975,3953.193,"Counsel, assuming that the Court were to find that it was not a taking for a private purpose, the railroad could then, would you concede, recover that amount that it paid out under the Tucker Act?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3953.193,3976.99,"Well, assuming that it could not be -- that this was not a -- for a private purpose, we would -- we would say that there was still irreparable harm to the Rock Island estate because this estate is in the process of withdrawing from the rail service and from the public service and the effect that we would have is to prevent a partial distribution that the reorganization court wants to make to the expense of administration claimants."
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3976.99,3982.343,How long would it take to process a Tucker Act claim?
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,3982.343,3986.747,It's taken a -- this Act was passed over a year ago and has taken a year to litigate this.
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3997.226,4001.918,"So, what really is the problem is that it delays a partial distribution?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4001.918,4002.906,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4005.192,4007.476,-- the harm will be the difference between the interest rate.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4013.492,4022.116,"Your Honor, the problem there is that there are -- there are costs of administration claimants as Judge McGarr found who cannot afford to wait for their money."
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4047.252,4052.165,Why could the partial distribution not be made?
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4052.165,4071.641,Because the escrow fund is not large enough to cover both the first mortgage bonds and the $75-million lien that would be imposed upon the estate and that is why he is unable to proceed and he has so indicated to the various costs of administration claimants who come to his court on each status report date asking when are they going to be paid.
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4080.937,4081.539,How about a --
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4081.539,4081.672,-- distribution.
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4081.672,4084.962,-- partial pro rata distribution?
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4084.962,4102.332,"Your Honor, the -- the difficulty with that is that again the escrow fund is not large enough to cover both the first mortgage bond holders and the $75 million so that there would be nothing left at that point or -- or just a miniscule amount left for the expense of administration claimants."
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4102.332,4107.331,What is the priority between the administrative expenses and the first mortgage bond holders?
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4107.331,4109.995,"Your Honor, that has not been adjudicated by the reorganization court."
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4124.904,4130.491,But a lot of them are not to the extent that (Voice Overlap) these mortgage bond holders have profited by it.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4130.491,4143.318,Again -- I would have to say that I think that -- that most of the first mortgage bonds would be prior to the cost administration claimants but that is a question under Section 77 and Judge McGarr has not ruled upon that and you --
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4143.318,4143.434,(Voice Overlap) --
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4143.434,4144.828,-- would get different answers to that question.
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4144.828,4148.352,And he'd have to do so if the fund were large enough to cover both.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4148.352,4158.876,"That is correct and the problem there, of course, is you would get different answers to that question from different counsel for whom I am speaking today so I should make that clear."
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4184.14,4203.796,"Counsel, would you say that in the case of an ongoing enterprise or even a reorganization of the railroad that for the Government to impose such liability would also lack a public purpose?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4203.796,4211.302,"In that particular situation, Your Honor, I -- I -- because the railroad remains in the railroad business, I think it would be a harder question."
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4220.88,4225.824,"Yes, it was my understanding we really have upheld legislation of that kind."
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4225.824,4251.729,"That is correct, Your Honor, but there, the thought is that it -- that the rationale there is the connection between the fact that an ongoing railroad profits from the partial abandonment that is affected and that the Congress can regulate the sharing of that profit with employees who are displaced because only a few employees have to bear the burden for which the entire railroad profits."
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4251.729,4268.045,"How do you deal with the argument that presumably the investors in the railroad understood that some liability might well attach in any event under the other Act that was enforced, the Milwaukee Act?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4268.045,4290.861,"Well, I think they understood it to mean that if the rail -- I think they understood Brooks-Scanlon and the cases that have followed Brooks-Scanlon like New Haven Inclusion per se, that if a railroad operates at a loss consistently over the years, they have a right to withdraw their investment from rail service and that cannot be subject to conditions such as the Congress tried to attach here."
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4376.101,4380.844,Was -- was the Milwaukee reorganized out of the Northern District of Illinois?
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4380.844,4382.06,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4510.468,4520.859,"But Congress had added the bottom line and said, “By the way, to the extent the bankruptcy acts must be amended to achieve the above, they are so amended.”"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4520.859,4522.34,"I don't believe they did that though, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4522.966,4526.846,"If they had, there'd be no separation of powers problem, wouldn't there?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4526.846,4529.492,If they did it prospectively for all railroads and did it in connection with this --
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4529.492,4534.603,I don't -- I don't think the separation of powers means it has to be uniform.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4537.195,4537.762,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4537.762,4538.513,The Bankruptcy Clause.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4538.513,4539.537,"Right, the Bankruptcy Clause."
1981.80-415,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4539.537,4542.283,So it wouldn't be a separation of powers problem.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4542.283,4546.333,"It wouldn't, but on this particular circumstance, what they did was they tried to dictate the decision."
1981.80-415,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4557.235,4563.623,"Mr. Murray, do you have any precedence for this argument to support you on this?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4563.623,4566.644,"Your Honor, we -- we have cited the United States versus Klein case."
1981.80-415,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4571.944,4575.387,"My question is, are there any precedence that you can --"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4575.387,4576.526,The -- the Klein case --
1981.80-415,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4576.526,4576.965,Only the Klein case?
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4576.965,4582.435,"-- is only one precedent in which we rely on, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4603.134,4622.04,"Mr. Murray, do you -- are there any specific authorities that truly resolve the question of whether this particular Act may be said to be an act of bankruptcy, the Act that we're considering that Congress passed --"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4622.04,4622.256,Your Honor --
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4622.256,4626.553,"-- so as to bring in the play, the uniformity problem?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4626.553,4629.2,"I don't have any specific authorities that I can cite to you, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4648.547,4657.44,On a railroad which is ceasing to operate maybe the bankruptcy stage is -- is indicative.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4657.625,4658.385,The bankruptcy --
1981.80-415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4658.385,4664.716,My -- my concern is whether this Act may properly be characterized as a bankruptcy.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4664.716,4667.959,"Your Honor, my view would be that it's even more of a bankruptcy situation."
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4676.915,4679.495,"It's actually a Section 77 proceeding, isn't it?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4679.495,4680.586,It is still a Section 77 proceeding.
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4680.586,4684.481,And Section 77 is passed pursuant to the bankruptcy power.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4684.481,4684.979,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4684.979,4688.088,And this is going to be a plan of liquidation in the Section 77 proceeding.
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4688.088,4689.603,That is correct and that is why it would be a question (Voice Overlap) --
1981.80-415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4689.603,4691.931,Then the question is what claims are you going to pay?
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4691.931,4692.712,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-415,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4705.001,4714.995,"Mr. Murray, would you summarize again why you think the Staggers Act does not provide appropriate relief assuming we find a taking?"
1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4714.995,4724.923,"Your Honor, our concern there is with respect to the fact that this benefits employees who are not former employees, who are not going to be working for other railroads."

1981.80-415,2,21193,daniel_r_murray,,4808.188,4811.691,I would assume that the trustee would bring the action on behalf of all creditors.
1981.80-415,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4818.233,4824.228,"Well, I understand that but somebody would have to initiate the litigation to determine whether or not the Tucker Act applied."
