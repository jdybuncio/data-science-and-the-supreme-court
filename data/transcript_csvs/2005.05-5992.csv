2005.05-5992,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.501,We'll hear argument next in Zedner v. United States.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,5.783,9.126,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-5992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.672,148.564,"What about, Mr. Zas, that the court thought it was home free on the Speedy Trial Act?"
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,155.284,166.473,"That may be, Justice Ginsburg, but... but as of our filing after the competency proceeding, we asked for a trial as soon as possible."
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,182.071,195.104,"Yes, but on... on that one, the... the Second Circuit said that he was incompetent, and you could have excluded the time on (4) because (4) allows you to exclude time when he's incompetent."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,234.769,238.16,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I have several responses for that."
2005.05-5992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,259.853,266.354,"You're not quite through your answer yet, but is there also a requirement that the competency determination be made within 30 days?"
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,269.339,271.121,Your Honor is... is exactly right.
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,280.952,281.437,I'm sorry.
2005.05-5992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,293.282,298.908,"But that... but that's different, I take it, from the judge's delay in making the finding of competency."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,298.908,300.299,"That's right, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,309.409,324.82,"Yes, that's why, see, I guess on this point, we'd have to send it back because if, in fact, the judge had determined in his mind within the 30-day period that the person was incompetent or he was incompetent in fact, then that could have been his reason."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,352.309,357.655,"Your Honor, I'm... I'm just trying to envision what that remand would look like."
2005.05-5992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.376,381.691,"The delay... the delay was not because we can't try this man because he's incompetent, and until he's rendered competent, we... we have to stay proceedings."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,386.552,388.474,"--That's right, Your Honor, and the act--"
2005.05-5992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.474,396.085,"Which is what is specifically precluded by the requirement that... that you act within 30 days, and... and all the rest of the time, the clock is running."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,396.085,398.022,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,398.022,403.915,"And I take it the trial... the Speedy Trial Act doesn't say if the judge is thinking about something, it requires him to make an order."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,403.915,405.822,"No, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,419.512,419.997,"Well, I was going to ask you about that."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,428.764,429.764,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,447.753,460.646,"So your view is that we should say that the Second Circuit's statement that the defendant could not have been tried because, at that time, he was incompetent, that we should simply say that's false, that the Second Circuit is wrong to say that."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,460.646,463.553,"Well, not quite, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,565.028,567.356,"Now, we've been talking about the competency period."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,577.531,578.672,That's correct.
2005.05-5992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,578.672,582.141,And that's this... that's the first of the two periods that's involved here.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,582.141,582.875,That's correct.
2005.05-5992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,615.211,617.164,I don't know if it makes any difference to the case.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,628.495,630.683,"--It could take for all time, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,649.218,659.126,Are there... are there cases in which the judge's findings... let's assume that he made the findings... are set aside for abuse of discretion on... on review for a violation of the Speedy Trial Act?
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,659.126,663.751,That is a standard that the courts of appeals have generally applied.
2005.05-5992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,678.35,678.975,Who... who could complain?
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,701.886,707.043,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, you're right."
2005.05-5992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.161,755.647,And you think it's... it's not harmless error if they didn't make the finding but... but could have?
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,755.647,757.008,"That's right, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,775.511,781.841,"No, but isn't... isn't the difference that in the latter period, the court took no action, and there is a mandate on the court to act?"
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,818.723,822.849,"Justice Souter, I would... I would not characterize this as a clerical error."
2005.05-5992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,828.319,829.648,"Well, let's put it this way."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,844.088,848.996,"--Well, I would disagree, again with the characterization that it's just a failure to speak."
2005.05-5992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,859.404,860.06,"Well, we don't... we don't know."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,875.423,878.705,"--That's right, and the court also didn't make the finding--"
2005.05-5992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,878.705,879.55,Right.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,879.55,883.534,--or state the reasons that the statute specifically requires.
2005.05-5992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,918.277,918.511,No.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,918.918,923.152,--that's where this... this distinction that you're drawing can be taken into account.
2005.05-5992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,923.152,942.876,"--But it's... it requires... in order for us to conclude that that's the only way it can be taken account... into account, we... we'd have to conclude that... that rule 52 was, in effect, partially repealed and made inapplicable implicitly here without any reference to it."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,953.347,964.506,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the principle... well accepted principle that the more specific provision will govern over the general governs here."
2005.05-5992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,973.945,982.072,"But there's always some sanction for error, and the point of the harmless error rule is to determine whether that specific sanction should be applied."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,982.072,989.37,"Yes, but there's not always a... an express command from Congress as to what the remedy should be."
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1006.312,1017.986,"I'd like to know how... how do we know that the judge didn't set forth orally his reasons for finding that the ends of justice outweigh the interest, et cetera?"
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1020.439,1022.627,"Well, you only--"
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1022.627,1029.05,"Because I don't know that you'd have to use the exact words, the ends of justice served."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1042.804,1051.384,"--Your Honor, this... the only place you will find the words here are the transcript of the status conference on January 31, 1997."
2005.05-5992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1069.966,1071.482,He didn't think he needed it.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1072.545,1073.467,--That's correct.
2005.05-5992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.852,1119.04,"Mr. Zas, are you going to talk about estoppel?"
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1119.04,1120.415,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1157.501,1161.408,"Well, isn't there something more than a waiver here?"
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1199.588,1205.479,"Well, Your Honor, I can't disagree with what you've said, but... but the--"
2005.05-5992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.479,1206.465,"Well, I can."
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1225.313,1226.922,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1226.922,1230.173,And hasn't my brother cleverly changed my hypothetical?
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1242.285,1243.019,Yes.
2005.05-5992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1243.019,1244.067,Yes.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1244.067,1245.536,I think... I think there are two different waivers that--
2005.05-5992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.536,1246.224,Okay.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1246.224,1247.302,--that are before the Court.
2005.05-5992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1287.483,1291.374,As long as they're not in jail pending trial.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1291.374,1291.718,That's right.
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1318.38,1321.193,Maybe you could say then that it's the Government that has the right.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1371.501,1375.08,"--Well, it's... it's partially correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1375.08,1377.049,How is it not correct?
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1377.83,1385.925,"Well, it's not correct because I would... I would disagree with the characterization, if that's what Your Honor is doing, of... of anything that happened here as being sandbagging."
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1385.925,1386.55,I'm not talking about here.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1404.836,1405.79,Yes.
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1405.79,1406.368,Is that right?
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1406.368,1407.352,"Yes, that... that is--"
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1407.352,1407.649,Okay.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1409.353,1413.479,"--Well, that... that is what the... that is what the statute says."
2005.05-5992,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1429.233,1429.779,Maybe.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1451.471,1459.771,"Well, Your Honor, the alternative, if you go sort of the Government's route here, is to essentially perpetuate the confusion that brought us here in the first place."
2005.05-5992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1471.945,1477.258,This... this was a judge who apparently was doing this as a... a matter of standard practice.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1486.104,1489.088,"That... that's right, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.559,1493.387,"And Gothic print, right?"
2005.05-5992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1493.387,1495.653,It could have come from my chambers.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1497.857,1507.296,"And as we point out in the reply brief, the judge had taken a strong legal position 20 years earlier that the requirements of the act could be waived."
2005.05-5992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1507.296,1509.234,I was going to ask what is the date of the Speedy Trial Act?
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1510.156,1512.891,I think President Ford signed it on January 3rd--
2005.05-5992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1512.891,1515.704,And it was widely publicized among the judiciary then.
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1515.704,1517.47,"--Yes, yes."
2005.05-5992,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1529.144,1531.926,Can he make an ends of justice finding for all time?
2005.05-5992,0,23464,edward_scott_zas,,1539.256,1540.631,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1553.024,1554.62,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1555.495,1561.714,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1634.652,1643.606,"But... but as we've indicated, the... the judge was the one that opted out of the act by this regular practice of requiring the perpetual waiver, or whatever we call it."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1643.606,1646.154,I guess there... there are couple things there.
2005.05-5992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1693.524,1703.136,"It's pretty hard to read those pages as if they were anything other than what they seemed to be on their face, that he didn't worry about the Speedy Trial Act because he thought that it had been waived."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1703.136,1707.839,"I think you're absolutely right that the court was not, at that point, thinking in terms of applying the Speedy Trial Act."
2005.05-5992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1707.839,1725.25,"Well, then why isn't that the end of that, that the... if you agree that the defendant can't waive it, well, the reason that he got the continuance is because he waived it, otherwise there would have been something else done and... or at least might have been."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1725.25,1725.922,Right.
2005.05-5992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1751.709,1754.944,How can we say it's purely procedural with respect to the first time?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1775.667,1779.262,--Complex defendants can make for complex cases.
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1812.223,1821.49,"Did the Government at any point tell the... tell the court, Your Honor, we think the act requires you to make a specific finding and we request you do that?"
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1821.49,1822.131,No.
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1831.632,1841.495,"Because, I mean, you're... you're coming in and saying, oh, well, he waived, but certainly the Government could... could have asked the... asked the district court to make the necessary findings."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1841.495,1850.496,"--Right, and at the time of... of this... this was about 10 years ago now... the Second Circuit recently held that waiver is not ordinarily appropriate, but sometimes is."
2005.05-5992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.056,1912.134,What... what are you hypothesizing?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1923.87,1928.419,"--We think that, legally speaking, all that matters is that the court could have, and that once--"
2005.05-5992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.419,1928.981,Could have made it.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1944.719,1953.611,"--In... in some instances, it may add to an additional degree of complexity, although I'll say that whatever that might be, it's still less than the complexity of retrying the case."
2005.05-5992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1977.569,1978.304,Suppose you ask the judge.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2021.047,2027.111,"--Well, you would need more on the record there because if the record was limited to what you just said, I don't think there would be a basis for--"
2005.05-5992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2027.111,2033.159,"But it's possible you could argue, looking at the record, that the judge should have tried it... should have excluded it on a different basis."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2056.774,2058.853,--At this... at this point we're not at the harmlessness point yet.
2005.05-5992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.837,2060.351,It's not harmless.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2062.165,2062.884,"--Right, and--"
2005.05-5992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2062.884,2066.4,So we don't say the judge is right because he waived it.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2071.137,2078.81,"--Well, anytime you're talking about a waiver or estoppel theory, the premise is that there... there may well have been underlying error, and the question is whether the defendant is precluded."
2005.05-5992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2123.335,2127.492,"But, you know, Congress could have... could have written it the way... the way you're proposing it."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2152.139,2152.42,No.
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2204.478,2209.042,"Well, it seems to me the Government is equally remiss for not pointing out the obligations of the court under the act."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2228.874,2231.406,"--Well, I mean, there are two concerns."
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2240.533,2249.473,"Well, of course, I'm... I'm supposing that after this rule, there would be no trial because there would be... if... if you don't prevail, there wouldn't be a trial."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2249.473,2256.599,"Oh, I... well, if dismissal was required in this case, I think dismissal would be without prejudice as opposed to with prejudice and therefore--"
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2256.599,2260.881,And I'm asking are there... are there severe costs with that when there's been no trial?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2260.881,2264.694,--If there had not already been... oh.
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2264.694,2265.961,There's... there's no trial.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2265.961,2266.414,This is pretrial.
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2266.414,2274.993,The... the action is dismissed for a Speedy Trial Act violation because the petition of the petitioner here is accepted by this Court and the Government just reindicts.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2274.993,2276.852,"Oh, there's already been a trial."
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2276.852,2279.479,I'm hypothesizing that there hasn't been.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2279.479,2279.698,Okay.
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2279.698,2280.824,The case is dismissed.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2280.824,2281.011,I see.
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2281.902,2282.667,And there is a reindictment.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2282.667,2282.964,Right.
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2283.402,2286.34,How costly is that to the system other than getting the grand jury together?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2286.34,2286.715,Sorry.
2005.05-5992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2323.114,2330.193,In this... is there a statute of limitations problem in... in these cases if their dismissal is without prejudice?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2330.193,2331.006,No.
2005.05-5992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2345.961,2346.978,Counsel--
2005.05-5992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2346.978,2347.228,Mr.--
2005.05-5992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2347.228,2354.979,"--the... the argument you're making is really one of invited error, and I'm not sure it even applies on these facts."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2382.548,2393.19,"Well, I think that when a... when a litigant expressly waives his rights under an act, that the very natural effect of that is to make the court think he does not have to follow that act and that would include the findings requirement."
2005.05-5992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2393.19,2403.037,"Well, in this case, the judge told the defendant I've got a solution to this."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2403.928,2405.538,No.
2005.05-5992,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2455.783,2467.582,Do you have any idea how often this... this sort of situation comes up where there's an alleged violation of the act and then a denial by the district court of a pretrial motion to dismiss?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2467.582,2472.928,I think that happens with some regularity.
2005.05-5992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2477.475,2490.822,"--You... you made an argument a moment ago which included the point that he asked for this particular relief and represented what he needed to do if he got the relief, the continuance."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2529.736,2531.299,Yes.
2005.05-5992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2562.696,2562.916,Yes.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2565.948,2566.667,--Yes.
2005.05-5992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2586.859,2592.078,Except... except where there's a public policy against what you want to estop him into doing.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2617.802,2630.071,"--Well, I think the... I mean, I... I agree that... I mean, whether it's waiver or it's estoppel, if Congress manifests an affirmative intent to displace those doctrines, they don't apply."
2005.05-5992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2686.301,2694.756,"If... if what you say is true, I don't know why it makes any difference that the defendant led the court into it."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2712.447,2714.791,"Well, the question then would be harmless error analysis."
2005.05-5992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2721.324,2726.341,It's harmless error because he... the evidence of guilt was substantial?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2728.263,2728.607,--No.
2005.05-5992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2778.773,2780.96,Why do you... why do you put that in a separate category?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2807.186,2818.298,"--Well, I... I agree that... that section (h)(8) is different from the incompetency exclusion, for example, which I'll turn to in a minute, in that does tie the... the findings to the excludability."
2005.05-5992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2834.191,2836.255,Or say the error is not complying with the act.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2836.255,2851.352,"--Right, and then... but the... but the... I mean, ordinarily that... just not complying with the act generally is harmless, and the question would be is... is that... because, remember, the... the only thing that's subject to mandatory dismissal is not trying someone within 70 relevant days."
2005.05-5992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2851.352,2866.87,"Yes, within 70 relevant days counted as the statute requires them to be counted, which includes the requirement of this finding set forth in the record before you can stop the clock running for... you know, for some period."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2871.465,2872.043,Right.
2005.05-5992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2890.236,2890.674,Which court?
2005.05-5992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2890.674,2892.72,"Oh, no, that... pardon?"
2005.05-5992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2892.72,2908.741,"The... is that... is there any reason to believe that the judge, of course, would clarify it and say ends of justice, if we took your remand solution."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2908.741,2909.538,Right.
2005.05-5992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2926.024,2926.838,Well--
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2926.838,2927.916,--It does seem more reasonable.
2005.05-5992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2928.353,2943.451,"--It seems to me that in this case, that... that all purpose waiver that the judge and not for the first time proposed is... is what caused all this."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2961.157,2964.892,"--At... at the time, I mean, there was... there was... especially this was 10 years ago."
2005.05-5992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3016.779,3019.623,But it was not known at the time that he was incompetent.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3031.36,3042.269,"Well, the... the act has a lengthy series of these resulting from exclusions, and with the exception of (h)(8), which is unusual in terms of the ends of justice finding, these operate automatically as this Court said in Henderson."
2005.05-5992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3094.515,3101.283,You really don't know the answer of whether the clock is running until the finding is made.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3137.681,3145.901,I... I don't think it's appropriate to presume that an Article III judge would have a defendant imprisoned and committed if he was not actually incompetent.
2005.05-5992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3173.814,3178.127,Are you... are you relying to any extent on something that I think you brought up?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3188.817,3198.131,"We haven't relied on that because that would have been the... that... that's an appropriate basis for an ends of justice continuance, but no continuance was ever sought or granted for the relevant period."
2005.05-5992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3210.149,3215.697,"Even if we agree with you on the incompetency exclusion, we still have to reach the waiver for all time question."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3220.51,3221.871,--No.
2005.05-5992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3227.512,3229.92,You're not suggesting he was incompetent during that period as well.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3229.92,3233.218,"Oh, the defendant was incompetent the whole time?"
2005.05-5992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3233.218,3234.14,Yes.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3234.14,3235.171,No.
2005.05-5992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3263.146,3273.46,Am... am I correct that the... the particular provision that you think is relevant here is... is (h)(1)(A) on page 4 of the... the appendix in the blue brief?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3273.46,3273.835,No.
2005.05-5992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3280.586,3280.915,I've... I've got it.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3281.633,3283.508,And that applies whether the defendant is competent or not.
2005.05-5992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3286.478,3295.152,"What... what do you make of the language, any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent?"
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3311.984,3320.844,"Well, I'm happy to move to that as well, but before that, I mean, it is... there can be concurrent causes and there can be objective concurrent causes."
2005.05-5992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3328.049,3328.439,"Okay, but isn't that a--"
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3328.439,3328.939,"--during the relevant time period, he couldn't."
2005.05-5992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3328.939,3334.346,--isn't that a harmless error analysis rather than a... a subsection (4) analysis?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3334.346,3339.661,"Well, I think Congress... you're right that it's based in part on the principle that, look, of course, he couldn't have been tried then."
2005.05-5992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3353.726,3362.681,But... but I guess my only point is that (4) does not say any period during which the defendant is mentally incompetent.
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3389.39,3391.078,--If I could answer the question.
2005.05-5992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3391.078,3393.391,"If it was a question, yes."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3393.391,3395.11,The... the fact--
2005.05-5992,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3395.516,3398.407,"It was... it was cleverly disguised, but it really was a question."
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3398.814,3402.892,I... I... I'll try to give a cleverly disguised answer.
2005.05-5992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.892,3403.83,Isn't... isn't that so?
2005.05-5992,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3404.314,3406.737,The... the fact existed all along.
2005.05-5992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3414.848,3415.88,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-5992,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3418.365,3427.414,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to pick up on questions that both you and Justice Scalia asked regarding the... the language of the statute."
2005.05-5992,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3553.535,3558.395,It goes back some way because he's looking at reports from those earlier times.
2005.05-5992,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3561.426,3564.552,"--Well, the... the finding is effective from that point forward."
2005.05-5992,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3595.418,3596.168,What do you mean--
2005.05-5992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3596.168,3597.575,I guess you can be... I'm sorry.
2005.05-5992,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3597.575,3612.751,"--If the judge, when he finally found the defendant competent, had said expressly, and I... I made this determination in my mind shortly after the hearing and the... the briefs that were submitted at that time, but now I'm putting it on the record, that wouldn't be sufficient?"
2005.05-5992,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3612.751,3614.72,"No, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3635.27,3639.288,"Where does the act say that, that there has to be a finding at the time?"
2005.05-5992,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3639.288,3645.648,"Well, the court said... the act says it in... in section (h)(1)(J)."
2005.05-5992,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3674.405,3674.67,No.
2005.05-5992,2,23464,edward_scott_zas,,3684.829,3686.844,"--If I may answer the question, Your Honor."
2005.05-5992,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3698.3,3702.3,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
