2008.07-1356,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.785,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-1356, Kansas v. Ventris."
2008.07-1356,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,7.137,24.031,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court has always held that a defendant's voluntary statements obtained in violation of constitutional standards may be used for impeachment purposes when the defendant testifies at trial."
2008.07-1356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.949,104.4,When does -- when does the Sixth Amendment violation occur?
2008.07-1356,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,104.4,109.471,"That question, Your Honor, as you realize, is debated a bit in the briefs."
2008.07-1356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.735,146.977,"Do you -- do we have any other situation in which, for purposes of impeaching testimony, a constitutional violation is allowed?"
2008.07-1356,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,146.977,162.939,"--Well, that's the -- that's one of the intricacies of -- of this particular question, although arguably in the -- in the Fifth Amendment context certainly, the Miranda warnings are given."
2008.07-1356,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,182.334,183.269,It's parallel to the Fifth.
2008.07-1356,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,183.269,189.106,"--It's parallel to the Fifth in this respect, and certainly, distinct from the Fourth in that respect."
2008.07-1356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,234.202,246.343,"It would make no difference, I take it, General McAllister, if this had been a police officer who was pretending to be a cellmate."
2008.07-1356,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,280.866,299.645,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I believe that is correct if -- if it's for example, an undercover officer, someone has gone in -- and in fact, there are cases such as Weatherford v. Bursey that involved an undercover agent who was present for meetings with the defendant and his counsel, and the Court indicated that the presence alone would not violate the right to counsel."
2008.07-1356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,337.768,349.559,--So the police know that they -- they can get around the clear prohibition on their questioning without Miranda warnings by pretending to be a jailbird.
2008.07-1356,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,349.559,351.678,"Potentially, yes."
2008.07-1356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,366.104,373.341,"No, I'm -- I'm assuming we're not in the area where the jail mate is -- is simply passive."
2008.07-1356,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,386.517,392.171,--There is certainly testimony about what he was told to do and what he did.
2008.07-1356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,407.098,412.482,"Anyway, your answer is that a police officer could affirmatively elicit testimony?"
2008.07-1356,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,412.482,416.203,"No, not that he could affirmatively elicit."
2008.07-1356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,421.288,423.624,But you're -- you're talking about impeachment only.
2008.07-1356,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,440.8,444.37,"--Outside of -- well, it would still be admissible for impeachment."
2008.07-1356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.019,474.656,"But you're -- you're making no distinction, then, between the Fifth and Sixth Amendment."
2008.07-1356,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,474.656,486.714,"Well, there may be distinctions, and -- and there is an distinction in the text of the Fifth Amendment -- suggests actually a rule of exclusion when you truly have -- when there truly is a compelled statement."
2008.07-1356,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,518.167,527.273,"What about the argument that essentially this is like taking a pretrial deposition, only one side isn't represented?"
2008.07-1356,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,527.273,534.361,"Well, with all due respect to that argument, Your Honor, we disagree with that."
2008.07-1356,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,833.173,834.791,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,849.449,866.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has consistently allowed the use of voluntary statements obtained in violation of constitutional standards for impeachment purposes, and that same rule should apply here."
2008.07-1356,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,910.772,929.253,"Well, you say there's no deterrent value, since the police are -- are not going to do this, that they know they're not going to be able to use this in their case-in-chief."
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,940.208,942.06,But there is a down side.
2008.07-1356,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,962.224,964.04,Is that really verifiable?
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,991.659,1001.115,"I don't think that there's any evidence in the briefs, and I am not aware of specific instances of discipline, but I think that that's because this situation arises pretty infrequently."
2008.07-1356,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1014.942,1028.499,"At the Federal level, is there anything one way or another, any manual that instructs a U.S. attorney about the use of snitches to extract confessions?"
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1028.499,1035.605,--I think the Department of Justice manual sets out this Court's rules in terms of the Kuhlman case and the Henry case.
2008.07-1356,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.759,1121.461,It seems to me you're just confirming the answer to the Chief Justice's question.
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1128.548,1134.286,"Again, I -- I think that there is a down side in terms of police discipline and the deterrence--"
2008.07-1356,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.286,1137.304,"Has any police officer ever been disciplined for doing this, do you know?"
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1137.304,1138.654,--I -- I--
2008.07-1356,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.654,1140.689,I'd find it rather amazing if he has.
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1140.689,1148.361,"--Again, I think that most police officers just follow the rule that this Court set forth in Kuhlmann, so that this -- this issue has not arisen frequently."
2008.07-1356,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1163.388,1169.542,"Well, defendants sometimes lie, but sometimes people who are in this position in prison are not the most trustworthy people either."
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1169.542,1171.075,--I think if they're--
2008.07-1356,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.075,1172.577,You could bring that out on cross-examination.
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1173.144,1175.429,--That -- that is what I was going to say.
2008.07-1356,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.474,1195.509,"It seems to me that -- that all confirms the fact, well, they have nothing to lose."
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1199.311,1207.734,I think that the -- the fact that the evidence would be unavailable in the government's case-in-chief really is a strong price that the government pays.
2008.07-1356,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.551,1236.336,If it is truthfully reported.
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1240.788,1241.821,Yes.
2008.07-1356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.172,1274.794,"Ms. Saharsky, I'm -- I'm still a little hung up on -- on whether we would be allowing a constitutional violation."
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1298.91,1300.477,--Certainly not.
2008.07-1356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.813,1306.813,Exactly.
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1312.651,1317.705,Because the text of the Sixth Amendment doesn't say anything about the exclusion of evidence at trial.
2008.07-1356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.679,1331.215,But its real meaning is that counsel is guaranteed at trial.
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1332.081,1333.248,I'm sorry.
2008.07-1356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1334.0,1337.719,Its root purpose is that counsel is guaranteed at trial.
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1346.39,1347.674,That's not true.
2008.07-1356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.18,1361.067,So you say that -- you say the Sixth Amendment violation occurs before trial.
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1361.067,1362.6,--I'm sorry if I suggested that.
2008.07-1356,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.138,1368.688,Right.
2008.07-1356,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1368.688,1376.927,"And that's because the government should not be allowed to go behind counsel prior to trial and gather up statements, and then use them to prove guilt at trial."
2008.07-1356,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1456.712,1457.795,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,1467.318,1492.968,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I guess I have basically three arguments with the -- or problems with the State's position First of all, what we're dealing with in the Sixth Amendment case here is a violation of a core enumerated trial right, and this makes it a very different animal from all the other cases that we're talking about."
2008.07-1356,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1516.767,1519.285,Wasn't this individual represented by counsel?
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,1521.568,1522.837,"--Yes, he was."
2008.07-1356,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.837,1530.324,"And he was represented by counsel at the time that the informant took the statement, got the statement elicited."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,1532.86,1538.264,"No, I don't think so."
2008.07-1356,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1539.114,1541.882,"I have my memo that I haven't looked through carefully, but I'd be quite interested."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,1575.972,1576.955,--No.
2008.07-1356,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1576.955,1577.539,How can I find out?
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,1577.539,1582.543,"No, the -- I don't know exactly the day that this happened."
2008.07-1356,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1626.888,1630.274,So it might be he asked for counsel but hadn't yet received counsel.
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,1630.274,1633.911,"Correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-1356,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1633.911,1649.77,"Counsel, do -- do I understand the first sentence on page 6 of your brief to concede that there's no deterrent value from prohibiting the introduction of these statements for impeachment?"
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,1660.126,1662.626,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-1356,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1715.111,1744.53,"So in a situation like we have here where the law enforcement officers do not instruct the informant to do anything that would violate the Sixth Amendment and in fact, according to their testimony, instruct him to engage in conduct that's consistent with the Sixth Amendment, there's no deterrent value in later suppressing the use of the statements for impeachment purposes."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,1744.53,1752.902,"--I mean, I guess, maybe I'm confused."
2008.07-1356,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1766.126,1767.728,What do you want to deter?
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,1774.299,1777.434,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-1356,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1821.946,1822.815,"Yes, I see the problem."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,1869.261,1872.396,"--I do not, Your Honor."
2008.07-1356,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1878.985,1895.511,"You -- you agree with the representations on -- from your friends on the other side that there's no case of ours where we've excluded a statement or evidence submitted for impeachment, even though it would have been excluded in this case-in-chief."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,1905.886,1909.921,It would be a very different rule.
2008.07-1356,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.011,1947.296,That's what I'm not certain about.
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2005.751,2019.975,"Well, in -- I think one of the complicating factors here, Your Honor, is that the State in this particular case didn't try a straightforward interrogation."
2008.07-1356,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.611,2023.061,"No, no."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2071.027,2079.883,I don't know whether he had asked for a lawyer or not.
2008.07-1356,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2088.821,2095.475,"But we do know that unlike the police giving Miranda warnings, there's no warning here at all."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2113.937,2116.806,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-1356,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2116.806,2149.544,"But the other side says well, practically the defendant is much more likely to say something that's really involuntary when he's confronting police officers -- that the reason that we exclude in the case of a police officer is the intimidating setting when the defendant is in the police station or in the cell and there are these police officers."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2160.768,2175.011,"Well, Your Honor, I think that there certainly can be a coercive atmosphere even if you're not talking to a known police agent."
2008.07-1356,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2207.416,2221.742,"Counsel, you've -- you've emphasized that what distinguishes this case from the other ones where we've allowed evidence that would be excluded from the case-in-chief and for impeachment purposes is that this is a trial right."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2255.629,2263.735,"Your Honor, I think it goes to the nature of the harm that comes from a Sixth Amendment violation."
2008.07-1356,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2278.079,2281.614,"Well, it seems to me you're getting away from the basis for your distinction then, saying, well, it's not just at trial."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2293.088,2305.729,"--Well, because the harm isn't something that just affects the outcome of the trial, it also affects -- it affects the litigation in a much, much deeper way."
2008.07-1356,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2313.518,2320.089,"Just to pause on that, it affects his decision to testify because it makes it more likely that he'll testify truthfully if he is going to testify."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2320.089,2322.108,--Not necessarily.
2008.07-1356,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2322.108,2332.646,The focus -- the focus on the trial context is at least a double-edged sword since the harm that we're facilitating under your rule is to allow -- allow perjured testimony.
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2332.646,2337.8,"Yes, Your Honor, in some contexts it would."
2008.07-1356,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2355.995,2362.483,"Yes, and if he has the assistance of counsel at trial, consistent with the Sixth Amendment, those -- those problems could be pointed out."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2372.54,2379.194,"In some cases, it will be possible for counsel to vigorously cross-examine the informant."
2008.07-1356,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2416.319,2416.969,"Oh, I think it would."
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2434.714,2446.422,"It would, Your Honor, inasmuch as it would remove any disincentive for the police to obtain this evidence by this manner in the first place."
2008.07-1356,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2450.224,2463.698,Which of the things that you've just said that result from the use of this for impeachment would not be true with respect to the other situations where illegally obtained evidence has been used for impeachment purposes?
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2465.3,2468.251,"I think they would be largely the same, Your Honor."
2008.07-1356,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2489.832,2498.021,"You don't dispute that there was a Sixth Amendment violation at the time when the statement was taken, do you?"
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2498.021,2500.39,"No, I do not."
2008.07-1356,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2500.39,2511.012,You urged a -- a fall-back position.
2008.07-1356,2,35766,matthew_j_edge,,2550.405,2553.357,"Yes, you could, Your Honor."
2008.07-1356,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2595.934,2596.97,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1356,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2600.172,2607.659,Two quick points by way of rebuttal.
2008.07-1356,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2686.211,2688.73,Wouldn't that apply equally to use of the statement on--
2008.07-1356,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2688.73,2691.363,"It could, Your Honor."
2008.07-1356,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2710.144,2711.51,"Thank you, counsel."
