2010.09-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.337,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-1272, Kentucky v. King."
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,9.106,12.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,43.51,57.42,Where did the -- where did the Kentucky Supreme Court -- where did the Kentucky Supreme Court say that it was looking to a subjective state of mind on the part of the police?
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,57.42,83.57,"Well, the Kentucky Supreme Court's first prong of their test, and I believe it's in our petition appendix on page 26 -- I'm sorry."
2010.09-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.132,105.566,That didn't -- that didn't apply in this case?
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,105.566,106.066,That is correct.
2010.09-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,123.925,126.11,Why is -- why is that subjective?
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,133.197,137.934,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, it -- it isn't directly a subjective inquiry."
2010.09-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,205.829,214.415,"So, you have an apartment building where the police know from experience there is a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug transactions."
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,225.973,232.646,"--Well, there's -- I would say yes, if there is probable cause as well as--"
2010.09-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,232.646,239.3,"Well, the probable cause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know, flushing and, you know, the hiding or whatever behind the door."
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,239.3,243.002,"--Well, I would assert that there are -- there are two separate issues here."
2010.09-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,252.29,271.937,"They go to the apartment building and they sniff at every door, and when they sniff, when a strong smell of marijuana emanates from the door, then they go through this routine, but they do it as a matter of every 2 weeks, as the Chief said, as a routine matter."
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,287.964,300.688,"Justice Ginsburg, under a simple lawfulness test, since the officers have not violated the Fourth Amendment prior to the exigency arising, there would be no need to suppress any evidence."
2010.09-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,305.574,319.316,--to the Chief Justice when he said -- and I think this was the Solicitor General's position -- that the police can routinely knock at a door and wait to see if they hear a toilet flushing.
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,327.22,329.688,"--Yes, if -- if probable cause exists."
2010.09-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,329.688,333.79,"Well, why -- why do you need the probable cause inquiry?"
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,336.908,341.96,"Well, under the Fourth Amendment for a reasonable warrantless search to occur, a police officer must have--"
2010.09-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,341.96,342.645,Before they can go in--
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,342.645,343.161,--Yes.
2010.09-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,344.378,345.68,--because they have just heard the toilet flushing?
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,345.68,349.149,--They must have probable cause coupled with exigent circumstances.
2010.09-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,349.149,349.515,I'm sorry.
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,365.975,367.508,There are two separate issues here.
2010.09-1272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,373.562,374.248,To knock on the door?
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,376.748,377.616,"--No, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-1272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,378.4,379.066,Take us--
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,379.066,380.616,--they could knock on the door.
2010.09-1272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,381.05,383.035,--Take us through it -- take us through it chronologically.
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,388.906,389.572,--He could knock on the door.
2010.09-1272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,389.572,391.958,--He smells marijuana--
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,391.958,393.493,The smell of--
2010.09-1272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.493,394.243,--then he knocks on the door.
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,397.112,401.413,"--Well, the smell of marijuana would give probable cause to obtain a search warrant."
2010.09-1272,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,415.406,418.775,But I don't understand why the smell of marijuana is necessary.
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,447.358,448.742,"--Well, I think -- I think we're confused."
2010.09-1272,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,454.812,458.098,Probable cause beyond thinking that the evidence--
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,458.098,458.648,--Beyond the reasonable belief--
2010.09-1272,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,458.648,458.898,--is being destroyed?
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,458.898,459.264,--Yes.
2010.09-1272,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,459.798,460.231,Okay.
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,460.231,460.798,That is correct.
2010.09-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.798,464.25,"It might just be somebody going to the toilet, right?"
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,464.25,464.802,It could be.
2010.09-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.635,470.853,"So, you have to suspect that the reason the toilet is flushing is somebody is trying to get rid of evidence."
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,475.924,477.94,"Yes, Justice Scalia, you're absolutely correct."
2010.09-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,477.94,480.042,"So there's only one probable cause, right?"
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,480.042,480.359,Yes.
2010.09-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,480.359,480.876,Okay.
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,480.876,481.426,Yes.
2010.09-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,501.972,502.824,And may we just--
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,502.824,503.44,--and experience.
2010.09-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,503.44,522.719,"--Mr. Farley, may we just go back over -- you're putting in the fleeing felon, but as far as I understand from this record, it was never shown that the dealer that the police were following was aware that he was following and that he was fleeing from them."
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,541.382,544.151,"That -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,561.244,561.946,"Sure, you can."
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,579.574,579.807,Certainly.
2010.09-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,591.113,591.882,And in your view--
2010.09-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,591.882,595.917,Question -- may I ask a question that goes back to what you said?
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,651.754,658.924,"Well, the officers testified under these circumstances that they believed that they were in hot pursuit of this felon."
2010.09-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,670.28,690.193,"--Counsel, why was -- how does this holding by us not become a simple warrantless entry in any drug case, meaning police knock on the door, suspect doesn't answer it, gets up and moves to their bedroom?"
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,712.039,712.589,--Well--
2010.09-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,712.589,714.289,Aren't we just doing away with Johnson?
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,727.432,729.715,"--Well, I would disagree with you."
2010.09-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.776,762.6,"What if -- what if the defendants here had not flushed the evidence down but had answered the door and said, ""Yes""?"
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,768.504,772.956,They could have sought a consensual encounter with the occupant--
2010.09-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.956,775.889,"Oh, yes, but they say: Oh, heck, no, you can't come in; do you have a warrant?"
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,775.889,778.408,--Then the officers would not have been able to force entry.
2010.09-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,778.408,784.077,"So basically the -- the police were taking advantage of the stupidity of the criminals, is that right?"
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,788.215,795.285,"Well, I don't if I -- I don't know that I would phrase it -- there is no -- there is not a requirement to inform an occupant of a right to denial."
2010.09-1272,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,800.853,806.157,"What if the officers had simply knocked, said we're going to kick the door in if you don't open it?"
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,806.157,815.279,"I believe that's still fine under a lawfulness test, unless the occupant of the home submits to that show of authority and comes to the door and allows entry."
2010.09-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,815.763,823.183,"Well, after -- after they've heard the movement inside or the flushing or whatever, you can't just kick it in because you've smelled marijuana."
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,829.938,835.307,"--Well, I believe that the noises that they heard were consistent with destruction of physical evidence based upon--"
2010.09-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.307,836.842,"Yes, but without that noise."
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,837.326,838.092,"--No, no."
2010.09-1272,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.092,838.878,"--No, of course not."
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,838.878,839.211,"So no, no, of course not."
2010.09-1272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,851.769,860.356,"But this may be a bit rudimentary, but can you tell me why isn't the evidence isn't always being destroyed when the marijuana is being smoked?"
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,862.808,866.529,"I -- Justice Kennedy, I -- I would tend to -- I would tend to agree with you."
2010.09-1272,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,886.84,890.208,So the distinction is being destroyed as opposed to being consumed?
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,890.208,891.958,"--Correct, that is -- that is correct."
2010.09-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,891.958,894.244,How is it -- you mention Johnson.
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,894.244,895.696,Yes.
2010.09-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.696,902.35,And I think the other side says it was the same thing except it was a hotel room instead of an apartment building.
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,906.968,912.305,"Well, what occurred in Johnson, I believe, is -- is completely different than what occurred here."
2010.09-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,922.344,923.861,Didn't they smell marijuana or opium or something?
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,923.861,928.331,"--Well, they did, and they knocked on the door, and she came to the door and they -- they forced their way in."
2010.09-1272,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,941.389,941.908,You left out one thing.
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,950.078,952.013,"Well, I believe they heard sounds when they knocked on the door."
2010.09-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,968.891,969.925,"Thank you, Mr. Farley."
2010.09-1272,0,30348,joshua_d_farley,,969.925,970.508,Thank you.
2010.09-1272,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,970.508,982.699,Ms. O'Connell.
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,982.699,985.318,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1003.012,1028.46,"Could you -- does a ruling in this case that any lawful conduct by the police mean that the police knock, somebody gets up on the other side and walks through a closed door, and closes a door in the back, and police say in my experience it's -- it's consistent with the destruction of property that drug dealers will go into a closed room to get rid of it."
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1029.293,1032.095,"--I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.781,1034.281,Why -- why not?
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1040.868,1043.387,"--Well, a person might not--"
2010.09-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.387,1044.755,"That's peculiar behavior, isn't it?"
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1044.755,1046.905,--A person doesn't have to answer the door.
2010.09-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1053.195,1059.849,"Is that a common experience, that you knock on a door and all you hear is somebody walking out of the room and shutting a door?"
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1059.849,1063.633,"I mean, I -- I guess that a person is entitled to do that."
2010.09-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.633,1068.787,"I don't recall it ever happening to me, but maybe -- maybe I'm a likable fellow and people open the door."
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1069.454,1077.441,"I mean, I think that that -- that's certainly a lawful option that somebody has when the police officers knock at their door."
2010.09-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.926,1081.028,They could say: Go away.
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1084.894,1085.83,--That's--
2010.09-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1085.83,1086.83,Strange.
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1086.83,1090.298,--I guess some people might do that if they don't want to give consent to police entry.
2010.09-1272,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1101.773,1102.689,And what was that here?
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1113.061,1120.215,"Justice Ginsburg, it's our position that the Court should assume that there was an exigency in this case."
2010.09-1272,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1165.763,1182.706,"Ms. O'Connell, if I could ask you about the government's proposed standard: You say that as long as each step in the police conduct is lawful, that's sufficient, and each step would -- the way the Fourth Amendment works, each step, we're asking, essentially, whether each step is reasonable."
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1224.1,1232.205,"I think the problem with that test, Justice Kagan, is that police officers have options of how they can conduct searches and seizures."
2010.09-1272,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1266.129,1276.484,"Is it your position that the police can do anything that's lawful, even if the purpose of doing so is to create exigent circumstances?"
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1276.484,1289.827,"Yes, I think that under this Court -- the way that this Court has interpreted Fourth Amendment warrant exceptions, as long as there is no violation of the Fourth Amendment, that is okay."
2010.09-1272,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1292.51,1299.266,"The -- the question presented in the blue brief used the word ""impermissible"", and we're talking about unlawful."
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1306.003,1308.539,"Well, yes, there is a difference."
2010.09-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.42,1338.808,"What are the objections to adding in the alternative, ""or in bad faith""?"
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1338.808,1360.471,"--Justice Breyer, the objection to that is simply that in all cases that are founded upon probable cause that are not programmatic searches that are conducted without any individualized suspicion, this Court has repeatedly rejected prongs of a Fourth Amendment test that -- that rely on the subjective--"
2010.09-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1360.471,1361.537,Objectively?
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1374.314,1376.766,"--I'm sorry, I don't--"
2010.09-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1376.766,1404.266,"My point is a solely unlawfulness test would allow the police to get into the habit of just knocking at every door, but if you say that also, it has to survive a bad faith test, where bad faith is objectively, not subjectively, determined, then you will rule out the possibility of the police hatching -- which I don't know if they would, but hatching such a plan."
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1404.266,1410.087,--I guess that it's not totally clear what bad faith would mean in this context.
2010.09-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1410.087,1415.808,"Well, there are circuits who have adopted a bad faith test in the alternative with other things than the word ""unlawful""."
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1436.471,1443.891,"Justice Breyer, I don't -- I don't know what it means to act in bad faith in a case like this as a police officer."
2010.09-1272,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1443.891,1451.564,Maybe it could mean having no reason for knocking on the door other than to create exigent circumstances.
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1451.564,1460.669,"Well, Justice Alito, I think that it would be difficult to determine objectively whether that was the case."
2010.09-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.186,1463.454,"Well, the police say, oh, I don't want to get a warrant."
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1483.083,1494.708,"--I think that there's already a significant risk built into the Fourth Amendment that police officers, if they knock on the door and they don't hear somebody destroying evidence inside, they're going to have to leave and get a warrant."
2010.09-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.924,1502.979,You don't know that they're destroying evidence unless you have reason to believe that there is contraband inside.
2010.09-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1509.9,1514.002,"No, I mean to add: And in fact, there's probable cause."
2010.09-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1514.002,1514.335,--Okay.
2010.09-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1514.335,1515.954,"In addition, he smelled the marijuana."
2010.09-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1518.739,1519.606,"Well, that's a different hypothetical."
2010.09-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1521.191,1521.591,All right.
2010.09-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1522.075,1525.527,--they knock on every door under which they smell marijuana.
2010.09-1272,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1525.527,1526.127,Correct.
2010.09-1272,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.395,1528.795,Perfectly okay.
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1528.795,1539.501,"--Right, and I think that there's -- the Court shouldn't be concerned, and certainly shouldn't be concerned enough to adopt a bad faith or a subjective motivation prong to a test that it creates--"
2010.09-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1539.501,1550.825,"But what makes that different than knocking on the door and saying, open the door or I'm going to kick it in?"
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1558.098,1561.533,"--That's true, and, Justice Sotomayor, to be clear--"
2010.09-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1561.533,1585.648,"So why wouldn't that objectively be bad faith if what we find out is they now have a tactic which is they go through this building and every time they smell marijuana, hash, or -- I don't know if crack cocaine smells or not when they're smoking it, but whenever they smell something, they just do that."
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1585.648,1598.139,--I think the fact that if the person actually does what the police officer says and answers the door will mean that the evidence would be excluded as a coerced consent search is enough of a deterrent to that sort of conduct.
2010.09-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1598.139,1601.491,So there's no bad faith measure whatsoever in your--
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1601.491,1602.86,I don't think it's necessary.
2010.09-1272,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1602.86,1606.912,"--analysis, and lawfulness is defined by actual physical seizure."
2010.09-1272,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1614.916,1618.118,"I think that's right, if the person submits to the command."
2010.09-1272,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1618.118,1619.136,"Thank you, Ms. O'Connell."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1633.479,1636.045,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1660.547,1660.963,"Well, you're--"
2010.09-1272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1660.963,1661.497,I'm sorry.
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1661.497,1680.793,"--You're describing what you think the evidence was to support exigency, and the suggestion we have heard on the other side is that that's an issue that can be addressed on remand once we, according to the other side, correct the State court's error in that this -- you -- the police cannot create exigent circumstances."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1690.082,1694.95,It's relevant because it goes to whether exigent circumstances existed.
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1707.525,1708.81,"No, it's -- it's not at all."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1721.701,1729.39,There's no point in delving into whether an exigency was created by the police if there is no exigency to begin with.
2010.09-1272,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1729.39,1742.615,"Well, I -- I think the Court is interested in taking the case on the question whether or not the police may create exigent circumstances and use those exigent circumstances to enter."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1748.769,1760.076,"The other problem with remanding this case for further determination on this issue is, as this Court is aware, the procedural posture of this case is troubling."
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1766.913,1767.546,"Oh, sure, there is."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1775.936,1793.98,"--That conclusion is dependent on the notion that in an indictment it's merged with the judgment such that a decision in the Commonwealth's favor in this case would vacate the decision of the Kentucky Supreme Court, which in turn vacates the underlying suppression order."
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1802.903,1805.938,"This is the argument you presented to us in the letter, right?"
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1805.938,1806.788,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1806.788,1809.74,"And, yet, we nonetheless decided to have argument?"
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1809.74,1810.259,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1810.259,1814.794,"So maybe it would be -- it's your case, but maybe it would be best to move on to the legal issue."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1814.794,1825.852,"If we move to the question of whether the police have created exigent circumstances, it's important that we're all operating on the same understanding of the facts in this case."
2010.09-1272,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1841.075,1843.241,Did the trial court make those findings?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1852.263,1853.23,Yes.
2010.09-1272,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1853.23,1854.147,But what else did they do?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1854.147,1854.78,Yes.
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1904.011,1904.896,"Where's -- no ""open up""."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1906.463,1907.331,--Yes.
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1926.626,1931.946,Is that after -- after the exigent circumstances or the alleged exigent circumstances were presented?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1937.6,1945.54,It's -- it's unclear from the trial court's factual finding what the order of events was.
2010.09-1272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.294,1954.812,Loudly.
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1960.55,1962.75,--It's unreasonable conduct.
2010.09-1272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.75,1964.334,Is it -- if it unlawful?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,1968.453,1975.059,"Well, it's certainly not unlawful in the sense that it violates any provision of the penal code."
2010.09-1272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.677,1988.45,"Miss Drake, the problem I have is there are a lot of constraints on -- on law enforcement, and the one thing that -- that it has going for it is that criminals are stupid."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2056.889,2059.924,I have two responses to Your Honor's question.
2010.09-1272,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2089.36,2089.86,Could I ask you this?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2131.851,2140.957,"--The portion of the Joint Appendix that I quoted to the Court, we explained to them we were going to make entry, appears on page 24."
2010.09-1272,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2140.957,2141.29,Right.
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2141.29,2143.557,"So, if Your Honor keeps reading--"
2010.09-1272,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2143.557,2150.479,It starts -- it says we knew that there was possibly something that was going to be destroyed inside the apartment.
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2158.299,2158.866,--Yes.
2010.09-1272,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2172.142,2173.808,Is there any -- is there any evidence of that?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2176.594,2177.427,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1272,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2200.059,2203.011,"Well, does it -- does it turn on how loudly they knocked?"
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2209.498,2232.095,"It -- it -- it depends entirely on whether a reasonable person would interpret that behavior as the officer conveying the impression that entry was imminent and inevitable, and this feeds back to Justice Scalia's question which is, well, what -- what is unreasonable about what the officers did here?"
2010.09-1272,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2232.095,2244.502,"What was there here to make a reasonable person believe that -- that entry was imminent and inevitable, if -- if all that's done is a knock on the door and they say police, police, police, this is the police?"
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2249.889,2251.006,That is the point.
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2256.96,2259.512,It seems to me that you're trying to change the case.
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2322.234,2331.507,"If I understand Your Honor's question, the officers are engaging in what we would call a true knock and talk."
2010.09-1272,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.102,2375.969,"So you agree that -- that the court below is wrong because what they say as I read it is irrespective of how reasonably the police behave, if it is reasonably foreseeable that their tactic will create exigent circumstances -- and I would think it's reasonably foreseeable when you knock on the door very politely and say ""the police"" that somebody might shout out ""hide the pot"", all right?"
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2428.302,2432.289,--The appropriate test is the test that we propose.
2010.09-1272,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2473.533,2476.918,"Well, Ms. Drake if that's the case, in some way you're agreeing with the government."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2484.238,2498.648,"--And to the extent that lawful is defined as a synonym for unreasonable, and to the extent that there does not need to be a completed antecedent Fourth Amendment violation, we would agree."
2010.09-1272,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2523.43,2527.131,So what took this outside of the category of the ordinary knock and talk?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2527.131,2535.504,"This is not a knock and a -- knock and talk case, this is a knock and announce case or a knock and demand case, which is how the trial court characterized it."
2010.09-1272,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2536.171,2544.677,"Well, I don't know about the labels, but what did they -- what did the police do that went beyond would be permitted under your understanding of a pure knock and talk?"
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2547.879,2551.331,"--Yes, it's the -- it's the banging, not knocking."
2010.09-1272,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2553.283,2554.133,"Banging, not knocking?"
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2554.133,2568.958,"Banging, not a soft -- not the knock that you would expect a reasonable person to engage in, in the ordinary discourse with another person, or that you would expect from an officer attempting to gain consensual--"
2010.09-1272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.958,2590.704,"But I -- you -- you -- you might have considerable support on the Court for the proposition that if the exigent circumstance is created by unlawful activity by the police, which would include conveying the impression that they are about to kick the door in, then -- then you have a different case."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2644.339,2650.909,--What the officers did in this case is the functional equivalent of saying we're going to kick in the door.
2010.09-1272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.137,2671.988,"That wasn't the basis for the decision below, though."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2689.617,2706.81,"I don't disagree that the lower courts did not analyze the problem in this fashion, did not analyze the question in this fashion, but it's a legal question that calls for an examination of how a reasonable person would interpret the behavior, and so--"
2010.09-1272,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2706.81,2711.364,But what does that have to do with the -- the police officers' lawfulness?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2745.851,2747.553,--I--
2010.09-1272,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2747.553,2760.026,"Or -- or are you going further and trying to say that as a matter of fact the testimony's critically clear that they knocked loudly, said ""Police"", and said let us in or we're going to bust it?"
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2760.026,2763.145,--The factual record is clear.
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2786.178,2791.546,So just assume for -- for my sake that the police comes to the door.
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2815.245,2815.947,--Yes.
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2815.947,2816.48,Okay.
2010.09-1272,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2816.48,2818.497,But you said -- just add on to that.
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2843.109,2846.561,I would like this Court to adopt the test that we have proposed.
2010.09-1272,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2846.561,2847.011,Which is?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2847.011,2856.334,Which is that an officer acts unreasonably when he or she conveys the impression that entry into a home is imminent and--
2010.09-1272,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2856.334,2856.936,"No, no, no."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2860.388,2861.254,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1272,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2861.254,2868.475,"Okay, and the reason you choose the word ""unreasonable"" rather than the Second Circuit's test of ""unlawful"" is?"
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2868.475,2876.081,"Because, frankly, I'm not sure what that means, and I think that's become clear in the context of this briefing."
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2888.186,2892.757,"You know -- you don't know what -- you don't know what unlawful means, but you know what unreasonable means?"
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2892.757,2895.459,Yes.
2010.09-1272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.385,2920.825,Do you have any doubt that it's unlawful for a police officer to threaten to burst into a home?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2920.825,2923.542,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2923.542,2927.763,So why do you need unreasonable?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2940.571,2949.76,"Yes, and that's why my answer to Justice Kagan's question was to the extent that unlawful and unreasonable are synonyms, we would agree."
2010.09-1272,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2962.335,2984.183,"If your test is something novel -- Justice Breyer mentioned there are some five tests in the different circuits, and the foreseeability test is the one that the Kentucky Supreme Court used, but is your -- does your test coincide with the tests of any other circuits or is it different?"
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,2984.183,2985.099,Our test is a novel test.
2010.09-1272,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2990.837,2994.539,"Your test, it's -- it's not wild."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,3005.779,3009.131,"That's correct, and by the way--"
2010.09-1272,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3009.131,3009.797,No test.
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,3010.331,3024.057,"--We're not saying that -- we're essentially saying the police shouldn't act as though they have a warrant when they don't have one, which is exactly what they did in this case, and that proposition is not new."
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3082.893,3091.333,What is -- what is an example of conduct that you would consider unreasonable resulting in suppression of the evidence that would not be unlawful?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,3091.333,3097.653,"Well, it's very hard."
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3101.521,3102.255,Right.
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,3102.255,3126.986,"--between those terms, reasonable and unlawful, so long as unlawful doesn't mean violation of a penal code provision and so long as it doesn't mean, as the Commonwealth is suggesting, that there has to be -- that the defendant would have to first demonstrate that the police were seized in order to be able to convincingly argue that the search was unreasonable."
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3126.986,3133.326,So you can't -- can't give me one example of some conduct that's unreasonable under your test that would not be unlawful?
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,3133.326,3138.528,"I can't -- I can't think of one, Your Honor."
2010.09-1272,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.528,3164.261,"The problem is that as reasonable as the test is, it's not the test that was used by the Court below, and you want us to affirm the decision below, which simply said if the exigent circumstances are -- are the consequence of the police action, whatever the police action was -- lawful, reasonable, whatever -- the evidence has to be excluded."
2010.09-1272,2,30082,jamesa_j_drake,,3171.701,3187.644,"Well, the factual record in this case is fully developed, and how a reasonable person would interpret the scenario is a mixed question of law and fact, which -- this Court would review the decision of the Kentucky Supreme Court in that regard de novo anyway."
2010.09-1272,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3243.813,3245.249,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1272,3,30348,joshua_d_farley,,3247.282,3253.336,"My time is short, so I would like to just make a few quick points."
2010.09-1272,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3295.765,3304.288,"Mr. Farley, one of the points of the Fourth Amendment is to ensure that when people search your home, they have a warrant, and of course there are exceptions to that."
2010.09-1272,3,30348,joshua_d_farley,,3353.183,3355.968,"Well, Justice Kagan, I would disagree with you."
2010.09-1272,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3383.868,3392.288,"It wouldn't technically be a Fourth Amendment violation, would it, if the police gave the impression that they had a warrant and were about to kick in the door?"
2010.09-1272,3,30348,joshua_d_farley,,3394.657,3395.74,--I don't believe so.
2010.09-1272,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3395.74,3401.061,So your -- the -- the unlawfulness test would not prevent that?
2010.09-1272,3,30348,joshua_d_farley,,3401.061,3403.811,"No, Justice Scalia, it would not."
2010.09-1272,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3403.811,3404.263,It would not?
2010.09-1272,3,30348,joshua_d_farley,,3408.215,3418.254,"I believe under Hodari D., if the officers demand entry and there has been no response to that demand, there has no -- been no completion of the Fourth Amendment violation."
2010.09-1272,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3420.206,3421.539,"Well, it'd be okay for officers to do that?"
2010.09-1272,3,30348,joshua_d_farley,,3425.509,3437.917,"--I believe that there are -- there are large restrictions and prohibitions to that, that officers are well aware of, because if the person does answer the door, the officers know, well, everything is going to be suppressed."
2010.09-1272,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3438.684,3441.617,"Why, you say that what they've done is not lawful."
2010.09-1272,3,30348,joshua_d_farley,,3442.652,3450.223,"--Well, if they demand entry and entry is given, that is then a Fourth Amendment violation, because they've demanded entry without a warrant."
2010.09-1272,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3455.444,3457.729,They can't gain entry by deception.
2010.09-1272,3,30348,joshua_d_farley,,3459.979,3462.031,No.
2010.09-1272,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3462.031,3462.647,No?
2010.09-1272,3,30348,joshua_d_farley,,3463.197,3477.356,"We would just assert that under the lawfulness test, we aren't asking for anything more or less than this Court has done or other reviewing courts have done for generations, and this is a simple Fourth Amendment analysis."
2010.09-1272,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3494.852,3495.485,"Thank you, counsel."
