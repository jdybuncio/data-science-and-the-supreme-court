1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.768,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-395, United States v. Lori Williams."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,57.679,63.405,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,126.524,142.296,"Mr. Jones, do you concede that the lien was improper because at the time notice of it was given the person who allegedly had incurred the tax liability was not the owner of the property?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,142.296,145.278,"No, Justice Ginsburg, we don't concede that."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,165.981,173.945,"I thought that was conceded, or that was the premise of the decision below, was it not?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,173.945,175.658,Not... not quite.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,175.658,176.988,The... it did--
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,176.988,178.55,"Neither court, if I--"
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,178.55,189.036,"--Just as a matter of chronology, is it not so that the notice of lien was filed some weeks after the property was transferred?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,189.036,203.845,"--After the transfer, and our point with respect to that is that the notice of lien is not needed to be valid as against a person who took the property without qualifying as a purchaser, under 6323 of the code."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.557,208.777,But you say you don't have to litigate that issue?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,208.777,216.875,"--That issue hasn't been reached by either of the courts below, because this issue... the case has been decided solely on jurisdictional grounds."
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.531,250.465,"Well, Mr. Jones, 1346 confers jurisdiction on the district courts."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,250.465,250.926,Yes.
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,250.926,261.284,"But traditionally, in cases like Testan, we've said that simply conferring jurisdiction is not enough."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,264.485,264.925,Right.
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,264.925,266.608,--to waive sovereign immunity.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,267.937,281.919,The short answer to that question is that the waiver of immunity for a claim that would fall within 1346(a)(1) is in section 7422(f) of the Internal Revenue Code.
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.919,285.107,But that appears just to be a statute of limitations.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,285.107,287.32,"No, sir, 7422(f)--"
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.32,287.841,(f).
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,287.841,296.096,--is a statute that says that a claim of the type permitted by 7422(a)... this is very complicated.
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.872,321.222,That's what made Mr. Helvering famous.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,321.222,322.604,I believe that's correct.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,374.777,379.16,"Mr. Jones, would you go back in time with me before there were those later provisions?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,384.444,385.423,1921.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,385.423,388.157,"And the other provisions, the subsequent--"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,388.157,398.423,The provision that this Court held in Dalm modifies 1346(a)(1) is 1724(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,425.541,432.516,"--But the language of 1346(a) and 7422 are matching, and neither or those use the word ""taxpayer""."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,432.516,433.265,"No, they--"
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.265,437.279,So the critical statute you're relying on is not either one of those.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,437.279,439.84,"--It is, in fact, 7422(a)."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,477.514,478.786,What year did that come in?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,478.786,487.42,I can't say.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,487.42,490.543,It was after 1346(a)?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,490.543,494.206,"I doubt that, but I can't say."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.659,505.553,"Not the requirement of an administrative refund claim, but the time limit that refers to the taxpayer."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,514.118,523.625,"That's absolutely right, but 74... our point is that 7422(a) requires that there be a refund claim filed in accordance with law."
1994.94-395,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,536.472,559.419,"But I don't think 6511 provides what you say it provides, because 6511 it seems to me doesn't provide anything more than the fact that a claim for credit or refund of a tax with respect to which the taxpayer is required to file a return shall be filed by the taxpayer within certain periods."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,568.335,577.939,"Actually, I believe that the language of 6511 would apply whether or not a return is required to be filed."
1994.94-395,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,585.275,588.227,"Well, it applies whether or not a return was filed."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,588.227,588.598,Right.
1994.94-395,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,588.598,596.492,But isn't it conditioned upon the requirement of filing by the taxpayer when the taxpayer is the claimant?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,596.492,597.263,Is--
1994.94-395,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,597.263,598.823,"I mean, isn't that what the text says?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,623.91,629.745,"--I'm sorry, I don't believe that's correct, because if you read on, at page 3 of our brief we quote this provision."
1994.94-395,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,629.745,630.483,Yes.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,630.483,634.436,"And the last clause of that sentence says,"
1994.94-395,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,636.768,638.971,If no return was filed by the taxpayer--
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,638.971,639.87,And that--
1994.94-395,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,639.87,647.907,"--but here, her claim is, I am not a taxpayer within the meaning of the statute, because I was never required to file a return as to the taxes you are ultimately collecting."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,647.907,651.377,"--Well, she can't qualify as a taxpayer under the code."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,680.956,687.782,"Mr. Jones, always understood, that's hardly universal."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,741.116,745.648,--I would respectfully disagree with that treatise's description of the law.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,746.43,751.642,"You may very well disagree with it, but you can't say until this case, it was generally understood that."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,751.642,752.653,--I think I--
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,752.653,753.745,You can say it was debatable.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,753.745,759.96,"--Well, whether it was debatable or not, the way we understand the cases is as follows."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,866.527,872.601,"I just brought it up because of your statement that until this case it was generally understood, and I think it's not generally understood."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,872.601,891.585,"--I think that it... I would go so far as to say I submit that it is perfectly accurate to say that other than the two lines of decisions that I just described, every court that has addressed this subject has said, other than Martin and the current decision, has said that the... a nontaxpayer may not sue for a refund."
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.585,895.027,What has been the basis of those courts' position?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,895.027,897.307,There have been a variety of bases.
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,933.853,940.926,"Okay, but where in that complicated structure do they derive the principle that a nontaxpayer can't sue?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,940.926,943.517,I'll track the reasoning.
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,954.627,955.896,7422(a)?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,955.896,958.608,"--Of the Internal Revenue Code, yes."
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.608,959.098,Yes.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,959.098,966.335,It says that such a suit may not be maintained until a claim has first been filed with the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with law.
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,966.335,972.846,"So far we have no limitation to taxpayers, either in 1346 or 7422."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,972.846,986.887,"And like in Dalm, we go on to 6511, and 6511 says that this claim that has to be filed before you can proceed with a case under 1346--"
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,986.887,990.43,"But again, the statute doesn't limit that to taxpayers."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,990.43,990.919,"--Yes, it does."
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,990.919,992.361,You think 6511 does?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,992.361,1001.177,"In 6511(a), it says that the claim shall be filed by the taxpayer within a period of years from the time of the payment of the tax to the filing of the return, or if there was no return--"
1994.94-395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1001.177,1002.867,"Well, that's the statute of limitations section."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1002.867,1003.498,--Yes.
1994.94-395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1003.498,1010.663,"Now, did this taxpayer file an administrative claim for refund first?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1011.673,1016.327,"She filed an administrative claim for refund, but she is not the person who is the taxpayer."
1994.94-395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1016.327,1031.346,"But she was in effect compelled by the Government to do something because the lien had been slapped on the house and she was trying to sell it, and there is a degree of Government compulsion."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1044.314,1048.748,The statutory structure that I've described wasn't the result of historical happenstance.
1994.94-395,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1091.505,1106.925,"All right, except that's a discretionary thing with the IRS, and here she's got an escrow that's going to close in a week, and is there any indication in the world that the IRS would have given her this?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1115.62,1125.619,"Might I first state there's absolutely nothing in the record one way or the other about the conversations that did or did not occur between the Service and the respondent on this subject, and I would encourage--"
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.619,1149.734,"Well, can you tell us whether in general it is the practice of the Government to notify people in this situation who don't owe the tax but whose property is going to be subject to a foreclosure sale if they can't sell it, is it... just like the Social Security Office gives people notice of the death benefits that they're entitled to, does the IRS advise people in these situations?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1149.734,1156.517,--Let me divide your question from the foreclosure to this sale situation.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1177.3,1184.316,"But my question to you is, if she's trying to avoid... she wants to sell the property so she'll avoid a foreclosure."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1203.428,1215.666,"Well, it doesn't quite... well, I mean, you could understand it to mean that, but what it says is that he may in his discretion enter into... the Commissioner may in her discretion enter into these--"
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1215.666,1223.622,"Can you think of a more discretionary way of saying, in the director's discretion, the district director may in his discretion?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1223.622,1230.275,--I don't think that anyone doubts that the Commissioner will exercise her discretion to enter into these agreements.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1236.179,1238.54,Is that based on your knowledge of what's done in the field?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1239.662,1240.253,--Yes.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1240.253,1244.126,--regularly exercise their discretion to make these agreements?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1244.126,1246.067,"Well, there's nothing on that in this record."
1994.94-395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.336,1251.36,"And the point is, isn't it, that you don't really care, under your reading of the statute?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1254.532,1255.904,"No, sir, I wouldn't say that."
1994.94-395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1255.904,1256.553,Well--
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1256.553,1259.233,"There's no refund remedy, that's right."
1994.94-395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.233,1266.81,--There's no... section 3225(b)(3) doesn't help if the Government acts with total arbitrariness.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1266.81,1280.669,"I would say that it does, because if someone... if the Commissioner arbitrarily abused her discretion in refusing to provide a substitute collateral agreement, I suppose that that would help that there would be some basis--"
1994.94-395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.669,1282.171,And there would have been jurisdiction in this case?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1282.171,1282.779,--Well--
1994.94-395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.779,1283.64,You're not saying that.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1283.64,1286.142,"--There wouldn't be in this case, Justice Stevens--"
1994.94-395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.142,1286.672,"Well, that's what I'm talking about."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1286.672,1288.315,--because in this case she sued for a refund.
1994.94-395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.109,1307.425,"Yes, but the statute does not read that the Commissioner shall, unless there is in her judgment reason not to do so, enter into such an agreement."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1310.187,1312.2,"Well, it says it... she may in her discretion."
1994.94-395,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.2,1312.699,--Yes.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1312.699,1321.304,And how a court would decide whether discretion had been abused in a particular situation is frankly a little bit far removed from the question we--
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1321.304,1322.015,Hasn't that language--
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1322.406,1327.259,"--Which is, whether there's jurisdiction for a refund suit for a person who didn't do that."
1994.94-395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.259,1332.323,"It's not that it's far removed, it's... at least in my mind."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1397.024,1410.034,"That's... to us that's a very important question, because we think that this result, deviating from the language of the statutes and the cases, would produce incredibly bad results."
1994.94-395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1423.932,1428.015,What if you just said the person who paid the money can file to get her money back?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1428.015,1437.47,"--You would be permitting a collateral litigation of someone else's tax liability by the person who wasn't, by definition, obligated for it."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1437.47,1440.623,"Oh, no, no, no, she's not seeking to contest whether the husband owes the tax."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1446.095,1452.981,"If you look at page 6, footnote 3, of respondent's brief, you'll see that they do contest the underlying assessments."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1457.044,1463.059,"Well, let's assume... let's assume that the only issue that she's bringing up is her issue, not his issue."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1483.602,1484.801,--I understand your point.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1505.875,1514.67,--Why not the simple... the simple point that the wrong that was done to her was that a lien was put on her property?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1514.67,1519.813,"--Well, it wasn't... that's a question that hasn't been resolved."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1520.174,1523.436,But that's her controversy with the Government.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1530.282,1541.499,--The problem... I take it we accept as taken that there's an enormous problem from allowing the collateral litigation of the liability itself.
1994.94-395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1541.499,1542.16,I don't accept that.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1550.784,1551.155,Okay.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1578.674,1581.156,How about the precedent of this Court set in Lampf?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1588.488,1592.532,--6532 is the statute of limitations for a refund suit.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1626.293,1630.867,There's no wrongful levy here when they never got to the point of making the levy.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1631.626,1632.507,--Yes.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1632.507,1635.471,--They notified her of the lien.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1635.89,1636.971,There's no clear--
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1636.971,1641.613,"--another statute that you haven't mentioned, and I wonder if you can tell us how that plays into it?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1654.752,1655.273,--Yes.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1655.273,1656.993,"And it doesn't use the word, taxpayer."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1656.993,1659.074,That's correct.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1659.955,1668.033,"So she has a claim for a refund, and then here's a substantive provision that says, the Government can give somebody a refund--"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1668.033,1669.512,--For an overpayment--
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1669.512,1671.643,--A refund to the person who made the overpayment.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1671.643,1674.025,"--Right, and there was no overpayment in this case."
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.025,1676.919,Could you--
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1676.919,1689.785,"There would only be... but beyond that, even if there was a claim of an overpayment, it would only be maintained in court under 1346 if it had been first filed as an administrative claim by the taxpayer."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1696.4,1700.881,"--But you get all that from 6511, and then the definition of taxpayer."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1700.881,1710.218,"--And from 80 years of cases addressing this subject that have reached the same conclusion, and from the fact that congress relied on that conclusion in an action--"
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1710.218,1718.824,"Do you have a case like this one, where the person who is making the claim says, this was my property."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1728.15,1728.781,"--Yes, Busse."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.781,1731.644,--You keep saying... what is the closest case to this one?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1731.644,1733.694,The Seventh Circuit decision in Busse is just like this case.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1733.694,1734.084,All right.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1737.506,1741.591,Only consistent with the two lines of authority I described earlier.
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1743.34,1745.902,"Well, let me ask... I want to ask you a question before your time expires."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1759.681,1764.024,"I didn't understand your hypothetical, and I think I may need to."
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1765.894,1768.458,Lot 2 has no connection--
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1768.458,1768.817,--No connection--
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.817,1769.378,--with the tax liability.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1773.181,1776.842,"--They can bring it to the IRS' attention, and the IRS would remove the lien."
1994.94-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.842,1782.266,"Well, but supposing you're going to have a particularly... a curmudgeon, who's the IRS--"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1782.967,1789.75,"Then they can bring... then they bring a quiet title action, or if that's... if they're in a big hurry, they make a substitute collateral agreement."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1789.75,1794.414,That's 65... that's again the discretionary thing.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1794.414,1804.641,"Well, it's discretionary in our view in the sense that Congress wants us to do it when we can work out provisions that make sense in the facts of the case."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1804.641,1805.442,Is your answer--
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1805.442,1808.564,I don't think that anyone has suggested that we've abused our discretion.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1808.564,1829.998,"--Mr. Jones, is your answer to the chief in the case of somebody who is no relation to the taxpayer at all, just a wrong lien on the wrong piece of property, that the only remedies are a quiet title suit... by the time that gets over the foreclosure has long since occurred... or this, within his discretion?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1831.287,1831.848,No.
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1831.848,1832.899,What else?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1832.899,1837.832,"Well, a foreclosure suit and a quiet title suit are wholly separate issues."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1839.863,1841.746,I'm not talking about a foreclosure suit.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1846.618,1850.191,"--They bring a quiet title suit, or they make a substitute collateral agreement if they're in a hurry."
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1850.191,1855.645,"--And if the district director says, in my discretion, no, then what is there?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1855.645,1856.336,"Well, then there--"
1994.94-395,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1856.336,1856.896,She's in a hurry.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1856.896,1860.285,--There's the same kind of a problem they would have with any private creditor who has a lien.
1994.94-395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1863.258,1864.71,"All right, if I have to read--"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1864.71,1866.15,Pardon me?
1994.94-395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.15,1869.291,"--in your mind, the sanctity of the following proposition."
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1874.207,1875.586,That's correct.
1994.94-395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1875.586,1876.307,--That's sacred.
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1876.307,1877.319,That's sacrosanct.
1994.94-395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1877.319,1881.14,"All right, but that is, in my mind, not a tax expert, what do I read?"
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1885.814,1888.426,Flora and Dalm.
1994.94-395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.426,1889.546,Flora?
1994.94-395,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1889.546,1892.878,This Court's opinions in Flora and Dalm.
1994.94-395,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1892.878,1893.639,"All right, fine."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,1902.885,1906.026,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1955.69,1958.2,"Well, that by itself doesn't--"
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,1958.2,1959.422,That's absolutely correct.
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1959.422,1965.206,--tell us much of anything as to what might have been triable issues of fact.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,1965.206,1988.771,"Well, in our complaint, we alleged certain facts, and then in their answer they denied these facts, and then the Government in their conclusions of law submitted to the Court, which is in the Joint Appendix, page 11, their number 12, which specifically states there are no longer any genuine issues of triable fact, which to me means that whatever the issues were in the case from the complaint to the answer no longer exist."
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1988.771,1990.801,Did this go up on a motion for summary judgment?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,1990.801,2001.959,"The judge recharacterized it from a motion for summary judgment to a trial on stipulated facts, and... originally it was submitted as a motion for summary judgment, but he recharacterized it."
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2009.615,2016.548,And so it was a trial on stipulated facts because the parties stipulated that there were no triable issues of fact?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2016.548,2017.159,That's correct.
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.159,2019.229,That's quite remarkable.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2019.229,2033.21,"The Government in essence is arguing that it doesn't matter, because the Government's argument is that she's not the taxpayer, that she has no jurisdiction to sue, so whether or not their collection was erroneous or not is really irrelevant, according to their argument."
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2101.496,2110.631,Are there any authorities indicating that the IRS has processed and paid administrative claims that are filed by persons other than the taxpayer?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2110.631,2111.841,--No.
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2122.568,2123.389,Dismiss the claims?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2123.389,2128.851,"--They dismiss the administrative claim for refund, and the reason they gave in this case--"
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2128.851,2134.586,So the position of the IRS has been consistent that it will only honor refund claims when filed by the taxpayer?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2134.586,2142.07,"--That's their position, but we complied with the statutory scheme by filing the administrative claim, which was then denied, and we then proceeded to district court."
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2142.07,2167.697,"Well, Mr. Panitz, as I understand the Government's reasoning, it's that 7422 says that no suit shall be maintained until you've filed for a refund, and 6511 says that the claim for credit on the... under the refund section must... shall be made by the taxpayer."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2170.54,2184.339,"Well, the Government's position with regard to 6511 makes that provision the Charles Atlas of all tax provisions, because it literally reaches across from title to title and injects 28."
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.339,2196.487,"Well, but if it really is a keystone... I mean, if you have to do this in order to bring a suit for refund, and if to do it you have to be a taxpayer, perhaps that is its effect."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2196.487,2199.688,But the actual language in 6511 is not limiting jurisdiction.
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2203.01,2209.245,"Yes, but 7422 says that must be complied with before you bring a suit for refund."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2209.245,2214.037,"No, actually, counsel misstated the purpose of 7422."
1994.94-395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.401,2236.542,"It doesn't say, by the taxpayer?"
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2236.542,2240.276,"--It doesn't say, by the taxpayer, so there's no limitation there."
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2257.127,2259.728,"Well, nobody ever claimed the tax laws were equitable."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2264.219,2267.652,"--They are fairly strict, but they should be fair."
1994.94-395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2275.178,2276.968,"Yes, but they argue that it is fair."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2342.553,2342.913,Sure.
1994.94-395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.913,2344.121,"--I want you to... yes, to reply to it."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2344.121,2350.176,We're not arguing that she's going to go into court and litigate the liability of her ex-husband.
1994.94-395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2350.917,2352.329,But you asked for that.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2352.329,2353.868,--We're--
1994.94-395,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2353.868,2354.359,I gather.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2354.359,2354.96,--No.
1994.94-395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2354.96,2356.99,"But if we agree with you, it would happen."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2358.022,2369.059,"We mentioned in a footnote as an irony that not only did she not owe the taxes, but her ex-husband didn't owe the taxes, either, but we're not saying that she was go into court and litigate his tax liability."
1994.94-395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2370.93,2375.323,"--But that doesn't matter, because even if you won't, the next person could."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2383.679,2391.963,"No, I think this Court can limit its holding to simply whether or not the person that paid the taxes owed the taxes."
1994.94-395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2391.963,2392.544,Sure we could.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2395.486,2396.157,The language--
1994.94-395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.157,2399.92,The language of this thing either permits a suit or it doesn't permit a suit.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2400.839,2405.703,"--Exactly, and the language of the jurisdictional statute focuses on the language, erroneous collection."
1994.94-395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.156,2410.997,"--Well, it doesn't say--"
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2410.997,2411.778,She didn't owe the taxes.
1994.94-395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2411.778,2412.257,--as to Mrs. Williams.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2413.479,2414.089,Any--
1994.94-395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.089,2417.95,"--because they moved against the wrong person, it could be erroneous because the tax wasn't due."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2417.95,2424.195,"--Any sum alleged to have been excessive, or in any manner wrongfully collected under the Internal Revenue."
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2424.195,2425.908,Isn't it wrongfully collected if it wasn't owed?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2425.908,2427.517,"Yes, it is."
1994.94-395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2427.517,2429.219,"Okay, so there you are."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2438.516,2447.153,"Let's say that she litigates, and the district court rules that she didn't owe the taxes, and the taxes were erroneously collected as to her."
1994.94-395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2455.967,2457.409,"Well, of course he does."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2471.187,2471.968,Correct.
1994.94-395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2471.968,2498.466,"You have a footnote that she, as well, can contest whether he ever owed the tax, and Justice Scalia pointed out that there's nothing in the statute, no language in the statute that would distinguish her contesting the lien on her property as distinguished from her contesting the amount of taxes her husband owes."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2498.466,2503.709,"I'm going to give you sort of an abstract analogy, but I'd like you to follow along just for a second."
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2551.73,2558.685,"It's not clear to me, what is it that she wants to contest if she goes into the district court?"
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2566.25,2580.89,She's going to contest the validity of the tax lien that was placed on her property after she had been conveyed the property for adequate consideration and under the Internal Revenue Code that lien was in error.
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2585.053,2589.265,Is the only way she can challenge that is by first paying the tax?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2589.265,2591.058,By first paying... no.
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2600.581,2601.983,Would the quiet title have been adequate?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2601.983,2606.267,"Absolutely not, under the facts of this case, because of the way the lien arose."
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2608.598,2611.46,Is what you're saying is that she'd lose on the merits?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2611.46,2614.051,"--No, she would not lose on the merits."
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2631.293,2633.076,"All right, so quiet title is one."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2638.117,2638.886,Correct.
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2638.886,2639.657,Anything else?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2639.657,2644.371,And she could file a claim for refund if she acquiesces in the payment of the taxes under duress--
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2644.371,2647.544,Although that's the issue that is before us.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2647.544,2647.972,--That is the issue here.
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2647.972,2648.723,Mr. Panitz--
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2648.723,2649.124,Yes.
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2649.124,2662.614,"--a moment ago you said that, I believe, 6532 could be relied on to file... for filing the claim, you didn't have to rely on 6511, and that 6532 didn't mention the word ""taxpayer""."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2665.917,2679.176,6532 is the statute that provides that the administrative claim filed with the Internal Revenue Service must be allowed to be considered for 6 months or--
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2679.176,2681.817,"Yes, but it refers to the claim by the taxpayer."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2681.817,2684.498,"--I believe that's 6511, Your Honor."
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2684.498,2684.839,No.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2710.375,2712.228,"Well, I'm not relying on that section for jurisdiction."
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2712.228,2712.559,Okay--
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2712.559,2714.399,I'm using it as the statute of limitations as well.
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2714.399,2714.95,"--Well, okay."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2728.948,2730.069,"Well, the--"
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.069,2731.41,Tell me what section.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2731.41,2731.83,--Sure.
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.83,2733.5,Can you give me a number?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2733.5,2758.807,"Well, for example, the definitional section, 7701(a), as part of the preamble, specifically states, number 1, the definition of taxpayer shall only be used in this title, which means it doesn't apply in the jurisdictional sections, title 28, and it also states that the definitions in 7701 shall not be manifestly incompatible with the intent of the statutes."
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2758.807,2767.002,"Well, so you say perhaps the word taxpayer should have a different definition than the person who paid the tax?"
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2767.002,2770.616,"Well, when the word is used in a statute of limitations--"
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.616,2776.219,"But that would seem... I mean, that doesn't seem terribly difficult to define taxpayer as the person who paid the tax."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2776.219,2781.352,"--That's the generic sense that the word is used, unless it's defined differently--"
1994.94-395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2781.352,2781.852,That's your client.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2781.852,2782.143,--as a term of art.
1994.94-395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2782.143,2782.543,That's your client.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2782.543,2783.405,That's right.
1994.94-395,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.405,2783.765,Your client has paid the tax.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2790.358,2793.661,"And we make that point in our brief, that she paid the tax."
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2793.661,2795.344,So your client paid the tax?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2795.344,2797.945,When the word is used in the generic sense--
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.945,2799.755,I asked you a question.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2799.755,2800.205,--Sure.
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.205,2801.838,Did your client pay the tax?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2801.838,2802.146,Absolutely.
1994.94-395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2808.259,2815.105,You do concede that you can't just volunteer to pay somebody else's tax and then go litigate it.
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2815.105,2826.662,"--There's a distinction between volunteering to pay somebody else's tax, and being in a position where you're coerced or persuaded to pay another person's tax."
1994.94-395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2879.668,2881.54,"So you're not limiting your argument, then--"
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2881.54,2881.881,--No.
1994.94-395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2881.881,2883.02,--to the coercion case?
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2883.02,2883.61,"No, I'm not."
1994.94-395,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2883.61,2906.034,"So you disagree, as Mr. Kent did, with that manual that says you can pay someone else's tax in a situation of duress and then sue for a refund, but absent duress, if you're just a mere volunteer, you have no claim?"
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2906.034,2921.925,"The facts in this case obviously were the duress situation, and we absolutely say that there's no possibility for the Government's fears to come forward in that particular situation, but in the volunteer sense, and this Court doesn't necessarily have to go that far, but as a matter of tax policy, why not?"
1994.94-395,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2927.689,2930.831,"Well, it seems to me we do have to go that far, under your interpretation of the statute."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,2955.068,2966.304,"--I would assume so, under the facts of that hypothetical, that if the work was never performed, it would be a defense to a mechanic's lien, although I'm not an expert in mechanic's lien law, so I might be misspeaking."
1994.94-395,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3033.037,3036.4,"That's fanciful, but they're worried, I think, about another thing."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,3064.539,3085.971,"My response is on line with the courts that have ruled on this, and I cited a few in my brief, which were not authority to this Court, but I cited them just so that you could see how other judges have gone through the same analysis, which is that the word 6511 is used in its generic sense, that it's used as the person who pays the taxes."
1994.94-395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3095.408,3101.122,"Don't we also assume that Congress wants some sort of a statute of limitations, and there is none on that reading."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,3105.606,3116.763,"I agree, in essence with what the justice was just asking me, which is that it's construed in its generic sense in 6511, which makes 6511 the statute of limitations--"
1994.94-395,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3116.763,3118.613,"I'm sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying."
1994.94-395,1,38247,philip_garrett_panitz,,3119.053,3123.558,"--If there are no further questions, Your Honor, I thank you for your time."
1994.94-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3123.558,3124.657,"Very well, Mr. Panitz."
