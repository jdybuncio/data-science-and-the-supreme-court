1974.74-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.948,"We'll hear arguments next in 74-121, Phelps against the United States."
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,1591.597,1594.981,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1884.965,1888.828,Let the property away from --
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,1888.828,1890.139,That's right.
1974.74-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1890.139,1893.103,And it's not subject to summary proceedings.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,1893.103,1906.966,"It's -- in a summary proceeding, the property would be turned over without regard to the validity of the adverse claimants claim and then he would have to rely upon his rights as a creditor in the bankruptcy proceeding."
1974.74-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1906.966,1911.87,"Well he filed a petition for reclamation, can he?"
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,1911.87,1941.867,"I suppose so and by his co-counsel that he could but in a plenary proceeding, the question turns exclusively upon the rights of the adverse claimant if he have rights in the property the it belongs to him and is in subject to administration of bankruptcy at all so that the distinction between a summary proceeding and a plenary proceeding is not merely a matter of the elaborateness of the procedures but it affects the substantive rights as well."
1974.74-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1941.867,1947.466,"We didn't quite get that last Mr. Jones, why do you say it affects the substantive rights as well?"
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,1947.466,1964.713,"Well in this case for example in a plenary proceeding, the only issue before the Court would be whether the Government's levy was valid and whether the tax payer owed a tax, if so then the moneys would be paid over to the Government in full."
1974.74-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1988.685,1993.799,That's the consequence of what's going into the jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court for any kind of problem.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,1993.799,1998.134,That's right.
1974.74-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.579,2233.124,Well how about the provision of subsection 8 that Section 70 (a) of the Act so that equates the possession of the assignor to the possession of the bankrupt.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2235.543,2258.165,"That's true, that's why I used that hypothetical because I wanted the Court's attention first to be focused upon the general case of the Government's levy and I intended at a later point to address the special considerations that arise when the person upon him, the levy has been served is a general assignee and I hope to get to that point in a moment.Well,"
1974.74-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2617.509,2621.066,That wasn't modified by the Chandler amendments.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2621.066,2680.788,"Section 2 (a) 21 was enacted after the decision in Galbraith Valley but it was generally considered as being merely a codification of prior law and collier and his treaties as we indicated in our brief so treats that enactment and I don't think that anyone has construed as being a general requirement that the assignee turnover the property in his possession willingly without regard to any adverse claims then I believe that after the passage of the Chandler Act, lower courts, not this Court but lower courts have had the opportunity to apply Galbraith against Valley to a situation such as the one involved here and they have done so to bar the summary turnover of property held by the assignee for his own self or as custodian or agent for a third person from summary turnover to the receiver in bankruptcy."
1974.74-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.788,2684.721,Was the levy made before bankruptcy?
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2684.721,2685.609,That's correct.
1974.74-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.609,2691.262,And the levy wasn't -- and the -- but -- the levy was made after assignment?
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2691.262,2692.903,That's also correct.
1974.74-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2692.903,2707.867,And so the assignee for the benefit of creditors who acquired -- who took possession to property before bankruptcy and sold it then was subjected to a levy.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2707.867,2709.125,"That's right, that's right."
1974.74-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.125,2726.28,And then came bankruptcy and any right to the Bankruptcy Act that the assignee may have had any rights to trustee or the state against the assignee only arose with the filing of the bankrupt.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2726.28,2729.952,Well any rights that they had in bankruptcy arose at that time.
1974.74-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.06,2736.677,And you are asserting any rights to the United States arose before bankruptcy.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2736.677,2741.761,"Well, let me distinguish between various kinds of rights."
1974.74-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.066,2747.713,But your levy arose before bankruptcy.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2747.713,2751.426,The levy was served upon the assignee before bankruptcy.
1974.74-121,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2793.974,2796.333,May I interrupt at that point?
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2805.106,2806.866,"There was an assessment of taxes to, that's correct."
1974.74-121,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2806.866,2809.591,"Right, but did that create a lien?"
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2809.591,2811.447,It did.
1974.74-121,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2811.447,2815.968,"Not a lien which gave any notice to other creditors though, did it?"
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2815.968,2825.825,No and that lien until perfected would not have been valid as against for example a bona fide purchaser.
1974.74-121,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2833.088,2835.843,And that was filed with the assignee?
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2835.843,2840.597,No that was then -- the notice of levy was served upon the assignee.
1974.74-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2850.747,2855.418,And the notice of levy was filed if I understand it after he had sold the channels for the benefit of creditors.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2855.418,2859.364,"After he'd reduced the property to proceeds, to cash, that's correct."
1974.74-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2859.364,2866.071,"For the benefit of creditors who under 4741 the beneficiaries of the trust, is that right?"
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2866.071,2867.921,"That's right, that's right."
1974.74-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2870.406,2875.586,Yes but also the federal law talks about property rights to property of the tax payer.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2875.586,2878.814,"Oh, yes, you're talking about Section 63 31."
1974.74-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2878.814,2880.904,Which is the whole basis of this lawsuit.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2880.904,2906.407,Yes it is but one aspect to that provision that the petitioner has consistently overlooked in this case is the fact that the Government's levy does not reach only property of the tax payer seemed to be searching in vain for the statutory language.
1974.74-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2976.197,2977.335,That's really the question.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2977.335,2981.401,Well that's one of the three questions and I regard that as a subsidiary question.
1974.74-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2981.401,2983.401,It's not the big question that you hope to.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2983.401,2984.269,That's correct.
1974.74-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2984.269,2990.676,That you did not oppose certiorari to be because you hope the court would decide that that is more particularized question in this case.
1974.74-121,1,33759,keith_ajones,,2990.676,2994.702,That is an important question and -- that's true.
1974.74-121,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3187.815,3189.432,Do you have something further Mr. Quaid?
