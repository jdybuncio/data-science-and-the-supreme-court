1963.35,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3934.659,3942.839,"I -- it -- maybe that you should pass a law which says, I'm not sure, that people should not cancel their reservations but you don't --"
1963.35,3,22412,edward_hill,,3942.839,3943.018,No.

1963.35,3,22412,edward_hill,,3944.221,3945.783,"No, I do not."
1963.35,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3956.727,3965.682,That's -- if officer thinks somebody else may get disturbed by it and might get belligerent then you can arrest the people who do it.
1963.35,3,22412,edward_hill,,3971.65,3980.213,"If they're exercising -- I don't believe I can quite answer that to your satisfaction, sir."
1963.35,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3980.213,3999.571,But we had a case somewhat like that in Connecticut where one of the Jehovah's Witnesses was using -- for the strong language against the religion and the argument was that people with that faith were allowed to come up and have a fight with them.
1963.35,3,22412,edward_hill,,4027.851,4033.259,"Well, we -- we can't manufacture here facts (Inaudible)."
1963.35,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4077.542,4083.092,Would you asked us to overrule Edwards or do you say that that dissent overrules Edwards?
1963.35,3,22412,edward_hill,,4083.092,4084.848,I don't say they it overrules Edwards.
1963.35,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4091.182,4096.157,But what you do with -- what do you do with Edwards?
1963.35,3,22412,edward_hill,,4096.157,4096.286,I think --
1963.35,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4096.286,4096.544,(Voice Overlap) --
1963.35,3,22412,edward_hill,,4096.544,4110.551,-- Edwards is distinguishable in that these people are in South Carolina did not have an opportunity to fully and completely express themselves and they would deny that there.
1963.35,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4110.551,4116.929,You appeal that the -- the opinion did not reach the merits of the case but the dissent did?
1963.35,3,22412,edward_hill,,4116.929,4118.653,"No, sir, I didn't -- I didn't say that."
1963.35,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4272.676,4275.708,Is it your idea that it was unlawful before --
1963.35,3,22412,edward_hill,,4275.708,4276.045,Sir?
1963.35,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4276.045,4286.249,-- that the -- is it your idea that it was unlawful before the policemen ordered them to disperse or after which or both?
1963.35,3,22412,edward_hill,,4286.249,4290.027,"I will have to say both and then I probably going to say for granted, sir."
1963.35,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4290.027,4292.609,I think that's right.
1963.35,4,40281,roy_t_rhodes,,4413.607,4415.318,Mr. Chief Justice and gentlemen.
1963.35,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4701.377,4705.182,Why was it disturbing here if it didn't disturb -- if they were --

1963.35,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4705.864,4708.511,Why was it disturbing here if they were peaceable and --
1963.35,4,40281,roy_t_rhodes,,4708.511,4709.166,Why was it disturbing --

1963.35,4,40281,roy_t_rhodes,,4713.288,4718.972,"Well, there are a number of reasons as to why it was disturbing the community."
1963.35,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4738.187,4741.159,You are afraid to disturb people to anger --
1963.35,4,40281,roy_t_rhodes,,4741.159,4741.216,Sir?
1963.35,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4741.216,4746.059,"-- or create unrests among the people, is that it?"
1963.35,4,40281,roy_t_rhodes,,4746.059,4747.81,"Was it tending to do that, sir?"
1963.35,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4748.022,4749.605,You're afraid that what it would do.
1963.35,4,40281,roy_t_rhodes,,4749.605,4752.789,"That was the opinion expressed by the officers that made the arrest, yes."
1963.35,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4752.789,4760.975,That's -- that's your own -- that your basis for your statute on that that Edwards says that you can't do that.

1963.35,4,40281,roy_t_rhodes,,4788.854,4791.713,-- 24 hours and I think there's a substantial difference.
1963.35,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4808.171,4813.584,It would be pointed out that the statute brought the name that preventing congestion of the streets.
