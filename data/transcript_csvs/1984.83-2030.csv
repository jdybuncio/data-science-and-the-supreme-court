1984.83-2030,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.241,We will hear arguments next in Board of Education of Oklahoma City against the National Gay Task Force.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,29.785,33.654,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,59.122,59.805,Mr. Arrow--
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,59.805,60.239,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,60.239,65.192,--I wonder if it doesn't involve some judicial interest in seeing that there is a case or controversy.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,73.196,73.964,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,73.964,77.166,And is I read it there was no threat that it was going to apply it to anyone.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,77.166,78.116,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,78.116,81.302,And the only party plaintiff was a national organization.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,81.302,82.737,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,102.466,106.452,Is this a case where we ought to have the views of the Supreme Court of the state?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,106.452,108.002,"Your Honor, we feel that it is."
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,126.747,128.949,Does Oklahoma have a certification statute?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,128.949,129.833,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,133.337,134.637,Have you put a copy of it in there?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,134.637,135.67,Of the certification statute?
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,135.67,136.005,Yes.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,136.005,136.739,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,153.75,154.2,Thank you.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,154.2,156.166,You are welcome.
1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,156.166,158.535,"Well, have you urged it before?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,158.535,161.754,We have urged the lack of standing before.
1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,162.356,164.222,How about abstention?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,164.222,165.808,--We have not urged abstention.
1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,165.808,167.158,In either court of law?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,167.158,169.51,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,174.497,177.116,I suppose certification is not the same thing as abstention.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,177.116,178.166,"That's right, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.391,212.705,"Well, of course, if there is no real case or controversy, if this is just an abstraction, and there is no real threat to the third party people, the plaintiff, it is not a question for abstention, it is not a question for certification, it is a question for dismissal by the District Court on jurisdictional basis."
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,212.705,217.824,"We have so urged that in Proposition 1... I believe it is 1B, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,257.651,258.618,May I ask just one question?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,258.618,259.101,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,259.101,263.055,You say the case will present a test as to what public school teachers may or may not advocate.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,263.055,263.605,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,263.605,274.612,"As you read the statute, does it prohibit activity by a teacher which is advocacy of, just to use the language of the statute, advocacy of homosexual activity?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,274.612,286.151,"Homosexual activity is, of course, defined in very specific terms in the statute, Your Honor, as the commission of an act defined in Section 886 of Title 21, which has been defined as the offense of criminal sodomy."
1984.83-2030,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,306.399,312.468,Could Oklahoma prohibit a school teacher from smoking in the classroom?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,312.468,314.554,We certainly think that it could.
1984.83-2030,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,316.356,318.456,On what grounds?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,318.456,322.86,"--On the grounds that it might impair student health, for example."
1984.83-2030,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,325.312,329.747,Any other ground besides health?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,329.747,331.199,"--Possibly, possibly--"
1984.83-2030,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,331.199,332.949,How about the role model factor?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,332.949,334.151,--Yes.
1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,351.279,353.995,"Well, the only issue here is conduct, isn't it?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,356.464,361.051,"Well, here we are talking about advocacy of the specific crime."
1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,361.051,363.503,"I know, but the statute defines activity and conduct differently."
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,363.503,364.187,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,364.187,367.139,"And what is at issue here, activity or conduct?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,367.139,369.324,What is at issue here is public homosexual conduct.
1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,369.324,369.957,That's what I thought.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,369.957,370.641,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.641,371.241,All right.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,372.859,373.359,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.759,380.38,"I am still a little puzzled, because the term ""conduct"" as used in the statute includes advocacy, does it not?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,380.38,380.882,"Yes, it does."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.882,381.215,Yes.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,382.665,383.751,"Absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,383.751,397.058,And does this statute... would this statute make it dischargeable conduct for a public school teacher to make a speech in which he advocated as a general proposition that private homosexual activity which is prohibited by law--
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,397.058,397.624,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,397.624,399.426,--is nevertheless a good idea?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,401.712,406.914,For him to advocate the commission of the crime would be precluded by the statute.
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,409.382,410.918,"No, to advocate the commission of the crime."
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,410.918,416.555,"--Advocating the commission of the crime is precluded by the... or at least it is regulated, to be quite specific, depending upon the nexus."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,416.555,421.107,"In your view of the statute, is such a speech prohibited by the statute?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,421.107,422.542,It is regulated by the statute.
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,424.059,426.094,Is it a cause for discharge if a person gives such a statement?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,426.094,433.497,"--On a case by case basis, Your Honor, it might be, depending upon the presence or absence of the nexus factors, depending upon the nexus ramifications."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,434.433,435.283,I don't understand that.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,435.283,435.833,--Okay.
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,467.571,471.372,"He gave the speech... he said, I intend to give this speech over and over again."
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,471.372,471.856,--Yes.
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,471.856,472.891,Then I suppose it would be prohibited?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,472.891,475.426,"Well, depending again upon the adverse effect upon students."
1984.83-2030,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,532.013,545.155,Do we know whether the Oklahoma courts would require finding an adverse effect on students or employees under the statute in order to impose sanctions?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,545.155,545.821,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,545.821,546.557,Do we know that?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,546.557,547.407,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,547.407,548.557,How do we know that?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,548.557,552.51,"We have the Childers case, which I believe is cited in the brief."
1984.83-2030,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.616,567.318,The adverse effect on students or employees is a requirement in each case?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,567.318,569.786,"Yes, Your Honor, and that was concluded by the District Court."
1984.83-2030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,753.222,766.965,"Was your answer to the earlier question about whether the statute would be invoked if a teacher simply advocated the repeal of the consensual sodomy statute, would it be invoked then?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,766.965,767.965,"No, Your Honor, it would not."
1984.83-2030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.866,798.77,So the only kind of speech implicated is where a teacher were to advocate the commission of a crime?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,798.77,799.97,The commission of the specified crime.
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,801.972,818.565,"Suppose a teacher sat down at lunch with a number of other teachers and said, I wish they'd leave these homosexuals alone, they are not hurting anyone except themselves, and that was heard by everybody in the room, students and everybody else."
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,818.565,819.082,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,819.082,820.567,Would that violate the statute?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,820.567,830.705,"It would not violate the statute, because to say, I wish they'd leave these people alone, I suppose, could be assumed as a sub silentio suggestion that in fact the statute should be repealed."
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,835.459,838.895,That wouldn't be encouraging homosexual activity?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,838.895,839.311,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,842.013,845.049,How do we know your state court would think that?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,845.049,856.255,"--Well, for example, there was a Tennessee case called Jackson versus... I would submit the authority to the Court, Your Honor, but there is a Tennessee case in which an advocating--"
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,856.255,857.373,This isn't Tennessee.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,858.457,864.176,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but we certainly think that the Oklahoma court might be persuaded by the Tennessee court's reasoning."
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,870.497,873.366,"The claim here is that this statute is overbroad, isn't it?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,873.366,874.318,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,876.701,881.138,"And if my hypothetical is one that would be reached by it, it would be overbroad, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,881.138,882.322,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,899.934,903.635,May I ask one other question?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,903.635,904.637,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.637,908.222,"The term ""public homosexual activity"" is defined as the crime."
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,908.222,908.672,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,908.672,911.491,"Is the term ""private homosexual activity"" defined?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,914.109,914.926,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.645,917.045,It is not defined?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,917.045,917.828,It is not defined.
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.828,926.184,"Well, what about a speech then advocating private homosexual activity and said, but be careful not to violate the prohibition against public homosexual activity?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,926.184,926.601,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.857,936.825,Right.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,936.825,946.497,So we would certainly concede that the advocacy of private criminal sodomy would also come within the statutory sweep.
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.497,949.966,"Well, is all private homosexual activity a crime?"
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,949.966,957.305,"Yes, Your Honor, it is in the State of... criminal homosexual... homosexual sodomy, public or private, is illegal in the State of Oklahoma."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.305,958.772,"Well, I'm not sure that answered my question."
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,958.772,959.422,Okay.
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.422,963.126,Is all private homosexual activity--
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,963.126,965.126,As defined in this statute?
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.126,967.161,"--Well, the term isn't defined in this statute."
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,967.161,967.928,Well--
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.928,969.196,Private homosexual activity.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,969.196,969.913,"--Oh, I see, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.496,975.7,Is all private homosexual activity forbidden by law in Oklahoma?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,975.7,984.872,"If we take activity in the sense of meaning what it is in Section A1, then yes--"
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.872,986.705,"No, no, because that refers to public."
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,988.407,993.811,"--Well, if we assume that the definition of the activity, Your Honor... that is what I am focusing on, is the definition of activity."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.811,995.161,There is no definition of activity.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,998.363,999.129,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1019.776,1022.228,"Then the word ""private"" is really redundant in the statute, isn't it?"

1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.428,1027.632,Your suggest that they could just read those words out of the statute?
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1027.632,1028.498,Which words are we--
1984.83-2030,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1028.498,1032.95,And that the statute does not in fact prohibit... the words A2.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1036.738,1039.523,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1342.72,1345.938,The Napoleonic Code is actually very short.
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1345.938,1346.44,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1984.83-2030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1346.44,1348.656,"I say, the Napoleonic Code is actually very short."
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1350.908,1352.844,That is true Your Honor.
1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.038,1656.204,Did you cite Childers in your brief?

1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.81,1665.576,That's what I thought.

1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.791,1760.77,"Well, in order to violate this statute or to be a reason for his discharge, there has to be a finding that even though he... that the conduct, the public homosexual conduct that is charged has rendered him unfit."
1984.83-2030,0,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1760.77,1761.537,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1767.943,1778.049,And does the conclusion that he is unfit have to come within one of the reasons in that general statute about fitness?

1984.83-2030,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1809.12,1830.433,Mr. Tribe.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1830.433,1851.097,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, writing for the California Supreme Court nearly a decade ago, the late Justice Tobriner recognized that the modern struggle for homosexual rights in this country is truly a struggle for civil rights, and he said, like other such struggles, it incites heated political debate."
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1874.545,1883.484,"Do you suppose Justice Tobriner would embrace in that general statement the laws on drugs, murder?"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1883.484,1893.507,"I think he would have said that the right advocate change in those laws, to express therefore misgivings about the views they take, is a fundamental protected right."
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1893.507,1896.209,A right to decriminalize them?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1896.209,1897.911,The right to decriminalize anything.
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.385,1916.622,"Now, bringing it away from his general statement down to the framework of this case--"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1916.622,1917.722,Yes.
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.722,1929.697,"--suppose the prohibition was against advocating drug use, private or public, murder."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1929.697,1947.141,"Well, I suppose if a teacher were foolish enough to say, you know, I think these murder laws are silly, I think, to use Justice Brennan's example, murder is really a pretty good idea, that teacher would probably be civilly committable, but I doubt that that teacher would be violating... that teacher would be going across the Brandenburg line."
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1952.978,1957.532,"What if the advocacy is of theft, rape?"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1959.266,1974.828,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, however long the list, the principle for which this case, I think, ought to stand is that if one is simply expressing misgivings about the law, whether sub silentio or expressly, one should not be punished."
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.844,2065.402,"--Mr. Tribe, I think the abstraction in this case is that, if you agree, the statute has never been applied to anyone, no one is being threatened with its application, it has never been construed by the state courts."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2067.903,2070.122,"It is threatening every day, which is why--"
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.122,2078.911,Has the Oklahoma City School Board in this record threatened to apply the statute to any particular individual?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2078.911,2086.751,"--No particular individual has asked, but because the chilling effect is so thorough... there is no question in this record."
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.213,2114.834,"Well, but there is no allegation as I read it that this particular regulation of the Oklahoma City School Board has ever been applied to a single living soul."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2114.834,2115.551,Because they are all--
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.551,2116.77,I am not interested in why.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2116.77,2117.82,"--You are right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.661,2133.446,"Well, it is also on all fours with Poe against Ullman, it seems to me."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2133.446,2138.767,"--But in Poe v. Ullman, it seems to me, Mr. Justice, the issue of ripeness was a serious one."
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2152.257,2158.661,"Yes, but there was no allegation in the complaint that this statute was ever... had ever been applied."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2158.661,2161.696,Because the allegation is that they were afraid to test it.
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2162.215,2166.184,"Well, but how far can you back up from a statute and still challenge it?"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2166.184,2176.19,"--Well, if you have to nudge yourself right up against it and risk your job to challenge it, then this Court, I think, clearly has to overrule Baggett v. Bullitt and Paishe."
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2176.19,2182.694,"Well, in Baggett against Bullitt, the principal had circulated a memorandum saying that those teachers were going to have to take the oath."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2186.164,2193.617,"Well, they could have taken the oath, but then you see their argument was, the argument of the other side was, it is perfectly harmless to take the oath."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2233.894,2236.513,"The defendant was the board, wasn't it?"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2236.513,2239.548,The defendant was the board of education of the City of Oklahoma.
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.548,2244.25,And is it true that it has a statutory obligation to enforce it?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2244.25,2246.702,"It has a full statutory obligation, Justice White, to enforce it."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.702,2248.488,It had no discretion but to enforce it?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2248.488,2249.488,There appears to have been none.
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.94,2257.992,I suppose... and the complaint did allege that.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2257.992,2258.527,That's right.
1984.83-2030,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2335.677,2344.116,"Mr. Tribe, do you agree with the narrow interpretation of this statute described by your opponent today?"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2344.116,2347.918,"Well, I certainly don't agree with any narrow interpretation I have heard before."
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2410.475,2416.629,"Mr. Tribe, isn't that the reason you should give the state an opportunity to limit its own laws?"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2416.629,2425.985,"Well, Justice Marshall, I would love to have the state do that if it could be done in a single plausible construction, but this Court has--"
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.985,2428.704,"Well, couldn't you file a lawsuit against them in the state court?"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2428.704,2437.809,"--Well, in fact this Court itself could certify the case to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, and that would surely be better than making us start from the beginning, but let me ask this Court to think about--"
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2437.809,2438.411,Why?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2438.411,2439.361,--Why would that be better?
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2439.361,2440.144,Why would that be better?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2440.144,2453.618,"Well, because this Court has held about eight times that the high cost of keeping the chilling effect of this kind of law in place while someone is dragged through another judicial system is not worth paying."
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2453.618,2457.487,Do you mean you filed this case for the purpose of getting us to send it back?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2457.487,2461.223,"No, no, we filed this case for the purpose of being able to speak freely."
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.223,2463.19,You say now it is all right to send it back.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2463.19,2466.442,"No, I say it would be better to send it back than make us go through from the word go."
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.715,2480.185,You are asking a state supreme court to interpret its own state statute.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2480.185,2480.669,--Right.
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2480.669,2482.237,That is all you are asking.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2482.237,2485.773,"But if the question is that open-ended, I would hate to serve on that state supreme court."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.773,2488.125,"Well, after we hear your argument we will know what to ask them."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2488.125,2504.984,"Well, I think after you hear the argument you might know, if you agree with me, that there is no finite list of questions that would help, because the very questions already asked from this bench, I think what we got was an example of the Draconian chilling confusion caused by this law."
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2578.765,2581.967,You are starting there with a conclusion that this is protected discussion.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2585.602,2598.262,"--Of course, even the board of education concedes that if it comes anywhere close to advocating repeal, it ought to be protected, but remember, when they were asked to narrow the law's enforcement to that extent, in February of 1981, they refused."
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2672.977,2689.605,"Do you think a legislature is entitled to take into account the reality, if you concede that it is a reality, that teachers in schools, particularly grade school and high school level, are role models for the pupils?"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2689.605,2711.019,"I think that, Mr. Chief Justice, that certainly can be taken into account, but when President Reagan editorialized against this very law in California, about six years ago, his answer to the role model point was, first of all, as a matter of common sense, there is no reason to believe that homosexuality is something like a contagious disease."
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2764.17,2767.272,Abood wasn't a classroom teaching case.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2771.141,2787.952,"--That's right, Justice Rehnquist, but one of the conclusions in Abood, I think, would simply that if the teacher's union to which teachers had to contribute began engaging in lobbying, saying we should tighten up the laws against gay activity, then a teacher would be free to withhold her dues."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2822.942,2831.631,"Well, you do challenge, I take it, a rule that said that you may not discuss homosexuality in class?"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2831.631,2835.5,"Well, of course, that would be subsumed in this case, but this case goes way beyond class."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.5,2838.535,"Well, I know, but so you would say there are some limits to what you--"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2838.535,2841.32,"Sure there are, Justice White, and I would... let me give you an example."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2841.82,2851.795,--I would suppose you would say that the teacher in the class could not be fired for in class urging that the laws against homosexuality be repealed.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2851.795,2852.728,"--Well, in a math class--"
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2852.728,2853.644,Is that right or not?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2853.644,2854.829,--that would conflict with the curriculum rules.
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.829,2856.696,"Well, I know, but any time, any time."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2856.696,2862.567,"I think, Justice White, I would probably urge that, but we don't have to prevail on that view for this law to be struck down."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.567,2865.852,"I know you don't because you are arguing overbreadth, that it covers non-classroom activity."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2865.852,2876.993,"That's right, but even in class, Justice White, suppose during a recess a child runs in and says, what should I do, I just saw these kids ganging up on Johnny, they claim Johnny is gay."
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2898.34,2901.525,"When you say ganging up, I take it you mean chiding."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2901.525,2903.31,Chiding or perhaps beating up on.
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2915.035,2918.004,That is not in this record.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2918.004,2920.189,"Well, the chilling effect, Justice Marshall, is in the record."
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2920.189,2922.206,I am talking about the beating up business.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2922.206,2922.558,That is right.
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2922.574,2923.524,That is not in this record.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2923.524,2928.026,--The Court may just have to take notice of some realities.
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2928.026,2929.478,Let's stick to the record.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2929.478,2931.83,Nor is it necessary to our case that we talk about that.
1984.83-2030,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2934.214,2936.798,It is necessary to stick to the record.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2936.798,2938.65,"I will do that, Justice Marshall."
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3062.898,3067.618,Do you think counsel could amend the statute in the District Court?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3067.618,3071.654,"Well, the problem is, I suppose, counsel couldn't even promise not to enforce it."
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3072.57,3074.722,"Well, let's stay with the amending."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3083.045,3084.914,--I certainly don't mean to be doing that.
1984.83-2030,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3215.465,3218.5,"Mr. Tribe, I notice you haven't cited In Re Sawyer."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3221.052,3222.518,Which aspect of the holding?
1984.83-2030,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3222.518,3225.504,That was where the lawyer criticized the Smith Act.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3225.504,3234.693,"It would seem to me that if lawyers can't be punished for criticizing the Smith Act, as you point out, Justice Brennan, then teachers can't be punished for criticizing the anti-sodomy act."
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3234.693,3239.93,"You think those two things are quite parallel, apparently."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3239.93,3243.882,The anti-sodomy act and overthrowing the government?
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3328.638,3335.042,What are the immediate consequences of trying to overthrow the government by use of actual force and violence?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3341.463,3342.314,You mean other speech?
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3342.314,3344.447,"Yes, you get shot."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3344.447,3353.955,"If you incite it, you would get shot, surely, and if you incite homosexual activity, then you are committing a crime in Oklahoma, and you go to jail, and from jail you can't teach."
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3353.955,3357.674,"No, you are changing this quite markedly."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3372.9,3388.51,"I suppose that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I suppose if you go out and begin committing homosexual sodomy, that is, anything close to the act itself is a crime in Oklahoma, and if you impose it or solicit it, that is, the kind of activity that is ancillary to it, you can be fired as a teacher."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3436.859,3448.465,"Mr. Tribe, what... public homosexual conduct is what is involved here, but it at least include either advocating, soliciting, imposing, encouraging, or promoting."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3448.465,3449.834,That is right.
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3450.6,3467.462,"I take it... you have said time and time again that if you just got up and urged that the law be repealed, the law against homosexuality be repealed, you would be advocating, soliciting, imposing, encouraging, or promoting?"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3467.462,3468.846,--Encouraging or promoting.
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3471.848,3478.001,"Well, as to the Wrightman case, this is the first time I have heard that case cited for anything."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3484.007,3486.473,--It is the one proposition to which it may really be relevant.
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.473,3487.389,"Well, it may not be."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3497.729,3501.649,"The three words together, advocating, encouraging, or promoting."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3501.649,3505.435,Advocating that the law be repealed would be encouraging?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3505.435,3510.254,"No, advocating that the law be repealed might encourage or promote the underlying activity."
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3515.992,3521.377,"But the activity wouldn't be encouraged until repeal actually took place, would it?"
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3521.377,3523.829,I suppose the activity is indirectly encouraged.
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3552.331,3562.037,"If the Task Force offered to stipulate to a construction in the District Court, it seems to me that is all the more reason why the state court should be given an opportunity to construe it."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3562.037,3566.258,"If the state court in a single decision could construe it, that would be fine."
1984.83-2030,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3566.258,3570.393,Couldn't they construe it according to the stipulation that your client offered to enter into?
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3570.393,3592.04,"That it construe it to... if this Court were to ask the state court, does this law henceforth apply only to directly and deliberately urging the commission of the specific crime with the intent that the crime be committed, and if their answer to that question is, yes, we will effectively rewrite the law so that it all it covers, that would satisfy the purpose."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3592.04,3601.598,"Suppose a teacher gets up in a classroom and says, I encourage each of you to engage in homosexual activity, and that is all he says or she says."
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3608.252,3617.108,"I would think even without this law, that teacher could probably have been legally fired, because... well, certainly under this law that teacher could be fired."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3620.643,3629.248,I want to know whether you would say firing a person for saying that would be constitutional.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3629.248,3640.223,"Under this law I think not, but in general the answer is, I think you could fire someone in class for saying, I encourage you to go out and commit a crime, and it wouldn't matter what the crime was."
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3641.223,3649.995,Whatever the teacher says inside the classroom or outside the classroom has got to be at least to encourage homosexuality.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3649.995,3651.229,--That it has to have that effect.
1984.83-2030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3651.229,3652.281,Yes.
1984.83-2030,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3652.281,3653.481,My time is up.
1984.83-2030,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3653.897,3654.297,"Thank you, gentlemen."
