1967.823,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,113.291,117.275,Was it a wiretap because in Berger it was not a wiretap?
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,117.275,127.561,It was a wiretap in this case -- and wiretapped the telephone at the office of the Commission of Sanitation at the dump.
1967.823,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,486.384,487.781,"Yes, excuse me Mr. Boudin"
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,487.781,488.381,"Sure, Your Honor."
1967.823,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,488.381,497.46,"This did not supersede or eliminate the earlier hearing based on their refusal to answer questions, did it?"
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,497.46,502.801,"The earlier hearing, Your Honor is referring to the three or the 12."
1967.823,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,511.772,512.19,I see.
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,512.19,519.794,And it was because they refused to waive their immunity before the grand jury that these three were then dismissed from employment.

1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,942.708,943.887,"No, it does not permit it."
1967.823,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1008.797,1021.747,"Let me see, is this to suggest that there is a hearing and the city in fact determines that this justification and in particular circumstances there ought not to be a dismissal?"
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1025.838,1026.636,Yes.

1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1065.921,1066.706,No.
1967.823,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1093.329,1095.593,"Oh, was there in fact a hearing in that case?"
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1095.593,1097.045,There was hearing in Gardner?
1967.823,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1098.548,1109.351,You don't think that the action of the Court of Appeals maybe read as in the fact that they should be using your words that the statute has a built-in provision for --
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1109.351,1111.1,I do not think so Your Honor.
1967.823,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1120.665,1121.524,There was a hearing.
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1123.12,1128.723,There was a hearing in this case in which the only issue was that as the Court of Appeals point out was the privilege taken.
1967.823,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1132.124,1132.544,That's right.
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1132.544,1135.043,The transcript of the hearing before the Commissioner of Investigation.
1967.823,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1135.043,1135.426,Mr. Boudin.
1967.823,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.426,1148.433,And your client in that hearing further established for example that he didn't understand the Fifth Amendment or the reason he refused to testify was some other reason that the --
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1148.433,1156.496,The only case in which a hearing could have had any relevance would either show that he didn't take the privilege or that he didn't have counsel (Voice Overlap) --
1967.823,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1156.496,1158.257,Or that his refusal was not based on the Charter.
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1158.257,1161.684,"Exactly, but that of course would not mitigate -- yes."
1967.823,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1161.684,1171.983,"Do I read the statue correctly in this herein, the 12 have just said we won't answer the question, any questions period."
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1174.423,1175.348,That is correct.
1967.823,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1176.313,1184.529,If they would have to have a hearing as to whether they will fit to remain as sanitation workers.
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1191.779,1193.323,That is correct Your Honor.
1967.823,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1210.054,1212.199,"That there's a hearing in any event, isn't there?"
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1212.199,1214.484,There is a hearing but the hearing has no meaning.
1967.823,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1288.139,1292.487,"Well, I should think if he did said that that it would have been pretty clear that he wasn't actually relying on the privilege (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1292.487,1294.088,"Yes, of course in that particular incident."
1967.823,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1295.416,1299.873,"So when he said that, that would have been -- then he wouldn't have come within the Charter provision."
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1299.873,1301.406,"That's right, he would have avoided it."
1967.823,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1322.132,1325.323,"Or to establish the facts that bring him within this Charter provision, is that it?"
1967.823,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1325.323,1325.975,Exactly.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1676.317,1680.175,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.823,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1753.749,1761.499,"That -- you said the allegation there had this -- it originated with the citizen complaint, is that where -- is that shown in the record?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1761.499,1780.292,"The difficulty here, Your Honor, is that the -- the hearings you see before the Commissioner of Sanitation are not part of this -- are not part of this record and it is not -- that point is relevant of course in terms of the -- in terms of the question of the wiretapping."
1967.823,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1780.292,1781.11,Yes.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1781.11,1792.741,"But the -- I didn't mean to imply that the citizen complaint was or was not the source of the wiretap, that would be going beyond the record but the fact is that someone complained to the city."
1967.823,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1792.741,1797.814,And is -- is that bare fact shown in the record somewhere?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1797.814,1800.248,In Mr. Freidman's affidavit it is shown.
1967.823,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.248,1802.305,Who got the wiretap?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1802.305,1804.312,The Commissioner of Investigation.
1967.823,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1804.312,1807.756,"Well, he would have the affidavit, wouldn't he?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1807.756,1813.247,"It would be (Voice Overlap) -- it is not in the record but he would have it, yes."
1967.823,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.914,1838.248,On what ground?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1838.248,1841.028,On grounds of self-incrimination.
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1850.053,1862.76,"Is it the fact Mr. Redlich that under the Charter provisions, once they had refused to answer on ground for self-incrimination, there was no alternative for the commissioner of what to suspend?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1862.76,1878.268,"The -- as we have interpreted that 1123 in light of Slochower, and as we believe that interpretation has been sustained by the Court of Appeals in Gardner, we do not dismiss automatically."
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1904.957,1906.716,I'm getting a little confused.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1915.232,1915.841,That's right.
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1915.841,1921.02,"Now, is that -- was that the end of the hearing, as to the 12?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1921.02,1925.625,"As to the 12, that was the end of the proceeding before the Commissioner of Investigation."
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1925.625,1926.98,"Now, there was still another proceeding, wasn't there?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1926.98,1928.305,There was still another proceeding.
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1928.305,1929.92,And this is for the 12?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1929.92,1930.28,That's right.
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1930.28,1931.629,And this was before whom?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1931.629,1933.336,Before the Commissioner of Sanitation.
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1933.336,1937.929,And what was the nature of that proceeding?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1937.929,1945.502,The nature of that proceeding was that they were charged with a violation of 1123.
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1958.359,1973.506,"Now, do I understand that it's your position that either in Gardner or some other case, the New York Court of Appeals has said that it's a requisite before there may be a dismissal?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1973.506,1973.654,The New York Court --
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1973.654,1975.666,That there'll be such proceedings?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,1975.666,1985.544,The New York Court of Appeals has not affirmatively stated that a hearing is required under 1123.
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2017.624,2022.849,Is that position sought necessary by reason of any decision of this Court?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2022.849,2024.567,"Yes, Slochower."
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2052.456,2054.735,But I don't understand that.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2062.36,2074.043,"Now, they were asked if they wish to -- if they wished to respond to the -- the initial questions were asked by the Commissioner of Investigation."
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2081.592,2104.077,"Well, I understand that but this -- your statement mean that you reach Slochower as meaning that if the employees admit that they did assert the privilege and for that reason refused to testify, that they may be dismissed."
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2112.06,2112.223,No.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2112.306,2114.22,Is that your reading?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2114.22,2118.303,May I ask you to restate that because I wanted to respond?
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2118.303,2119.264,They have a hearing?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2119.264,2119.634,Yes.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2119.634,2127.38,"The employees say yes, we claim the privilege and we did not answer the questions because of the privilege."
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2140.995,2142.0,"No, I do not (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2142.0,2144.319,"Now, tell me just how you read Slochower?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2144.319,2156.777,I read Slochower as saying that there must be a hearing and at that hearing it must be evident that the questions that they originally refused to answer.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2189.288,2208.014,When you read Slochower as requiring a hearing which may be limited to the purpose of ascertaining of what the questions were in front of the limits of the questions to her as to which they claimed the Fifth Amendment.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2208.014,2209.203,"Yes, and we as --"
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2209.203,2213.355,"That's not what -- that's now where Justice Clark's opinion says, is it?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2213.355,2224.102,Well Justice Clark's opinion talks about a -- the right of an employer to inquire into the employees fitness for office.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2327.828,2332.274,Your emphasis upon this city counsel for this (Voice Overlap) --
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2332.274,2333.461,Corporation counsel.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2333.461,2333.914,Huh?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2333.914,2334.842,I said corporation counsel.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2334.842,2340.897,This corporation counsel for this city administration bothers me.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2354.332,2355.355,"Yes, Slochower is in 1957."
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2355.355,2359.143,What position did they take?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2365.154,2368.338,Not in -- not in every case.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2408.648,2419.544,Was there any account made to obtain a change in the City Charter that bring it into line with Slochower or for any reason they have to Slochower?

1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2419.976,2423.339,-- decision of the city counsel or the City Charter?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2423.339,2426.157,Not to my knowledge Justice Fortas.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2426.157,2429.669,"That really makes kind of a mess, doesn't it?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2429.669,2430.923,I had to comment on that.
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2497.801,2506.778,(Voice Overlap) he might get it if the city taking this position?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2517.984,2519.645,That's right.
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2519.645,2546.499,"Does the city make a distinction and say, “In so far as the privilege is concerned, when the city's inquiry is into the conduct as an employee of an employee, the privilege does not complete his dismissal if he asserts the privilege and refuses to answer questions directed to his conduct as an employee.”"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2556.614,2559.436,"No, because we do believe we do not go that far."
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2563.918,2571.749,"And you think the privilege, the federal privilege requires that that would be that opportunity, is that it, before he maybe dismissed?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2571.749,2579.081,I wouldn't state that the -- I'm not convinced that the federal privilege requires in light of Garrity (Voice Overlap) --
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2579.081,2582.225,Why then the federal constitutional requires that?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2582.225,2582.957,The hearing?
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2582.957,2583.78,Yes.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2583.78,2598.696,"I think that the -- in light of the -- my answer, in light of Garrity, I don't believe that the federal privilege requires it because I think that any evidence that is adduced here could not be used in any criminal proceeding."
1967.823,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2616.475,2617.638,Which didn't happen here.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2617.638,2618.84,Which did not happen here.
1967.823,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2618.84,2620.482,Nor does that happen in any of these cases.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2620.482,2621.716,No.
1967.823,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.569,2640.393,"But I supposed you also might say that just under your state law, you would require – they'd be required, that the Commissioner of Sanitation would have to give the employee a hearing before he fired him for refusing to talk to the Commissioner of Investigation."
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2640.393,2641.421,That is right.
1967.823,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2641.421,2641.972,"Well, what -- what ground --"
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2641.972,2664.609,"But I suppose you are defending this -- I suppose you are defending this on the ground that it's necessary and proper for the city to get answers to these questions from employers with respect to the faithful discharge in their work in events necessary for administrative reasons, is that right?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2664.609,2666.275,"That is only part of it, Your Honor."
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2666.275,2667.118,So what's the other part?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2667.118,2682.497,"The other part is that if an employee refuses to answer a question narrowly and specifically related to the performance of this work, the city need not to keep that person on the payroll indefinitely so that he can retire with the city pension."
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2683.776,2687.388,"Whatever that is, that's an embellishment of it."
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2694.638,2700.737,The city even needs answers to the questions or if the answer doesn't come we have the right to dismiss.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2700.737,2701.627,Right.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2784.165,2789.174,"Your Honor, the history of this charter provision has been indicated yesterday."
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2808.121,2809.207,On what basis?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2814.223,2830.567,Under -- the provision under which they were -- they were discharged pursuant to a hearing under Section 75 of the Civil Service Law regarding the -- under which the city employee is -- he is entitled to those rights and entitled to judicial review from that (Voice Overlap) --
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2830.567,2834.824,Was this statute -- is this charter provision is practiced.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,2887.184,2889.42,I would say two things in response to that.
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2997.142,3024.802,"Mr. Redlich, may I direct your attention once more to the hearing that you have before the Commissioner of Sanitation in which you have told us that these 12 men were offered an opportunity to respond to the charges and they declined to respond to the charges.Where in the record do we find those charges?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3024.802,3026.276,"You do not, Your Honor."
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3026.276,3027.868,Where are they?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3027.868,3037.431,"They are not in the -- they are not in this particular record because the hearing took place after this lawsuit was brought, Your Honor."
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3038.052,3047.756,Would you mind telling me briefly what the form and the -- of the charges and what they contain?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3047.756,3051.196,The charge before the Commissioner of Sanitation?
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3051.196,3051.725,Yes.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3051.725,3060.272,It was a charge that these employees had violated Section 1123 of the Charter.
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3076.089,3084.686,"By the transcript, are you referring to the tapes of the -- the tapes of the wiretapping?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3084.686,3088.826,"Yes, I'm not sure whether it was tape to -- no, no not the wiretapping, no."
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3138.743,3156.982,"I get that part of it but -- but in these charges that you refer to, were they're charged with having done this and that and the other thing in violation of their duties to which they put and responded?"
1967.823,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.982,3161.667,What were the original questions to the 15 about?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3161.667,3176.683,The original questions to the 15 were about the allegation that they had taken money from private cartmen and pocketed the money instead of picking up the tickets which they were supposed to pick up.
1967.823,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.556,3196.893,Did they have any chance to talk about those charges in the final hearing before their discharge?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3209.778,3226.154,"They were -- at the second proceeding although the formal charge against them was a violation of 1123, they were asked as I understand it two things at the second hearing which Mr. Justice White refers to."
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3242.169,3245.235,Where do we find -- do we find that colloquy in here?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3245.235,3247.252,"You do not, Your Honor."
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3247.252,3251.443,"What do we do, we just take that on fate?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3251.443,3257.108,"I ask that -- I've answered the question as best as I can, Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3257.145,3259.771,"Well, I wonder why that isn't in here."
1967.823,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.59,3272.375,"Where is the best description, if there is, in the record of what happened?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3272.375,3273.713,Could I respond to that?
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3315.925,3323.811,Well I think -- I think the thing that is bothering me is your use of the word charges.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3333.455,3333.64,Your Honor I --
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3333.64,3347.528,Or is it just a question of this man having asked the question to me didn't -- they didn't respond that may put those together in some form and you now refer to them as charges.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3355.914,3365.874,Mr. Chief Justice the formal charge levied against these employees was that they had violated Section 1123 of the Charter.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3376.13,3376.65,Was it required (Voice Overlap) --
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3376.65,3393.086,"And then at the second hearing before the Commissioner of Sanitation, they were limited, were they, only to the reasons why they refuse to answer to the Commissioner?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3419.913,3426.113,"Although it is necessary to answer that to go beyond the record, answering it to the best of my information, I will."
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3426.113,3426.847,You argue that?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3426.847,3427.523,Pardon?
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3427.523,3428.739,"Almost have to go beyond it, I guess."
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3428.739,3437.83,"Yes, I'm answering it to the best of my information Mr. Chief Justice with regard to the 12; they were offered that opportunity with regard --"
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3437.83,3439.236,In which opportunity?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3439.236,3448.164,The opportunity to respond to the original questions that had been asked before the Commissioner of Investigation.
1967.823,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3524.195,3543.551,"Well then, you are placed with the question as to those three at least of whether they are -- they are fired just because they refused before the grand jury to waive their privilege."
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3543.551,3551.713,"With regard to those three, yes, Mr. Chief Justice I think you have a very similar issue to what you had yesterday in Gardner."
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3551.713,3553.734,Well I -- I don't understand this.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3593.171,3594.62,"Yes, because the --"
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3594.62,3610.962,"And thereafter when notice of hearing was served on, are you telling us that there was or was not a reference to the invocation of the constitutional privilege?"
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3613.053,3622.87,"No what I said was this, that they were charged with the violation of Section 1123 of the Charter and suspended pursuant to that --"
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3622.87,3627.289,"And at that time, what I have read is the notice that they got."
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3627.289,3628.035,That is right and that is not --
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3628.035,3629.445,Alright.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3629.445,3630.127,I'm sorry.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3630.127,3630.652,Go ahead.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3630.652,3638.618,And that is not inconsistent with my prior answer because there followed a hearing before the Commissioner of Sanitation.
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3653.945,3659.39,Were they given notice to that hearing before the Commissioner of Sanitation?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3659.39,3659.606,Oh!
1967.823,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3660.443,3670.119,Did that notice say that you have -- that the basis or part of the basis was the invocation of the constitutional privilege?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3670.119,3675.069,"Yes, the formal charge was a violation of 1123, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.823,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3675.069,3683.189,The hearing as I understand it procedurally followed the standard set out in Civil Service Law of Section 75.
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3683.189,3683.591,That is right.
1967.823,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3683.591,3685.727,Which is in the appendix to your brief?
1967.823,1,37261,norman_redlich,,3685.727,3689.753,That is right Justice Stewart.
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,3959.784,3963.397,Mr. Chief Justice.
1967.823,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4067.865,4085.216,"But it definitely Mr. Boudin (Voice Overlap) I gather, it is a fact, is it not, that the inquiry before the Commissioner of Investigation involving all 15, the questions there put did go to their conduct as employees."
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4085.216,4086.018,I don't dispute it.
1967.823,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4131.957,4132.701,Mr. Boudin.
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4132.701,4132.805,Yes.
1967.823,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4132.805,4143.404,"May I ask, do you know whether Section 75 of the Civil Service Law was enacted after the Slochower case?"
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4143.404,4147.082,"No, I think it -- I think it once similar occurred before."
1967.823,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4151.041,4155.346,But the procedure was not followed in the Slochower case.
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4155.346,4161.47,"No, and that may have been because the Board of Education might have had a different mechanism."
1967.823,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4161.47,4168.828,"Well, do you concede that Section 75 requires a hearing in this type of case?"
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4168.828,4175.658,Section 75 will regard the hearing and the corporation counsel agrees in any kind of -- solely and this case involving (Voice Overlap) --
1967.823,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4175.658,4179.966,So that we can read Section 75 into 1123?
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4179.966,4184.057,I do not think so because I think these are two different system.
1967.823,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4185.45,4195.55,I thought you said that Section 75 wouldn't require a hearing in the -- in this type of case.
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4195.55,4205.918,"Based upon charges that would be filed, charges otherwise comparable but the only charge here is the charge of 1123."
1967.823,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4232.582,4238.91,"So the procedures of Section 75, -- the procedures of Section were followed in this case, weren't they?"
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4238.91,4243.3,"In the sense that the hearing was offered, except the hearing was limited to (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.823,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4243.3,4245.413,There was notice to all of the proceedings --
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4245.413,4248.41,Except the charges were limited if I may end with that point --
1967.823,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4248.41,4251.479,But the substance of the charges and what I'm talking about the procedure of the hearing.
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4251.479,4255.46,We make no claim that 75 was not -- was violated at any (Voice Overlap) --
1967.823,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4255.46,4256.589,Or that was not followed here.
1967.823,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,4256.589,4260.801,"No, we don't regard it into the case."
