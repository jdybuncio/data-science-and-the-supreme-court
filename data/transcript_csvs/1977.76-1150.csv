1977.76-1150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.645,"Court will hear arguments first this morning in 76-1150, Baldwin against Fish and Game Commission of Montana."
1977.76-1150,0,30561,james_h_goetz,,14.934,21.07,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, my name is James H. Goetz."
1977.76-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,94.686,99.576,"Well, is that a latter really any different from the first?"
1977.76-1150,0,30561,james_h_goetz,,103.119,106.732,That all of it required is to pay some money to get th combination license.
1977.76-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,110.051,116.297,"But it is just a -- you can get it if you just pay some money, quite a bit of more money."
1977.76-1150,0,30561,james_h_goetz,,116.297,130.58,"Yes, that is true, in that sense, it is the same and in that sense, our position, appellant's position is that it is a means of indirectly gouging, if you will of a non-resident hunter to increase the fees."
1977.76-1150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,146.585,151.809,Do you analogize this to your legal tie-in sale?
1977.76-1150,0,30561,james_h_goetz,,151.809,172.966,"Yes, I think I would, I have not thought about it in that context right away, but I think it would be something like an illegal tie-in and in the sense that it entails an indirect imposition which must be undertaken by a person in order to avail themselves of the right to hunt."
1977.76-1150,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,178.547,182.022,Did the District Court address the Combination License issue?
1977.76-1150,0,30561,james_h_goetz,,182.022,206.189,"In my judgment the District Court did not, there is one Footnote in the District Court's opinion which suggests that the District Court addressed that issue simply as another aspect of the increase in fees, somewhat along the lines of Justice White's question here today, I believe it is clear the District Court did not address it directly."
1977.76-1150,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,206.189,209.037,Do you think it is before us?
1977.76-1150,0,30561,james_h_goetz,,209.037,237.718,"Well, yes I do because it was presented in the District Court and the District Court rejected the plaintiffs and the appellant's challenge to the Combination License and there is absolutely no doubt from the record that that issue was presented squarely and specifically and as I say, it was referenced in the Footnote, the District Court did not address it at least as I thought they should have as a separate issue."
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1185.667,1188.707,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.822,1340.987,"Would it be your position then that the State of Montana, could, if it wanted to, just exclude non-residents entirely from recreational hunting?"
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1343.653,1351.829,"In so far as the Privileges and Immunities Clause is concerned, I believe it could with respect to the Equal Protection Clause, we have a different --"
1977.76-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.829,1355.515,Similarly with the parks.
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1355.515,1357.531,With the national parks?
1977.76-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.646,1364.762,"Yeah, but how about state parks, just reserving state parks for the use of citizens?"
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1364.762,1369.33,"I submit that under the Privileges Clause, the court could because a fundamental right is not involved."
1977.76-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.139,1405.244,"Well, let us just say the state says that for political purposes namely to encourage our citizens to be willing to put up the money for state parks, we are going to exclude nonresidents, it is just recreation, they just only want to do is to camp and walk around."
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1405.244,1416.435,"If the state seem absolutely deterred, all incoming non-residents, I think we have a different situation in this case."
1977.76-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.435,1419.754,Don't you think that that would be reached by the Privileges and Immunities Clause?
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1419.754,1422.438,I do not think it would be reached by the P$I Clause.
1977.76-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.438,1424.079,And then the Equal Protection?
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1424.079,1425.252,Because I do not think that --
1977.76-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.252,1431.554,"In Equal Protection, you would say you would need more than a rational basis?"
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1431.554,1439.931,"That is not the case of course, but I think that we would have to look at different reasons for the state that is what is rational in that situation might be different than -"
1977.76-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.931,1450.007,"But the interest remains the same, the interest in nonresidents and you are saying that under the Equal Protection Clause, you would say that interest in entitled to more weight?"
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1450.007,1463.07,"I think that under the Equal Protection Clause, where there is -- if federal lands are involved for example, I think that there might well be a different measure of the states conservation activity than in the situation here."
1977.76-1150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1463.07,1475.828,"Your point is that under the Privilege and Immunities Clause, that that cause is simply inapplicable because this right is the right that is not recreation, it is not covered by that clause."
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1484.051,1488.671,"Well, under the Equal Protection Clause, implicit or explicit constitutional rights --"
1977.76-1150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1488.671,1490.773,Equal Protection Clause has to do with classifications.
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1490.773,1503.864,"That is correct and where the classification is not invidious as here but where the result is a total exclusion, I could see the court applying a different level not necessarily strict scrutiny but --."
1977.76-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1503.864,1507.558,Because in your mind of the interest so called involved.
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1507.558,1511.684,"Because of the result I think, Your Honor."
1977.76-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.684,1529.955,"I must say I just do not follow the reasoning because the classification in either case, we are taking of Equal Protection, now let us forget about Privilege and Immunities, the classification between residents and non-residents, you say that is a legitimate classification, if it is a legitimate classification why cannot they say no non-residents at all."
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1535.692,1557.346,"I think that conceivably a state could say no nonresidents at all, it would depend upon the rationale of the state what it was trying to do, and I think we had for example a situation we had a rare species and only a limited number could be hunted, I believe that the state can readily say and demonstrate the need."
1977.76-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.346,1570.177,"In all these cases as Justice White points out, we do not want too many people overusing our park facilities and we would rather save them for the taxpayers of pay forums, so we will simply exclude our (Inaudible), what is wrong with that?"
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1570.177,1576.061,I simply believe that it is not a fundamental right and I believe that the classification is not invidious.
1977.76-1150,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1576.061,1578.708,Toomer against Witsell what is wrong with that?
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1578.708,1588.646,"Well, Toomer versus Witsell was a P&I clause case and in Toomer versus Witsell We are talking only Equal Protection."
1977.76-1150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.646,1590.443,"But that was a racial classification, wasn't it?"
1977.76-1150,1,38100,paul_a_lenzini,,1590.443,1594.739,That is correct.
1977.76-1150,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2969.413,2973.613,"That is correct, there is no issue as to durational residency requirement."
