2003.02-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.968,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 02-693, John Lamie v. the United States Trustee."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,8.999,13.086,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,68.443,79.134,"Mr. Goldstein, who's covered by fees available for a professional person employed under section 327 or 1103?"
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,79.134,90.529,"That would be an attorney who's retained by a trustee, and according to the U.S. Trustee, it would also be an attorney retained by a debtor in possession in a chapter 11 case."
2003.02-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,92.015,94.077,But not chapter 7.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,94.077,95.192,--That's correct.
2003.02-693,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,104.358,105.966,"That's, obviously, of critical importance."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,142.253,144.398,"According to the U.S. Trustee, no."
2003.02-693,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,183.036,193.894,"Even if you tell the court in the chapter 11 proceeding, we're going to go to 7 and we need the debtor to do some work, the... the court just has no power to authorize that work I guess is your position."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,193.894,194.553,"Oh, no, no, no."
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,233.768,236.906,"Well, why can't the... I mean, their argument is the trustee can do it."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,247.847,254.096,"--Because there are things that the Bankruptcy Code assigns as responsibility to the debtor, not the trustee."
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,258.372,263.118,"No, but is there any conflict in the trustee saying, look, you can do these things for the debtor and I'll pay you?"
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,263.118,263.74,--Yes.
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,322.272,329.786,"Maybe... not to... not to be cute about it, but maybe those are the only times he should have."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,329.786,343.039,"Well, we know that that's not the case, Justice Souter, because the Bankruptcy Code does, as Justice Kennedy has suggested, give important responsibilities to the debtor qua debtor, not that are distinct from the duties of the trustee."
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,349.038,361.736,"But is there any conflict... any conflict of... of... you know, ethical or quasi-ethical conflict if the... if the trustee says, look, these responsibility... you've got to shoulder these responsibilities."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,371.191,372.965,"Yes, actually there is."
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,385.969,388.941,"Would you give me... just give me an example, a garden variety example--"
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,388.941,390.221,--An exemption fight.
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,390.221,390.777,--of a conflict situation?
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,390.777,391.874,An exemption fight.
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,391.874,392.739,"Yes, okay."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,392.739,395.878,When you're trying to... to decide whether or not the debtor gets to claim an exemption.
2003.02-693,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,399.509,414.658,"Before you do, Mr. Goldstein, is it true that in most chapter 7's, this is an academic question because there's not any money to pay even the... any... the administrative creditors?"
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,414.658,423.492,"Yes, but the fact that in relative terms, in terms of the percentage of chapter 7's, it's not that big a deal does not mean in absolute terms it's not."
2003.02-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,433.977,436.124,These end up as chapter 7 cases?
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,436.124,437.238,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,451.15,461.72,"Mr. Goldstein, you know, Congress had this problem brought to its attention a number of times and... and has chosen not to enact something, putting that language back in."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,466.96,470.941,"--In all candor, Justice O'Connor, I think that's a point in their favor."
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,477.528,481.449,"Before you get to the intent of Congress, I'm rather stuck with the language."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,532.513,534.948,"--Yes, and then I will come back to Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,544.979,545.516,No.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,547.086,547.579,--Well--
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,547.579,550.802,I am adverting to the fact that the words aren't there.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,550.802,556.169,"--Justice Breyer, let me explain to why I think you are, and then you can tell me why I'm misguided, I'm sure."
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,556.419,556.995,No.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,558.936,559.679,United States v. Wilson.
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,559.679,560.339,--All right.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,560.339,566.905,"United States v. Wilson, and then I'll come back to why I think their argument is an expressio unius one, and then I'll explain to you U.S. v. Wilson."
2003.02-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.014,637.41,"Well, you think this just got lost in the shuffle?"
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,637.41,637.865,--Yes.
2003.02-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.865,643.105,That's why I'm asking you a question that I hope--
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,643.105,643.726,Yes.
2003.02-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,643.726,644.841,--you'll be allowed to answer--
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,649.671,650.208,Yes.
2003.02-693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,650.208,650.868,--which they didn't--
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,650.868,658.299,"Well, this Court has never really taken that view of subsequent legislative history, Justice O'Connor, but let me turn to the events."
2003.02-693,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,691.531,700.076,"--Isn't there a current... isn't there a current correction... bankruptcy technical correction bill pending, and isn't this absent from it?"
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,700.076,709.242,"It is, but Justice Ginsburg... so now we have not just the failure to enact legislation exists, but the U.S. Trustee is relying on the failure to enact legislation that doesn't even exist."
2003.02-693,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,752.726,759.042,But now it has been called to their attention and it isn't in the bill making other technical corrections.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,759.042,762.657,"--Justice Ginsburg, I agree, and I... I'm obviously not making this point well enough."
2003.02-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.965,788.292,"But, Mr. Goldstein, you're overlooking one... one other argument I think."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,798.945,800.181,We... yes.
2003.02-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.181,800.802,And nothing was done.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,800.802,817.27,"Justice Stevens, let me put that series of events in slightly more context, and that is that in the House, when the bill was not pending there, there was a hearing, and this is one line in a 718-page record of just written materials submitted that says there is an inadvertent omission."
2003.02-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.266,823.381,Let me just add one thought.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,913.288,923.402,"--It is important to note, of course, that when the Department of Justice and the U.S. Trustee commented on the bill at the time, they did not say that this would be the result of the statute or that they proposed it."
2003.02-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,956.634,963.859,"Well, are the standards for changing bankruptcy policy in Congress different from the standards of changing other kinds of policy?"
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,963.859,969.532,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the indications in this Court's precedents... the answer to that question is yes."
2003.02-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,969.532,971.661,And what... what precedents are those?
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,971.661,975.46,Those would be principally the line of cases that begin with Midatlantic.
2003.02-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,985.424,1005.858,"Well, but some of the... the Midatlantic, for example, was shortly after the Bankruptcy Code was adopted succeeding the 1898 act, and there, there was probably a good reason for saying when you have that sort of a comprehensive revision, the presumption is that if something... it's not clear where something was changed, we meant to retain the old."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1007.966,1027.201,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that the relevant answer would be that Cohen v. de la Cruz, which deals with a much more minor revision of the Bankruptcy Code than even this one, the 1984 revision applies the same principle and that is this Court has recognized that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code are incredibly interrelated."
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1036.367,1038.718,"At some point, will you go back to my first question?"
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1038.718,1039.544,--Yes.
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1039.544,1041.113,I just... you have just a few--
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1041.113,1041.69,Yes.
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1041.69,1043.342,"--I mean, why... because I looked at United States v. Wilson."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1081.237,1081.693,Okay.
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1084.665,1085.408,You can have--
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1085.408,1089.511,--I... I think... I think we have a new thread.
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1116.343,1116.898,--Inserted the word what?
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1116.898,1118.49,--Inserted the word criminal.
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1121.834,1123.857,But that's... you're not missing... you're missing my point.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1125.549,1125.92,Yes.
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1125.92,1128.028,--to read language in a statute--
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1128.028,1128.233,Yes.
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1128.233,1133.229,--so that it has a limited scope or a scope over here or only applies there.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1153.867,1154.322,Right.
2003.02-693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.322,1161.109,I've never seen a court just take three words out of the blue and insert them in that way in a statute.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1161.109,1161.448,All right.
2003.02-693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.189,1205.22,"Well, they don't have to read it out."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1226.685,1243.858,"I think you and Justice Breyer may be making a similar point here, and that is, look, if we had the text and all we had was the text, it would do less violence you say, and I think I can conceded it would do less violence to read in the... the word rather than to render the other one superfluous or read it out."
2003.02-693,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1283.323,1294.385,"Why don't you just say the first correction, which is... or the first, in... in your view, slip is the elimination of four words?"
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1318.368,1323.197,I don't think that we have to get down to the number of words or syllables or anything like that.
2003.02-693,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1340.082,1344.102,But there were umpteen illustrations of missing or's.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1346.975,1354.86,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't think there's any greater canon that says we find errors presumptively in second provisions rather than first ones."
2003.02-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1376.741,1383.262,But how can you say that if this material I called to your attention was called to the attention at least of the staff of the committee?
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1391.807,1395.234,"--Right, Justice Stevens, let me distinguish two different periods of time."
2003.02-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1429.581,1432.097,May I just get one other thought out?
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1435.275,1445.284,"--That is the reference in... I'm on 2a of the blue brief, 11 U.S.C. 330(a), subsection (1)(A), what we've called the providers' list."
2003.02-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.9,1449.393,Right.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1449.393,1456.617,"Reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered by the trustee, examiner, professional person, or attorney."
2003.02-693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1458.309,1462.357,Why... why couldn't that refer to an attorney appointed by the trustee?
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1462.357,1466.937,"--Well, it... as has been suggested, literally it could."
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1480.207,1486.711,"No, but it... not... the... the... there's another possibility: any attorney employed by the trustee."
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1498.699,1499.731,"--It is, Justice Souter."
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1512.967,1518.434,"No, but if the trustee appoints an attorney not for himself, but for the debtor--"
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1518.434,1518.7,Ah.
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1518.7,1519.882,--then it's not surplusage.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1519.882,1520.292,I apologize.
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1530.678,1533.772,I... let me... let's assume I misspoke.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1539.677,1541.202,No.
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1541.202,1543.597,That's a way of reading these two sections together.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1543.597,1544.153,Okay.
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1549.976,1551.09,I did not expect that answer.
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1551.09,1551.666,Yes.
2003.02-693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1552.864,1553.441,Why?
2003.02-693,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1553.441,1569.888,"We all should assume that all... the answer to all the questions, if so, we win, because what would happen is that, remember, literally the debtor's attorney may be... provides compensable services, and then the ambiguity that Justice Breyer has focused on and then you have is that we have the question of, okay, who... who gets the money."
2003.02-693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.794,1606.363,"Very well, Mr. Goldstein."
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1607.866,1616.206,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1644.463,1656.163,"It eliminated them unambiguously I guess from the class of persons entitled to be paid directly, but did it eliminate them from the class of persons who might ultimately be compensated, i.e., the class in... in... what is it?"
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1657.716,1658.581,Yes.
2003.02-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1676.125,1678.976,So... so the... so the reference is surplusage in (a).
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1678.976,1681.038,It's superfluous in this sense.
2003.02-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1688.552,1689.128,Yes.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1689.128,1701.471,"But Congress may... it may have failed to make a conforming change, but it's also possible that Congress specifically left the word in because Congress often uses overlapping terms to accomplish its objectives."
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.906,1721.822,"But the word attorney in 330 would then have a different meaning after the amendment than it had before because before the amendment, it clearly referred to the debtor's attorney, did it not?"
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1721.822,1730.45,"That's correct, but there's no question that the... the code, as it now stands, has... omits the debtor's attorney from one of the authorized people."
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1737.964,1740.952,"Well, he's arguing the word attorney means the same thing it always meant."
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1744.773,1745.682,--That's fine.
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.714,1747.64,And you're saying it means something different.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1747.64,1755.797,"--It could still mean the debtor's attorney, but there's no question in this case petitioner was not authorized to be retained by the trustee under section 327."
2003.02-693,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1768.057,1779.696,"Why does it make any sense, considering that the code does give obligations, duties that must be done by the chapter 7 debtor?"
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1782.934,1788.574,"Well, I think it reflects the fundamental distinction between chapter 7 and all other codes."
2003.02-693,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1814.869,1816.931,But... but why doesn't that help the petitioner?
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1848.056,1863.166,"Justice Kennedy, there's no question that both before and after the 1994 amendments, chapter 7 debtors retained counsel, but they do so in the overwhelming majority of cases with a pre-petition flat fee, usually 750 to $850."
2003.02-693,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1865.19,1866.676,And that can be paid.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1866.676,1867.503,Absolutely.
2003.02-693,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.503,1868.45,That is paid the lawyer--
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1870.846,1871.522,Absolutely.
2003.02-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1872.62,1873.197,For current services?
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1873.197,1873.819,--Yes.
2003.02-693,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1881.249,1884.343,"It would be avoidable preference if it's too high, wouldn't it?"
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1884.343,1907.748,"If it's too high, but I'm talking about the standard, routine fee of under $1,000 if somebody walks in because they've been overwhelmed by credit card debts or gambling debts or had a divorce, they need representation on how to fill out the schedules, what types of property are exempt, and they retain counsel, the counsel takes that money, gets the standard flat fee, that... and all the services are earned pre-petition with one exception."
2003.02-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1907.748,1918.605,"What if the... what if the check bounced and there's now been a conversion to 7 and the... and the lawyer says, I ought to be paid for my 11 work?"
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1920.546,1922.488,Not out of estate funds.
2003.02-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.832,1926.825,He clears the check.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1927.246,1928.982,Bankruptcy counsel do this--
2003.02-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1928.982,1935.214,"So you're saying at this point, regardless of chapter 11 work, chapter 7 work, no payment out of the... the estate funds."
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1935.214,1944.214,"--Not out of estate funds, but it's... it's critical to understand that in chapter 7, unlike all other chapters, the... the estate is frozen at the time of petition."
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.036,2003.945,Let me ask you about--
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2003.945,2004.316,--Sure.
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2004.316,2007.866,"--a provision of the statute you didn't include in your brief, or at least in the appendix."
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2009.352,2010.361,Yes.
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.361,2015.546,"--specifically authorizes the debtor's attorney to receive a retainer, as I understand it."
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2015.546,2039.239,"That's for the code as it... what... this is a... a pro-creditor provision that recognizes that debtors will often go to counsel before they file bankruptcy, and anyone, whether or not you seek compensation under the statute, any lawyer for any debtor who ultimately files for bankruptcy has to disclose their fee arrangement, and the court can order the cancellation of it or return of the fee if it's excessive or unreasonable."
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.239,2050.179,"But... but if the court does not order a cancellation of it, it seems to me that provision contemplates a payment to the debtor's attorney for his services to the debtor."
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2050.179,2051.333,Pre-petition.
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.045,2070.159,This refers to 7.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2072.882,2073.503,--Right.
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2090.137,2096.909,"Well, in section (b), it authorizes the court to cancel it... cancel the agreement if it's unreasonable compensation."
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2101.011,2103.679,"Right, but that's... that's pre-petition."
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2103.679,2106.484,"Well, I understand, but the money has to be paid pre-petition."
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2109.745,2110.405,That's right.
2003.02-693,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2153.091,2158.125,But not that would assist the debtor in the exemption example.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2158.125,2158.885,No.
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2193.132,2199.67,"I really don't understand that argument because this case just involves the other 4 percent, and there are a lot of cases in the 4 percent, aren't there?"
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2201.443,2203.285,"--That's true, and in those cases--"
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.285,2206.34,So what difference does it make that 96 percent... it doesn't make any difference.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2207.826,2218.683,"--I think it goes to the idea that given that there's a plain absence of any statutory authority to do this, the question is, is this some sort of absurd result that Congress could not have plausibly intended?"
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.988,2242.849,"Has retained counsel to do work to benefit the estate, not retained counsel to represent the debtor."
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2242.849,2243.575,--That's right.
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.857,2246.547,Which he could have done before 1996.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2246.547,2247.124,--Right.
2003.02-693,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2254.183,2256.495,"Not if he's a company, as in this case."
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2256.495,2257.238,--Right.
2003.02-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2299.674,2303.761,"Well, he didn't have ample authority to do it before the chapter 7 was filed, did he?"
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2303.761,2305.331,--No.
2003.02-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2327.827,2342.855,"But... but I thought you indicated that the trustee had ample authority to hire the debtor's attorney, and I... in the chapter 7 proceeding, and I said, true, but does he have the authority to hire the debtor's attorney before the chapter 7 is filed?"
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2344.834,2350.035,"This... I mean, I'll try to take you chronologically."
2003.02-693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2362.174,2363.781,For work done from that time forward.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2363.781,2365.722,--Work done just while it was an 11.
2003.02-693,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2380.583,2382.607,"Well, there's no trustee until chapter 7, is there?"
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2382.607,2382.979,That's right.
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.558,2406.589,"And he can hire the... and he can hire the debtor's attorney to do work in the chapter 7, but that doesn't compensate for what... the work that was done before chapter 7."
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2406.589,2408.241,That's right.
2003.02-693,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2408.241,2412.412,The work that was done before chapter 7 was compensated in this case.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2412.412,2413.071,"Yes, it was paid."
2003.02-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2463.431,2467.972,Are all trustees in chapter 7 cases United States Trustees?
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2468.882,2469.541,None of them are.
2003.02-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2485.351,2487.291,Even if the Government isn't involved in the case.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2487.291,2489.316,Right.
2003.02-693,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2510.408,2512.722,The bankruptcy judge appoints the trustee.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2512.722,2520.356,"--I don't know if... Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure whether it's the... the bankruptcy court does appoint the trustee."

2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2539.387,2540.585,"No, no."
2003.02-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2559.449,2563.907,They... they do that without any appointment by the bankruptcy court then I take it.
2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2563.907,2564.9,--That's right.

2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2660.258,2660.918,--Sure.
2003.02-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2660.918,2669.956,"--Maybe this is a little repetitious, but I want to read you two sentences from Collier on Bankruptcy, the treatise that most of us rely on perhaps too much in this area."

2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2739.407,2740.726,Collier is just wrong.

2003.02-693,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2796.537,2809.457,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, by both the bankruptcy court and the district court because they proceeded on the erroneous assumption, as found by the Fourth Circuit, that this was money that belonged to the lawyer instead of the estate."

2003.02-693,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2901.488,2905.103,But can't that be checked by the court under 329 and say that's too much?
