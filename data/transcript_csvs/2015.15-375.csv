2015.15-375,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.135,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-375, Supap Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons. Mr. Rosenkranz."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,9.135,22.1,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress modified the American Rule in the Copyright Act, it was not just trying to punish those who took unreasonable positions."
2015.15-375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,91.245,105.855,"Mr. Rosenkranz, if Kirtsaeng had lost this case -- if he had lost this case, should fees have been awarded to Wiley, given the significance of this decision? I mean, it's an important decision."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,116.18,124.155,"Wiley would have an argument, Your Honor, certainly on one of the factors that we have suggested, which is it would say we won an important case."
2015.15-375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,125.67,126.62,It would have had more than that.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,133.905,134.75,Not --
2015.15-375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,134.75,138.03,"If I were going to bet, I would say yes to that question."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,138.66,139.55,I'm sorry.
2015.15-375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,143.5,143.905,Right.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,143.905,153.73,"So our client had a lot already weighing against him. But just to get back to finish the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, but there would have been other factors."
2015.15-375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,171.355,174.665,Why? It was a lucrative business he was engaged in.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,174.665,181.47,"Your Honor, he was a student who had this side business who was making just a few dollars per book."
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,183.64,185.3,Several hundred thousand.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,185.3,191.0,"Several hundred thousand dollars in revenues, Your Honor, but not in profit."
2015.15-375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,218.17,227.71,"Mr. Rosenkranz, just to continue on with what Justice Ginsburg was asking you. As an ex-post matter, you have a great David versus Goliath story to tell."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,265.65,268.965,"Your Honor, the answer is no, and for this reason."
2015.15-375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,289.32,291.44,"Well, but that's only one side of the question."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,320.99,337.38,"Your Honor, understood. That will be part of the calculus. Now, in the Ninth Circuit where the test that we are suggesting predominates, and in every circuit that doesn't accept the Second Circuit's position, which is to say every other circuit, there is not a dearth of copyright litigation."
2015.15-375,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,361.12,370.13,I thought you told -- I thought you told us that there haven't been any awards under the -- maybe I misunderstood -- the Second Circuit test in 15 years.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,374.81,390.925,"178 cases, Your Honor, that were decided under the Second Circuit's Matthew Bender standard, not once did any defendant -- defendant, that is, ever prevail in receiving attorneys' fees except where the plaintiff --"
2015.15-375,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,390.925,391.27,Right.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,391.27,394.245,-- has been -- has engaged in unreasonable --
2015.15-375,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,394.245,394.925,Unreasonable.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,394.925,395.38,-- conduct.
2015.15-375,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,395.38,403.14,But I thought your point -- your point now is that the defendants in copyright cases still show up.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,403.14,404.64,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,407.43,413.29,"So in the Ninth Circuit, plaintiffs show up, starving artists show up, and starving artists defend."
2015.15-375,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,413.29,415.11,And they don't in the Second Circuit?
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,415.11,424.86,"Then the truth is there are very few starving artists in any copyright litigation. So, yes, they may show up, but they won't be able to pay for their own lawyer."
2015.15-375,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,425.35,435.19,Do you suggest that one of the solutions to that problem is for the district court to take into account the relative financial resources of the parties; is that correct?
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,435.19,438.2,"Yes, Your Honor, as -- as one of the factors."
2015.15-375,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,467.165,467.62,Is there anything --
2015.15-375,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,467.62,474.92,Have we ever said in a -- have we ever said that the availability of attorneys' fees is dependent on the financial resources of the party?
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,474.92,484.965,"Your Honor, it's -- it's certainly -- it has long been a part of the standard that courts have consistently applied in attorneys' fees cases."
2015.15-375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,534.61,535.59,Mr. Rosenkranz --
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,535.59,535.77,-- under --
2015.15-375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.77,553.065,"-- it does sound like, as Justice Kagan put it, that your rule is if David faces Goliath and David wins, David gets fees no matter how reasonable Goliath's position was."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,555.495,557.095,"Your Honor, it doesn't."
2015.15-375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,590.06,600.31,"So one thing that concerns me about a test like that, Mr. Rosenkranz, is it's very hard for people to make judgments ex ante and to figure out what their chances are."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,639.98,641.23,"Understood, Your Honor."
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.74,676.48,What is -- what about -- I suppose I start this thinking district judges do have a job.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,704.84,705.52,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,705.55,705.89,All right.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,715.45,716.21,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,740.44,763.31,"No, but you want us case-specific or you want us to say something? I mean, one -- one whole -- one result would be the Second Circuit seems not to have taken account of what we said, which is that all considerations -- all considerations that are consistent with the purposes of the Copyright Act can be relevant."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,765.995,769.49,"Absolutely, Your Honor. Although, I -- I would add a little bit more."
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,769.61,771.75,"You wanted this other thing, which I don't know how to do."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,781.685,782.19,Your Honor --
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,782.19,783.37,Maybe others thought it did.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,786.04,791.65,"Your Honor, district courts know what cases are advancing the law and what cases are more specific --"
2015.15-375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,791.65,801.03,"Mr. Rosenkranz, I -- I think that Justice Breyer is getting to something. Put on a hat that doesn't want to win outright."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,895.535,906.96,"Understood, Your Honor. The simple answer is: What the Second Circuit did was to pick one factor out of a jumble of possible factors and say, this will be the one that gets substantial weight."
2015.15-375,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,920.06,933.44,"So the test would be, it's okay to have it one among others, but not a presumption that says that's always going to entitle you to defend against an award or to win an award."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,933.44,933.89,Agreed.
2015.15-375,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1020.67,1035.94,"But it seems to me that you -- a -- a party can advance the law and a -- a case can advance the law by insisting on principled, consistent application of settled principles."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1062.73,1067.84,"Of -- of course, it does. And -- and in the right case, that can support a fees award."
2015.15-375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1082.925,1095.22,"Mr. Rosenkranz, can we go back to your test now? Would you say we'll make it something district courts can understand and readily apply? So take my question."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1105.735,1120.105,"The answer will depend on a district court's specific balancing, but I'll do the balance that I would do -- that I would argue to the district court. I would say, well, first, Wiley did win something really big here."
2015.15-375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1192.029,1209.73,"Can I -- can I ask, Mr. Rosenkranz, one of the things that confused me about this case and about, actually, both sides' arguments, I -- I don't really understand why it is that the fees are awarded in such a high percentage of the cases, both in the Second Circuit and elsewhere."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1225.79,1233.515,"So, Your Honor, the answer has two parts: There is a different test for defendants than for plaintiffs, notwithstanding what you read in Matthew Bender."
2015.15-375,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1234.61,1242.93,"Before -- before you talk to me about the -- the way this might or might not be pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant, just why are they all so high?"
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1242.93,1262.28,"Well -- well, the numbers are so high for plaintiffs because plaintiffs are generally getting copyright fees, even if the other side was perfectly reasonable, because there's a blameworthiness element to it. So this -- you know, this so-and-so infringer should be smacked with a -- with attorneys' fees."
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1303.32,1306.4,"Well, you know, it's -- I have no idea why."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1320.895,1321.28,Sure --
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1321.28,1331.9,"Maybe, from time to time, the copyright owners feel that, you know, my employees have to pay for gasoline at Exxon; why should Exxon's employees take all my works for free?"
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1331.9,1332.59,"Sure, Your Honor."
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1332.89,1333.0,Okay.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1356.425,1359.265,"Your Honor, I -- I -- I understand the lack of love."
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.64,1373.655,"It might be you say we go back and say have they taken what used to be an all-factors test, and have they in fact said -- and then we could all go home."
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1393.61,1394.315,Yes.
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1402.91,1405.06,You have added a couple of standards.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1414.735,1418.42,"Your Honor, my later sentences -- you're -- you are right, were two sentences."
2015.15-375,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1437.53,1445.09,The problem with that is that different judges are going to have very different views about what will further the purposes of the Copyright Act.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1455.68,1456.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1469.32,1474.865,The -- the footnote does not say further the purposes of the Act.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1516.24,1516.86,"No, your Honor."
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1517.82,1517.96,Yes.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1517.96,1518.53,-- very short.
2015.15-375,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.19,1522.32,Right.
2015.15-375,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1522.32,1524.43,-- description of Fogerty. Thank you Your Honor.
2015.15-375,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1524.43,1533.38,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Smith."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1533.38,1539.305,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a case, I submit, where the lower courts did everything right."
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1562.15,1570.435,"Except there is -- Mr. Smith, I'm troubled by what's happening in the Second Circuit."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1656.385,1657.36,"No, your Honor."
2015.15-375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1668.43,1668.915,Sorry.
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1670.095,1670.59,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1671.79,1675.94,"But that was a study from 2000, correct?"
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1675.94,1676.34,"No, no, no."
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1690.14,1692.47,"Having practiced in this area, I know you're right."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1692.47,1700.97,"So, you know, these statistics can be thrown around, but it is not as if defendants in general are not succeeding in getting attorneys' fees when they're appropriate, but what you --"
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1700.97,1718.135,But -- but isn't there a problem in having one factor outweigh all others? It's much harder to start a -- with a presumption up here and all the other factors have to tie against that one to overcome it.
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1718.135,1718.73,But it's the fact --
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1718.73,1722.51,"Why don't we just have the Fogerty factors, which are it's one among many?"
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1722.51,1724.04,"Your Honor, two -- two responses."
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1772.63,1786.79,"But since most plaintiffs are not going to sue unless their position is arguably, reasonably present, shouldn't we be looking at how reasonable the defendant's position was?"
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1786.79,1789.95,You do when they -- when the plaintiff wins.
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1789.95,1792.045,When the defendant wins.
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1792.045,1802.135,"When the defendant wins, if you have a rule that says we're going to shift fees against reasonable plaintiffs, then you're going to have the wrong incentives."
2015.15-375,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1864.505,1880.07,"As you understand the Petitioner's position, do they take the argument you've just made about the necessity for continuing the litigation and then add a David and Goliath factor to it? Is that your understanding of their position, or am I --"
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1880.07,1888.605,"My understanding of their position -- and it is a little hard to nail down, Your Honor; it seems to vary at times -- is from Pages 40 and 41 of the merits brief, the blue brief."
2015.15-375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1901.89,1903.52,He's departing from that.
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1903.52,1903.85,Excuse me?
2015.15-375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1903.85,1909.175,"He's departing from that, at least. So you say, just don't say never."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1922.14,1923.64,"Certainly did not say never, Your Honor."
2015.15-375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1931.46,1940.925,"The way they wrote this here, and they were quoting, it says, ""As this Court has reasonably explained."" Am I in the right place? I'm in Page 18a, 19a of the -- of the petition."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1957.654,1958.94,"But, Your Honor --"
2015.15-375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.94,1961.41,"Anyway, your position is it shouldn't be never."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1961.41,1962.05,And that is the law --
2015.15-375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1962.05,1962.82,And maybe everybody agrees.
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1962.82,1964.32,That is the law in the Second Circuit.
2015.15-375,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1967.93,2001.12,"Mr. Smith, when you have a -- a system, which the Second Circuit does, of saying, look, this is the first among equal factors, and you need something, you know, pretty exceptional to outweigh this factor, if I'm a district judge and I'm thinking, you know, who likes to be overruled by the Second Circuit, it does seem as though it sends a pretty strong signal to district courts that this is the key factor and that they are not -- you know, probably not in their lifetimes going to see a case in which that factor is outweighed."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2001.12,2005.73,"The factor that -- that can outweigh it, and has outweighed it, is litigation misconduct."
2015.15-375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2063.45,2065.71,You mentioned that he's getting free representation.
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2072.505,2078.18,"I think it can affect the -- some of the other factors that are relevant under Fogerty, in particular the means --"
2015.15-375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2078.18,2078.49,"Well, it seems --"
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2078.49,2079.39,-- of compensation.
2015.15-375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2082.72,2090.335,"Well, it seems to me that's quite an intrusion into the relationship between the -- the party and -- and counsel."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2098.815,2099.33,I think it's --
2015.15-375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2099.33,2105.475,-- with the counsel giving a discount on fees and all that? I -- I'm not sure that should be a pertinent consideration.
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2105.475,2106.09,Perhaps not.
2015.15-375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2145.56,2150.07,"I mean, are you seriously suggesting it's a tough call for them whether to oppose the cert petition or not?"
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2150.07,2150.59,"Well, maybe not."
2015.15-375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2158.4,2159.51,"Well, what are -- what are the annual --"
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2159.51,2160.86,-- several million dollars in fees.
2015.15-375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2160.86,2164.03,What are the annual revenues that you're --
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2164.03,2166.23,Mr. Rosenkranz said 1.8 billion. Maybe that's correct.
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2188.04,2192.795,The problem with your situation is that you're looking at incentives.
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2232.91,2234.78,I -- I assume he probably --
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2234.78,2252.49,"And would have gone into debt for it? I -- I don't know the answer, but the -- the incentives are very, very different for a defendant who's being asked to go on with the litigation because the likelihood of them getting fees is so much smaller."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2252.49,2262.29,"I think there was never any significant likelihood of anybody getting fees under a proper application of the Second Circuit's rule here because, obviously, both sides had objectively reasonable positions."
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2267.24,2269.475,He got a willfulness found below.
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2269.475,2269.88,"Well, but --"
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2269.88,2274.595,How do you get a willfulness found in a situation where you know there's a circuit --
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2274.595,2275.27,But --
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2275.27,2279.33,"-- where there is a chance of a split court, 4-to-4?"
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2279.33,2283.03,"But the -- the conduct was -- was intentional, but the law was 50/50."
2015.15-375,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2320.52,2342.525,"Are you asking us, in our decision, to endorse the Second Circuit test and reject the Ninth Circuit test, articulate it the way that the Ninth Circuit does, what -- the Second Circuit test does? Ask us exactly what you want us to announce with respect to what the test should be or not be."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2342.525,2347.555,We think the Second Circuit's test makes eminent sense and ought to be upheld.
2015.15-375,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2380.96,2392.015,"How do you answer the argument that you -- you referred to patent cases, but the patent statute says ""fees"" in exceptional cases."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2392.015,2392.52,Right.
2015.15-375,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2392.52,2394.07,The Copyright Act doesn't say that.
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2394.07,2396.36,"And I think that is, in fact, how it's played out."
2015.15-375,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2439.11,2453.84,"Do you have a view, Mr. Smith, as to why it is that this reasonableness inquiry is producing such skewed results as to plaintiffs and defendants? Because as a logical matter, you would think it shouldn't, that -- that there -- there wouldn't be this skew."
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2453.84,2454.21,I mean --
2015.15-375,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2454.21,2459.965,Unless you really think the defendants are taking so many more unreasonable litigating positions.
2015.15-375,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2465.52,2484.84,"Part -- part of it is the default judgments where fees are routinely awarded because there is nobody there to oppose them in -- in very small amounts. But I -- I think the other thing is, as the government points out in their brief, plaintiffs decide when to bring cases, defendants don't decide when to be defendants, and there are a lot of intentional infringers of copyrights out there in the world that we have now."
2015.15-375,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2540.61,2560.36,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg."
2015.15-375,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2560.36,2596.035,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start by picking up on this point that's gotten a fair bit of discussion about what the statistics are in the Second Circuit under the Matthew Bender standard which says that objective reasonableness should be given substantial weight. Looking at hundreds and hundreds of cases in the Second Circuit, in the district courts, I think that there is a lot of discretion that one can exercise in deciding whether to include cases in your count or not include cases in your count, whether you include default judgments, whether you include declaratory judgment situations, whether you include situations where the Court says as a technical matter, you can't get fees because your motion was late."
2015.15-375,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2707.29,2707.75,I'm sorry.
2015.15-375,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2708.43,2720.905,"Martin v. Franklin, which was a case that involved the statute that, much like the statute here, just gave broad discretion to district courts without a lot of standards to guide them. And what the Court said in that case is discretion isn't whim."
2015.15-375,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2734.09,2750.175,"You didn't have the sort of situation you have here, where you're concerned about encouraging people to move for remand or discouraging people from filing for fees under remand. It was -- the policy sort of pushed all one way in Martin."
2015.15-375,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2750.175,2753.615,"Well, it's true that only one side in Martin could get fees."
2015.15-375,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2817.66,2827.34,Mr. Smith suggested that he thought the times in which the reasonableness inquiry would be outweighed is if you see real litigation misconduct.
2015.15-375,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2832.945,2852.33,"My sense is that that is probably going to be the most frequent circumstance in which it would be outweighed, and there are, as Mr. Smith pointed out, some cases in the Second Circuit like that, Viva Video, Zalewski cases, where even though the losing party was objectively reasonable, the Court said there has been some misconduct here and so awarded fees may be appropriate, or the district court should go back and see if there was misconduct here."
2015.15-375,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2852.33,2852.69,Maybe --
2015.15-375,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2852.69,2856.635,So there are other examples as well that I'd like to point out beyond that.
2015.15-375,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2938.05,2945.94,"Counsel, it -- is it pertinent, in the government's view, whether or not the party seeking fees was represented by pro bono counsel?"
2015.15-375,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2945.94,2953.725,I think it would be pertinent if you were to adopt an approach like Petitioner's approach where you took financial condition of the parties into account.
2015.15-375,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3016.72,3025.6,"Fogerty says -- it adds, ""The need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence."""
2015.15-375,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3025.6,3026.145,Yes.
2015.15-375,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3026.145,3032.455,"It lists the reasonable fact -- you know, reasonable position is one among four. It says there could be others."
2015.15-375,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3035.97,3036.49,First --
2015.15-375,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3036.49,3038.405,Maybe Marbury was a poor man.
2015.15-375,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3049.82,3050.35,"Well, it --"
2015.15-375,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.35,3054.295,"I mean, I -- I don't know. It has to be consistent with the Act."
2015.15-375,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3054.295,3059.535,Why are we suddenly picking this one thing out of what could be a bunch of things?
2015.15-375,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3059.535,3068.655,"For a number of reasons. First of all, if you look at the factors that are mentioned in Fogerty, they actually, many of them, center around objective reasonableness: Frivolousness, deterrence, motivation."
2015.15-375,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3126.84,3136.025,"If you were thinking of this solely as a policy matter, if you didn't think that that evidence was all that overwhelming, why is it that this factor should be first among equals?"
2015.15-375,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3136.025,3140.995,For the -- I think a lot of the reasons that Mr. Smith explained with respect to incentives.
2015.15-375,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3178.665,3181.66,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Rosenkranz."
2015.15-375,3,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3181.66,3192.63,"Thank you, Your Honor. So Justice Ginsburg's question, which got picked up through the course of the argument, I think really gets to the nub of the matter."
2015.15-375,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3222.185,3229.755,"But it does mean something different in practice because, as we were just told, it's unusual."
2015.15-375,3,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3238.085,3239.085,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-375,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3249.07,3262.565,"We have the -- the Second Circuit, and what was it, 50 percent of the defendants and 70 something percent, whatever, it's a much higher percentage than in -- than in patent cases."
2015.15-375,3,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3262.565,3263.8,"Agreed, Your Honor."
