2004.03-750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,6.87,"Mr. Boas, the Court will hear argument in Small against the United States."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,6.87,11.517,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,115.171,128.795,"Well, I guess we have held, though, several times that Congress meant to define very broadly when it enacted felon in possession of firearm statutes."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,129.372,131.108,"--That's... that's correct, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.646,141.844,So it makes it a tougher case when you use the word any because we've given the... the word any generally a broad definition.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,141.844,150.593,"--Well, earlier this year in the Nixon case, this Court said that when we look at any... and that was a case dealing with the meaning of any entity."
2004.03-750,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,301.058,302.378,Are there any such cases?
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,304.69,305.062,No.
2004.03-750,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,305.062,305.599,--when people... no.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,318.065,319.551,Nor have I--
2004.03-750,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,319.551,320.188,Fine.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,340.81,343.782,"--Well, 921(20) or--"
2004.03-750,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,343.782,346.177,I'm just wondering how anomalous or your anomaly is.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,347.542,353.402,"--Well, the... the limitation not only excludes antitrust offenses, it excludes any business regulatory offense."
2004.03-750,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,353.402,354.433,And are there such?
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,354.433,355.093,Of course.
2004.03-750,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,355.465,356.374,"I mean, maybe."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,356.374,356.829,--Yes.
2004.03-750,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,356.829,362.113,"I don't... I don't... but I just... are we sure that there... that, you know, that this anomaly exists?"
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,362.113,366.283,I... I'm certainly that there are business regulatory crimes throughout the world.
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.283,369.71,Why did they say any State or Federal?
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,383.949,384.588,Well--
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.588,393.609,"--because if any only means State or Federal, there was no need to say State or Federal in this provision."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,404.671,418.789,"--Well, this same limitation, Justice Scalia, existed as a limitation under 1202(a) where any court said any State or Federal court and the exclusion said any State or Federal court."
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.904,421.202,"Well, I don't care how it got there."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,434.022,439.034,"--Well, but at some point in the statute, Congress has to give an indication of their intent, and this is where it is."
2004.03-750,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.603,449.686,No.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,462.401,466.2,"Well, there has to be some indication--"
2004.03-750,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,466.2,471.939,You don't... you don't set forth the main qualification to the main definition in a... in a later subsection.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,471.939,484.942,"--Well, if we go further with 921(20), there's another limitation that again clearly deals with States, and that's the restoration of civil rights provision."
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,574.645,578.649,Would... would you concede that... that this is at least sloppy drafting?
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,587.815,602.509,"--Well, perhaps they should be more consistent, Justice Ginsburg, but the overall... I mean, if you go down the list of the prohibitions in 922(g)(1), you can see that the thrust of this is... is to deal with domestic situations."
2004.03-750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.331,620.259,"Mr. Boas, I think you make a strong argument that Congress probably didn't think of this particular problem."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,636.977,638.646,I think they would have.
2004.03-750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,645.029,646.681,"Well, there would have been a need to under your view now."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,646.681,646.864,--That's right.
2004.03-750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,654.832,666.061,"But I suppose somebody on the committee might have said, well, we don't want this kind of person to have a gun, and the fact he's convicted in Japan rather than in Brooklyn really doesn't make any difference with regard to the purpose of the statute."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,666.061,674.978,"If the individual is convicted in Japan, Justice Stevens, then he would not be under our immigration laws allowed to come to this country, and if he did come--"
2004.03-750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.978,675.887,"Well, but this person--"
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,675.887,676.547,--he'd be an illegal alien.
2004.03-750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,676.547,681.377,--But the defendant in this case was convicted in Japan and he somehow got to the United States.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,681.377,682.286,"Well, because he's an American citizen."
2004.03-750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.286,683.029,Well--
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,683.029,689.922,"So... but Congress can't cure every problem that exists in the world, and this statute is fairly comprehensive."
2004.03-750,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.922,693.06,Are people really not allowed to come in if they've been convicted of any crime?
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,693.06,695.661,Any crime that carries more than a year basically.
2004.03-750,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,696.116,703.918,Suppose it was a crime like not wearing a veil if you're a woman in a country that... suppose it was a crime like criticizing the government if you were in Soviet Russia.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,710.855,711.598,"--Well, that's--"
2004.03-750,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,711.598,714.449,--and in other countries there are... we don't let anyone in if they've done any of those things?
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,714.449,714.942,--No.
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,753.58,757.667,"Well, the... the court of appeals here said what it would... it read in a check."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,767.698,770.936,"--That's what they said, but... but when and how do we decide that?"
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.168,816.223,"Well, I think... let... let's put, you know, the worst for you."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,853.413,858.798,"Well, what I'd prefer and that the statute means aren't necessarily the same thing, Your Honor."
2004.03-750,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,865.756,868.357,"Suppose you put the question to Congress, which would you prefer?"
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,906.995,919.876,--I think Congress would say the perils and problems that exist by a blanket inclusion without any method of determining which count and which don't count of foreign convictions are too great.
2004.03-750,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,920.498,925.039,"Well, if it's a... if it's a matter of notice and... then that's a separate issue."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,932.387,936.185,"--Well, but what if it's a foreign conviction where there's no due process?"
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,951.822,958.88,May... may we go back to the... the choice that you were given by Justice Scalia first and then Justice Breyer?
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,967.691,968.146,--That's right.
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,968.146,968.889,Isn't it so?
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,977.145,977.888,That's correct.
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,977.888,979.208,--commits a crime.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,979.208,984.204,That's one of the subsections of 922(g)(5).
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,988.375,990.111,"So it doesn't cover Americans, of course--"
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,990.111,990.277,--No.
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,991.103,996.1,"--who go... go and commit crimes abroad, are convicted abroad, and... and come back to home sweet home and then get a gun."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,998.716,1000.308,--That... I didn't hear your--
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.308,1001.96,That seems to me extraordinary.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1003.446,1010.711,"--Well, I don't think Congress can be said to have intended or envisioned that they would cure every problem in the world."
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1018.762,1039.939,"I think if there was a problem that... that they were going to leave unsolved, it is less likely the problem of having an American citizen killed by a gun toted by somebody who has been convicted of a crime abroad than it is the problem of somebody having been convicted abroad of some silly crime like wearing a veil or not wearing a veil or something else."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1048.233,1054.178,"Well, Your Honor, it's unclear what... what their thought process was in this matter."
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1105.076,1106.746,Where... where is that defined?
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1106.746,1111.492,"That's defined in 921(a)(33), Your Honor."
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.218,1144.086,"Once again, that... that cuts both ways."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1162.373,1166.338,At... at some point a person has to be told what Congress was intending.
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1199.486,1201.754,"Mr. Boas, when they combined these two--"
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1201.754,1202.497,Yes.
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1202.497,1210.093,"--and ones... the 1202 did say Federal or State... they made other changes, harmonizations."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1222.371,1234.343,"The... they made no discussion of the reason for taking out the language, of the United States or of any State, and what they... the only language was that we're intending to merge these into one statute--"
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1234.343,1236.655,But they did... they did explain other things--
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1236.655,1237.232,--Yes.
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1237.232,1240.204,"--other changes, but this one... there's silence--"
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1240.204,1240.742,Exactly.
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1240.742,1241.485,--as far as I understand.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1241.485,1264.974,"And... and by keeping in the exclusions, by... by looking at 924(e)(1) where it... what's very important to me is that 924(e)(1) says if you have three prior drug... serious drug offenses in a court referred to in 922(g)(1), you get 15 years."
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1369.332,1377.521,"Let me... let me ask you the question the... the Chief Justice would ask, were he here, because he always asked this kind of a question."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1390.675,1395.793,--I'd say... that's... there's a question--
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1395.793,1396.415,It's a good question.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1397.158,1397.901,--It's a good question.
2004.03-750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.161,1420.154,--Maybe you can think--
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1420.154,1420.647,How... how about--
2004.03-750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.647,1422.133,--Maybe you can think of a unanimous case.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1422.133,1423.785,--Well--
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1424.323,1467.996,"--And this is one I'm... I'm surprised that you didn't cite, but it... I don't think you did... EEOC against Arabian American Oil Company, where the wording of the statute was anyplace outside the United States, title VII coverage, and this Court held that anyplace outside the United States did not mean that a U.S. employer operating abroad had to abide by the anti-discrimination norms with respect to hiring in some place abroad because Congress was thinking in terms of the inter-State sitting... in the setting and not international."
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1467.996,1469.482,"Well, I... I'm not familiar with that case."
2004.03-750,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1469.482,1470.847,That... that was a decision by the Chief.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1472.166,1474.273,"That's should be... that's a good one too, Judge... Justice."
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.621,1602.819,You call that FOPA?
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1606.7,1607.982,--That's right.
2004.03-750,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.121,1724.062,Recidivism is an element of the crime.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1730.477,1732.978,"--Well, that... that's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.181,1787.553,I'm sorry.
2004.03-750,0,37725,paul_d_boas,,1788.462,1788.728,--I have.
2004.03-750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1790.486,1794.589,Ms. Millett.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1794.589,1799.13,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-750,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1812.976,1813.786,You can ask it as well--
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1814.546,1826.806,"--is the Gonzales case where this Court said that the word any in the gun control law, in this context, in this framework means, read naturally... I'm quoting here."
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1851.226,1857.103,There is... there's an overarching concern and I'll... I'd like to put it to you right from the beginning.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1928.313,1933.248,"--Justice Ginsburg, this is not an extraterritorial application of a statute."
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1950.893,1951.348,"--Yes, but--"
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1951.348,1951.969,That's no more--
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1951.969,1956.094,--but let me just interrupt on your... your best case suggestion.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1965.92,1969.142,--The... the phrase convicted in any court--
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1969.142,1969.392,No.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1977.481,1980.432,--I don't... I don't have a case that specifically talks about--
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1980.432,1980.598,You don't have a case.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1980.598,1988.705,"--that yet, but if I can... if I can explain why the phrase convicted in any court... because any any court... the... the problem is you're not... there's not a case for that."
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.89,1995.459,And do they ever refer to foreign courts?
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1996.097,2003.055,"The... not... not that I'm aware of, but... but they don't... it... it doesn't address it one way or the other."
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2019.941,2030.055,"But the reason you often need qualification is there's... there's sort of basic question, does this include State courts as where as... as well as Federal, and it's often necessary to spell it out one way or the other."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2035.711,2040.17,"--Justice Stevens, if I could make two points."
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2072.779,2078.808,How many times have you used this statute to go after people who were convicted in a foreign court?
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2078.808,2081.203,It... it's... I can't give you an exact number because we--
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2081.203,2082.029,"About, approximate."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2082.029,2083.431,--we don't know about the ones that we never hear about.
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.431,2085.677,"More like 100, more like 50, more like 10, more like 5?"
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2086.366,2092.697,"It's... it's not that... I would... I would say there's probably 10 to a dozen, but I... I have to--"
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2092.697,2094.761,10 to a dozen over how long a period of time?
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2095.942,2096.973,--Since 1968.
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2098.559,2099.202,'68.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2155.939,2163.164,"Justice Breyer... and Justice Stevens, I do want to get back because I do have a lower court case that interprets any court in the way you discussed."
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2188.594,2189.559,Which was it?
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2191.399,2199.201,"--Lewis v. United States, and that is... that's really our favorite case, although we like the word of... definition Gonzales has for any."
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2223.3,2231.708,"Well, that... that example, what you gave in your brief, gave me this concern."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2294.123,2320.722,"Justice Ginsburg, in Daniels v. United States, which dealt with 924, the sentencing enhancement provision, but it has a... the parallel and incorporates 922(g)(1) convictions, this Court held... a plurality of this Court held in five opinions that... in fact, that the... the bar... or that you still count an unconstitutional or allegedly unconstitutional State conviction, even if it was never appealed and that... and there is no more opportunity for appeal."
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2325.08,2328.136,But that's... that's a question of waiver or forfeiture.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2330.448,2331.274,"Yes, but that--"
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2331.274,2341.017,"But... but there's a basic rule in civil as well as criminal procedure, that if you want to attack a judgment, you go where that judgment was rendered."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2353.111,2354.02,--And--
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2354.02,2356.909,But that... that doesn't operate internationally.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2356.909,2358.684,"--Well, it does certainly in this case."
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2364.485,2374.821,"Yes, but you're not building that into your interpretation of the statute at all because you have said in your brief... and correct me if I've got you wrong... you don't like what the Third Circuit did."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2411.212,2419.22,"--That... that's right, Justice Ginsburg, and that is... you know, the... the statute also bars receipt of firearms by anyone who's under indictment."
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2446.672,2448.092,But that's... that's standard for judgments anyway.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2484.567,2495.507,"--Well, certainly in immigration and extradition, you don't get to appeal the validity of your foreign conviction or the... the processes that led to it."
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2501.634,2513.961,"I'm asking if it's alien in our criminal justice system, not in deportation, not in... extradition is somebody who did somebody... something abroad, and we don't send people just to anyplace."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2515.092,2515.669,--Right.
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2523.349,2541.47,"Because the person is going to be tried in that other system, and we have bound... within our international system, we say we're part of a world community and we want Japan to extradite people who have done bad things here to the United States, and so similarly, we will extradite to Japan."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2553.897,2561.866,"--Although we... we do also extradite, just to serve sentences, where there may have already been a trial that could be as flawed as anyone could conceive or articulate."
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2562.238,2571.154,"--Well, we have the check already that these are... these places with whom we want to do criminal justice business together."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2572.269,2579.782,"--Well, what we have is the check that the political branches have decided that it's important to attach significance to foreign court--"
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2579.782,2586.364,"--And then we have the... we have the document where it's very clear we want to have extradition with the UK, with Japan."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2615.985,2628.823,"--In fact, in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a) which... which... inadmissibility criterion for aliens, convictions of moral turpitude, there's no reference to whether it's a conviction by a foreign court or a domestic court."
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2628.823,2636.253,"But if somebody is coming into the country, somebody is asking to come in, any conviction that you're talking about, of course, refers to someplace abroad."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2636.253,2636.419,No.
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.522,2650.381,May... may I interrupt this--
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2650.381,2650.803,"Now, surely the context--"
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.803,2653.654,"--this colloquy to raise another question, if I may?"
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2666.407,2669.09,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.885,2686.885,And how are we to decide whether such tribunal should be treated as a court within the meaning of the statute when there is no statutory definition of the term court?
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2686.885,2690.162,--Through traditional rules of statutory construction.
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2708.532,2716.334,"But if you concede that there are some tribunals that are not courts within the meaning of the statute, are you not conceding that the word court is inherently ambiguous?"
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2716.334,2722.361,I... I am... I am conceding that... that it has to be given meaning.
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2726.614,2730.163,"But it's something less than the all-inclusive term, any court, in a literal sense."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2730.163,2735.176,--Any... it has to be... it has to be a court capable of entering convictions.
2004.03-750,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2737.322,2738.808,"Well, I mean, it doesn't... it's... it's not a tennis court or an inner court."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2739.263,2740.294,--Right.
2004.03-750,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2740.294,2744.918,"If... if somebody asked where this man was convicted, they'd say in a Japanese court."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2744.918,2745.49,Right.
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2757.633,2758.376,You didn't really have a chance--
2004.03-750,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.376,2763.577,Can I assume that there's some prosecutorial discretion in the application of this statute?
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2765.063,2766.072,"Absolutely, Justice--"
2004.03-750,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2766.072,2773.131,--have you prosecuted any... any woman who tried to buy a firearm because she had been convicted of wearing... not... not wearing a veil?
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2773.131,2774.617,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-750,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2774.617,2776.269,Do you think any United States attorney would do that?
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2776.269,2777.755,"I would hope not, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-750,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.21,2780.727,Or... or somebody who was convicted of treason in Cuba?
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2789.151,2790.47,--I... I wouldn't think so.
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.842,2796.786,Do you know any cases in which we've construed a statute narrowly on the ground that we're confident the prosecutor won't bring any such cases?
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2796.786,2801.139,"--That... well, again, just last... this isn't... this isn't quite the same context."
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.98,2833.073,"But it's... it's been on the books for so long with very, very few prosecutions."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2856.745,2868.079,"And in Beecham v. United States, in Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court, this Court recognized there... it was dealing with another issue, whether the jurisdiction that restores civil rights is different from the convicting jurisdiction."
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2891.446,2891.784,Ms.--
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2891.784,2892.999,--violent assailants--
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2892.999,2905.037,"Well, Ms.... Ms. Millett, my... my problem with that argument and I guess my basic problem with... with the case is Congress did not just sort of stop when it got to the point that would support your Lewis argument."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2964.989,2973.313,"--I don't think it's strange at all, Justice Souter, and that is because that the business exception, if I can call it that, is a carve-out."
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2983.511,2985.369,"Well, it called it that, but it didn't... it didn't have this issue in front of it."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2985.369,2986.112,--That's... that's right.
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2986.112,2989.184,"I... I realize you've got the language, but it... it wasn't addressing this issue."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2989.184,2991.479,"Right, and... and the language should be what counts most."
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2993.52,2994.346,"Well, I was talking about our language."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2994.346,2994.718,--Right.
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2995.255,2996.907,But... and I think that ought to count for a lot too.
2004.03-750,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2997.463,2998.599,"Well, not too much."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2998.599,3002.685,--But what Congress was doing there was backing out.
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3020.413,3030.444,"No, but how... how familiar an example is it that price-fixers would... would be placed in... in a terrible position if they couldn't carry guns?"
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3037.603,3038.446,"Well, the problem--"
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3038.446,3053.085,"And if it can deal with a problem that is as little pressing as that, it seems odd that it would not have averted in any way to equally non-pressing problems under... under foreign convictions if that's what they had in mind."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3053.085,3053.707,--It dealt with that.
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3064.497,3064.868,All right.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3065.057,3065.883,I can't... I--
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3065.883,3066.809,--No.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3067.94,3072.005,--I can't... I'm not going to stand here and tell you that Congress specifically thought about this.
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3072.005,3072.414,"Oh, there's no--"
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3072.414,3073.407,"Right, but--"
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3073.407,3073.657,--We both know there's no--
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3073.657,3080.649,--But... but what Congress did here... and it's very important to understand... it was throwing a broad net--
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3080.649,3081.104,--Ms. Millett.
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3081.104,3081.392,--All right.
2004.03-750,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3081.392,3093.225,"Ms. Millett, there are many lawyers in Congress and at least the law students of my generation... some of them are of that elder age."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3154.953,3156.772,"--Two answers, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3174.604,3177.426,But neither did it give any explanation for not carrying it forward.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3177.426,3178.031,"--No, but I don't... that--"
2004.03-750,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3178.031,3187.607,It's... it's the silence at the... at the time it... it apparently departed from the practice of predecessor statutes that... that seems to be a problem for your argument.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3187.607,3198.587,"--But... but again, I don't think this Court has ever characterized as silence Congress' twice deletion of language from a statute in 1968 and again in 1986."
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.099,3237.74,"You know, this is a very interesting case because there are three ways to answer the question of what is a court."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3263.192,3267.157,"--I think... it's, of course, the legislature and the President's signature."
2004.03-750,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3270.024,3270.834,That would save us a lot of work.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3277.149,3286.204,"--But, Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens, the important thing to keep in mind here is we don't just have a statute that appeared out of nowhere."
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3289.071,3291.117,"No, but it is pretty clear that Congress didn't really think about this problem."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3291.117,3291.777,"--No, but it thought... it--"
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3291.777,3296.146,And it was also clear on your side that they would like to prevent this guy from having a gun.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3296.146,3296.889,"--Exactly, and--"
2004.03-750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3296.889,3300.687,"So there are two competing considerations, both of which are very powerful."
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3300.687,3305.395,"--Well, if nothing else... and this guy is squarely within what Congress wanted to capture."
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3316.995,3317.617,--Can I... I want to get you.
2004.03-750,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3318.46,3319.436,Would... would you finish... would you finish please--
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3319.436,3320.079,"Well, I have a new--"
2004.03-750,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.079,3322.491,--telling us about the administrative waiver proceeding?
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3324.06,3324.682,--That's exactly what I wanted to know.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3324.682,3324.865,--Right.
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3324.865,3326.723,And I... can I... that's exactly what I wanted to know.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3352.018,3354.33,"Well, he got... in this case, he got... and this is--"
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3354.33,3354.702,No.
2004.03-750,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3355.9,3360.746,"--You... you go and you fill out a form that says, as this case did... and it's on page 4 of our brief--"
2004.03-750,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3360.746,3361.201,Yes.
