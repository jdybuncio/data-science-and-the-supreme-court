2007.06-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.997,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-571, Watson v. United States."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,8.247,23.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Watson's receipt of a firearm in exchange for drugs does not constitute the use of that firearm as the word 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c)(1) for two principal reasons."
2007.06-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,51.167,59.165,Would you address first whether receipt of the gun constitutes possession of the gun?
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,59.165,60.523,"Yes, ma'am."
2007.06-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,69.754,76.172,"But under the statute as amended, possession is also indictable."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,76.172,80.436,Possession in furtherance of the offense is... is... would be indictable.
2007.06-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,103.207,104.364,"Well, I'm not sure."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,132.68,135.43,"I understand, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,164.841,175.602,"Mr. Koch, let's say that the parties to the transaction are concerned about avoiding exposure under the money-laundering statute, and so they got together and said: All right, we are going to have this deal."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,188.735,196.874,"I don't believe that the... that, given what the... what this Court has said in Bailey, that that would constitute active employment still."
2007.06-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,197.717,201.653,It's being actively employed as the consideration in the sale.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,201.653,204.855,"--However, the... from the standpoint--"
2007.06-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,204.855,206.791,"It's not being shot, but it's still being employed."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,206.791,207.666,"--Yes, sir."
2007.06-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,222.159,228.783,"But I think it would be a natural, grammatical construction to say he's willing to use the gun for the consideration."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,228.783,240.856,"Your Honor, I'm not certain that we would... that we... that it could be held in the absence even there of even possession... whether or not that would be enough to constitute the use."
2007.06-571,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,288.149,308.454,"Well, if we look at this transaction, a guns-for-drugs transaction, is there... can you think of any good reason why Congress would want to prescribe a 5-year penalty for the person who hands over the gun, but not any penalty for the person who receives the gun and hands over the drugs?"
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,308.454,313.874,"I do think that there are distinctions between the two conducts, sir."
2007.06-571,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,334.865,346.752,"And so that the... the risk is Congress was worried that somebody would go to a transaction like this with a gun originally intending to trade it for drugs and then when one person gets there, a person decides to shoot somebody with the gun?"
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,346.752,347.705,--I think--
2007.06-571,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,347.705,350.923,And that's why they would penalize one side of this transaction and not the other?
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,350.923,356.545,"--Well, assuming of course it would... in Smith the Court held that that is a use within the term of the statute."
2007.06-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,376.865,395.968,"In Smith, the Court said that the reason that selling the gun in exchange for drugs... what was dangerous about that was the potential for instantly converting the gun from currency to a cannon."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,410.039,416.021,"He could if the gun was handed over in a condition... first of all, there... were there bullets or not?"
2007.06-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,423.019,425.845,But it's the same on both sides.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,433.78,441.308,--I will... I will grant Your Honor there's obviously risk presented by the presence of the gun potentially by either party.
2007.06-571,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,485.119,501.205,"If the person who hands over the gun is not a government agent or informant, is there any doubt that the person who hands over the drugs can be charged with using the... the gun under 18 U.S.C. Section 2(b)?"
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,509.123,513.248,I do think that there... that's an issue that's been raised.
2007.06-571,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,549.967,553.278,"Well, you're relying on the language of 924."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,567.132,570.678,"That is what that statute says, sir."
2007.06-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,604.616,608.772,Subsection (b) is not charged in the indictment?
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,608.772,612.457,"18 U.S.C. Section 2 was what I understood the question to be, Judge."
2007.06-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,612.769,614.004,No.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,616.22,616.564,"No, sir."
2007.06-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,616.564,617.002,Section 2(b)?
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,617.002,620.047,It was not.
2007.06-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,645.584,652.409,"Mr. Koch, but the government answers that, a dollar for coffee, by saying it depends what question you ask."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,658.204,659.735,One of the problems--
2007.06-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,659.735,661.03,This is a gun transaction.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,661.03,661.608,"--Yes, ma'am."
2007.06-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,702.234,709.465,I don't remember whether you ask in your brief as an alternative argument for the overruling of Smith.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,709.465,712.136,"I did not raise that in the briefs, no, ma'am."
2007.06-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,891.159,895.922,"It has to be used by somebody, some human, and the human in this case is Mr. Watson."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,895.922,905.919,"Well, ma'am, I think under Smith the human that's using the firearm in the transaction is actually the person that came with the firearm to use it to purchase drugs."
2007.06-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.334,921.928,Excuse me.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,923.942,925.207,"I beg your pardon, Judge."
2007.06-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,997.522,998.287,Excuse me.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,998.537,999.537,"--Yes, sir."
2007.06-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.537,1013.423,Why couldn't it have been said in Smith that... that trading it for drugs was not the only way in which the offense could have been committed?
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1015.281,1028.665,"In Smith the argument, as I took it from the opinion, Justice, was that the... when one looked at, at the predicates, there were several which had, according to the opinion, only nonweapon uses."
2007.06-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.175,1050.673,"So the issue in Smith was weapon versus nonweapon, and that's not what you're arguing here?"
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1050.673,1051.626,"That's correct, sir."
2007.06-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.626,1058.686,"The issue here is use versus nonuse, active employment versus passive receipt?"
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1058.686,1059.405,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-571,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1059.405,1069.462,Why isn't it... why isn't your argument more directly that the issue here is... is nonweapon use by A versus nonweapon use by B?
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1073.632,1080.068,I agree that certainly Mr. Watson didn't use it in any weapons sense.
2007.06-571,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1082.754,1084.112,"And if you are right, that's the end of the case."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1084.112,1087.533,"I understand, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1112.289,1119.754,"But you're not... as you said before, you're not arguing for the overruling of Smith, and therefore, you concede that the other party to the transaction used the gun."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1119.754,1120.707,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-571,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1120.707,1122.081,In a nonweapon sense.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1122.081,1122.409,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.409,1124.565,I think you are making his argument.
2007.06-571,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1130.546,1132.359,It's really not a bad one.
2007.06-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1135.311,1142.759,But... but what you're saying is that all Watson did was to receive the gun.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1148.523,1149.836,Yes.
2007.06-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1149.836,1152.444,It seems to me that in that sense he used a gun.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1162.893,1172.764,"I would suggest, sir, that the agreement couldn't rise to the, to the level of active employment as that term is used in Bailey."
2007.06-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1180.012,1188.007,"He says, you get a gun, you put it in your car, you come to my house, you bring that gun with you, and I will give you drugs."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1199.175,1212.061,"--We... I would take the position that he certainly, in a situation like that where he is, he is not possessing the gun, he is expressing his intentions or desires with respect to it."
2007.06-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1225.632,1227.898,Perhaps.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1236.411,1242.126,It is correct that when he... that although he initially wanted to ask how much the gun was--
2007.06-571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1242.126,1249.343,"He agreed to let the other party to the transaction use a gun to pay for the drugs, the other party to make the use of the gun."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1249.343,1252.513,--Factually what happened was that he wanted to buy a gun.
2007.06-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1264.696,1268.881,What do you have besides the linguistic argument?
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1310.879,1311.41,Bailey.
2007.06-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.498,1333.309,"And, of course, you could say the same thing about Bailey, I suppose."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1341.228,1342.554,I guess ultimately--
2007.06-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.554,1346.943,Bailey doesn't make any more sense either from a policy standpoint.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1346.943,1348.349,--I do think--
2007.06-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.349,1350.645,"We sometimes we rely on linguistics, don't we?"
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1350.645,1351.534,"--Yes, sir."
2007.06-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1351.534,1352.862,And sometimes we try to--
2007.06-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.862,1353.487,And sometimes the words of the statute.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1353.487,1355.268,I do think--
2007.06-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1355.268,1357.376,--I don't want to put you in a whipsaw here.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1377.416,1388.317,"--I do not believe it's necessary for this Court to overrule Smith in order to rule for the Petitioner here, because of... because of the differences, first of all linguistically; and secondly because of the reliance on Bailey."
2007.06-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1388.317,1393.565,"And in answer to my question, you said you were not urging the overruling of Smith?"
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1393.565,1394.987,That's correct.
2007.06-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1431.518,1434.065,But he receives the gun and it could have been loaded.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1445.654,1452.885,"--Under Bailey, however, if all he did was receive the gun, hold it in his hand, Bailey says that's not enough, that's not a use."
2007.06-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1454.946,1459.914,"Suppose he received the gun, loaded it and said, well, now, let's renegotiate this transaction?"
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1461.429,1470.581,"As Bailey... as Bailey thought very clearly, if he then takes the gun and uses it to communicate a threat to the other party, then he is making a use."
2007.06-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1473.673,1476.078,But he doesn't brandish it.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1481.997,1492.088,"Your Honor, I believe if the jury was to find in that factual scenario that that was... that he was, in fact, silently making reference to the gun, then I think that gets you within Bailey."
2007.06-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1507.27,1514.861,"I thought Bailey involved a guy, he had the gun in a locked thing in the trunk of his car, which is a little different from holding it in your hand."
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1514.861,1519.391,"There were... there were actually two, two different fact patterns in the consolidated."
2007.06-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1530.511,1534.775,If he has a gun in his hand he is certainly carrying it.
2007.06-571,0,33886,karl_j_koch,,1534.775,1538.648,He did have the gun in his hand then he would be carrying it under Muscarello and the other cases.
2007.06-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1568.823,1569.885,"Thank you, Mr. Koch."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1574.931,1583.302,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner used the firearm by accepting it in exchange for his drugs."
2007.06-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1603.935,1607.059,But that does not answer the question use by whom.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1617.6,1620.334,"And the Petitioner did use it here, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1624.754,1633.001,"Yes, but I mean, the problem you, it seems to me you've got that you can't totally paper over is that that's not usually the way we talk."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1649.196,1659.099,"--If you buy the car, then you have used the car as an item of trade or commerce during or in relation to that commercial transaction."
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.817,1665.472,It's enough to say we don't usually talk that way.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1665.472,1666.675,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.346,1668.002,That's the end of it.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1672.749,1683.388,"--Well here, Your Honor, it's important to put it into statutory context, of course, and the statutory context asks whether or not one has used the firearm during or in relation to a drug trafficking crime, here a drug transaction."
2007.06-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1684.496,1688.869,It adds an additional element you have to prove but it doesn't answer the linguistic point.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1688.869,1696.865,--I think one can employ use in a natural way to mean receipt in the way that Petitioner used the firearm here.
2007.06-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.178,1703.878,"If you're on the other side of the transaction, it's perfectly natural to say I used the gun for the transaction."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1707.503,1712.047,I used the gun as a medium of exchange to sell my drugs.
2007.06-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1714.219,1716.327,--I didn't use the gun as a medium of exchange.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1721.481,1737.584,"--I believe in any barter transaction, Your Honor, in particular, where one side has said as they negotiate it out, I will sell you this amount of drugs for this particular firearm, then both have used the gun as the medium of exchange--"
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1737.584,1739.522,So if you have... sorry.
2007.06-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.522,1741.177,But you don't have the simple sentence.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1746.207,1748.347,--I--
2007.06-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1748.347,1752.112,I suppose you could say we used the gun in order to complete the drug transaction.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1752.112,1761.701,"--And... and the drug dealer used the gun as the medium of exchange to complete his drug sale, and I do think we do sometimes use ""use"" in that way, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.981,1770.089,"Well, let's say... let's say you have a duel, and each person in the duel needs to have a weapon."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1777.055,1779.444,Well in a--
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1779.444,1782.476,Because you can't have a duel without both people having weapons.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1782.476,1787.41,--You would have certainly used--
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1787.41,1788.455,You wouldn't say that the person--
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1788.455,1789.08,--the sword as weapon.
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1798.624,1801.92,--Each person in the drug exchange brings to the table what they've got.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1807.136,1817.835,"If he agrees to trade his drugs for the gun as the currency to close the drug transaction, I believe he has used the gun in the way that we normally use the word."
2007.06-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1817.835,1826.16,But the only way you can make that argument is to define the crime as consisting of the agreement as opposed to the consummated transaction.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1826.16,1826.91,No.
2007.06-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1834.439,1838.5,"Well, I thought you said a minute ago that he was using it because he agreed to accept it."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1838.5,1849.667,"I think one could make the argument, Justice Souter, that an agreement alone is a use once, one agrees to use the gun as the medium of exchange to sell one's drugs."
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.482,1896.554,"Why... why wouldn't making a material misstatement in order to obtain a gun constitute a use of the gun... as much as it, the receipt of the gun constitutes a use of the gun here?"
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1898.693,1903.676,"I think one could make the argument, Your Honor, as I said, that making material statement."
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.957,1905.956,Not if you believe Smith.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1905.956,1907.112,--I beg your pardon.
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.112,1908.253,Not if you believe Smith.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1908.253,1915.78,"Because... and that's why the Government is drawing the line today at actual receipt, and that's... that's all that's involved in this case."
2007.06-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1921.982,1935.584,Yes but Justice Breyer made the very persuasive argument that it doesn't make sense to treat both sides of the transaction exactly the same; but isn't it the fact that in many drug transactions the buyer is not treated the same way as the seller?
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1940.489,1942.722,"--Well, there are two points in response to that, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1951.375,1957.857,"But generally speaking buyers and sellers are not always treated alike in the criminal law, are they?"
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1957.857,1966.947,"When Congress... no that's correct, Your Honor; but in those cases where Congress uses words, like it does in the distribution statute, that clearly targets one side or other of the transaction."
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.239,2018.347,Why?
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2030.25,2038.919,"Because our reading, Justice Scalia, gives full effect to the provisions that Congress has carefully chosen to place in (D)(3) and the Petitioner's reading does not."
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.919,2039.527,What are they?
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2039.527,2040.684,And if I could explain it.
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.469,2066.422,"Involved in... that broadens that enormously, doesn't it?"
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2066.422,2069.578,"Yes it does, Your Honor; but that actually strengthens my point."
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2069.578,2071.279,It cuts the other way.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2079.355,2097.065,"Well yes, Your Honor, but if you allow me to continue on, further on in (D)(1) Congress used a narrow subset of crimes some of which include receipt crimes where it only used the word use and that's the logic to this Court's decision in Smith and it applies equally here."
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2136.268,2142.063,"It could be... it could have... it is intended to be used, not necessarily."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2169.834,2175.549,"I think if you were to interpret (d)(3) in that way, Your Honor, you would do great violence to what Congress intended."
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.31,2187.701,What page is that?
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2187.701,2191.153,"It's on the government's gray brief, 10-A."
2007.06-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.011,2237.573,This is what... this is what is bothering me about your side of this case.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2301.546,2305.56,"--I don't think that it's... several responses, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2329.255,2332.972,But those are all examples that I used the gun to pay for the item.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2337.049,2337.612,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2345.513,2355.495,"So if Congress passes a statute saying anyone who uses a gun in a crime of violence gets an additional sentence, the person who is shot is using the gun in a crime of violence?"
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2355.495,2363.991,"You wouldn't have to go that far here, Your Honor, because the ""use"" here is use as a medium of exchange."
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2379.126,2382.982,So is that a necessary element of the offense: That the transaction be negotiated in advance?
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2382.982,2387.013,"No, Your Honor, if you take it as the medium of exchange to sell your drugs."
2007.06-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2399.821,2410.503,Are you saying that the parties are viewed collectively so that in Justice Breyer's example the pitcher and the batter used a ball and a bat.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2417.97,2420.234,"In any bartering exchange, Justice Kennedy--"
2007.06-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2420.234,2424.888,"Well, does that fit with the words of the statute, any person who--"
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2424.888,2425.45,--Any person--
2007.06-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2425.45,2430.323,"--Even though it's a collective enterprise, you can still focus on one of the parties and prevail."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2431.464,2438.664,"--Well, imagine... imagine a statute that made it a crime to use United States currency during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime."
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2451.143,2454.032,I don't think... I don't see how your hypothetical advances the argument.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2465.075,2466.23,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2481.381,2482.537,"Well, that's what weakens your hypothetical."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2485.909,2492.391,"--Yes, but the Court has already held that using a gun as the medium of exchange falls within the statute."
2007.06-571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2492.391,2492.937,May I ask--
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2492.937,2500.185,"It held that the person who does use the gun, which is the natural, grammatical construction, uses the firearm."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2506.838,2517.788,"I think the rationale necessary to the holding in Smith, Your Honor, was that use of a gun as an item of trade or commerce, specifically as the medium of exchange, is the ""use""."
2007.06-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.234,2536.294,"Yes, but the argument in Justice O'Connor's opinion was largely linguistic."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2551.382,2562.753,"--I think in... in Bailey, Your Honor, the Court required a use that makes the gun an operative factor, a use that changes the circumstances where both parties are aware the gun is being used."
2007.06-571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2573.546,2583.746,"--It was... Watson possessed the gun, would you agree with that, in furtherance of the transaction?"
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2589.744,2590.728,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2591.523,2595.179,Why was it... why wasn't possession charged here?
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2595.179,2602.942,"I do not know the specific circumstances of the charging decision here, Justice Ginsburg, but in the Fifth Circuit the law was already clear that this was a use."
2007.06-571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2614.984,2626.557,"But the prosecution would certainly want to assure the success of the argument; and if this is clearly possession, why wasn't possession charged?"
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2636.865,2640.52,"--I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.781,2655.513,"Maybe they were doubtful about whether the ""possession"" thing applies here."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2668.633,2669.837,I think it's part and parcel--
2007.06-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.837,2673.303,It's hard to say it's in furtherance of the crime when the crime is over once he gets it.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2693.186,2698.403,"--Well, the Petitioner agreed with you on that, Your Honor, but four circuits have agreed with the government."
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2744.588,2747.383,"Well, I just... I don't understand the significance of the argument you just made."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2755.566,2756.957,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2765.11,2769.859,So what was your point referring to the people who were convicted under this statute... under this construction of the statute?
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2769.859,2780.963,"That it... that it is of ongoing importance to the government, even though as a prospective matter the government may be able to charge this conduct under possession and furtherance."
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2780.963,2787.273,I thought the argument you made earlier was that this may not be of particular ongoing significance because of the amendment.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2787.273,2788.897,"Right, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2881.798,2882.063,Something just occurred to me.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2896.432,2899.619,"Whose trunk is it in, Your Honor?"
2007.06-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2899.619,2908.365,"Well, they just transferred ownership in exchange for drugs with... by transferring title to a gun that was located in the... in the trunk of a car."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2908.365,2915.238,"If he has constructive possession of it, Justice Stevens, and he's... I believe he would have received it and that would be sufficient."
2007.06-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2915.238,2924.81,"So it... it was not sufficient in... in Bailey in any case, but it would be sufficient here because it played a role in the transaction?"
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2924.81,2925.404,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2925.404,2925.935,Thank you.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2925.935,2937.806,But... I mean Bailey makes examples to things that would involve an active employment including reference to a gun that... if the reference to a gun changes the circumstances of the underlying offense.
2007.06-571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2937.806,2946.662,"But... but Smith, in Smith, Justice O'Connor used the illustration turning currency into a cannon."
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,2960.328,2970.215,"That's true, Justice Ginsburg, and if the Court wanted to limit it to ""use"" means that you've actually taken possession of it because that... that's all the government is defending here."
2007.06-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3002.123,3012.885,"Is... is there any reason in such a case, if you lost this case, in the future could you not just charge, as Justice Alito said, that they're a principal in the possession by the seller?"
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3012.885,3014.728,--We... we believe--
2007.06-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3014.728,3015.978,If the government is not involved?
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3019.569,3024.146,"--There is no attempt offense under Section 924(c), Justice Breyer."
2007.06-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.13,3076.407,And so your... your practical argument then is that there has been considerable reliance on your interpretation to the extent that many people have been convicted under it.
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3076.782,3079.577,"--That I don't know, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3079.577,3079.983,About?
2007.06-571,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3080.796,3088.635,"I don't know, Your Honor, but there are six circuits on our side of the conflict and... so it... it... I don't know."
2007.06-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3093.102,3095.115,"Thank you, Ms. Maynard."
2007.06-571,2,33886,karl_j_koch,,3098.269,3098.959,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2007.06-571,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3229.423,3230.907,"--Thank you, Mr. Koch."
