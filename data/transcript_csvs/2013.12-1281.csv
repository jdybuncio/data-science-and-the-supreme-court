2013.12-1281,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.504,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-1281, the National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,8.604,10.889,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1281,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,42.51,47.231,You say -- you say that it would repudiate the constitutionality of appointments.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,54.485,62.155,"No, but they -- no, I don't, Mr. Chief Justice, but it certainly would repudiate the legitimacy of those appointments."
2013.12-1281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,62.155,62.589,Why not?
2013.12-1281,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,62.589,73.28,"How did it -- how did it affect the -- how many board decisions will have to be redone, or how did -- how is the board coping with that problem?"
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,73.28,82.902,"Well, there are many dozens of board decisions and, perhaps, many hundreds of board decisions that are under a cloud as a result of the D.C. Circuit's ruling in this case."
2013.12-1281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,108.283,116.473,"What would happen, under the reasoning of this case, what would happen to the decisions of recess-appointed judges?"
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,116.473,117.506,"--Well, I think that--"
2013.12-1281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,117.506,119.091,Of which there's been quite a few.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,119.091,128.281,"--I think that would be a very serious question, Justice Sotomayor, and I think it does point up the -- the difficulty with the position Respondent is urging."
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.281,131.916,"Well, surely, you would -- you would argue the de facto officer doctrine."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,131.916,132.783,"Yes, we would."
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.783,133.851,Of course you would.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,133.851,134.468,"Yes, we would."
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.468,136.803,And we've applied that in innumerable cases.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,140.339,145.558,"Well, I would certainly hope not, Your Honor, but it certainly casts a serious cloud over the legitimacy of all of those actions."
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.614,164.97,"You started off by saying, you know, it would -- it would repudiate so many actions that have been taken."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,198.193,202.411,"Now, I think the practice has to prevail, Your Honor, but I do -- and I--"
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.411,204.43,So if you ignore the Constitution--
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,204.43,205.813,--But I don't think--
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.813,208.149,"--often enough, its meaning changes?"
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,208.149,219.356,"--But, Your Honor, of course, in this situation, the meaning of the clause with respect to the timing of -- of the vacancy has been a matter of contention since the first days of the Republic."
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.356,220.639,"Now, you're -- you're questioning my hypothesis."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,222.558,224.76,"Well, I think I've answered the question accepting your hypothesis, but I think--"
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,224.76,227.443,Let's assume that the text is clearly against you.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,241.303,245.255,"--Well, the practice has started with George Washington, and it has worked through the--"
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,245.255,245.84,Yes or no?
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,245.84,248.19,--I think -- I think I've already answered that.
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,248.19,248.876,Does the practice prevail over the clear text--
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,248.876,252.761,The practice gives meaning to the -- the practice gives meaning to the Constitution--
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.761,255.196,--You're questioning my -- my hypothesis again.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,255.196,255.563,--No--
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,255.563,262.466,I am assuming a clear text of the Constitution and a practice that is -- is contrary to it.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,262.466,265.585,--It's extremely unlikely that would arise if the text were so free of doubt.
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.087,267.603,You do not want to answer my hypothesis.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,267.603,268.187,"--No, I am -- I am answering."
2013.12-1281,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,286.415,287.934,"Well, let me ask you about the premise."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,328.344,335.248,"But the word “ happens ” may not always be an apt phrase, the phrase “ may happen ”, the constitutional phrase, but it is a natural use."
2013.12-1281,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,374.973,379.611,"General Verrilli, we've taken you off your starting point."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,429.708,434.446,--So I think I have two points to make in response to the question of what to do.
2013.12-1281,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,494.234,503.173,"Well, of course, Justice Ginsburg's question points out that your argument is, it seems to me, in search of a limiting principle."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,513.981,518.2,I think the -- the way we resolve that problem is by looking to the Adjournment Clause.
2013.12-1281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,532.525,533.111,Is that 3 days?
2013.12-1281,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,533.111,535.161,"And what about the pro forma sessions, then?"
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,540.781,548.204,"--Well, but the problem with the pro forma sessions, I think, Justice Kennedy, is in thinking about the length of the recess."
2013.12-1281,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,566.965,571.317,So -- so you think there's no recess during pro forma sessions?
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,571.317,572.667,--There is a recess.
2013.12-1281,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,579.087,581.939,"Well, let's just talk -- let's focus on that."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,595.015,602.436,"--I think that it's a -- that's a different case and I think, concededly, a significantly harder case for the Executive because here--"
2013.12-1281,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,602.436,602.602,Yeah.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,612.225,614.025,"--Well, I think it is significant, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-1281,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,641.994,652.367,"General, I think you're -- you're not answering the real thrust of the Chief Justice's question, which is that we could just be back here if we -- if we said, well, they didn't phrase this in the right way."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,668.811,679.769,"--I think there has to be a limit to that point, Justice Kagan, because, after all, what we're talking about here is a power that the Constitution gives to the President, the power in Article II."
2013.12-1281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,682.721,683.071,But why?
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,695.545,695.929,Sure.
2013.12-1281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,696.812,698.914,"And -- and to work every day, which--"
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,698.914,699.764,That's true.
2013.12-1281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,699.764,700.782,--lots of people do.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,700.782,701.532,That's true.
2013.12-1281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,704.184,704.7,So--
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,704.7,705.334,That's absolutely true.
2013.12-1281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,708.786,713.84,"So what do you say about the Twentieth Amendment, which says that that January 3rd was a meeting?"
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,724.131,724.714,--Yes.
2013.12-1281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,724.714,725.398,And they haven't.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,746.994,755.767,I think our view is that it's hard to see how the -- what the -- what the Senate did with pro forma sessions complies with either and--
2013.12-1281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,755.767,756.1,Okay.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,796.277,798.762,"--Or there is another option, Justice Breyer."
2013.12-1281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,798.762,805.332,"Would you write that opinion, saying the Senate of the United States has violated two -- two provisions of the Constitution?"
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,805.332,805.682,"No, no."
2013.12-1281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.115,807.365,All right.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,807.865,816.554,"Because you might, perhaps, give the Senate some deference with respect to requirements that apply only internally to the Congress."
2013.12-1281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,826.693,829.294,"Would it -- would it -- I mean, that's my basic question really."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,834.098,834.348,--So why--
2013.12-1281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,834.348,838.4,"What my really basic question is why is this an important case, in your opinion?"
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,900.474,908.413,--So it's important for multiple reasons with respect to practicalities and fundamental questions of constitutional structure.
2013.12-1281,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,983.143,992.082,"General, would you agree that this clause now is not mostly used to deal with emergencies arising from congressional absence?"
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1037.946,1040.08,"Well, two answers."
2013.12-1281,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1048.268,1053.139,"Yes, as a result of congressional refusal, not as a result of congressional action."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1053.139,1071.601,"And that gets to the second point, which is that it may be true as a matter of raw power that the Senate has the ability to sit on nominations for months and years at a time, but that is 100 miles from what the Framers would have expected."
2013.12-1281,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1092.78,1101.703,"But you are making a very, very aggressive argument in favor of executive power now and it has nothing whatsoever to do with whether the Senate is in session or not."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1118.165,1126.254,"Well, I do -- I think this -- I think the recess power may now act as a safety valve given that intransigence, and that is actually quite consistent--"
2013.12-1281,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1126.254,1132.075,"But it isn't -- it isn't tied then to the availability of the Congress, availability of the Senate."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1184.473,1190.711,"--So let me take a half a step back, if I could, Justice Ginsburg, and answer that question in this way."
2013.12-1281,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1242.812,1251.335,"But the compromise they settled on in moving away from that is that the President will nominate and the Senate, if it so chooses, can confirm a nominee."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1273.348,1286.158,"Well, but those things -- there are often situations in which the Senate is not in session when a vacancy becomes open or needs to be filled, I guess would be the more accurate way to say it."
2013.12-1281,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1311.14,1324.7,"Well, if the Senate has -- the Congress and the Executive have come together to address those sorts of problems in a vast number of cases by providing that there can be an acting general counsel of the NLRB to deal with that situation."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1324.7,1332.22,"--Well, actually, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to multi-member boards, the Vacancy Act doesn't cover them."
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.344,1346.979,"Well, let's -- let's go to that 1948 emergency, the secretary of labor."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1372.114,1375.399,"That's true, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.066,1377.168,So what's the problem?
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1384.171,1394.71,"--Well, I think it seems to me the Framers made a different judgment, because they gave the President both the power to call back in extraordinary circumstances and the recess appointment power."
2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1401.716,1414.458,"Yes, but my only point is what -- what the recess appointment power consists of cannot be determined on the basis that, well, there are going to be terrible emergencies, so it must enable the President to do this or that."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1422.796,1437.989,"--So, what I would say about this, and also to your point, Mr. Chief Justice, is we have, I would submit, a stable equilibrium that has emerged over the course of this country's history between the two branches."
2013.12-1281,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1457.751,1464.455,"General, I think that's a really strong argument, but I have to say I'm not sure it applies consistently throughout each of the three claims that you make."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1509.92,1529.666,"--Well, winning on questions 1 and 2 would be of great importance to the Executive, but we also should win on question 3, and here's why: There isn't a long history reflecting equilibrium with respect to the use of pro forma sessions in order to restrict the President's ability to use the recess appointment power."
2013.12-1281,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1539.939,1543.324,"Well, there's no practice -- there is no long practice of doing it."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1563.82,1564.787,"No, we don't."
2013.12-1281,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1597.377,1609.851,"But it seems -- it seems to me that we're searching here for a proper interpretation of the word “ session ”, which, after all, is in the provision that we are looking at."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1667.205,1676.644,--I don't think that that's an interpretation that really can be squared with the body of contemporaneous evidence from the time of the framing.
2013.12-1281,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1726.743,1728.009,But where does this 3-day rule--
2013.12-1281,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1728.009,1729.443,But you are relying on adjournment.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1733.497,1734.897,"No, that's right."
2013.12-1281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1746.453,1751.857,"--If it means the same thing, then you are tying the two together, which actually might have some validity."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1763.747,1772.186,"No, I don't think so, because the dictionary definition then and now of recess is a suspension of business."
2013.12-1281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1782.794,1785.011,Can you have an adjournment without a suspension of business?
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1788.115,1792.334,"--Well, I'm just talking now, Justice Sotomayor, if I may, about the intra-session recess point."
2013.12-1281,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1792.334,1794.036,But I'm talking about tying the two together.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1794.036,1809.295,"Right, but with respect to -- putting the pro forma issue aside for a second, with respect to intra-session recesses, the meaning of the “ session ”, it seems to me, is the session, the full session, because you can have -- you can have recesses by adjournment, as Jefferson's parliamentary manual said."
2013.12-1281,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1830.975,1831.308,"Well, where is this--"
2013.12-1281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1831.308,1843.383,"The most surprising thing to me that you have said, and it's important, is not just the view of language at the time of the framing, but what the purpose of this clause was."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1850.137,1850.853,Okay.
2013.12-1281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1850.853,1865.396,"I cannot find anything, so far, and I may have missed it -- I'm asking -- I can't find anything that says the purpose of this clause has anything at all to do with political fights between Congress and the President."

2013.12-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.616,2081.718,But his death happened in 1941.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2081.718,2085.853,--But the fact that “ may happen ” is a phrase that isn't always apt to describe an enduring state.

2013.12-1281,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2138.486,2153.428,"One reason they could have put the language in is because they were afraid otherwise the president would have the power, simply, when somebody died two or three years before and they've had a big fight in Congress to save up all the controversial nominations and then put them through as recess appointments."

2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2195.574,2198.359,And we don't disagree with that.

2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2234.963,2239.951,And so we do have that very established practice that is completely in accord with the purpose and the structure.

2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2268.786,2270.953,I think that's a way harder case for us.
2013.12-1281,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2289.032,2303.708,"Suppose it was -- suppose it was the exact same no-business order, but the single senator who was there got up and asked for unanimous consent to name a post office, and every three days, he got up and said unanimous consent to name a post office."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2312.428,2320.251,"Well, I think if they did business each of the three days, then you wouldn't have a situation in which no business was conducted and you wouldn't meet the definition of a recess."
2013.12-1281,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2321.601,2329.373,"But that, again, suggests that the rule that you're asking us to establish is -- is so easy to evade that why bother establishing it at all."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2337.963,2344.632,"No, I think the problem with looking at it that way, Justice Kagan, is that that's the end of the recess appointment power."
2013.12-1281,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2357.457,2358.524,I totally take your point on that.
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2368.915,2369.765,"--Well, this does."
2013.12-1281,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2389.426,2392.444,"--Well, what is significant is whether they're available to confirm nominees; isn't that right?"
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2392.444,2392.927,Yes.
2013.12-1281,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2392.927,2398.098,"So suppose they say, instead of no business will be conducted, no nominations will be considered."
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2398.098,2400.564,That would be a different case because they would be--

2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2401.983,2402.75,--they would be there -- they would be here.
2013.12-1281,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2405.268,2405.552,--So what?
2013.12-1281,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2417.576,2423.33,"It's not, because the recess -- or the definition of recess is when no business shall be conducted."

2013.12-1281,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2818.148,2820.767,Is it because of the 80 years or?
2013.12-1281,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2820.767,2822.952,--I think it's longer than that.

2013.12-1281,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2919.93,2923.151,Let me address it this way.
2013.12-1281,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2975.433,2986.558,What happened in that period at around 1970 is that's about the first time that you have intra-session -- an intra-session recess that's longer than an inter-session recess.

2013.12-1281,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3074.263,3075.865,What if I do place more weight on this?
2013.12-1281,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3121.144,3121.594,Right.

2013.12-1281,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3380.762,3394.588,"Well, before you do so, I mean, is the Senate's power, in your view, so comprehensive that if they passed an order saying, we're actually never in recess, people can be reached, you know, we can call people back."
2013.12-1281,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3398.64,3408.764,"--Your Honor, under the first question presented, I think the answer is, yes, they could do that, because it really is the Senate's ability to trigger the power."

2013.12-1281,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3935.362,3940.848,"--And, yes, Your Honor, but in addition, though, there -- there is not just the word “ happen ”."
2013.12-1281,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3953.84,3978.456,"Well, the Constitution as it -- as it first was has now been amended and it is no longer a part of the Constitution, with reference to appointment of Senate, uses the word “ vacancy ” in much the same way as the clause we're discussing here, and I think favors your position, because if a vacancy happens by resignation during the recess of the legislature then the governor can make the appointment."
2013.12-1281,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3981.742,3982.975,"Exactly, Your Honor--"
2013.12-1281,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3982.975,3984.944,--occur over -- I should say occur over 3 days.
2013.12-1281,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3984.944,4001.237,"--And -- and it's even better than that because at the time of the framing, a legislator -- a governor tried to appoint somebody to the Senate pursuant to the clause that had arisen -- where the vacancy had arisen during the legislative session rather than during the legislative recess, and the Senators actually refused to seat that individual."
2013.12-1281,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4003.923,4010.177,"Do you want to say anything before the -- about the -- the language on the “ happen ”, I support you."
2013.12-1281,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4032.092,4032.942,And Your Honor--
2013.12-1281,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4032.942,4033.625,What do you want to say about that?
2013.12-1281,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4033.625,4035.46,--That's a consequence of advice and consent.
2013.12-1281,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4172.349,4175.301,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5126.615,5130.316,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-1281,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5193.24,5198.478,"Well, if we agree with you on the first question, then there either needs to either be a number or a functional test."
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5205.215,5210.285,"We think the number should be -- should be the number in the Adjournments Clause, 3 days or less."
2013.12-1281,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5217.441,5224.361,"With respect to the presence of that in the Adjournments Clause but the absence of any number in the Recess Appointments Clause, how do you explain that?"
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5224.361,5230.765,"--Well, I think that there isn't really a need for explanation."
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5276.563,5283.217,"Can you argue that the Senate sort of acquiesced in that and everybody's come together, but what would expect a Senator to do?"
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5283.217,5285.167,"Well, if they--"
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5285.167,5293.523,"You know, the president appoints somebody during a recess contrary to the Respondent's view, what's the Senator who objects to that supposed to do?"
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5293.523,5296.708,"--Well, a couple of things about that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5325.544,5326.61,"Well, you would object to that, wouldn't you?"
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5326.61,5326.943,Of course.
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5326.943,5328.876,On the same grounds that you're objecting here.
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5328.876,5329.426,"Well, we would."
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5330.078,5332.278,"Well, then that's not something that is effective for the--"
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5332.278,5332.93,--But in terms of--
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5332.93,5334.097,--you think it's unconstitutional.
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5334.097,5340.601,"--In terms of an expression of their disagreement as opposed to acquiescence it would certainly be a question of disagreement, and it didn't happen."
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5340.601,5347.373,"Well, the Senate says we don't agree with the recess appointment, and you say, well, it's too bad, the appointee is still in office."
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5347.373,5350.741,"But they didn't, I guess, would be, or the point being--"
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5350.741,5352.158,"Well, some did -- Senator Byrd--"
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5352.158,5352.625,--senators--
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5352.625,5355.46,--famously objected to the president's assertion of that power.
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5355.46,5364.749,"--Yeah, but he famously objected to it, Mr. Chief Justice, by saying that the intra-session recess ought to be 30 days or longer, not that intra-session recesses are inappropriate as a matter of constitutional power."
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5371.055,5372.555,"No, I just want to make sure I understand."
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5375.357,5381.095,"--Well, the Senator who objects can say whatever the Senator wants, but we don't have a historical record of objection."
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5383.28,5388.6,"But suppose the Senator says, Look, I object to that, I think it's unconstitutional, but I'm not going to -- what can I do?"
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5396.436,5403.859,"Well, if the Congress as a body thought that these were inappropriate they could take legislative action to try to limit the president's authority, and they just, they never have."
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5403.859,5406.478,--But would you say that action would be totally ineffective?
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5406.478,5419.818,"Well, we'd agree on the -- we'd certainly agree on the criminalizing point, but in terms of the Pay Act, for example, they just never in all their -- in their original consideration of the Pay Act and subsequently, they never tried to address this."
2013.12-1281,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5420.868,5424.772,"But people object all the time to things that in fact they can't do anything about, right?"
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5424.772,5429.924,"--And, yes, Your Honor, and of course -- and that's an individual objecting and it's not the Senate objecting."
2013.12-1281,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5429.924,5431.609,The question of reports.
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5438.197,5438.949,Take a few more minutes.
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5440.415,5441.901,"I was thinking the same thing, Your Honor."
2013.12-1281,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5484.744,5495.201,"Yeah, but I'm focusing on 30 days and the reason I'm doing that is this seems to me, hypothetically at least, a real matter for the political branches to resolve among themselves."
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5506.843,5507.226,--I guess what I--
2013.12-1281,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5507.226,5508.543,So I want to get your view on that.
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5508.543,5509.159,"--Yes, of course."
2013.12-1281,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5523.969,5524.888,"Well, that was that Senate."
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5531.992,5536.362,--That is an expression of the law of the United States that the Congress enacted.
2013.12-1281,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5536.362,5543.699,"I'm really interested in how you think the 30-day idea, if practical, plays out in terms of your concerns."
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5543.699,5551.555,"Well, I think it, as I said, I think there is an equilibrium here and the 30 days doesn't fully capture it."
2013.12-1281,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5554.074,5554.407,Briefly.
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5554.407,5554.807,Briefly.
2013.12-1281,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5554.807,5557.109,"Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, briefly."
2013.12-1281,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5611.711,5612.411,"Thank you, General."
