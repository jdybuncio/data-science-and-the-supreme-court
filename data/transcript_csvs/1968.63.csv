1968.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.577,"Number 63, Nellie Hunter, appellant versus Edward O. Erickson, Mayor of the City of Akron, et al."
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,18.12,21.326,If the Court please.
1968.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,180.953,184.499,"What number of signatures were required for it, initially?"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,184.499,201.095,"It's 7% of the electorate vote so that it varies from time to time but in any event, the City Council indicated that the requisite number of signatures had been secured and placed it on the ballot."
1968.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,201.095,205.773,Was there a large number of votes Mr. Carter in election itself?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,205.773,212.723,"In the election itself, I think that there were about 100,000 votes."
1968.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,212.761,214.716,What proportion is that on?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,214.716,216.493,With that I don't know.
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,323.782,327.818,"Mr. Carter the law was suspended by the charter provision, I gather."
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,327.818,328.398,"Yes, sir."
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,328.398,335.222,And then how would it have been -- would it have -- could it have been approved with the City Council.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,342.913,345.097,It could've been done either way.
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,364.945,370.585,"There was no -- in the charter amendment, there was no automatic provision for getting it on the ballot?"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,370.585,371.263,"No, sir."
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,381.522,383.56,Has it ever been put on the ballot?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,383.56,388.055,The last -- this past election was put on the ballot.
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.055,389.287,How was it put on?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,389.287,391.406,It was put on by the City Council?
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.406,392.075,By what?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,392.075,392.999,By the City Council.
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,392.999,394.117,And did it pass?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,394.117,394.991,"No, it did not."
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.991,396.62,"Now, what was the vote on?"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,396.62,397.633,It was a close vote.
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,401.939,403.615,Was it to be identical or --
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,403.615,404.56,Yes.
1968.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,417.83,419.65,It was to keep or repeal?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,419.65,420.838,Keep or repeal.
1968.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,420.838,421.809,137?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,421.809,422.647,137.
1968.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,422.647,426.976,"Then the open housing ordinance itself has not been voted on, is that it?"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,426.976,434.182,"No, the open housing ordinance -- what the effect of repealing of 137 would be to resurrect."
1968.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,434.182,450.159,"Well, what I'm trying to get at is -- I gather if 137 is constitutional and valid then the only way the open housing ordinance can ever become operative is that it go on the ballot to be approved under 137 and that is not what was submitted at this past election."
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,450.159,450.939,Which I understand.
1968.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.939,452.538,"Well, has it ever been submitted?"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,452.538,457.614,The -- the city housing ordinance has not been submitted to the voters.
1968.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,461.988,463.742,"Well, the repealer of 137."
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,463.742,464.371,"Yes, sir."
1968.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,464.371,467.202,But may I get back to Mr. Justice White asked you earlier?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,467.202,467.944,Sure.
1968.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,467.944,473.949,"Now, how do you get under 137 the open housing ordinance to a vote?"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,473.949,495.424,You get the open housing ordinance to a vote by having the City Council re-pass the law and then it's submitted within 30 days by referendum and it's placed on the ballot at a general or regular general election which then this process requires 10% of the voters to act.
1968.63,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,511.269,528.476,"Now, does she have a -- does petitioner here have a -- an appellant here have a remedy under a state law that was passed subsequent to the events of this litigation?"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,528.476,531.771,"There is a -- no, sir."
1968.63,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,533.816,536.055,When was that enacted?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,536.055,544.174,The state -- all I can concert sir is that the law was enacted subsequent to the institution of this case.
1968.63,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,545.931,556.48,"October 30, 19 -- effective October 30, 1965, there was a state law enacted that was some time after the institution of this litigation."
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,566.474,569.653,That I can approach it in several angles.
1968.63,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,628.277,629.082,Mr. Carter.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,629.082,630.615,-- or fair housing legislation.
1968.63,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,630.615,631.591,"Excuse me, Mr. Carter, but --"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,631.591,632.908,Sure.
1968.63,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,632.908,656.747,-- your adversary on page 2 of his brief says that the Ohio Code was amended to make unlawful certain discriminatory practices in both commercial and residential property and to provide the Ohio Civil Rights Commission with the enforcement powers.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,675.396,677.893,My -- my contention is that it does not.
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,727.589,735.167,Well would the appellant have ever remedy either one of the 1966 statute or 1968?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,735.167,736.289,The appellant would --
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.289,738.793,Notwithstanding the Court.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,738.793,761.189,"The appellant would have a remedy under the -- a general remedy under the 1982, under Jones versus Mayer but they would not have the remedy of the Government administrative machinery which is provided by this ordinance plus the fact that --"
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.189,764.544,"You mean, you wouldn't have the 1968 statute --"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,764.544,771.704,The 1968 statute does not apply to this kind of housing at this time.
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.704,774.438,But you would have under 1982.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,774.438,804.456,"It should have a general remedy which I think that this Court indicated in Jones versus Mayer Company that even though the 1968 Act provided administrative machinery that as a matter of fact, the -- it's the 1866 law did not displace it because of the fact that it was a general remedy which -- and this -- what this provided was administrative machinery to effectuate the right which had been granted."
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,928.223,944.741,"Mr. Carter, as I had understood your argument, it would -- you would be making substantially the same attack on Section 137 whether or not there had previously been any fair housing legislation enacted, would you not?"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,944.741,945.795,I think so.
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,945.795,946.498,I think so.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,947.591,950.354,I think so.
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,959.727,961.004,Without a housing history.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,961.004,972.686,All it would mean would be of course under the circumstances that I would not be able to show that the group had been succeeded in getting a fair housing legislation through the City Council.
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,972.686,978.878,"But that really doesn't affect the -- your basic constitutional attack on 137, does it?"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,978.878,986.477,"Well, the only thing I do say is that the issue, it does seem to me that may sharpen up the issue somewhat."
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1012.76,1015.159,"As I understand your argument, it's really a different issue."
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1017.221,1018.139,"Oh, I think it is."
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1033.818,1034.804,"Well, --"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1034.804,1035.811,-- than Reitman versus Mulkey.
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1036.795,1053.282,"Four members of the Court dissented Reitman against Mulkey and it may be that if your argument had addressed itself to the point that this may be a different case, it might help you."
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1053.282,1054.592,Well --
1968.63,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1054.592,1057.72,You'd like to have five anyway wouldn't you?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1057.72,1058.758,I didn't hear it.
1968.63,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1058.758,1060.917,You'd like to have five anyway.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1060.917,1061.912,I didn't hear you sir.
1968.63,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1061.912,1065.023,You'd like to have five members of this Court anyway.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1065.023,1069.903,"Well, I certainly would under any combination."
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1069.903,1084.692,"Mr. Carter, do I understand correctly that the Akron charter also provides that before any tax ordinance can be enacted that there has to be a vote of the people?"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1084.692,1089.883,The respondent raises that on the theory --
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1089.883,1090.676,You raise it.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1101.216,1102.482,I agree.
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.482,1104.059,Is that the law?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1104.059,1104.765,I beg your pardon?
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.765,1105.758,Is that the law?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1105.758,1111.85,"No, that -- I don't believe that that can even make -- can sustain that exception."
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1240.352,1258.242,Am I also right in my understanding Mr. Carter that any ordinance passed by the City Council of Akron unless it's an emergency ordinance which requires more than a simple majority but that any ordinance passed is subject to a referendum?
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1258.242,1260.108,Any ordinance that is passed is --
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1260.108,1262.175,That does not have an emergency clause.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1262.175,1267.232,Any ordinance that is passed is subject to a referendum.
1968.63,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.232,1270.24,But only if it's put to referendum by initiative.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1270.24,1270.785,"Oh, yes."
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1275.299,1276.394,But anybody can --
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1276.394,1277.839,And if they get the --
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1277.839,1279.859,-- the adequate number of people can.
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1279.859,1298.074,But this also does not meet the problem because of the fact that the initiative and referendum of any ordinance need not be at a general or regular or general election which is required by 137.
1968.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1348.878,1352.276,"What part of the Fourteenth Amendment were you relying upon, the Equal Protection Clause?"
1968.63,0,38936,robert_l_carter,,1352.276,1356.886,"Equal Protection Clause, yes."
1968.63,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1740.982,1744.623,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3012.666,3022.459,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, counsel."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3203.683,3214.149,Does the record before us show -- does the record before us show that Mrs. Hunter lives -- now lives in Chicago?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3214.149,3217.105,"Well, I'll grant you."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3233.547,3236.77,"Well, I have problems about that."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3236.77,3237.626,I beg your pardon?
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3237.626,3242.96,As I have problems about going outside of the record or something of that sort.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3242.96,3244.163,"Sorry, I didn't mean to --"
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3244.163,3255.673,"Well, you're in distinguished company Mr. Vinopal, I think in -- by the justices of this Court yesterday in a very analogous situation pointed out that the --"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3255.673,3255.831,Thank you.
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3255.831,3260.946,-- petitioner had moved away from Arkansas and relied on the newspaper article.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3260.946,3265.648,No intention to offend the Court or counsel.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3634.234,3640.168,"Well, is that when you decided to pass 137?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3640.168,3663.142,That wasn't decided Your Honor until March of 1965 so we passed 137 in August of 1964 right within 25 days after the fair housing ordinance went on.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3663.142,3666.089,Why was it passed?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3666.089,3678.248,"Well, my own judgment as to why I think it was passed is first of all, we start with a proposition that we don't have to have fair housing ordinance in Akron, that's number one."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3678.248,3687.305,"And wasn't it subject to initiative and referendum of the ordinance, the original fair housing ordinance?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3687.305,3691.286,If fair housing ordinance was passed as an emergency ordinance so that would remove --
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3691.286,3694.045,It could be attacked by initiative and referendum then?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3694.045,3696.268,"No, it have to be attacked by initiative."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3696.268,3699.494,"Well, it could be attacked by initiative."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3699.494,3700.36,"Well, --"
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3700.36,3702.519,"In other words, you could do one or two things."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3709.388,3709.518,Yes.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3709.518,3710.281,-- wouldn't be difficult.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3710.281,3711.051,Which we did.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3711.051,3712.678,"So, you took the easy way."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3712.678,3718.941,"Well, in a sense I think we've been afforded the proponents of fair housing when I come to that, I'll tell you why."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3722.306,3725.658,"Well, if it benefited Mrs. Hunter, why is she here complaining?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3725.658,3740.769,"Well, because I -- well, benefited her in the political process that were involved in this particular activity, that's what I mean and I will come to that."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3741.98,3746.489,Can I ask you before you go to another point?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3746.489,3746.958,Yes.
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3746.958,3761.877,"Is there anywhere -- is the affidavit referred to in the complaint which appellant filed with the Commission with the mayor and the members of the Commission, is that affidavit in the record?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3761.877,3762.833,"That's in the record, Your Honor."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3766.626,3766.909,I see.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3768.952,3785.568,"Well, it's in there and by the way, there are certain, one or two sections of the charter which I intend to refer to which are not in the printed record but they are in the original record copies of which were furnished to state court by our office, I know."
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3818.922,3824.555,And that took 7% to put it on the ballot?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3824.555,3829.465,"No, you see we have a procedure where the council themselves put it on the ballot."
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3835.886,3836.83,"Well, the council did."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3836.83,3837.73,Yes.
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3842.349,3842.742,Yes.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3842.742,3848.764,-- to put all ordinances that they -- any charter amendments which they desire on the ballot themselves.
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3848.764,3851.846,"Now, just let me, just so that I may understand what happened here."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3857.596,3858.789,Yes.
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3858.789,3865.301,And then you are telling us that and passed each as an emergency ordinance which may each not subject to a referendum.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3865.301,3866.418,Yes.
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3866.418,3874.216,And then you're saying that council thereafter submitted that the voters of Section 137 as an amendment to the Akron city charter?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3874.216,3876.105,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3877.659,3878.517,You confused me.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3878.517,3880.143,"Yes, I'm sorry."
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3887.786,3888.239,"Right, --"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3888.239,3888.636,Yes.
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3888.636,3890.16,-- and what percentage of the registered voters --?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3890.16,3890.953,7%.
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3890.953,3892.291,"7%, that's what I thought."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3892.291,3892.894,Yes.
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3892.894,3902.289,"What is the -- since I've already interrupted you, what is the population of Akron and what is the usual, the average number of registered voters in an election?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3902.289,3911.032,"The county voters are 200,000. I think the city voters are somewhere on 150 to 170,000."
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3911.032,3912.721,"Population is about 300,000?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3912.721,3915.497,"Yes, 300,000 or somewhere at 350."
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3915.497,3919.089,What percentage is the population of Negro approximately?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3919.089,3923.774,I think we have 11%.
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3923.774,3928.986,Thank you.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,3928.986,3987.622,"Well, then we come along to January of 1965 at which time Nellie Hunter filed this complaint and following that, there had been again activity instituted in the state legislator whereby in March of 1965, the state fair housing bill was enacted and I think just as a casual personal observation as to why it didn't get enacted in 1963 is because someone who has hazily done after this report and someone wanted to put it in with health welfare and morals in that part of the code and it was batched up and so it come back the next time that the legislator met and they passed it quite readily under the Civil Rights Commission section."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4086.34,4099.278,"Well, the problem -- I'm really in trouble because there's it seems to me a difference of opinion between you and Mr. Carter as to whether the state law does cover this."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4118.243,4118.795,"Your Honor, I --"
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4118.795,4121.892,But I am troubled by that difference.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4121.892,4124.883,"On page 13 of my brief, I have it set out."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4124.883,4125.538,"Oh, you do."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4125.538,4126.051,Yes.
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4126.051,4126.728,Thank you.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4126.728,4138.139,"Now, I do want to say that the state law doesn't cover the sale and rental of private property between and A and B."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4140.608,4143.658,But does the state law covers this complaint.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4143.658,4146.14,"Yes, in my opinion, it certainly does."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4146.14,4151.616,What section of the state law?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4151.616,4167.192,That would be Section -- under 4112.02.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4167.192,4167.64,Where is that?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4167.64,4171.069,Page 11 of my brief.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4171.069,4172.786,Page 11.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4172.786,4174.29,Yes.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4200.732,4205.257,"Is it print, publish, circulate etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4212.005,4226.221,"Well, from the complaint that I gather, there was a circulated and implied that there were certain properties for sale and then when it come time to show with this lady, they were --"
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4226.221,4235.166,Do you -- would I be safe in saying that if there is a question as to whether that the state law covers this?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4235.166,4237.935,I -- I'm not doubtful about it.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4245.611,4248.842,"No but I mean, that it's covered by the state law."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4248.842,4250.623,"I think it does, her complaint."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4250.623,4254.98,Do you think there's some question and it's not covered by the state law?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4254.98,4255.168,No.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4255.168,4256.405,Do you recognize that?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4256.405,4258.467,"No, I do not."
1968.63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4264.285,4267.997,Did your state court say whether it did or didn't cover it?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4267.997,4280.459,"No, of course, the state court of course all we dealt with there is whether or not the state court had a right that this a regulation and that the state court had -- that the people of Akron had the right to vote."
1968.63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4280.459,4287.272,"Well, isn't it a matter of state law whether or not the state statute covers this complaint?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4287.272,4288.995,Yes.
1968.63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4288.995,4291.333,"Well, how we can't resolve that question?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4291.333,4296.973,"Well, in this case, the question of that problem never was raised in the state court."
1968.63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4296.973,4300.619,"Well, but the point is, it's an issue at all we can't decide, can we?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4300.619,4303.76,"No, I don't think."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4303.76,4314.943,But there is not question that that complaint would come before the Commission if the Commission had been in existence and if 137 had not been adopted.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4314.943,4315.883,Yes.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4315.883,4316.537,No question.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4316.537,4317.876,"Yes, that's right."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4317.876,4334.665,"And the Commission might have, since you say that such a wonderful atmosphere in Akron, couldn't the Commission have talked to the seller and the realtor and explained, you shouldn't treat this woman this way and be nice to her and it could have all been settled, could it?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4334.665,4335.363,Yes.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4335.363,4340.767,But it couldn't be settled once 137 was passed.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4340.767,4342.465,That's right.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4342.465,4345.105,"And you say, you helped in the situation."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4345.105,4345.684,Say what?
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4345.684,4349.601,You say you helped in the situation.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4353.755,4369.559,"Well, on the basis of the fact that we did not have to have a fair housing ordinance in Akron that we have adequate remedies namely by the state law and now the federal law."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4409.751,4417.155,"Before you go on with that, may I see if I can clear this up in my own mind anyway."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4417.155,4419.11,Alright.
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4419.11,4441.476,"If Mr. Jones, a resident of Akron owns a one-family house and he has that on the market for sale and he refuses to sell it to Mrs. Hunter because she is a Negro."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4453.979,4454.347,Yes.
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4454.347,4469.296,"-- in subparagraph 1 refuse to sell, makes an unlawful discriminatory practice to refuse to sell on a count of race, etcetera but that applies only to commercial housing, doesn't it?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4469.296,4469.887,"Yes, sir."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4469.887,4471.61,And would not affect this situation.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4471.61,4472.664,"Yes, sir."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4472.664,4486.27,"Now, I fail to see anything else in the state law, I may be wrong, but I fail to see anything else in the state law that would reach the case that I just put to you, am I wrong?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4486.27,4488.474,That's right but that isn't the case we have here.
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4488.474,4489.402,I'm right about this?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4489.402,4490.366,Yes.
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4490.366,4541.1,"Well now, then you turn to page 13 of your brief and you look at the affidavit that I couldn't search and in that affidavit, the agent, according to the affidavit, the agent stated to Mrs. Hunter that she could not show me any of the houses on the list because all of the owners had specified that they did not wish their houses shown to negroes so that it's at least arguable, isn't it that Mrs. Hunter, the gravamen of Mrs. Hunter's complaint here is that the owners of individual houses, not commercial property, the individual houses refused to sell to her and that would not be covered by the state law."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4541.1,4547.908,"Well, merely on the basis of a statement of some real estate agent, it would be arguable, yes."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4547.908,4548.125,Yes.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4548.125,4553.673,"But not in her specific private dealing with any private individual, it wouldn't be."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4553.673,4558.685,"Well, I think I got the line straightened out anyway."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4563.682,4620.807,"I got into the question here of what barriers are placed in the path of these people who wanted this particular ordinance and I have read a stack of cases I guess this high and right now, I would say they're all piled on the floor of my mind and I couldn't sort anything up and tell which or any of them ought to be catalogued but I drafted a little statement here which I thought was in the sense the rule would apply here as to whether or not there had been unreasonable barriers placed in the way for these people to accomplish what they want and I think we go back basically to the proposition that this really is a political duel or a political competition."
1968.63,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4680.835,4707.882,Would you amend your -- would you amend your hypothesis there to this extent to say that this was a political combat between those who wanted to protect their constitutional rights and those who wanted to deny them to them and could you proceed from that and get the same result?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4707.882,4737.903,"Well, I would say that I'd have to grant that certainly those people have the right to their constitutional rights and it would have to fit in whatever process the city or the state involved, included, would have to be rights that are allowed and permitted under the Federal Constitution."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4789.39,4794.228,"So, am I correct that we already have fair housing enacted?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4794.228,4795.479,Yes.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4797.153,4800.526,"I said at this time, we already have it."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4800.526,4807.342,"Well, no because in the state court of Ohio says that we did not because it was suspended."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4808.771,4816.108,"Up until it was suspended, you did have it and so you helped by taking it away."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4819.644,4829.106,"Well, until that the ordinance become effective, Your Honor, it seems to me we wouldn't have it."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4829.106,4832.946,I would also assume that the ordinance that was passed would become effective.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4832.946,4836.568,"Well, again getting back to the total procedures which are permissible --"
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4836.568,4844.125,What more it was accomplished other than that under your argument that Akron save the money of the Commission?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4846.793,4846.977,"Well, --"
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4846.977,4848.995,In Akron.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4848.995,4854.26,"Well, because I think the state commission was far better equipped to handle the complaint, that's another thing."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4854.26,4855.985,Is it in operation now?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4855.985,4859.984,"Yes, it's in operation now and real estate people are regulated by the state."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4859.984,4863.297,And would it handle this complaint?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4863.297,4865.007,"Oh, yes."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4869.403,4882.765,I'm going to let you interpret your own law but I would feel much better if I were an ordinary citizen if I had three protections than if I had two.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4882.765,4909.764,"Well, there are those who feel we have too many laws overlapping as they are and my own judgment is that since this is a total problem that we ought to regulate statewide that ought to be done that way because as I just said there are many of this municipalities in Akron who aren't going to have, do not have one and never will have one in my own humble judgment and so --"
1968.63,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4909.764,4917.987,"Well, is it your -- is it your opinion that the state law preempts this whole situation?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4917.987,4935.1,"Well, preempt -- the state is now in and I'm sure that if Akron tried to do anything that the state found offensive to the way it was handling then that would be held improper."
1968.63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4947.824,4962.721,"Well, I must say Mr. Vinopal, I have trouble seeing how we can accept your insistence that the state law indeed preempts whatever words you want to use, despises any state -- municipal regulation in this if your state courts haven't said so."
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4964.862,4973.223,"It's not your position that the state law replaces this because as a matter of Ohio law, that doesn't happen."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4988.915,4989.619,Yes.
1968.63,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4990.794,4996.31,It's never your position that the relief asked for by the plaintiff in this case is now provided by state law.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,4996.31,5001.339,That -- that's my position that there was a state law which provides the relief that she could had.
1968.63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5003.689,5016.334,"Well, if it is, I still don't see -- that enables this Court to escape the determination on the constitutional question that's been presented to her."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5018.026,5039.788,"Well, it seems -- yes, that's the one face of it but if this party had other remedies, it seems to me would be a moot question and on that basis, it ought to be concerned with this Court."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5079.934,5082.823,These other communities are not before us.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5082.823,5083.028,Right.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5083.028,5083.88,Am I correct?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5086.283,5087.047,Yes.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5087.047,5096.571,And Akron had a fair housing ordinance and that's the case we are deciding.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5108.807,5137.119,If I may just a moment here.
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5183.192,5188.12,But I read this in saying if Section 137 is valid.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5197.058,5200.583,"Yes, yes."
1968.63,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5236.724,5238.048,In view of what?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5238.048,5273.844,"In view of the environment that existed at the time, namely that there was pending going in the state, the activity of having a state law that possibly that the enforcement provisions of a city ordinance may not have been effective any way in view of those things, in view of the fact that it's not necessary to have one that this was the first opportunity in I would say that people could have to decide whether they wanted one or not since council had elected to pass the ordinance the way they did."
1968.63,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5416.011,5424.478,Wouldn't you assume that utility is better shaped financially to get a referendum than a property owner?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5424.478,5433.086,"Well, some of them are but some of that I dealt with a little fellow with the bus line who I had to help get a franchise with the city, was put to bankrupt when he started."
1968.63,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5443.423,5471.794,"Perhaps, it's arguable that this case will be more likely the public utility charter provision if the latter said that utility charters may be issued to white people without a referendum but if any utility charters can be issued to Negroes then you got to have a referendum."
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5526.024,5552.612,"Well, of course, granting this is the element of the racial discrimination but in the sense we look at on this instance was an ordinance dealing with a regulation of a subject and of course one of the subject was the sale of housing whether it was to Negroes, to whatever classification of people was."
1968.63,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5630.559,5634.405,Why do you assume that we have to go slow in this area?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5634.405,5637.602,"No, I -- my statement was that not necessarily."
1968.63,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5641.469,5647.464,I understood you to say just a moment ago that because it was necessary to go slow in this area.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5647.464,5650.036,"No, I didn't speak loud enough."
1968.63,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5655.189,5657.431,Regardless of what?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5657.431,5663.516,My position is that the need to go slow isn't an element in here as to why the people would want to have this.
1968.63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5704.57,5706.84,"But Mr. Vinopal, could I ask you a question please?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5706.84,5708.956,"Yes, sir."
1968.63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5708.956,5712.192,Didn't this ordinance do two things?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5719.412,5720.371,"Amendment, yes."
1968.63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5720.371,5721.438,Yes.
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5729.401,5732.924,Yes.
1968.63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5732.924,5758.239,"Now, why can't the -- why can't a -- don't you think there's separate question involved here of whether a city may just drop and repeal an ordinance because this charter did at least did that may have gone farther and did something that's arguably impermissible?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5758.239,5767.072,But didn't it just gotten repeal among other things just suspend an existing ordinance.
1968.63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5770.088,5781.142,"Well, don't we have to hold that therefore that if the city may not -- for you to lose; don't we have to hold that a city may not repeal an ordinance?"
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5781.142,5788.032,"Yes, but I think a city can repeal an ordinance because there are the procedures and the machinery was adopted for their purpose."
1968.63,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5788.032,5791.386,What you're suggesting as an argument you might make?
1968.63,2,17166,alvin_c_vinopal,,5791.386,5798.629,"Well, there are several arguments that I'll think about tonight perhaps that I ought to say."
1968.63,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5858.139,5861.393,"Mr. Carter, you have a few moments left."
1968.63,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5861.393,5864.621,"Mr. Carter, how do you answer Justice White's question?"
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,5864.621,5869.176,"Well, Mr. Justice White's question about the repeal?"
1968.63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5877.528,5878.623,It has done that?
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,5878.623,5879.993,It has done that clause.
1968.63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5879.993,5883.616,There are two sentences that were put.
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,5899.547,5900.862,That's right but the point that it's --
1968.63,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5900.862,5913.016,"Well, if that -- if you will prevail as to that sentence, is that the end of the case without reaching the first sentence?"
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5913.016,5933.833,"Although as I understood your argument, you've been arguing about what's to the first sentence that you may not single out a housing discrimination ordinance as the kind must be submitted to the electorate and another."
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,5937.364,5946.059,The -- I think it's a matter of fact that we -- what we have here are the two bases.
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5974.139,5980.554,"You did that in arguing -- up to now, you've just been arguing about the latter aspect of it."
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,5980.554,5990.393,Because the latter aspect of it in -- I have been arguing I think about both of them because I think that's the question that Mr. Justice Stewart asked.
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5990.393,5990.802,"Well, you mean we don't --"
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,5990.802,5999.02,Mr. Justice Stewart said to me I think that would I have to make an argument about this is the statute have not been on the books?
1968.63,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6009.846,6013.821,Because it could have had quite the same lawsuit but you would have exactly the same constitutional argument.
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6013.821,6016.203,"Yes, I would have the same constitutional argument."
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6017.865,6026.492,I agree with you and that's why I say that's what have been the burden of your argument is the singling out of this kind of an ordinance for special treatment.
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6048.17,6052.224,You don't have to decide that a state may not repeal an existing ordinance.
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6052.224,6054.94,I mean an existing fair housing ordinance?
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6056.096,6057.182,I don't think you have to.
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6057.182,6057.975,Why not?
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6057.975,6062.717,Because of the fact that that I think that what you have decide it seems to me --
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6062.717,6064.557,Because that's one thing the state did here.
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6064.557,6070.056,"Well, that's one thing the state here but the state did more than that and what the state did more --"
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6070.056,6073.287,I know but why do we even have to get to it the more?
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6073.287,6093.231,"Because of the fact that if the state having done more, it seems to me that in so far as my argument is concerned that it is a simpler constitutional question to indicate that the state cannot single out these people and bar any legislation to some."
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6093.231,6095.594,Let me ask you this Mr. Carter.
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6101.393,6102.64,Right.
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6102.64,6132.383,"-- and stopped it or it said the first sentence is unconstitutional but it was perfectly constitutional for the state to repeal this ordinance so there is no ordinance in effect in Akron but the provision singling out fair housing ordinances as those which must go to a referendum or an initiative is unconstitutional, would that satisfy you or not?"
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6132.383,6134.874,"Well, it would appear to me that --"
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6134.874,6137.828,"In short what is this case about, is it?"
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6137.828,6149.734,"This case is about the fact that the ordinance of this kind, the state has singled out a particular class of legislation and said that you may not act this without going through certain processes."
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6149.734,6151.889,"Well, let's assume the Court agreed with you on that."
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6151.889,6159.433,That the state has also said -- the state has done more Mr. Justice White and say that it has repealed the ordinance because it says --
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6159.433,6163.222,"Well, you want us to say that the repeal is also unconstitutional?"
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6163.222,6169.538,I want you to say that repeal is unconstitutional with the burdens that have been placed upon it at the present time.
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6169.538,6174.552,"Well, we can say the burdens are unconstitutional but why does that make the repeal unconstitutional?"
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6174.552,6185.194,"Well, if you say that the burdens are unconstitutional, it seems to me that the issue as to whether a simple repeal is unconstitutional is not my case."
1968.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6185.194,6189.482,"Well, then you want us to reach whether or not the ordinance is now in existence in Akron."
1968.63,3,38936,robert_l_carter,,6189.482,6191.307,That's right.
