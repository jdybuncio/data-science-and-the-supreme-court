1986.85-495,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.522,We will hear arguments next in Ansonia Board of Education against Ronald Philbrook.
1986.85-495,0,43299,thomas_sullivan,,73.898,75.481,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.679,229.548,Is that so during the entire period here?
1986.85-495,0,43299,thomas_sullivan,,229.548,232.266,"No, it wasn't."
1986.85-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.772,243.006,"Between, what was it--"
1986.85-495,0,43299,thomas_sullivan,,243.006,244.724,'67 and '68.
1986.85-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.724,251.061,"--'67 and '69, they could use those three days, as far as we know, for anything they wanted?"
1986.85-495,0,43299,thomas_sullivan,,251.061,252.663,That's correct.
1986.85-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.663,260.649,"But nonetheless, Philbrook was not allowed to use it for religious reasons."
1986.85-495,0,43299,thomas_sullivan,,260.649,263.935,The record is not clear on that.
1986.85-495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.062,331.579,"Counsel, is it possible, since the court below didn't really decide these factual questions on how the three-day personal leave provision was in fact administered, or how Mr. Philbrook was treated with regard to it, that some remand might be necessary on the 703 issue?"
1986.85-495,0,43299,thomas_sullivan,,331.579,354.076,"--Your Honor, we don't think so, and for this reason: We feel that the record in this case permits no other conclusion than that the leave provisions of the contract have been consistently interpreted in accordance with the explicit provisions of the contract so as to preclude the use of necessary personal business leave."
1986.85-495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,371.62,385.98,"Even under the terms of the contract, it looks like the one day which can be granted on the request of the teacher alone without any inquiry at all would lend itself to use for any purpose whatever, in practice."
1986.85-495,0,43299,thomas_sullivan,,385.98,387.364,"--We don't agree with that, Your Honor."
1986.85-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,422.703,433.111,"You're just saying that this... as to this one day, it's not practically enforceable, and it's left up to the conscience and responsibility of the teacher."
1986.85-495,0,43299,thomas_sullivan,,433.111,433.895,That's correct.
1986.85-495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,440.181,444.252,"What's the purpose of the provision, that one day provision?"
1986.85-495,0,43299,thomas_sullivan,,448.887,452.255,"We don't have any bargaining history on that, so it's simply a matter of conjecture."
1986.85-495,1,39865,robert_f_mcweeny,,1399.979,1404.414,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it pleases the Court:"
1986.85-495,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.804,1496.006,"Well, what's the differences between those two, Mr. McWeeny?"
1986.85-495,1,39865,robert_f_mcweeny,,1501.058,1509.314,"--Well, I would just offer that to... the religious ceremony would be similar to the other types of activity."
1986.85-495,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.074,1541.452,"But as I understand it, you couldn't use any of... if you've used the three days you want for religious observances, under the contract, you could not then use some of the 18 days for other religious observances like the ones the three days are devoted to."
1986.85-495,1,39865,robert_f_mcweeny,,1541.452,1544.32,That's correct; you could not.
1986.85-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.106,1547.506,I don't understand that at all.
1986.85-495,1,39865,robert_f_mcweeny,,1553.176,1557.628,"--Well, you could not claim it was a sick day."
1986.85-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1578.874,1584.545,"--The three religious days off are day-of-rest provisions, right?"
1986.85-495,1,39865,robert_f_mcweeny,,1584.545,1585.647,"That's correct, religious practice."
1986.85-495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.647,1588.599,For days when you religion doesn't allow you to work.
1986.85-495,1,39865,robert_f_mcweeny,,1605.359,1605.775,That's true.
1986.85-495,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.202,1782.504,Very well.
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,1787.006,1791.093,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.779,1823.381,Why is it an explicitly religious line?
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,1844.776,1851.615,Your understanding... I have to disagree with the understanding you were given a couple of minutes ago.
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.999,1909.618,"We just have a dispute as to the contractual interpretation, then."
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,1911.987,1913.189,"--Yes, that's right."
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1933.584,1941.272,"But if the board is telling us that it interprets the contract the other way, why do we have to get in a fight over what the contract means?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,1957.884,1962.086,"--The representation... I should say the representation was made by the union, not the board."
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.372,1965.788,"Oh, I think the board's position is the same, as I understand it."
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,1973.144,1978.215,That understanding has been communicated for the first time here today.
1986.85-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.609,2059.667,"Is it as clear as you suggest that this personal religious thing that is embraced within the 18 days might not be extended to the soup kitchen example, if Mr. Philbrook felt a religious desire to do that?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2059.667,2071.224,"The... what is embraced within the 18 days is religious ceremonies, which says... in the contract after it, there's a parenthetical description saying, Bar Mitzvah, ordination, first vows, and the like."
1986.85-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.922,2097.725,"Mr. Rosen, can I ask you a question about your facial reading of the contract?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2124.942,2126.792,"Yes, yes."
1986.85-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.894,2130.644,Let me follow up with another question.
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2133.846,2135.229,--It would less favorable.
1986.85-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2152.473,2154.14,Then let me ask you an intermediate question.
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2168.467,2170.05,"No, it would still be discriminatory."
1986.85-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.002,2176.221,It would treat the religious leave just like all other kinds of leave.
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2179.489,2185.81,"--Well, let me give an example that I hope will explain why that would be unfair."
1986.85-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2218.9,2220.183,"No, but it would have to be changed to say,"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2226.87,2232.957,"--Well, except that my analogy is, I'm using... I'm using available space instead of money paid."
1986.85-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2306.672,2307.272,Mr. Rosen.
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2307.272,2307.688,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2308.022,2332.037,"Is there any reason under Title VII why the accommodation made by the employer cannot be broken down to provide so many days a year sick leave, so many days a year for business necessity, and so many days a year for religious observance?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2332.037,2333.572,There is none.
1986.85-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2334.922,2341.761,You wouldn't claim that that kind of a breakdown is inherently discriminatory under Title VII?
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2341.761,2342.545,--We would not.
1986.85-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2372.064,2388.826,"Well, is it invalid for the employer to say, so many days a year sick leave, so many days a year secular-purpose leave, of any kind, and so many days a year for religious observance?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2388.826,2389.376,--Yes.
1986.85-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2394.061,2401.883,Even if the fact-finder determines that the amount given for religious accommodation is in fact reasonable?
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2401.883,2407.953,"--Yes, because the claim is one not of accommodation but of discrimination."
1986.85-495,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2440.507,2445.042,"That's your claim under Section 703a-1, or whatever it is?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2445.042,2445.409,--Yes.
1986.85-495,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.244,2460.069,"Well, I suppose, if the employer just cut out the three days for religion and said, three days for personal leave of any kind, including religion; that would satisfy you?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2460.069,2462.088,That would be nondiscriminatory.
1986.85-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.246,2477.514,Your client would be no better off?
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2477.514,2482.084,"--Our client would be no better... he would be free of the discrimination, but he would be no better off."
1986.85-495,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2494.575,2502.915,"Well, then, if the employer said, we don't have any leave around here on pay; no paid leave whatsoever."
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2509.319,2514.639,That would probably... probably still be all right under Title VII.
1986.85-495,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.732,2536.802,"Well, is the school board in any trouble if it says, no paid leave for anything except religion?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2541.456,2545.342,--We think that it depends how much paid leave they give for religion.
1986.85-495,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.058,2552.246,"Well, they give three days paid leave for religion, but no paid leave for anything else."
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2552.246,2563.786,--We think that the free exercise clause of the Constitution provides enough free play... and Title VII certainly does provide enough free play to make that kind; three days a year would be all right.
1986.85-495,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.786,2566.321,But would you think that Title VII would require that?
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2566.321,2567.921,"No, no."
1986.85-495,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.59,2609.212,So you think you know enough about what personal leave is allowed for in this specific instance to say that it discriminates against religion?
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2609.212,2610.814,We have not cross-petitioned.
1986.85-495,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2628.192,2630.144,You don't object to the remand?
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2630.144,2631.227,--We don't object to the remand.
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.429,2635.965,I'm not clear about your position.
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2649.023,2653.927,"As the government points out in its brief, that would be a somewhat different and a more difficult case."
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2666.817,2668.3,You're undecided on that?
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2668.3,2669.433,--I'm undecided on that.
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.433,2683.843,"What about if the 18 days were... in this case were expanded to 21 days; 21 days for explicit secular reasons, and 3 days for religious observance; that would be all right?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2683.843,2688.813,"For example, if on remand it were demonstrated, contrary to my expectation, that personal--"
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2688.813,2689.93,"No, it's a new contract."
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2690.765,2691.082,--All right.
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.082,2694.55,The three-day wildcard is gone.
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2694.55,2696.0,That would be all right.
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2696.0,2699.788,"And you get 21 days for explicit nonreligious reasons, and three days for religious reasons."
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2700.471,2701.254,That would be all right.
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.254,2704.423,How about one day for religious reasons?
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2704.423,2705.692,Even that is probably all right.
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2705.692,2707.925,Half a day?
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2707.925,2710.144,I think perhaps no days are all right.
1986.85-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.96,2755.255,"Mr. Rosen, would you tell me again, because I'm not really sure I followed your argument, whether or not, and if not, why not, just striking the words, any religious observance, from that fourth exclusion would satisfy the facial attack, even though it would leave in effect the general exclusion of all other provisions covered by leave."
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2758.29,2769.245,"My view on that is as with the chapel example that I used, it would still be an explicitly religious line."
1986.85-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2773.197,2775.315,Because it is one of the 16 exclusions.
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2775.315,2775.965,--That is--
1986.85-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2775.965,2778.601,But that's still a specific religious line?
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2778.601,2787.79,"--That, I suggest, Justice Stevens, is presented as what is claimed to be a good reason to discriminate against religion, if you will."
1986.85-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.758,2798.245,Religion is like other things for which leave has already been provided; and that's discriminating against religion.
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2798.245,2800.53,--Religion is--
1986.85-495,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2800.53,2806.518,"You see, it seems to me possibly you could win the case and have that provision stricken, and you'd be right back where you started from."
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2824.613,2824.963,--All right.
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2894.392,2906.95,"But it's acceptable to you so long... or you think it may be acceptable to you, so long as they list all of the conceivable nonreligious purposes, and fail to list any religious purposes?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2917.674,2938.255,"--The line I suggest would not be particularity, but comparability, Justice Scalia; that if commemoration of the death of loved ones is permissible, and that commemoration takes the form of observance of a religious holy day, I would say that exclusion of the religious holy day is discriminatory."
1986.85-495,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2938.255,2942.207,I see.
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2942.207,2947.361,"In sum, our view is that the line here is--"
1986.85-495,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.361,2949.011,Of course you'd say--
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2949.011,2950.063,"--Yes, Justice White."
1986.85-495,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.063,2977.546,"--anytime you permitted paid leave for a wedding, which is a church ceremony, in the sense that you aren't considered married unless you get married in the church, according to church ritual, if you allow that, you're really allowing... shouldn't you also allow other leave for religious purposes?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2977.546,2989.771,"We think that the right line is all weddings... if weddings are allowed, then you can't discriminate between secular weddings and religious weddings."
1986.85-495,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.771,2994.842,"Yes, but how about other religious activities?"
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,2994.842,3000.911,I think it's all right for an employer to identify a specific purpose like a wedding.
1986.85-495,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3000.911,3003.947,"Your time has expired, Mr. Rosen."
1986.85-495,2,21449,david_n_rosen,,3005.913,3013.653,Thank you.
1986.85-495,3,18942,charles_fried,,3013.653,3020.992,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-495,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.486,3222.223,"What if it said... what if it meant, do anything you want."
1986.85-495,3,18942,charles_fried,,3227.192,3229.877,"That would be another, more difficult case."
