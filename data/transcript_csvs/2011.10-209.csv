2011.10-209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.17,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-209, Lafler v. Cooper."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,9.439,12.058,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,35.237,36.523,Could I -- can I stop you on the first?
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,53.301,66.942,"--Justice Kagan, even in Kimmelman the Court remanded back to the lower courts to determine whether there was prejudice, and the obvious implication was that if there was no prejudice on the fairness of the adjudicatory proceeding itself, there would be no Sixth Amendment violation."
2011.10-209,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,89.974,100.83,"Counsel, isn't there a right to make a critical decision on whether to accept or reject a plea bargain, once offered?"
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,108.352,113.939,"--Justice Sotomayor, the -- the not guilty plea is an assertion of the defendant's constitutional rights."
2011.10-209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,141.49,149.262,"Suppose this were a death -- a death case, and roughly the -- the same facts, failure -- failure to communicate."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,171.442,172.592,I'm saying--
2011.10-209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,172.592,174.994,"So if you could do all of that, including the death penalty."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,175.444,183.984,"--Yes, I'm saying that there is no violation, because in order to prove a Sixth Amendment violation you have to demonstrate unreliability of the adjudicatory process."
2011.10-209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,223.942,231.631,"When you say no violation, you don't mean that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel?"
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,236.0,237.283,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,250.842,254.544,"Well, I thought that the second part of the test asked about harm."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,270.237,274.106,"Well, that's actually the best argument that the Respondent has in this case."
2011.10-209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,274.791,275.458,Sounds like a good argument.
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,275.458,280.445,"--Well, the reason why it's wrong is because this Court has been very careful to define what that harm is."
2011.10-209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,283.564,285.864,And outcome -- there is a different outcome here.
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,288.731,293.585,"Yes, but the Court went on to define outcome to mean reliability of the adjudicatory process."
2011.10-209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,306.66,308.095,"Well, take the sentencing cases."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,322.105,324.355,"--Well, I don't believe it's quite that simple."
2011.10-209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,346.986,355.326,"Well, I guess I don't understand that answer, because that answer seems to suggest that the assistance being provided was not ineffective."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,376.073,380.358,"Well, let's try another sentencing hypothetical, where it's clear that there was deficient performance."
2011.10-209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,424.387,431.576,"You acknowledge, though, that it's ineffective assistance of counsel if you're -- well, no, I guess you haven't acknowledged."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,452.406,461.346,"--Under the Court's first prong of Strickland, you would have to look at whatever the standards of professional practice were and, depending how lousy the bargainer was, it could or could not be deficient."
2011.10-209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.765,470.367,"Well, I don't even agree with the first part."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,476.688,478.557,"Well, we could agree with that."
2011.10-209,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,486.294,492.781,You can -- you can agree with that when 95 percent of the criminal cases are disposed of by way of bargaining?
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,492.781,503.839,"--Because in the 95 percent of cases that are disposed of that way, this Court has already held in Padilla and Hill that there is a constitutional right to have effective counsel when you accepting that plea."
2011.10-209,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,516.663,529.406,How can you talk about the reliability of a process or its fairness when you have an attorney who has fundamentally misgauged the law?
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,549.403,556.823,"Because there's no evidence here, not even a contention, that his belief had any impact whatsoever on the fairness of the trial proceeding."
2011.10-209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,564.246,566.879,"--Well, but you skipped over a step."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,577.821,582.708,"--Right again, but that fork in the road is not one to which he has a constitutional right."
2011.10-209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,582.708,584.993,"Well, but that's the question -- that's the question we're confronting."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,585.777,586.677,"Well, I--"
2011.10-209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,586.677,588.861,--your answer was a little too facile on that point.
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,603.204,604.488,"--Correct, we are assuming that."
2011.10-209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,621.35,632.557,Suppose the defective advice causes the defendant to enter a plea that he would not have entered if he had been properly advised.
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,633.557,634.757,Absolutely.
2011.10-209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,641.829,653.304,"So explain why defective advice causing a plea, that qualifies, but defective advice causing defendant to turn down a plea--"
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,653.304,655.387,It's just--
2011.10-209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,655.387,656.173,--does not?
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,656.173,665.379,"--It's just like the difference between deciding to proceed with counsel, in which case there is no barrier to entry, or deciding to proceed without counsel, giving up the constitutional--"
2011.10-209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.379,667.229,"No, the difference -- that's not the difference at all."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,692.462,705.587,"--Justice Scalia, you said it much more artfully, but that's exactly the point I was trying to make with Justice Ginsburg, that when you invoke your constitutional rights, your right to have an attorney, to go to a trial, to have a jury, we don't set up barriers to entry."
2011.10-209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,707.372,713.175,"I take it, then, Mr. Bursch, you would have the same answer if the State had never provided counsel at all."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,732.137,737.641,"That would be our position, because that's consistent with this Court's holding in Coleman and Wade and Kimmelman."
2011.10-209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,737.641,739.993,And that would also be your position in a capital case?
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,739.993,741.159,Yes.
2011.10-209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.836,767.976,"So your position is you are entitled to effective assistance of counsel before you plead guilty, but you are not entitled to effective assistance of counsel in evaluating plea offers?"
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,767.976,769.845,I would say it slightly different--
2011.10-209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.845,771.045,All right.
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,771.045,780.134,"--that you are entitled to effective counsel at every critical stage; however, it is not a Sixth Amendment violation unless it casts doubt on the reliability of the adjudication of guilt."
2011.10-209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,780.134,785.105,"That gets back to my question: Is it a violation in the abstract, damnum absque injuria?"
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,785.105,786.788,I'm sorry.
2011.10-209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,786.788,787.657,Damage without injury.
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,787.657,796.746,"No, because under the Strickland and Cronic cases there is no damage, there's no Sixth Amendment violation, unless you can prove the prejudice."
2011.10-209,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,796.746,802.399,"I mean, all of this is theoretically interesting and it may be that capital cases are sui generis here."
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,812.589,813.105,Correct.
2011.10-209,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,813.105,822.813,--there is no remedy that can put the parties back into the position where they would have been had the error regarding the legal issue not occurred.
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,822.813,823.83,That's exactly right.
2011.10-209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,869.009,872.211,"""Sacred"" is a little strong, don't you think?"
2011.10-209,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,897.942,900.628,We contend it violates the separation of powers.
2011.10-209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,947.009,948.209,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-209,1,45148,william_m_jay,,961.185,963.252,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,987.836,992.388,"Well, you -- first, there is nothing about this in the Sixth Amendment, is there?"
2011.10-209,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1001.41,1003.196,The Sixth Amendment requires the assistance--
2011.10-209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1003.196,1005.798,There is nothing in the Sixth Amendment that has these qualifications.
2011.10-209,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1065.252,1070.323,"--Well, I think that -- Let me address that capital hypothetical that has come up several times."
2011.10-209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1092.404,1095.355,I don't want to -- I want to stop you there because I don't understand it.
2011.10-209,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1128.677,1135.782,"--But I think the principle, Justice Breyer, is that you look at what -- you look at what it is the Court's being asked to set aside."
2011.10-209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1135.782,1136.365,Death.
2011.10-209,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1137.198,1137.717,Right.
2011.10-209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1146.573,1157.196,"He shows that never did he ever become aware, because his lawyer was sleeping and moved on vacation and never told him about the plea offer."
2011.10-209,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1158.381,1179.294,"--I think that's actually an easier hypothetical than the bad advice because you could show that if the lawyer then gets -- stands up and does a bang-up job at trial -- the defendant is convicted of capital murder, the defendant can't show any prejudicial effect on the trial -- that means that no other lawyer doing a better job could have gotten the defendant -- could even show a reasonable probability that a different verdict would ensue."
2011.10-209,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1181.461,1182.913,The Court has said that death is different.
2011.10-209,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1204.177,1207.612,"This is not a capital case, and I think that it certainly--"
2011.10-209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1207.612,1210.897,"All right, if you don't want to do the capital case, I'm still trying to get to the principle."
2011.10-209,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1210.897,1211.331,--I'm happy to do the capital case--
2011.10-209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1211.331,1227.525,"I will change my hypothetical and say all that happened was that this perfect trial because of mandatory sentencing rules led him to prison for 50 years, as compared with a plea bargain that would have given him 2 years."
2011.10-209,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1262.031,1275.356,"--Two points, Justice Breyer, and I want to make sure I get out my answer to your capital hypothetical, because you don't look just at whether the sentence that resulted was worse than the sentence that could have resulted."
2011.10-209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.858,1312.381,"Mr. Jay, you disagree with the assertion that Justice Breyer made that this was unfair."
2011.10-209,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,1331.86,1333.712,"Yes, that's correct."
2011.10-209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.978,1342.667,"Let's say there is an occasion where people don't get the sentence that they deserve because, for example, the lawyer was inadequate."
2011.10-209,3,45148,william_m_jay,,1343.667,1349.654,"--And in those cases, Justice Breyer, you show that the lawyer had a bad strategy at sentencing."
2011.10-209,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1414.596,1422.519,"Mr. Jay, you don't contest that plea bargaining is a critical phase, entitling somebody to a lawyer and to an effective lawyer, do you."
2011.10-209,4,29018,john_j_bursch,,1422.519,1426.138,--We don't -- we don't think -- that's not part of our argument here.
2011.10-209,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1426.138,1428.256,"Yes, because we have said that many times, isn't that right?"
2011.10-209,4,29018,john_j_bursch,,1428.256,1434.176,"Well, the Court -- let me be precise, Justice Kagan, because there are two things that the Court can be talking about."
2011.10-209,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1450.086,1458.192,What we have to recognize -- is that plea bargaining is a critical phase because about 98 percent of the action of the criminal justice system occurs in plea bargaining.
2011.10-209,4,29018,john_j_bursch,,1468.515,1473.285,"--Well, I don't think the Court has faced up -- faced this particular situation, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-209,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1473.285,1474.452,So it's not a critical phase.
2011.10-209,5,45148,william_m_jay,,1478.688,1486.378,--We are -- we are assuming that -- that Mr. Cooper in this case had a right to receive effective advice about whether to enter this plea.
2011.10-209,5,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1489.913,1505.606,"Has -- have you ever seen a critical phase before in our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence where the right to a lawyer depends upon what happens during that critical phase, where if one outcome results there is no Sixth Amendment right, but if another outcome results there is?"
2011.10-209,5,45148,william_m_jay,,1505.606,1513.029,"--Well, again, we don't think this is in any way crucial to deciding this case, but Scott v. Illinois, Justice Kagan, is an example of that."
2011.10-209,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.029,1519.682,"Mr. Jay, couldn't -- couldn't it be said that what our cases hold is that pleading guilty is a critical phase."
2011.10-209,5,45148,william_m_jay,,1522.884,1527.186,"It certainly is correct that pleading -- a guilty plea hearing, where the defendant--"
2011.10-209,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1527.186,1528.288,"Well, it's correct, but is it enough?"
2011.10-209,5,45148,william_m_jay,,1545.231,1547.35,"--That's not at all what we are asking, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-209,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1548.635,1550.635,So Justice Kagan and I want to know what your test is.
2011.10-209,5,45148,william_m_jay,,1550.635,1557.022,--Our test to resolve this case is to look at what it is that the habeas petitioner is challenging.
2011.10-209,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1570.531,1570.965,Sure.
2011.10-209,5,45148,william_m_jay,,1570.965,1574.817,"And -- on this sentence, he was sentenced in accordance with law."
2011.10-209,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1586.975,1587.343,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1589.343,1594.063,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-209,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1614.06,1620.048,"I think it's not -- that he got ineffective assistance, yes, that is not controverted."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1648.031,1656.971,"Those are both true, Justice Ginsburg -- Justice Ginsburg, but however the Strickland test requires a reasonable probability of a different result."
2011.10-209,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1664.327,1667.879,The relief that you want is specific performance on the plea bargain.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1667.879,1668.579,Correct.
2011.10-209,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1668.579,1669.162,Isn't that correct?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1686.323,1689.108,Yes.
2011.10-209,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1697.964,1699.5,What -- what is the judge supposed to do?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1713.474,1720.163,"Well, this Court has stated numerous times that it presumes a conscientious decisionmaker, and a conscientious decisionmaker would put--"
2011.10-209,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1720.163,1724.948,"Well, I'm asking what -- I'm a conscientious decisionmaker and I'm asking for your advice on what I should do."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1734.487,1740.577,--You would evaluate the case as you would have evaluated it at the time of the proceedings.
2011.10-209,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1740.577,1741.06,"The answer is ""yes""."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1745.029,1750.849,"Yes, because the deficient -- you evaluate things at the point of the deficient performance."
2011.10-209,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1760.554,1761.121,"I mean, that's pretty incredible."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1769.077,1770.512,"--Well, in that case--"
2011.10-209,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1770.512,1777.416,Wipe it out of your mind; you get -- you get the plea bargain that was offered at an early point in -- in the investigation of the case?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1777.416,1784.654,"--Yes, because what happens in ineffective assistance of counsel claims is the State has to bear the burden of the unconstitutionality."
2011.10-209,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1793.443,1811.423,"The judge -- the judge, he knows what the plea -- let's say he knows what the plea bargain was, but he also knows that for one of the crimes, felon in possession, that alone, the sentencing range is 81 to 135."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1824.981,1827.016,"--Yes, that's accurate."
2011.10-209,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1827.016,1838.59,So it -- it seems most unlikely that a judge would have accepted the plea bargaining for 51 to 68 for the crimes that were charged.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1838.59,1840.942,"No, I would disagree with that."
2011.10-209,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1857.951,1864.605,"That may be, but is it not true that the sentence range was 81 through 135 for felon in possession?"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1864.605,1871.093,"--I did not -- typically, you only score out the guidelines for the most serious offense."
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1903.064,1904.516,It wouldn't be a problem.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1916.406,1917.323,Right.
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1917.973,1918.906,You can't make him do that.
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1965.704,1984.051,"If Justice Breyer permits me to add an addendum to give the reasons why I might agree with him, or a way of viewing this, as I read the lower court's decisions, they said there wasn't ineffectiveness, because he was just trying to get a better deal."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2043.506,2044.339,--No.
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2044.339,2046.458,We have to give deference to their finding.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2046.458,2052.195,"You do have to give deference to their finding, there is no question under AEDPA there is deference."
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2108.282,2119.839,"You said earlier that the district court, the trial court judge, still retains discretion as to whether or not to approve the plea bargain, right, whether to accept it?"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2119.839,2120.856,The sentencing.
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2120.856,2128.778,"Yes -- well, which is it, the bargain or the sentence?"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2130.128,2133.647,It's a sentence recommendation and under Michigan law the judge cannot--
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2133.647,2134.699,He has discretion -- he has discretion.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2148.84,2154.978,"--Well, he can take into account anything that he could have taken into account in the first place."
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2156.096,2158.132,"But nothing that he learned at trial, I take it."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2158.132,2160.215,--I would argue no.
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.333,2164.451,"What if he -- what if he turns it down, Ms. Newman."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2170.32,2172.539,"--I would say there is not an option -- oh, I'm sorry, so the judge--"
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.539,2173.089,"--Yeah, the judge."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2189.733,2194.018,"--Well, in that case, the case would proceed under Michigan law."
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.185,2196.47,"We would have a new trial, is that it?"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2196.47,2197.037,--No.
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.743,2206.593,Okay.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2212.497,2215.199,It would depend on the reasons why the judge would turn it down.
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.373,2228.673,Why?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2246.301,2247.018,--Right.
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2247.018,2250.186,And the judge has the freedom to accept that or to reject it.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2250.186,2250.622,Correct.
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.622,2253.405,"If he rejects it, there is no plea agreement."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2262.596,2265.632,That's also a perfectly acceptable -- that's also a perfectly acceptable remedy.
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2267.415,2267.832,Wait.
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2279.939,2283.676,His suggestion is perfect but mine is more perfect.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2285.576,2286.045,--Okay.
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2288.328,2302.971,"You don't, you would -- he's right, you would have to, under my suggestion, have a new trial; even though there was a trial that took place two years ago or whatever it is, correct?"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2302.971,2303.388,Correct.
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.388,2304.59,But that isn't the end of the argument.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2317.498,2318.381,No.
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2333.442,2334.659,A deficient performance--
2011.10-209,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2334.659,2338.144,"Well, I don't know if that's going to be so hard to show."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2385.475,2394.831,"I think it would be much more difficult, because this Court on habeas review and state courts on non-habeas review are very deferential to strategic decisions."
2011.10-209,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2396.2,2396.5,"Well, you say that."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2444.413,2447.532,"--I disagree, Your Honor."
2011.10-209,6,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2463.661,2467.046,"And most of the circuits follow your rule, isn't that right?"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2467.046,2467.596,Right.
2011.10-209,6,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2468.646,2469.565,And the flood gates have not opened.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2469.565,2470.415,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-209,6,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2470.415,2471.431,Go ahead.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2471.431,2477.552,"Yes, we have unanimity in the federal circuits and we have -- almost every state that has addressed this issue has addressed it in the same manner."
2011.10-209,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2477.552,2480.521,Unanimity on the remedy?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2500.084,2500.617,Correct.
2011.10-209,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2500.617,2505.588,"And it removes the possibility of the prosecutor saying,"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2510.642,2510.975,Correct.
2011.10-209,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2510.975,2516.812,So the prosecutor -- the remedy is -- is that the remedy that's uniform?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2521.164,2523.032,"Well, the remedies vary."
2011.10-209,6,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2546.231,2549.783,And perhaps the lack of unanimity on the remedy question is appropriate.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2570.28,2571.363,Absolutely.
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2574.965,2575.334,Like what.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2584.356,2584.856,Correct.
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2584.856,2595.379,"What factual -- I mean, give me an example of the different remedies and how a certain fact situation could make one okay and the other not okay."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2595.379,2599.116,"Well, even in the two cases before the Court today."
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2610.205,2610.555,Right.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2617.327,2625.148,"--Well, that's just -- I don't know that the factual circumstances make it okay, but it was the remedy that the State -- I'm not sure I understand your question."
2011.10-209,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2630.469,2644.728,"--a situation where the -- where the defendant turns down -- where a plea is turned down and the defendant goes to trial, are there any facts in -- any facts that would make any remedy other than specific performance the correct remedy in that situation?"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2644.728,2661.356,"--These cases are so fact-specific, Your Honor, I don't want to evade the question about a hypothetical, but there -- every case is so fact-specific that I think there -- the possibility exists that a -- that--"
2011.10-209,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2661.356,2673.748,"You're recommend -- you're recommending specific performance as the remedy for your case, and I agree with you that is, if there is to be a remedy, it's the only remedy that makes a -- any modicum of sense."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2678.985,2680.485,--That's correct.
2011.10-209,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2680.485,2685.138,So what I'm looking for is any situation -- you said leave it to the discretion of the trial judge.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2694.661,2708.771,"Well, in -- in Mr. Cooper's case I think the -- the remedy in the Sixth Circuit is the only appropriate remedy that -- that puts every -- that is narrowly tailored to the Sixth Amendment violation, and that's what this Court has said."
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2716.408,2722.931,"Well, let's go back because I'm now becoming convinced -- I am -- I am trying out what Justice Scalia suggested."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2739.523,2741.058,--Correct.
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2741.058,2743.542,So now they have to hold the plea bargain open.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2752.7,2753.25,Correct.
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2753.25,2767.709,"But should the judge decide that this is a case where he would reject the plea bargain, for any one of a variety of reasons, then our assumption was wrong and we reinstate the previous trial."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2788.889,2790.589,"Well, I -- I believe that is what is suggested."
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.241,2793.86,Don't -- don't blame it on me.
2011.10-209,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2800.431,2801.431,"Yes, but I--"
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.431,2802.264,This is just a hypothetical.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2803.716,2804.199,--Right.
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2804.199,2805.667,--I think you should put it back in.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2805.667,2808.25,"Well, again, right."
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2814.171,2815.439,You're -- you are begging the question.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2815.439,2816.123,--Okay.
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2816.123,2816.923,Okay?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2827.279,2827.862,Right.
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2828.345,2829.028,All right?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2855.828,2861.149,That -- any grounds that would have existed in the original circumstances.
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2870.005,2875.992,--So how are you ever going to know that the defendant would have accepted the plea agreement?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2895.703,2904.809,"Well, always -- in large part, it's not going to depend on the defendant, it's going to -- in larger part it's going to defend on -- depend on defense counsel--"
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2904.809,2905.428,Why?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2905.428,2910.63,"--in making that determination, because Strickland always looks at strategy."
2011.10-209,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2912.249,2914.534,I think you can answer the Chief Justice's question.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2918.086,2918.669,--Correct.
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.669,2920.938,And there is no prejudice unless he would have accepted the deal.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2937.214,2942.534,Yes -- I don't think I can answer it yes or no.
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2942.534,2948.355,"How is the judge -- how is the judge ever going to know, be able to decide whether the defendant would have accepted the deal or not?"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2948.355,2951.874,The same way that -- that trial courts decide any question of fact.
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2964.467,2967.269,"It's the defendant's choice, not the lawyer's choice."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2968.436,2980.125,"--But he -- but he has the right to assistance -- to the effective assistance of counsel in making that critical choice, and he didn't have the effective assistance of counsel on -- Mr. Cooper wrote letters to the judge--"
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2980.125,2980.927,That's the effectiveness question.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2988.081,2988.598,--Correct.
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2988.598,2990.765,How is a judge supposed to know?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2990.765,2995.936,The judge looks at the record before him.
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2997.955,3000.621,People have different -- some people are willing to take the chance.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3024.523,3030.158,"--No, by -- by looking at -- Mr. Chief Justice, by looking at the evidence in the record before him."
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3032.176,3033.878,So the judge should decide whether he would take the deal.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3033.878,3035.294,--No--
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3035.294,3037.746,"Look at the evidence before him and say, boy, I would take that deal."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3038.596,3038.946,"--No, no -- no, no, no."
2011.10-209,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3057.994,3062.112,Do you think the length and the complexity of the trial has any bearing on this?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3096.285,3103.106,"Well, every plea bargain is predicated on relieving the prosecution of having the burden of -- of trying a case."
2011.10-209,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3132.075,3134.077,You conceded -- you conceded he had a fair trial.
2011.10-209,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3135.21,3135.86,Right.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3135.86,3137.196,--I didn't--
2011.10-209,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3137.196,3140.398,It can't be a charade and still be fair.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3140.398,3145.366,--It's an unfairness of the entire proceedings that were presented.
2011.10-209,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3154.657,3157.057,You are saying it was unfair to have a fair trial?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3157.057,3162.144,"--I'm saying it's unfair to go to trial when your attorney tells you, you can't be convicted."
2011.10-209,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3162.144,3163.977,You are saying it's unfair to have a fair trial; isn't that correct?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3163.977,3166.012,I'm--
2011.10-209,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3166.012,3167.512,That has to be your position.
2011.10-209,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3167.512,3169.064,It is.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3169.064,3177.82,--I'm saying it's unfair to say that the trial erases the unfairness when there was no possibility but for a conviction at the end of the road.
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3184.307,3187.092,"Oh, but you can never say that there is no possibility of acquittal."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3190.477,3191.394,There was no defense.
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3193.91,3194.929,That's up to the jury.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3210.572,3215.259,"--That's true, but in this case, Mr. McLean told Mr. Cooper he would be convicted."
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3222.996,3225.615,"Counsel, what was the defense at trial?"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3225.615,3226.481,I'm sorry?
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3226.481,3228.233,What was the defense at trial?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3228.233,3231.102,There wasn't -- there was no defense presented.
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3233.721,3236.923,Did he deny having committed the act of the shooting?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3236.923,3237.623,--Never.
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3237.623,3239.041,At trial?
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3239.041,3240.441,No.
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3240.441,3258.186,"Is it the case that in most of the cases in which motions of this kind are brought to trial judges if there is a defense of mistaken identity or of ""I didn't do it"", that judges often find the defendant has not proven that they would have taken the plea?"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3258.186,3260.454,I didn't--
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3260.454,3268.66,"In most cases in which a trial is had, where the defendant is pleading misidentification or: I just didn't do this act."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3279.85,3286.856,--I don't know that the cases bear out that if you have a valid defense it would be harder.
2011.10-209,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3297.663,3303.733,"I thought of this case, and you can correct me if I am wrong, that your client told the attorney from the beginning: I did it; I want to plea."
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3303.733,3304.5,That is correct.
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3330.318,3331.868,You said that -- I want to make sure I understood your point.
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3342.108,3345.81,"Well, he held the state to its burden, and that is a defense."
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3346.46,3348.262,Did he--
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3348.262,3355.183,"--I'm not saying literally no defense, and I apologize if that's the what he it came across, but no cognizable defense."
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3361.67,3363.022,"--Something the jury could have accepted, right?"
2011.10-209,6,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3378.115,3395.66,"Except the defense counsel on this record specifically said that he -- that he was not running a strategy and hoping for that, that he told the client legally the only thing that could happen to him so he was in a better position by going to trial."
2011.10-209,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3397.76,3398.279,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-209,7,29018,john_j_bursch,,3401.481,3403.147,Thank you.
2011.10-209,7,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3548.658,3558.348,"I have one -- It's more proper, I think, for the government of the United States under the Federal rules, Rule 11, there has to be a colloquy before a plea is entered."
2011.10-209,7,29018,john_j_bursch,,3572.289,3584.297,"--It could be good practice, but it wouldn't have solved the problem here, because even if they had put the fact of the plea on the record, the problem was the alleged deficient advice that the lawyer gave to the client in private."
2011.10-209,7,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3592.337,3598.14,"Well, if they had -- if plea offer had come out -- I don't know how it would work."
2011.10-209,7,29018,john_j_bursch,,3601.008,3601.342,Right.
2011.10-209,7,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3613.333,3615.102,"Thank you, counsel."
