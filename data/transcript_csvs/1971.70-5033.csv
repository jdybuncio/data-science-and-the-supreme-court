1971.70-5033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.236,"We will hear arguments in No.37, the United States against the Pullman Company and Love against the Pullman Company."
1971.70-5033,0,27715,hugh_j_mcclearn,,19.125,22.645,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1971.70-5033,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,310.732,313.062,When did that had started to run?
1971.70-5033,0,27715,hugh_j_mcclearn,,313.062,313.75,Excuse me sir.
1971.70-5033,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,313.75,317.595,When would that 60 day period have started to run?
1971.70-5033,0,27715,hugh_j_mcclearn,,317.595,341.164,The 60 day period could have run from I suppose either the time when they received the complaint or at the time that they were advised of it which would have had been somewhere between May 23rd and the 1st of June which is the date of the letter from the Colorado Civil Rights Commission to the Equal Employment Opportunity.
1971.70-5033,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,341.164,350.327,Would the Statute fix any time limit for the reference by the Federal Commission to the State Commission?
1971.70-5033,0,27715,hugh_j_mcclearn,,350.327,358.552,The Statute provides that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can do nothing for 60 days.
1971.70-5033,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,358.552,359.565,That is what I am trying to get.
1971.70-5033,0,27715,hugh_j_mcclearn,,361.453,393.838,"The term of the Statute is after the filing of the, excuse me -- the indication is that the EEOC can do nothing from the time when a charge initiated with the State agency, and the last section of section -- the last sentence in Section 706b indicates that all that need to be done under the Federal Statute is to send a letter to the State Statute."
1971.70-5033,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,393.838,402.827,Is it that it shall be deemed to have been commenced for the purpose of the subsection at the time such statement is sent by registered mail to the appropriate State or the local authority?
1971.70-5033,0,27715,hugh_j_mcclearn,,402.827,404.812,That is my reference.
1971.70-5033,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,404.812,413.038,So there is from that time -- the state they sent I gather that which was mailed by the -- not the one received?
1971.70-5033,0,27715,hugh_j_mcclearn,,413.038,415.094,It would indicate whatever is sent.
1971.70-5033,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,415.094,418.413,Mailed by the EEOC?
1971.70-5033,0,27715,hugh_j_mcclearn,,418.413,425.151,"Or by the individual complainant, I suppose."
1971.70-5033,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1089.351,1093.355,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1522.692,1527.874,"Mr. Lawrence, what would the reference manipulate the filing date?"
1971.70-5033,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1527.874,1530.241,That was what the majority of the Court of Appeals complained of --
1971.70-5033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1530.241,1534.098,What would that suppose to (Inaudible).
1971.70-5033,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1534.098,1537.473,"Well, we do not quite understand the opinion ourselves."
1971.70-5033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.003,1582.165,"Excuse me, would you just bring me up to date."
1971.70-5033,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1591.022,1592.26,Thirty days after he received words from EEOC.
1971.70-5033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.26,1594.71,"30 days, whatever it is?"
1971.70-5033,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1594.71,1618.054,"That is right, And we also specify in our brief that even if the EEOC procedure is not valid, we still believe that under the policy of the Federal Act, EEOCs in the State should not file relief for the employee as we have elaborated both in this brief and the brief we filed last term in the Crosland case at the invitation of the Court."
1971.70-5033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1625.205,1627.008,Mr. Eppich.
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,1627.008,1629.963,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-5033,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1793.171,1801.311,"Mr Eppich, certainly along the line, you will tell us how Pullman is prejudiced?"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,1801.311,1802.615,"This time I cannot, Your Honor."
1971.70-5033,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1868.318,1875.75,"Mr. Eppich, how long has the porters in charge been trying to get Pullman can deduct their salaries?"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,1875.75,1877.707,"I cannot answer the question sir, I do not know."
1971.70-5033,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1877.707,1879.578,Where will one?
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,1879.578,1881.094,"I should imagine that way, that is far back in the --"
1971.70-5033,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1881.094,1884.567,"As a company, Pullman Company got in around for which is?"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,1884.567,1891.529,"The Pullman Company sir, no longer has porter in charge as the operations had been turned over."
1971.70-5033,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1891.529,1893.68,Do you have ample staff?
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,1893.68,1902.68,"Well, sir I do not know why it was limited but it sounds like a very technical situation but it is not gentleman."
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1915.62,1925.664,"Are you telling us that it is crystal clear on the face of the Statute that what Congress said was, â€œEmployee could go to the State agency if there is one."
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,1947.075,1949.599,"Yes Sir that is what I am saying, that the Act is just that clear."
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1959.083,1960.336,"No, I did not mean to put it that way."
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,1960.336,1961.373,"Right, that is not the case."
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1961.373,1966.741,"No, what I meant to put was you have to wait a certain length of time."
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,1969.23,1975.245,"Alright, it can be either 60 days or 30 days after the State has terminated its proceedings."
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1975.245,1977.547,"Well, in any that whatever maybe the time of it."
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,1977.547,1979.998,"No, let me straighten this out, this is a little confusing."
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1979.998,1983.848,"Will you tell me what you think, what you say the Statute said."
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,1983.848,1988.778,The Statute says this and I can refer the court in Section 706(d) where it says no charge maybe filed.
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2001.108,2005.239,That is commenced by the authority?
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2005.239,2006.713,This is an interesting question Sir.
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2042.547,2048.194,"Well, certainly you say that if he goes in the Federal Commission first, the Federal Commission cannot send it to the State."
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2048.194,2049.118,I do not see that Sir.
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2049.118,2049.764,Oh you do not?
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2049.764,2050.415,No Sir.
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2056.658,2060.197,"Well, may the Federal body send it to the State body?"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2060.197,2061.243,I have no objection to that Sir.
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2074.262,2076.88,"So now, at least it has to be before the State body first?"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2076.88,2077.953,No question about it Sir.
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2077.953,2081.036,"Now, how long do you say it has to be there before being held --"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2081.036,2083.402,60 days or 30 days depending.
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2084.667,2089.096,"Whatever that time is, then he has to file all over again with the Federal body, is that right?"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2089.096,2089.98,Yes.
1971.70-5033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2089.98,2092.86,"A brand new, even though it is the identical complaint --"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2092.86,2095.858,"Or some further direction, some further direction, if any, some further different direction."
1971.70-5033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.579,2101.372,According to you he has never filed before.
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2104.045,2106.212,"Sir, he never filed with the State Mr. Justice White."
1971.70-5033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.212,2114.75,"Well, I mean he has never filed a corpus charge with the Federal authority because he filed it before he went to the State."
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2114.75,2115.727,That is correct.
1971.70-5033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.009,2132.781,"Mr. Eppich, in this case when he came back from the State, well, he did not come back from the State --"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2132.781,2133.88,"Well, I think Your Honor --"
1971.70-5033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.88,2140.387,"He did not comeback from the State but the Federal people revived the old charge should I take it, is that right?"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2140.387,2142.342,It is not in the record but they did Sir.
1971.70-5033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.342,2144.558,"Well, they started moving anyway, did not they?"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2144.558,2144.737,Yes.
1971.70-5033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.627,2146.922,On something.
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2155.653,2156.642,Yes Sir.
1971.70-5033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.642,2167.775,"Now, in the alternative however, if they had sat down and talked about it, they would not need to have moved on the old charge at all, a member of the Commission could have filed the charge?"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2167.775,2168.26,Yes Sir.
1971.70-5033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2168.26,2173.947,"At that point, without hearing a word from the employee?"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2173.947,2174.3,No Sir.
1971.70-5033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2177.282,2181.736,"Well, it had already been to the State."
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2181.736,2184.646,"I am lost now, pardon me."
1971.70-5033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.646,2200.239,"Will you think if a member of the Commission had wanted to sentence him down after the State had disposed off this claim and file a charge except you to have even not with the identical charge, he would have to take it to the State first?"
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2200.239,2203.429,Are we presupposing the matter has been before the State.
1971.70-5033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.429,2204.86,Just like it was here?
1971.70-5033,2,22230,edward_c_eppich,,2204.86,2210.277,"Sir it was not before the State, it never did get before the State."
1971.70-5033,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2978.858,2980.254,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
