1993.92-1123,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.86,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 92-1123, Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U.S. Philips Corporation, et al. Mr. Mintz."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,15.86,18.878,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1123,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.721,121.594,"Mr. Mintz, as a preliminary matter, your client attempted to intervene in the court of appeals."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,121.594,122.445,That is correct.
1993.92-1123,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.445,124.928,And that motion was denied.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,124.928,125.897,That is correct.
1993.92-1123,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.897,130.115,And you didn't raise that as a question on certiorari.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,130.115,137.121,We did not have in our petition for certiorari a separate question directed to the matter of intervention.
1993.92-1123,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.121,140.923,Nor has your client moved for intervention in this Court.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,140.923,143.542,In... not in a separate motion.
1993.92-1123,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.679,160.052,Do you plan to discuss with us today whether this Court has jurisdiction in light of those deficiencies?
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,160.052,162.42,"I would be glad to address that, certainly, Your Honor."
1993.92-1123,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.42,162.903,Thank you.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,162.903,204.932,"Perhaps the background facts would lead, in fact, into both the issue of intervention and set forth the background for the issue on the merits, and I think if we look at the... one particular claim, Philips basic... Respondent Philips' insistence on continuing with a trade dress claim, I think we can see in what way the issue of... or the approach of vacatur on settlement on appeal is deficient, and essentially what--"
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,204.932,210.134,"The question Justice O'Connor is raising was, where is your party status?"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,223.144,233.517,"--Well, we believe that we fairly raised in the petition for cert the issue of the Federal circuit's denial of intervention."
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,233.517,238.071,"So your point is that it was an abuse of discretion to deny you intervention, is that--"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,238.071,238.771,Yes.
1993.92-1123,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,238.771,239.704,--Is that--
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,239.704,240.037,Yes.
1993.92-1123,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,240.037,243.557,"--Do you also agree that if it wasn't an abuse of discretion, that's the end of the case here?"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,243.557,257.048,"I think if we... if the Court does not find that the Federal circuit abused its discretion in denying the motion to intervene, we would not prevail at this level."
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.598,258.817,Why is that?
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,285.051,286.567,"--Yes, I believe you are."
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.567,291.971,So why should we impliedly take it to be the one rather than impliedly take it to be the other?
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,293.407,294.757,"Well, I--"
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.757,295.507,--Or either.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,295.507,319.539,"--I would say... we certainly, in our petition, intended to present the issue of the error of the Federal circuit in not allowing us to intervene, and to present to the Court what we thought was the principal question, which is whether or not the practice of vacating is an... the way the Federal circuit does it is an appropriate practice."
1993.92-1123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,355.981,366.354,"What is the standard that we follow in determining whether we should permit intervention either here or, assuming we're reviewing the ruling of the circuit court?"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,369.555,377.577,Rule 24 certainly applies to... applies in spirit to the Federal circuit decision as far as intervention goes.
1993.92-1123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,377.577,382.048,The spirit of Rule 24 I'm not sure moves me very far in your direction.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,392.821,395.023,"Well, I think--"
1993.92-1123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,395.023,399.158,--in a sense removed even further from Sears.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,404.779,417.971,"--The basis for intervention in the Federal circuit, if I may address that, is more than just that Izumi was an indemnitor for Windmere, the party on the claim... on the appeal."
1993.92-1123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,434.331,438.968,"Well, it was so significant you didn't move to intervene in the Florida action."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,438.968,452.811,"--Well, the Florida... at the time of the Florida action, the merits of the... Izumi itself was sufficiently represented in, as far as the merits of the underlying claim which was being defended."
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,468.587,471.873,"Mr. Mintz, you're raising this very question in the Seventh Circuit."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,486.699,491.686,Izumi is a party on the patent infringement claims.
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.138,495.404,"Well, who is raising the issue--"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,495.404,495.821,--trade dress--
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,495.821,502.808,--in the Seventh... who is raising the issue in the Seventh Circuit of the effect of the vacatur in the Federal circuit?
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,502.808,518.604,"--Sears moved for summary judgment in the Seventh Circuit, and the Seventh... in the district court in Illinois, and the district court granted summary judgment on the basis of collateral estoppel in view of the district court judgment in Florida."
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,518.604,525.241,"And then when the district court undid that ruling, who took the interlocutory appeal?"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,525.241,530.061,I believe it's Sears that is on the appeal.
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,530.061,532.513,So you're not appealing in the Seventh Circuit?
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,537.215,541.183,"Your Honor, I'm not certain whether Izumi is on the Federal circuit appeal and the Seventh Circuit."
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,541.183,545.737,"If it is, isn't that the proper forum in which to raise this question?"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,545.737,549.206,"Oh, I think the... the question of the--"
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,549.206,549.739,Of the--
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,549.739,550.225,--vacatur?
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,550.225,550.825,--Yes.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,550.825,563.533,"No, actually the issue in the... the issue before the Federal circuit is whether a judgment having already been vacated can nevertheless be the basis for collateral estoppel."
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,571.554,576.606,"And you're not raising the question, or Sears isn't raising the question that it was improper to vacate it?"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,590.283,595.837,"--Well, that appeal actually goes to the Federal circuit as well because of the patent infringement claim, and I don't believe--"
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,595.837,598.639,But I thought during the Seventh Circuit on that interlocutory--
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,598.639,600.574,--Not in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,601.458,620.385,"--And my question to you is, couldn't you raise in the Seventh Circuit the very question that you are now raising here, and if you are a party, and you expressed some doubt whether you were or not, to that interlocutory appeal, then you would not have the threshold problem that you have at the moment."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,620.385,638.783,"--But I think at that point the... going up to the Federal Circuit the law of the case is that the judgment has been vacated and we're dealing with the very, very same practice, which is that in the case where the motion to vacate was brought because of settlement, the Federal circuit vacated based on this practice."
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,638.783,639.683,"I understand ""law of the case""."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,651.773,685.495,"But the Federal circuit itself, in terms of... in this case, in the Florida case, having vacated the judgment of the Florida district court, I don't believe that is... that in itself would be an issue in the case that came out of the Northern District of Illinois, in which what had previously been a summary judgment dismissing this trade dress claim was reinstated by the District court in Illinois when the Federal circuit vacated the very judgment that was underlying it."
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,693.417,697.535,So you're saying you don't think you could raise this question in the Seventh Circuit.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,697.535,699.987,"In the Federal circuit, on the appeal--"
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,699.987,701.273,In the Seventh Circuit.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,703.206,704.141,--No.
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,709.629,712.012,And the interlocutory appeal is to the Seventh Circuit?
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,712.012,712.831,"No, to the Federal circuit."
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,712.831,714.197,"The Federal circuit, not the Seventh Circuit?"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,714.197,714.981,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1123,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,719.251,729.857,"So basically it's your position that if intervention isn't allowed somewhere there'll be nobody to challenge the vacatur, because the parties, of course, had stipulated to it."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,729.857,766.899,"That's exactly right, and that is part of the... I think of the problem of this kind of rule in the Federal circuit and... coupled with their refusal to allow intervention by the one party that is most affected by the vacatur, because in this case the agreement between Windmere and Philips to vacate the... to join in a motion to vacate the judgment followed a settlement of a trade dress claim on which Philips had lost and an antitrust claim on which Philips had lost."
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.369,776.154,Couldn't it conceivably be challenged?
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,810.328,811.478,"Well, the--"
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,811.478,819.016,"I mean, suppose, you know, a district judge just takes it on himself for no reason at all to, you know, erase his judgment."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,843.03,844.215,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,844.215,853.487,"--So you could raise... even though it's the Federal circuit, you could raise the very same question that you're raising here in the Federal circuit, only this time you'd have party status."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,853.487,866.895,"Well, I don't believe that the validity of the vacatur was raised in the Illinois district court case."
1993.92-1123,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,918.994,938.841,"The only way you could get relief would be to ultimately get this Court to grant certiorari certainly the district court in the Northern District of Illinois where the appeal lies from its judgment to the Federal circuit isn't going to decide that the Federal circuit authorized something that's contrary to law, and presumably the Federal circuit is not going to change its mind, either."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,938.841,980.151,"Yes, that's the assumption that I would make, but I believe that the case as it stands now, I think presents to the Court the really precise issue of the fundamental problem with a practice that... where an appellate court will automatically in essence vacate when the parties to the appeal settle and they settle all the claims on appeal, and the problem with this basic rule is that it does in effect vitiate the collateral estoppel."
1993.92-1123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1035.887,1042.809,I take it the logic of your rule would prohibit vacatur even in the district court after a final judgment has been entered.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1054.467,1057.418,"--Under the rule, it's not necessarily effected."
1993.92-1123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1077.065,1081.534,So it's only the filing of the appeal that prohibits the vacatur of the judgment?
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1092.325,1093.058,Not--
1993.92-1123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1093.058,1097.561,"Assuming a judgment, the parties settle after judgment, not wanting to go through an appeal."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1097.561,1120.14,"--No, not necessarily, because I think the difference is when the parties go on to appeal and jurisdiction shifts to the appellate court, which has not been involved in the case, and I... we don't... I don't think we want the appellate court then to be evaluating the merits of the appeal and deciding whether or not to vacate on the basis of the merits."
1993.92-1123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1137.269,1147.292,"You're not arguing, then, for an automatic rule against vacatur, you're arguing that the court of appeals should look at all the circumstances of the case?"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1147.292,1159.283,"I believe that the best rule is when the case is at the appellate court, that there should be a denial of the motion to vacate as a general rule, and I would argue for that rule."
1993.92-1123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1164.103,1167.121,I don't see why the same rule shouldn't apply in the district court under your logic.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1167.121,1174.561,To not permit the district court under... once judgment has been entered to vacate.
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1186.285,1188.785,"Mr. Mintz, what do you mean by, as a general rule?"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1204.08,1221.625,"I would say the Court should adopt an invariable rule in the sense that I have... I have not, at least in my own mind, been able to really come up with a boundary to the--"
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1221.625,1223.458,Even if you were party to the bargain.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1247.839,1254.077,--I would draw the line at when the appeal... when the appeal is filed and docketed in the appellate court--
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1254.077,1254.56,And then even--
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1254.56,1254.96,--And then--
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1254.96,1263.999,"--even if you... even if you wanted the Federal circuit to vacate the district court decision, it would still be--"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1263.999,1266.718,"--That's correct, Your--"
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1266.718,1267.987,--impermissible for the Court to do that.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1267.987,1268.387,--Yes.
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1280.461,1282.378,And interested nonparties.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1282.378,1288.048,"--Even when interested nonparties are willing to say yes, go ahead and do it."
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1288.048,1288.4,Yes.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1288.4,1304.993,"No, I think that the rule for the clearest guidance to the court of appeals and the most consistent operation I think with the principles of collateral estoppel would be to not grant vacatur in that case."
1993.92-1123,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1304.993,1311.647,Why should the cutoff point be the filing of a notice of appeal rather than the entry of judgment in the district court?
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1311.647,1331.56,"It's just that I'm thinking that in terms of the district court, when jurisdiction is still with the district court, the court can entertain a Rule 60 motion and make a determination for itself whether under the circumstances, all circumstances considered, the judgment should be vacated."
1993.92-1123,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.56,1338.797,"Would you say the district court, considering what sort of a motion it would make, should apply the same test as the court of appeals should?"
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1338.797,1340.582,No.
1993.92-1123,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1354.324,1358.711,So that there are some circumstances in which it is just to vacate a judgment.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1358.711,1365.281,"Yes, Your... yes, I would say there are... yes, there are circumstances--"
1993.92-1123,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1365.281,1371.268,"It's just for the district court to vacate, but apparently there are no such circumstances for the court of appeals."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1371.268,1380.457,"--Unless the... there are... the circumstances would be the same, but the difference is that the district court would be familiar with the underlying case."
1993.92-1123,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1380.457,1380.907,So... so--
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1383.826,1397.003,"That is one possibility, and as I say, I believe that is what is done in the Ninth Circuit, but I think the better rule at the appellate level is to simply deny the motion to vacate and dismiss the appeal."
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.003,1398.819,So the problem here was that the parties went to the court.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1427.622,1428.722,I would have a problem with that.
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.722,1429.307,I would think so.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1429.307,1429.89,And I don't think--
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1429.89,1430.64,That's weird.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1430.64,1431.507,--that that would be--
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1431.507,1433.859,Then what's the magic of the district court?
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1440.596,1473.984,"--Well, I think if we have the court of appeals... if we put to the court of appeals to actually go through the merits of the appeal and make a decision, I think once that decision is made, that suggests... and the judgment is affirmed, it suggests to me that the judgment should not be vacated, and the district court in that case... I don't know what the extraordinary circumstances might be to ever have a district court vacate in that situation, but it shouldn't be solely on the basis of settlement in that circumstance where the appellate court has already affirmed the judgment."
1993.92-1123,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1487.91,1492.462,60(b) motion is... what for any other reason?
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1501.401,1513.458,"It conceivably could be brought, but I think in that case the... I would not expect, as a general proposition, that the district court would vacate the judgment."
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.458,1518.077,Why... I don't understand why... why you would allow the district court to do it.
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1538.424,1558.654,"Only because I think that a rule... the Rule 60(b) does permit a... has a mechanism for allowing parties to ask the district court judge to vacate under certain circumstances, and at least the district court judge in that case can weigh these factors."
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.172,1589.207,"Well, 60(b) doesn't make it clear that you can vacate because the parties want it vacated."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1603.949,1605.401,"No, I'm not arguing--"
1993.92-1123,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1605.401,1610.889,"It mentions vacating, but there are many other reasons than merely the parties cutting a deal."
1993.92-1123,0,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,1610.889,1614.774,--I'm certainly not arguing for settlement as being a basis to vacate.
1993.92-1123,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.751,1658.97,"Very well, Mr. Mintz."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,1661.322,1665.857,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1722.527,1752.213,"Mr. Beeney, but wouldn't it be... it could come right back as a result of this now stayed interlocutory appeal in the Seventh Circuit, in the Federal circuit, from the district court, so isn't it kind of a wasted motion to say although Izumi was not a party in this particular proceeding, that very same question could come up via the appeal now lodged in the Federal circuit where Izumi is a party?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,1792.521,1800.444,"--There was an opinion written on Philips' motion for a new trial, and to set aside the verdict, but there was not an opinion written on the merits--"
1993.92-1123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1800.444,1800.91,Right.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,1800.91,1801.544,--of the verdict itself.
1993.92-1123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1802.396,1812.518,"So in all... what is the practical consequence of the vacatur, other than to deprive the judgment of its issue-preclusive effect?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,1812.518,1813.352,That is quite correct.
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1855.01,1858.462,"And of course, if they're right there, why do you bother vacating the judgment?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,1858.462,1860.128,"Well, we believe that they are wrong."
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.128,1863.43,"I think that's the heart of your position, if they're 100 percent wrong."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,1863.43,1865.966,"Oh, absolutely, and should that appeal proceed--"
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.966,1868.751,Otherwise you surely wouldn't pay $57 million to get a judgment vacated.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,1869.234,1874.305,"--In all due respect, Justice Stevens, there were other components to the settlement."
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1888.231,1893.116,"Mr. Beeney, while I've got you interrupted, I'd like to call something to your attention."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,1915.132,1918.251,I'm familiar with the California supreme court's decision in Neary.
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.251,1925.504,"It discusses that, and it also has some statistics about settlement procedures, and the number of settlements affected by the practice and all that."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,1925.504,1928.539,"I have not read the Review article though, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.695,1967.849,"Well, they really couldn't have intervened under general Rule 24 principles in the Florida action, could they?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,1971.401,1972.968,"That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1973.67,1987.311,"So really, it's this particular issue that causes a particular injury to them, and it seems to me that their... the propriety of intervention ought to be judged based on their interest in this issue, not the entire suit."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,1987.311,1990.596,"--Well, the injury, I believe, is caused to Sears, not to Izumi."
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2001.17,2007.741,Would you concede that Sears would have had an interest in intervening in this suit on the appellate level?
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2007.741,2014.728,I think Sears should have been permitted to intervene in order to present its position as to what ought to have been done with the judgment.
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2014.728,2018.782,"They didn't seek to intervene in this litigation, did they?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2018.782,2020.165,"They did not, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.165,2031.173,A person who has an interest in a judgment because that judgment will assist that person's case has a right to intervene?
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2031.173,2044.516,"I think in the circumstances here, Justice Scalia, where Sears had already used the judgment collaterally, I think under the spirit of Rule 24, I think that they would have been a proper party to present their views as to what should have been done with the parties' joint motion to vacate before the Federal--"
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.516,2049.884,"What if they'd already cited the opinion in a brief, as authority?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2049.884,2050.585,--I don't think--
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2050.585,2052.136,There's no collateral estoppel.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2052.136,2070.648,"--I don't think that would have amounted to an adequate interest under Rule 24 to justify intervention, but I think where they had actually used the judgment to attain the elimination of a claim against them... I realize I'm arguing against myself, but I think that they should have been... had they moved, been granted permission to intervene."
1993.92-1123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2070.648,2078.152,"Mr. Beeney, that's strange, because Izumi in the beginning of the world was a party in this Florida litigation, too, wasn't it, on the patent infringement claim?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2078.152,2079.437,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2079.437,2093.996,"And indeed, one of the problems it has is, it was... with the counterclaim that it tried to assert in the Northern District of Illinois, it was told it can't do that because it should have asserted it in the Florida action when it was a party in that action."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2093.996,2095.114,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2095.114,2116.444,"So it's a little odd to me to say that Sears, that was totally out of the Florida litigation, would be a proper intervenor in the Federal circuit litigation and Izumi not, although initially Izumi was a party, and in fact is being told in the Illinois court, you can't raise your antitrust counterclaim here because you were originally in the Florida action, and should have raised it there."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2116.444,2119.73,"Well, I think I would make a distinction as to the timing of intervention."
1993.92-1123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.503,2162.89,"Mr. Beeney, you're not arguing that an opinion written in the case should be vacated?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2162.89,2164.342,"Not at all, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2173.198,2184.321,"Do you argue for a rule of automatic vacatur in all cases, if the parties so stipulate, or is the Ninth Circuit Approach the preferred approach?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2184.321,2187.006,"We would argue for the firm rule, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2208.585,2213.573,So you'd take the same position if the issue was before the district court on a Rule 60 motion.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2213.573,2216.608,"--We would, Your Honor, and there are reasons why we think--"
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2216.608,2221.077,"Rule 60 doesn't, in specific terms, permit that."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2224.612,2232.718,"--No, I would agree that neither Rule 60 nor Rule 42 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure, nor the statute that we cite in our brief, directly speaks to this issue."
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2232.718,2247.045,"Rule 60 talks about whether it's any longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application, and that would seem to me to be inconsistent with an automatic rule of vacatur that you are asserting here."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2247.045,2250.662,"Well, I think the automatic rule has much to say for it for the very reasons of certainty."
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2251.779,2262.737,"It may have much to say for it, but I'm pointing out that that takes away the effect of the language in Rule 60 that the district court is to determine whether it's equitable that the judgment should have prospective application."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2262.737,2274.878,"--Well, I think Rule 60 could be read vis-a-vis these circumstances in that it is always just and equitable to vacate when all parties to a settlement moot their appeal, and that's the way I would urge Rule 60 to be read in this context."
1993.92-1123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2274.878,2282.382,"Mr. Beeney, your answer to the Chief Justice with respect to not at all... the opinion would stand."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2292.506,2298.743,"I think, Justice Ginsburg, the opinion would continue to have whatever persuasive effect by power of its logic."
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2306.83,2308.616,Like a Law Review article... just persuasive effect.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2310.468,2321.776,"Well, the precedential effect, as I understand it, Justice Scalia, comes from the judgment, not from the opinion, that the opinion is the rationale behind the judgment, but the judgment is what is the precedential effect."
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2321.776,2324.727,"So your answer to Justice Ginsburg would be yes, it's like a Law Review article."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2324.727,2326.077,"Well, I think I would submit--"
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.077,2328.262,"A disembodied opinion, without any judgment to go with it."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2328.262,2334.333,--I think I would submit that an opinion written by a court sitting resolving a dispute has far more persuasive reasoning by that fact alone.
1993.92-1123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2334.333,2344.105,"Wouldn't it be misleading to put it in a collection of judgments with accompanying reasons, if its status is simply that of a Law Review article?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2362.501,2368.07,"I think, Justice Ginsburg, the force of the opinion would determine in part on why the judgment was vacated."
1993.92-1123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2386.382,2393.268,"Then you're in agreement that the effect would be like a Law Review article, that it would have no further effect than that?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2393.268,2410.413,"I think I would say that regardless of whether the judgment is vacated, if the purpose of the vacation is because of a settlement, that that should have no effect whatsoever on the persuasive force of the opinion, because the reason for the vacation, the settlement of the parties, doesn't go to the merits of the reasoning behind the opinion."
1993.92-1123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2410.413,2425.84,"Well, supposing the very same issues come up before the same district court which had decided the case in which the judgment was vacated, would it be proper to argue to that court that the district court is bound by stare decisis?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2425.84,2427.692,"I think it would be, Justice Rehnquist--"
1993.92-1123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2427.692,2430.06,Then it does mean more than a Law Review article.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2430.06,2430.493,"--Right, Your Honor."
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2430.493,2435.095,I think you would give the same answer if there was another panel of the same circuit that confronted the same issue.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2435.095,2436.047,We--
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2436.047,2439.582,I take it it would be bound by the earlier opinion as a matter of the law of the circuit.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2444.634,2445.82,"--We would, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-1123,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2447.136,2448.688,So it does have precedential effect?
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2448.688,2449.122,--Yes.
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.68,2464.465,It seems to me there's no such thing as a judicial opinion without a judicial judgment.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2484.545,2495.419,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I don't see why a vacation of a judgment for reasons having nothing to do with the merits of the action needs to have any effect on the persuasiveness of the opinion."
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.653,2498.388,"No, no, no... you keep saying persuasiveness."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2519.415,2538.995,"--As I meant to say originally, if the reason for vacating the opinion has nothing to do with the merits of the decision, it ought to continue to have whatever effect it had with or without the judgment attached to it, and if I may get back, Justice Kennedy, to the question as to why this ought to be a firm rule, it does, we believe, offer quite a bit of advantages to the system."
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2554.172,2561.492,"In your view, Mr. Beeney, should there be any obligation to give notice to third parties who might be affected by the vacation of the judgment?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2561.492,2562.528,"No, Justice--"
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.528,2566.913,They're the only ones who really have an interest in whether it should be reached... preserved or not.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2566.913,2574.601,--I don't think that's a workable rule where the courts or the parties need to go out and attempt to find who might be interested in the issue.
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.601,2580.739,Presumably the parties paying to get the judgment vacated would have a pretty good idea who might be affected by it.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2580.739,2591.713,"They may or they may not, and again, involving the appellate court who receives the motion, and the collateral issue of whether adequate notice has been given, or who the parties who may be, I think is just not a workable rule."
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2591.713,2594.999,"Mr. Beeney, could I ask you the same question that was asked to Mr. Mintz?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2607.807,2612.377,"I think that is the rule that we would argue for, Justice Scalia, although I certainly wouldn't preclude the--"
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2612.377,2614.877,"Well, you'll take something less than that, so long as it applies--"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2618.229,2623.333,"--I think that is the better rule, and obviously, in order to affirm the result below, however, the Court need not go that far."
1993.92-1123,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2623.333,2631.922,"Mr. Beeney, isn't it only fair, though, if you're able to wipe out the preclusive effect, so should Izumi, and it shouldn't be stuck by the compulsory counterclaim rule?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2640.027,2647.531,"I think the counterclaim rule, Justice Ginsburg, goes to a different point, and therefore I would argue your... I would answer you question, no, I don't think it's unfair."
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.223,2686.758,"Let me ask, on the encouraging settlement, what about encouraging settlement before trial?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2690.043,2695.864,"--I think, Justice Stevens, that it has very little effect on the... weighing whether a party should settle--"
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2695.864,2701.285,"If you don't have the rule you propound, wouldn't the defendant face a greater risk in going to trial--"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2701.285,2702.318,--I think they would--
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.318,2704.387,--because he'd know he couldn't buy himself out of an adverse judgment?
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2704.387,2709.522,"--I think they would, but I think in the practicalities of litigation, that that is really purely an academic concern."
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2725.55,2735.739,"Isn't the same thing true after trial, that this possible benefit is only one of the factors that determines the amount of the settlement, it will not necessarily determine whether or not the case will settle?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2735.739,2736.858,Precisely.
1993.92-1123,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2738.458,2745.797,"So then, this rule is not necessary to promote a larger number of settlements, merely promotes settlements taking a somewhat different form?"
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2745.797,2749.249,"--No, I think it does have a profound effect on promoting the number of settlements."
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2772.447,2782.553,But it'll only prompt those settlements in those cases where the effect of the settlement will be to enable future district court litigation.
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2792.009,2792.925,"I think not, Justice Scalia--"
1993.92-1123,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.925,2793.625,Why not?
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2793.625,2799.513,"--for two reasons, 1) this rule has been in effect since this Court's decision at least in Hannon-Clark in the 1930's."
1993.92-1123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2826.23,2827.432,"Thank you, Mr. Beeney."
1993.92-1123,1,24997,garrard_r_beeney,,2827.432,2828.598,I thank Your Honors.
1993.92-1123,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2828.598,2830.634,"Mr. Hungar, we'll hear from you."
1993.92-1123,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2830.634,2838.221,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1123,3,27629,herbert_h_mintz,,2860.236,2860.236,"Thank you, Your Honor. Just one point, and that is that the... a settlement of this type, which basically goes to the quantum of damages that were awarded for the antitrust violation, essentially buys out the adversarial interest, or incentive of the other party and allows through the settlement a claim such as the trade dress claim, which would be the subject of defensive nonmutual collateral estoppel, an asserted right by the party that lost, to be resuscitated just for the payment of enough money to satisfy the other party, and the only real interested parties who would be adversaries are the parties like Sears and Izumi, who are directly affected, and have already been shown to be affected, in the other litigation where that trade dress claim, once dead, has now come back to life, and that's why we say the vacatur on settlement rule completely undermines and is very much inconsistent with collateral estoppel, and the rule should be consistent. Thank you very much."
1993.92-1123,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2860.236,2864.236,"Thank you, Mr. Mintz. The case is submitted."
