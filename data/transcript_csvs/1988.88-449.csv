1988.88-449,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.102,"We'll hear argument now in No. 88-449, John Healy v. The Beer Institute; No. 88-513, Wine and Spirits wholesalers of Connecticut v. The Beer Institute."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,15.941,17.714,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.88-449,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,197.092,200.134,"Counsel, you have no brewery in the State of Connecticut."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,200.134,201.635,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-449,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,203.518,204.496,How does that ever happen?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,214.083,214.504,Yes.
1988.88-449,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,214.504,215.165,Why is this?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,215.165,228.796,"Well, the... that is because we submit in Connecticut prior to 1981, the Connecticut laws were congested with regulatory provisions that protected the local industry."
1988.88-449,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,262.598,264.899,"It's kind of hard on Yale, isn't it?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,264.899,265.79,Pardon me?
1988.88-449,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,265.79,268.321,"I say it's a little hard on Yale, isn't it?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,268.321,270.421,"Well, not at all."
1988.88-449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,288.246,291.258,"Well, but you do allow for quantity discounts in Connecticut?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,291.258,294.302,Quantity discounts are not allowed in Connecticut.
1988.88-449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,294.302,295.081,"But they are in New York, aren't they?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,295.081,295.863,They are.
1988.88-449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.195,303.006,How do you explain that as consistent with your policy in trying to make the market real competitive?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,303.006,310.943,"--Well, it's... the net effect is that the price of beer is lower in Connecticut now, that it has worked."
1988.88-449,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,322.7,331.056,"Of... of course, if that's true and quantity discounts are irrelevant, you wouldn't... you wouldn't need this statute."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,331.056,331.987,Well--
1988.88-449,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,331.987,340.883,"But the problem is that with quantity discounts in... in New York, a New York price per se just has really no relation to the Connecticut market structure."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,340.883,348.527,"--Well, you're... I think you're making some assumptions about the marketplace in New York and... and in Connecticut."
1988.88-449,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.511,383.559,"Well, I guess the point is, as Justice Stevens' question illustrates, you say, well, Connecticut is really eliminated... a rigidly controlled market, but it still abolishes... or it still prohibits quantity discounts."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,385.833,400.961,"--Well, I... I'm not sure that the ability or disability to give quantity discounts has much to do with the competitiveness of the... of the Connecticut industry since the net effect is that we do have lower prices in Connecticut now."
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.214,405.133,Lower than what?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,408.948,409.669,"--Well, lower in comparison to other states."
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.585,420.056,Do you have lower prices than New York now?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,421.047,424.259,"No, they're not lower than New York now, but we don't have--"
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,424.259,424.798,--Lower than what?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,424.798,425.89,--the price difference that--
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.89,427.242,They're lower than what?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,428.771,433.355,--They're... they're lower in comparison to New York as they used to be in 1981.
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.355,435.196,They're lower than they used to be is all you're saying.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,435.196,435.436,"Yes, right."
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.436,438.839,"They're still higher than New York, but... but lower than they used to be."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,438.839,445.835,"Well, the actual prices are... are not a matter of record, but they may very well be still a little bit higher than they are in New York."
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.738,469.803,"Well, what... is it your submission that Connecticut's posting law has no effect at all on the prices in New York, for example?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,469.803,472.154,"That's exactly what we're saying, Your Honor."
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,472.945,477.41,"And... and so, what was the purpose of your posting law?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,477.41,483.955,"--Well, the... the essential purpose of the posting law is so that regulators know what price is in effect in Connecticut."
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.312,493.812,"Well, that's the posting law."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,495.274,497.604,--The affirmation law--
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,497.604,498.245,What's the purpose of that?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,498.245,507.111,"--Well, the purpose of that I think, as I was getting at before, is that the general assembly made a policy change in 1982."
1988.88-449,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.128,523.336,"So, would you concede that the goal is to... of the... of the affirmation law is to eliminate the price disparity between Connecticut and other states?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,523.336,524.745,That's exactly right.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,524.745,524.996,All right.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,528.439,529.751,"No, Your Honor, it doesn't."
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.023,533.313,"--Well, the--"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,533.313,534.223,As you understand--
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,534.223,537.033,--The Court below thought... certainly thought it did.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,537.033,539.885,--I don't think any of the trial courts agreed with that.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,551.595,552.785,What did the court of appeals say?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,552.785,555.567,The court of appeals didn't address that issue at all.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.567,555.787,What--
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,555.787,556.758,It... it let that stand.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.873,562.233,--Uh-hum.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,562.233,569.089,They found that this... the... the law at the time prevented brewers from lowering their prices in other states because if they did that--
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.089,572.16,"Well, that... that... that means that it has an effect on pricing in other states."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,572.16,573.642,"--It does, but I don't think--"
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,573.642,575.534,"Well, that's what... that's what I asked."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,576.555,578.095,--I'm trying to make the distinction now.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.147,696.335,But it did say that the effect of your affirmation law... posting an affirmation... was that the companies couldn't change their prices in other states.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,696.335,698.465,"Well, I think it--"
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.465,701.908,"For all practical purposes, they couldn't because of the laws of the other states."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,701.908,702.098,--Yes.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.651,713.017,"And so, you were really achieving by your... by your new... by your new law or the present law what you... you had the same effect as under the old law, didn't you?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,713.017,716.039,"--That's exactly what the court felt, and I think that's how they ruled."
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.039,720.221,And do you think it... do you disagree that it had the same effect?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,720.221,725.445,"No, I don't think I disagree with that in that they're not--"
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.445,729.718,And... and don't you think the legislature wanted it to have the same effect?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,729.718,730.039,--No.
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.844,764.894,Mr.... go on.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,766.105,771.328,--And we submit that this is not a constitutional deficiency because of this.
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.409,781.315,--Can... can I ask about... about the discrimination against interstate commerce aspect you've just been talking about the affecting the laws of other states.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,818.146,822.017,"--Well, are you saying that it discriminates against Connecticut brewers?"
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.017,825.099,It... no.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,831.594,834.806,"And there's... there are no brewers, and they are also--"
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.806,835.558,"Well, there may--"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,835.558,837.027,--They must sell to wholesalers.
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.682,843.602,"--Yes, but therefore--"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,843.602,843.762,xxx.
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.762,846.253,"--Therefore, if you're smart, don't sell in New York."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,865.578,865.728,Well--
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.728,874.394,--the facial discriminatory nature of a... of a particular law on the basis of whether there currently are any... any people being benefited by it.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,874.394,876.768,"--Well, I don't think that constitutes a discrimination, Your Honor."
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.696,892.779,"Gee, well... then there's no such thing as discriminating against interstate commerce."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,897.654,897.954,Well--
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,897.954,898.834,That can't be right.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,898.834,904.937,"--The... the... there are no brewers in Connecticut, so that is a hypothetical--"
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.937,906.119,"Well, there might--"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,922.255,924.766,"--Well, how does it interfere with interstate commerce?"
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.766,932.282,"You're discouraging me from selling outside of Connecticut because once I do, then... then... then I have a price constraint when I sell within Connecticut."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,938.025,943.881,"Well, I... I'm falling to see the discrimination because you're... you're... I think it's talking about apples and oranges."
1988.88-449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.988,969.32,"No, his point is they're free to--"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,969.32,970.332,--who are not located in Connecticut can sell elsewhere.
1988.88-449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.332,971.37,--His point is they're free to sell higher in Connecticut.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,977.483,977.733,"Well, I'm just not following."
1988.88-449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.965,1009.125,"--Oh, I... I don't think that's right--"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1009.125,1011.027,There are two different categories and two different classifications in--
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.027,1021.696,--You... you're telling me that you don't violate the Commerce Clause so long as you treat people who do business only in Connecticut differently from people who are interstate business people.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1021.696,1032.244,"--I think so, and that's especially true under the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution where each state... if I'm... if I'm not giving an acceptable answer to you on that, at least under the Twenty-first Amendment--"
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1032.244,1032.395,Well--
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1032.395,1034.285,--It's certainly valid for them to do that--
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1034.285,1034.546,--That's--
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1034.546,1036.659,--because there they're just regulating commerce within the state.
1988.88-449,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1056.892,1066.329,"--Mr. Vacchelli, if this case involved a product other than alcoholic beverages, would you think that a posting statute would violate the Commerce Clause?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1066.329,1068.01,That's difficult to answer.
1988.88-449,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1085.834,1097.849,"Well, why isn't it a protectionist purpose for the... the state to try to obtain a competitive advantage for its own consumers?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1097.849,1111.26,"Connecticut isn't trying to contain to give a competitive advantage to Connecticut over New York, Massachusetts or Rhode Island."
1988.88-449,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1154.602,1157.263,You're trying to protect your local consumers.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1157.263,1162.338,--We're trying to get the best prices for beer for our consumers that we can.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.338,1163.838,"You're trying to protect your retail dealers, aren't you?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1163.838,1170.652,"That, as I... that is also... it's... we're not trying to make them in a better position than anyone else."
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.074,1181.329,Could I ask you just... New York has... permits volume discounts.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1181.329,1183.793,They permit quantity discounts.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1183.793,1184.571,"I mean, quantity discounts."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1184.571,1185.282,There is... there is a difference.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.282,1187.092,And in Connecticut you cannot give them.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1187.092,1187.693,That's correct.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.693,1198.301,"Now, what if the... what if the... do the... do the brewers selling in New York have to... when they post under the New York law, they have to post their quantity discounts?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1198.301,1200.893,I'm not sure about that.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1200.893,1205.097,"Well, let's assume there is a quantity discount in effect in New York."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1205.097,1205.467,Yes.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1205.467,1210.632,"Now, at what price do they have to sell in Connecticut?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1224.69,1230.745,"Well, the... the... it's yes, but that's... I don't think that situation exists."
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.745,1231.186,Why?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1231.186,1235.399,There's no evidence in the record that only small wholesalers get quantity discounts.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1237.3,1238.581,"Well, I know, but... but--"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1238.581,1240.452,We do get the lowest price that's offered.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.908,1255.472,"--Well, but they can't be giving your... your people quantity discounts."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1255.472,1256.503,That's right.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1265.129,1269.372,Don't you think that has some consequence on... on their pricing and... their quantity discount pricing in New York?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1269.372,1271.473,"--There's no evidence of that, Your Honor."
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1297.923,1305.499,"But you do... but... but if they want to give quantity discounts in New York, they're going to have to sell beer at that quantity discount price in Connecticut."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1305.499,1306.427,--Yes.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.427,1317.897,Even though... even though none of the buyers happen to... happen to be buying in quantities big enough to justify a discount.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1317.897,1321.289,"That's... well, that's correct."
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.5,1324.66,I know.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1324.66,1326.513,--or volume discounts because all wholesalers--
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1326.513,1326.953,I know.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1326.953,1327.582,--must be treated the same.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.582,1337.559,"But you force the companies to sell at that lower price even though if they had a quantity discount system, none of these people would qualify for the quantity discount."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1337.559,1338.32,"Well, it's possible."
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.92,1350.871,Well--
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1350.871,1352.511,There is no evidence of... of that.
1988.88-449,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.511,1359.908,--Pennsylvania comes in here and says the effect it has on... on the market is that the brewers won't give us quantity discounts anymore.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1359.908,1370.664,"Well, Pennsylvania is... is trying to get prices lower than anyone else in the country, and that's exactly why affirmation laws came into effect in the first place."
1988.88-449,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1375.537,1378.227,What is the... what is the basic purpose of an affirmation law?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1385.493,1404.237,"--Well, I think generally they were enacted for both purposes: one, to prevent discrimination, geographic price discrimination which is the same kind of theory as under the Robinson Patman Act, and secondly, to... to get better prices for their consumers vis-a-vis other states."
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.099,1465.53,"Mr. Vacchelli, would the following law be... be constitutional in your view?"
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1485.065,1490.009,"Yes, as long as it's not protectionist and as long as it doesn't burden interstate commerce."
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1490.009,1490.71,"Well, why... but that's the point."
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1500.407,1505.733,"Well, I think you have to see what it does to the marketplace and how it interferes with interstate commerce."
1988.88-449,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1506.361,1508.704,We can't say that facially it discriminates against interstate commerce?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1508.704,1522.293,"--On its face it's dealing with two different categories, two different classifications of dealers, one that's only involved in Connecticut and one that's involved in interstate commerce."
1988.88-449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.293,1524.335,May I ask this question?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1529.24,1529.591,Yes.
1988.88-449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.591,1534.385,What happens to beer that might be imported from Tennessee of Canada or something like that?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1537.608,1542.172,The system is every product has to have a shipper.
1988.88-449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.645,1559.495,But then is... I'm still not quite clear.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1574.746,1575.137,That's right.
1988.88-449,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.137,1575.597,Yes.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1575.597,1583.925,"And considering the hypotheticals, Your Honor, the real world is that there are no brewers in Connecticut."
1988.88-449,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1595.452,1596.304,Counsel--
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1596.304,1597.876,And a core power that it's being exercised--
1988.88-449,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1597.876,1614.379,--Do... do... do we have any case in which we say that market behavior of a regulated entity in some other state can be the premise for legislation in the home state?
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1614.379,1625.204,"--Well, Seagram's is the only one that comes to mind immediately in that we can regulate with reference to prices--"
1988.88-449,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1625.204,1633.639,And you read... you read... you read that for the proposition that outside market behavior is a valid regulatory premise under the Commerce Clause.
1988.88-449,0,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,1633.639,1646.078,"--Well, it's not exactly the same thing, but it's very similar in that states are free to... to put on price controls on the sale of liquor within their states with reference to what's happening in other states."
1988.88-449,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.112,1710.705,"Very well, Mr. Vacchelli."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,1711.746,1728.377,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.875,1783.524,"When you say purposefully regulates, Mr. Glekel, you put to one side, I take it, cases in which a local law will have an effect, although it's not designed to have that effect in another state."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,1783.524,1784.285,--That's right.
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.825,2011.367,"Mr. Glekel, supposing that Connecticut passed the converse of this sort of a statute in the interest of a... a mild form of prohibition requiring that the brewers affirm that the prices in the neighboring states were no lower."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2015.912,2044.439,"If they were to affirm that the prices... if they had to affirm that the prices in the bordering states were no lower, it would have Commerce Clause consequences somewhat... somewhat in reverse since it would tend to... it would have the effect of preventing or at least strongly discouraging higher prices in the bordering states if the brewers intended or wanted to charge higher prices--"
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2044.439,2046.111,Or keeping prices in Connecticut high.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2046.111,2048.482,--Or keeping prices in Connecticut high.
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2049.911,2054.567,Would that... would that be good or bad under the Commerce Clause and under the Twenty-first Amendment?
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2054.567,2065.844,"--Well, we would take the position that it would still be exporting Connecticut price regulations beyond Connecticut's borders and influencing prices in other states."
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.844,2078.851,"Even though it's a perfectly permissible purpose, I take it, for Connecticut under the Twenty-first Amendment to say we want to... we don't want to prohibit beer consumption outright but we want to keep the price high so that not many people drink very much."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2078.851,2083.036,That's a permissible purpose under the... assuming that was the purpose.
1988.88-449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.851,2174.551,"Well, Mr.... Mr. Glekel, if... if... If New York didn't have a... some kind of a posting law, if the... if the... if a company... if a distiller could lower his prices there anytime he wanted to, would the Connecticut law be valid then?"
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2174.551,2188.453,"Assuming that all... that prices could be lowered in any of the bordering states anytime the brewer wanted to, our view is that the law could still be unconstitutional."
1988.88-449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.8,2218.122,"Of course, I doubt... probably Connecticut wouldn't have this statute then if--"
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2218.122,2219.023,"--Well, I just--"
1988.88-449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.023,2221.254,--If it were so easy to change the prices in other states.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2221.254,2236.165,"--I was just going to add that Connecticut's statute would scarcely achieve the purpose it was designed to achieve, which Mr. Vacchelli believes that it was achieving, if in fact consumers had an incentive to travel from Connecticut across state lines--"
1988.88-449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.165,2236.365,Just wait a day.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2236.365,2237.046,--every day but one.
1988.88-449,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.046,2238.358,"Just wait a day, yes."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2245.97,2250.545,What the... what the record--
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.545,2253.788,"Do we... do we know, for example, that they ever reduce the price in New York?"
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2253.788,2253.915,--Yes.
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2296.856,2298.608,But that doesn't say anything about price changes.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2304.763,2316.16,"Well, I think there are also statements in the record that there is a... that the New York markets are significantly more competitive... New York and Massachusetts, Rhode Island markets."
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.907,2363.552,"Well, does that... that material in the record indicate then that there have... there have been continuing price changes from time to time in New York despite the Connecticut statute?"
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2363.552,2367.355,"Well, the record--"
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2367.355,2370.097,Let me put it a different way.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2376.871,2380.764,--The present... the... the present statute.
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.764,2381.105,Yes.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2381.105,2391.093,"No, there's nothing in the record as to what has occurred since the actual enactment of the... of the Connecticut affirmation statute."
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2392.595,2401.481,"You started to explain earlier... and I was kind of curious, and I don't think you ever completed it... how the Connecticut statute might prevent price changes in New York."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2403.624,2408.777,"--Well, under the New York... New York does not have an affirmation requirement--"
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.777,2408.948,Right.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2408.948,2409.889,--unlike Connecticut.
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.274,2420.694,He has got to hold it for six months.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2420.694,2425.686,--that price promotion has to stay in effect for a... six months or a hundred... or 180 days.
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2425.686,2425.977,Right.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2425.977,2431.941,"It can be offered to a particular wholesaler or a particular region, but it has to remain in effect."
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.036,2453.426,Right.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2453.426,2468.726,"Plus the fact that brewer, after posting the price required by the Connecticut affirmation statute following the beginning of the promotion, can't just reassess the situation and say, gee, this doesn't make any economic sense."
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.721,2477.113,But that's a consequence of the New York statute.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2479.685,2499.547,"I don't believe so because it is really only the Connecticut statute, not the statutes of New York or Massachusetts or Rhode Island, that deliberately crosses state lines by referencing in-state prices and practices to out-of-state practices and prices."
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.609,2530.34,"Well, does that mean that every state is limited to the least restrictive form of regulation of the liquor business because if it adopts anything more restrictive like Connecticut does, it's going to interfere with neighboring states which have a more relaxed regime?"
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2530.34,2554.876,"No, it doesn't mean that, but I think it does mean if a state undertakes or enacts a statute that is designed to give a benefit to in-state businesses at the expense of out-of-state businesses and does this with the intent and effect of imposing a burden on out-of-state businesses, that violates the Commerce Clause despite the Twenty-first Amendment."
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2573.95,2579.045,You... you answered earlier in response to my hypothetical that it wouldn't make any difference if we were.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2586.167,2588.371,--Not any extraterritorial--
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2588.371,2589.883,"Well, but my... my hypothesis."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2589.883,2590.574,"--Yes, yes."
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2595.92,2600.825,Even though it... it has a perfectly legitimate motive to promote temperance.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2600.825,2621.35,"Yes, because it was promoting the temperance through... through protectionist means and, in effect, was attempting to pose a burden on the brewers and consumers and businesses in the bordering states in order to achieve the goals that it was seeking on behalf of the affirmation state."
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2621.931,2625.454,How would it impose a burden on consumers and border states?
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2625.454,2636.032,--Because it might well interfere with the policies of the border states under the Twenty-first Amendment who may take a very different view of what is desirable.
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2646.623,2649.077,But why... why should that view prevail over the more restrictive view?
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2652.509,2664.226,Because at some point if a state enacts legislation to further its view that references out-of-state practices as the measure of what's permitted in state.
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2749.273,2752.716,"Well, isn't that a permissible purpose under the Twenty-first Amendment?"
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2757.1,2773.8,"It may be a permissible purpose, but it's not a purpose that under the Twenty-first Amendment would enable a state to adopt extraterritorial or... or protectionist legislation."
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.001,2782.857,But your position is that no... no... even temperance purposes under the Twenty-first Amendment wouldn't... would not allow the state to adopt extraterritorial.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2782.857,2787.631,"--That... that is our position, and I... I think Brown-Forman supports that position."
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2924.084,2928.257,I really must confess I'm puzzled about another aspect that this example points up.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2940.797,2950.934,The... I think what you're suggesting is that under the supremacy--
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2950.934,2957.459,"Well, there's a federal statute that says you can't discriminate between competing purchasers who are similarly situated."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2970.238,2970.579,--No.
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.04,2972.532,And the statute is designed to prevent that.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,2972.532,2983.651,"--I... I think as the record below indicates, the Connecticut brewers... the brewers basically sell beer in the New York and Connecticut markets based upon competitive provisions."
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3007.188,3007.446,Right.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,3007.446,3009.349,A Connecticut wholesaler to a Connecticut retailer.
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3009.349,3013.082,You're saying the problem is that the markup is higher in Connecticut.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,3013.082,3019.684,"Well, what we are suggesting, part of the problem is undoubtedly that the markup is higher in... in Connecticut."
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3057.607,3070.195,"Mr. Glekel, what if Connecticut adopted a state liquor store policy of simply saying that the only people that can sell liquor in Connecticut or beer are liquor... are the state liquor stores."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,3081.882,3084.674,There may very well be.
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3091.038,3095.203,"Well, certainly lots of states have adopted it so far as liquor is concerned."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,3095.203,3110.203,"They certainly have, and I recognize that some of this Court... this Court's decisions have held that when a state acts in a proprietary capacity of this sort, Commerce Clause restraints don't necessarily apply."
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.699,3151.992,Then how is the state liquor business supposed go about purchasing from brewers?
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,3154.403,3166.993,"--Well, what Pennsylvania suggested in its amicus brief, that brewers should probably... that the state should bargain with the brewers or distillers, whatever, just like any other customer would."
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3166.993,3172.035,And might you not bargain to say I won't pay you a bit more than you charge New York wholesalers?
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,3172.035,3176.379,I suppose there's always the question of fact.
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3334.693,3341.989,"Mr. Glekel, supposing Connecticut passed a statute saying we will appoint a price control commission and we'll hire investigators to find out what the prices are in New York."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,3350.697,3359.292,I think there's... there always can be a question of fact whether a state is doing indirectly what's... what is... what is directly prohibited.
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3364.745,3368.628,"Well, the other factors it takes into account are the prices in Rhode Island and New Jersey."
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,3368.628,3371.451,--That sounds like it's unconstitutional to me.
1988.88-449,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3371.451,3376.987,I see.
1988.88-449,1,30514,jeffrey_ives_glekel,,3377.828,3384.821,As long as they're really not designed to deprive consumers and brewers in other states of... of their competitive advantages.
1988.88-449,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3430.174,3431.694,"Thank you, Mr. Glekel."
1988.88-449,2,40670,robert_f_vacchelli,,3434.097,3438.611,"Just one point, Your Honor, and that's on the matter of the Seagram's case."
1988.88-449,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3488.225,3490.007,"Your time has expired, Mr. Vacchelli."
