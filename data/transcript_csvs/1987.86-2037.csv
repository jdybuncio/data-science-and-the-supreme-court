1987.86-2037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.772,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 86-2037, Paul G. Landers versus National Railroad Passenger Corporation."
1987.86-2037,0,19536,clinton_j_miller_iii,,13.808,17.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-2037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.712,415.186,"Well, Mr. Miller, Section 153 First (j) provides that in proceedings before the Railroad Adjustment Board, you will have counsel of your choice, doesn't it, or union of your choice?"
1987.86-2037,0,19536,clinton_j_miller_iii,,415.186,416.222,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-2037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.222,421.257,So that the alternate representation certainly means something there.
1987.86-2037,0,19536,clinton_j_miller_iii,,421.257,422.459,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-2037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.193,459.632,"But it does mean, doesn't it, that the right to be represented by the union of your choice is effective at that level?"
1987.86-2037,0,19536,clinton_j_miller_iii,,459.632,460.667,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-2037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.667,464.869,So it's not just a social club.
1987.86-2037,0,19536,clinton_j_miller_iii,,464.869,468.488,That is correct to an extent.
1987.86-2037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,544.071,554.693,"Counsel, in the Adjustment Board Hearing, is the employee entitled to introduce new evidence at any time, or is he always confined to the record below?"
1987.86-2037,0,19536,clinton_j_miller_iii,,554.693,566.417,"Justice Kennedy, the general rule is often stated that one may not raise anything in arbitration that has not been dealt with on the property, that has not been raised on the property."
1987.86-2037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,566.417,574.34,"Well, are there ever hearings in which the employee is allowed to introduce evidence at the Adjustment Board level?"
1987.86-2037,0,19536,clinton_j_miller_iii,,574.34,576.209,"Not that I'm aware of, Justice Kennedy."
1987.86-2037,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,700.773,716.449,"Mr. Miller, I wonder whether the Court in the Pennsylvania Railroad case didn't take a much more limited view of Section 2 Eleventh (c) than you are advocating here."
1987.86-2037,0,19536,clinton_j_miller_iii,,720.686,735.363,"Justice O'Connor, I would agree that there was much discussion about the limited purpose to eliminate the problem of free riders, but I would point out that the issue that was in front of the Court was itself a very limited one at that time."
1987.86-2037,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,744.635,752.973,"Well, it strikes me that you're asking for a much broader interpretation of that section than I thought the Court had given it."
1987.86-2037,0,19536,clinton_j_miller_iii,,752.973,764.28,"Justice O'Connor, I guess all I can say in response is that I don't believe that the Court was required to go as far as we are seeking here because of the limited issue that was involved."
1987.86-2037,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,764.813,777.456,"Well, do you think that Section 3 First would possibly take precedence here in telling us what to do on these specific grievances?"
1987.86-2037,0,19536,clinton_j_miller_iii,,777.456,785.629,"--No, Justice O'Connor, I don't, because I believe you're referring to 3 First (i), the usual manner handling which was passed in 1934."
1987.86-2037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1158.839,1160.339,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
1987.86-2037,1,27901,harold_a_ross,,1163.725,1167.344,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-2037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1367.658,1370.943,"Mr. Ross, you emphasized, the company level?"
1987.86-2037,1,27901,harold_a_ross,,1370.943,1371.893,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-2037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1371.893,1373.812,What other levels are there?
1987.86-2037,1,27901,harold_a_ross,,1373.812,1379.299,There are two levels: the company level would be where you go through the stages of handling grievances.
1987.86-2037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1414.453,1420.09,And is there any representation at any other level?
1987.86-2037,1,27901,harold_a_ross,,1420.09,1433.867,"Once it goes beyond that level, then the individual, as Mr. Miller indicated, may represent himself before the arbitrator, the First Division of the National Railroad Adjustment Board, or he may be represented by any union of his choice, or by an attorney."
1987.86-2037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.383,1998.018,"You're not asserting that that's required by the Statute, are you?"
1987.86-2037,1,27901,harold_a_ross,,1998.018,2003.822,"--Your Honor, I believe that that was the intent of the draftsman that yes, that the Brotherhood of Locomotive--"
1987.86-2037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.822,2012.677,"Well, that may have been what they expected, but you mean that we have to read this section so that if you're permanently assigned to one of the crafts, you have to join the union for that?"
1987.86-2037,1,27901,harold_a_ross,,2012.677,2018.331,"--For the purposes of deciding this case, Justice Scalia, I don't believe that the Court has to go that far."
1987.86-2037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.21,2267.36,"Thank you, Mr. Ross."
1987.86-2037,2,19536,clinton_j_miller_iii,,2270.745,2275.166,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1987.86-2037,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2467.44,2469.507,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
