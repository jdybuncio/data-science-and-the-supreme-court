2017.141-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case -- the original case Number 141, Texas versus New Mexico and Colorado. Ms. O'Connell."
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Rio Grande Compact is an unusual interstate compact in that it does not require New Mexico to deliver water to the Texas state line."
2017.141-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,I'd -- I'd like to know what they are.
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"You're asking about the difference between a compact claim and a claim brought under reclamation law, for example?"
2017.141-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,The treaty or reclamation?
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"I think the -- the problem we're trying to avoid here is that when the United States sues somebody for a violation of reclamation law, taking water from a reclamation project without a contract or acting in a way that undermines the United States' ability to comply with a treaty, it's typically suing the individual water users that are violating those laws or interfering with that obligation of the United States to deliver water under a treaty. What we're trying to avoid here is a future motion to dismiss filed by New Mexico, which -- which indicates or insinuates on page 14 of its reply brief that actions brought under reclamation law or under the treaty should be filed against individual water users. We think we can file these claims against New Mexico because of the compact."
2017.141-orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,"Well, did you or did you not file a claim under the -- under reclamation law? The Special Master said he recognized a claim under that law, but did you make any claim under that law or were you staking your claim on your contact -- compact claim?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"Our complaint doesn't distinguish between claims brought under the compact and claims brought under reclamation law. What -- what our complaint does, as we've done in other cases where we've intervened as a plaintiff, is set forth what the United States' interests are and then tell the Court how we think it can shape injunctive relief against New Mexico to protect those interests."
2017.141-orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,"Well, could you -- can you explain at the outset, you're not claiming that every -- every time there's a compact approved by Congress, you would have a right to come into court as a party, right?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,That's correct. We're --
2017.141-orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,"And so what's the dividing line between when you can come in as a party under a compact and when, despite a com -- compact, you can't come in?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"Where -- where the compact protects specific federal interests that are at stake in the dispute that's been filed in this Court, then we believe the United States can -- can intervene as a plaintiff and bring claims against New Mexico that are based on that compact."
2017.141-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,"Well, what's the federal interest that was in the compact? The compact does not make any reference to your treaty obligations or to how you meet those. It doesn't appear to make any reference to any of the federal interests that you've been identifying."
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,Okay.
2017.141-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,Make the connection.
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,I think it -- it very clearly does refer to our treaty obligations in a way that protects them.
2017.141-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,What --
2017.141-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,What error in the format --
2017.141-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"-- what -- what difference does it make -- I mean, if -- if you are not entitled to raise this claim as a party, certainly you can participate as an amicus and make whatever arguments you want about how the compact should be properly construed, right?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,That's correct.
2017.141-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,So what difference does it make to you which way we rule on the question whether or not you're entitled to raise these claims yourself?
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,I think a couple of reasons.
2017.141-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"This is a pretty basic question I suppose I should know, but can you compromise state rights in the negotiation and determination of a treaty? Could you negotiate a treaty with Mexico that says we're going to give you this many acre-feet of water that is already appropriated somewhere else? And then that treaty obligation trumps whatever the prior allocations are?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,I'm not totally sure. I -- I think probably yes.
2017.141-orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,0,0,"Well, it -- usually the latter in time prevails because Congress can pass a statute after a treaty."
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,Well --
2017.141-orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,0,0,"-- this is not a completely clear area of the law, but there -- there is a general working rule applied in some of the cases that the later-in-time controls if there's a conflict between a treaty and a later federal statute."
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,And -- and we don't think there's any kind of a conflict here.
2017.141-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,Ms. O'Connell --
2017.141-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"I don't understand what -- what you mean when you say that if you're not a party, you're not going to be bound by the decree. I mean, if we determine that New Mexico is free to take additional water, whatever it is under the -- under -- between the end of the reservoir and -- and -- and the borderline, what does it mean to say you're not bound by that?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"Well, I think that's -- it's sort of the flip side of the argument that we're a required party."
2017.141-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,"Would I be right, though, that -- that your argument would also allow you to have initiated the suit in the first place? In other words, even if there hadn't been a suit between the states, that you could have said: New Mexico is -- is taking too much water and is preventing us from meeting our obligations and -- and that you could have initiated a suit under the compact?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,Yes.
2017.141-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,"Well, what's the difference? How could we say, yes, you have the right to intervene, even though you don't have the right to bring your own suit initially?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"The Court's standard for intervention is that intervention of the United States is appropriate where there is distinctive federal interests at stake that are best presented by the United States. So, I mean, I guess the Court could say, you know, we don't have any claims, but we could be a defendant, something like that."
2017.141-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,0,0,"Ms. O'Connell, one of the federal interests you've asserted is the treaty with Mexico."
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,I am not sure.
2017.141-orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,It has been executed for how many years?
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,It's been in existence since 1906.
2017.141-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,"I'm sorry, you said it was a public law."
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"I mean, it was enacted in -- in the -- the Statutes at Large."
2017.141-orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,0,0,"It is enacted, unlike some treaties, it's enacted as a statute?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,That's correct.
2017.141-orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,0,0,"Well, that's the end of that, isn't it?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,Okay.
2017.141-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,0,0,"Is it -- do we know that that's the end of that? I mean, it sounds like you haven't studied the question of whether it's self-executing or not. Does the government have a position on that?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,I don't.
2017.141-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,0,0,Okay.
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,I don't.
2017.141-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,0,0,All right.
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"Justice Kagan, to get back to your question, the reason why we think that we can bring a claim to enforce this compact against New Mexico is based on this Court's line of cases, that we've cited a few in our briefs, Sanitary District of Chicago versus United States, and a Fourth Circuit case, the County of Arlington versus United States, where this Court and -- and the Fourth Circuit in that case have held that the United States can bring suits for injunctive relief to protect federal interests that are at stake in a dispute. In Sanitary District of Chicago, the United States sued an Illinois corporation that was using too much water, water in excess of its permit allocation."
2017.141-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,"And if I could return -- I'm sorry -- to Justice Sotomayor's question to make sure I understood the answer to it. I know you're afraid that if this goes forward under reclamation law, you might be subject to this motion to dismiss on the ground that you can't sue a state under that law. But putting that aside, is the content of the two suits, if you had brought the -- the suit under reclamation law, and if you had brought the suit under the compact, is the content of the suits different or the same?"
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"I think it's -- it's the same, because -- and that's part of the reason why we are filing an exception here to the Master's recommendation that our complaint has to be dismissed to the extent it states a compact claim, is that the reason we think New Mexico is bound by these obligations to protect the Project and to have its water users not violate reclamation law or undermine the treaty is because New Mexico has signed onto the compact agreeing to protect the Project."
2017.141-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"Your -- your -- your argument really is like an implied right of action argument, isn't it? I mean, the compact doesn't give you any rights and yet you say because it affects your interests, you have a right to sue. And you make the third-party beneficiary argument, which is an argument that's often made to support an implied right of action."
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"Well, our --"
2017.141-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"By saying we're not going to approve -- we're not going to approve it unless we have the right to bring, you know, claims to enforce it? And you could imagine a group of states or two states saying: All right, I'm happy to agree with this, but we don't want the United States coming in and -- and, you know, mucking everything up. And so long as you're okay with that, and -- and -- and, you know, you give your consent, I don't know why you should be allowed to litigate as a party."
2017.141-orig,0,16657,ann_oconnell,,0,0,"I'm -- I'm not aware of any compacts where the United States has preserved that right for itself to intervene and bring suits to bring people into compliance with a compact. I think here, I wouldn't necessarily think of it so much as a compact claim but a suit for equitable relief where the relief we're asking for is that New Mexico be required to comply with its compact obligations. That's where this -- the implied right of action is coming, just from this Court's cases like Sanitary District, In re Debs, the San Jacinto Tin Company, it's more of just an equitable action. And because this Court is -- is acting in equity when it's interpreting interstate compacts, the relief that we're seeking is that New Mexico be brought into compliance with its compact obligations. If I could, I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal."
2017.141-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"Thank you, counsel. General Keller."
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The U.S. can raise its own compact claims because the compact creates a statutory duty for the U.S. to distribute water to Texas. This statutory duty arises from three key facts. First, the U.S. owns and operates the Rio Grande Project."
2017.141-orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,0,0,"Could the United States file, General Keller, an -- an action in the district court in the absence of a dispute between Texas and Mexico -- and -- and New Mexico, and the suit would say there's a violation of -- of the compact even though there's no dispute between the states?"
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,"Yes, because of the nature of this unique compact."
2017.141-orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,Could you tell me --
2017.141-orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,0,0,Excuse me.
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,"No, that would be a --"
2017.141-orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,0,0,Or is that the same -- is that just another way of saying the same thing?
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,I believe it -- it is another way of saying the same thing.
2017.141-orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,Now I understand. You are actually taking the position that the federal government can't sue another state for reclamation claims.
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,That -- that is -- that is probably correct because there would not necessarily be a -- a state law basis under the Reclamation Act to -- to invoke a lawsuit against a sovereign state.
2017.141-orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,"So unless the government can claim that New Mexico has an obligation and it can, therefore, sue under the compact, that's why -- now I understand."
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,"And -- and not only that but also under Hinderlider and that line of cases, when there are these disputes between states, it is going to be New Mexico's duty to prevent diversions of water."
2017.141-orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,Your brief says let the U.S. intervene but not beyond addressing any legal matter beyond the compact claims.
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,"No, and --"
2017.141-orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,Seems like an advisory opinion to the Special Master.
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,"Well, you would not necessarily have to opine on precisely how the litigation will go forward; however, the -- the crux of this lawsuit is an interstate equitable apportionment compact claim."
2017.141-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"Why is that? I -- I mean, is this really just a question of timing? I mean, they're saying the United States can't raise these claims because of our view about how the compact applies."
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,"And, Mr. Chief Justice, from our perspective, the practical difference is going to be minimal."
2017.141-orig,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,"I think I should have asked Ms. O'Connell this, but do you view the United States' interests as diverging from Texas's interests in any way?"
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,"We -- yes, we will have some disputes, and this will come up later in the litigation, over precisely how the equitable apportionment should be calculated, but for purposes of the question presented to this Court today, we do not diverge and we believe the United States should be able to raise its own compact claims."
2017.141-orig,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,"No, but I meant as the litigation proceeds, would there be a difference if only you were in the lawsuit as -- you know, and with, presumably, the United States as an amicus versus having the United States in as a party?"
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,"Well, potentially, Justice Kagan, just based on the -- the arguments that would be raised as to whether the equitable apportionment was actually being fulfilled."
2017.141-orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,I'm not sure you're answering Justice Kagan.
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,"Well, one issue --"
2017.141-orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,In what -- what issues? Are there issues in which there can be a difference?
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,Possibly.
2017.141-orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,And I presume you'd be happier if those issues were settled in one litigation rather than to have to start an action against the United States?
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,Yes.
2017.141-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"Thank you, General."
2017.141-orig,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,0,0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.141-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,General Yarger.
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin, if I can, by discussing the United States' exception to the Special Master's report and turn later to Colorado's first exception."
2017.141-orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,"Well, if -- if the United States didn't assert it, then, of course, there would be no reason for this Court to pass on it."
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"Well, it's -- it's true this Court has never foreclosed such a claim, but if you look back through cases, including Kansas versus Nebraska, which is perhaps the best, most recent example, that was a case between states that resulted in a settlement agreement among states."
2017.141-orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,Did that -- did that case involve -- what seems to me special about this case is the prominence of the federal facility.
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"And -- and I don't agree that the prominence of the federal facility in this compact is substantially less than the prominence of federal facilities on, for example, the Republican River."
2017.141-orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,0,0,"But I'm not sure they're the same because, as the government pointed out in its argument I -- is it I(l) and I(k), make specific -- in the compact, make specific reference that this has to be available for release in accordance with irrigation demands, including deliveries to Mexico. This is an international law obligation on the United States that the United States would be remiss if -- if -- if it ignored."
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,Absolutely.
2017.141-orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,0,0,"Well, but we're used to reconciling laws that -- I'm sure the United States takes the position that the compact is consistent with, indeed furthers, its obligations under the compact."
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,The treaty does.
2017.141-orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,0,0,Yes.
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"Well, I think it's a question of there are multiple layers of laws that are at issue in interstate water cases, obviously. You have state water rights."
2017.141-orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,I'm sorry.
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,I -- I don't necessarily think they're mirrors of each other.
2017.141-orig,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,I take it --
2017.141-orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,0,0,It shouldn't -- it's not -- it's not surprising that in some cases the United States could be a party to such a suit.
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"Well, I hope there's not because I disagree with -- with -- with that."
2017.141-orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,0,0,There is something I don't see?
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"There -- the United States absolutely has to approve a compact, but what it approves is the terms of that compact. And the terms of this compact give substantive rights to Texas, and the commissioners who have voting rights, the United States does not have a voting right on this Commission, to demand releases of water to -- to carry out the equitable apportionment of the compact. What I will say is I think there is a difference that -- that the United States doesn't draw in its briefing between legislation carried out under the Commerce Clause or under the treaty power and choosing to go a different route, which is to say, telling New Mexico and Colorado and Texas back in the early -- early '20s: Negotiate this compact and decide the apportionment among yourselves, and that will be the way that we determine how this water is apportioned. That's very different from the United States saying: We will exercise our commerce power or treaty power to determine the equitable apportionment of this river --"
2017.141-orig,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,"Well, I take it, General --"
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,-- and impose it on the states.
2017.141-orig,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,"-- I mean, you don't disagree, do you, or tell me if you do, that the United States has important interests here? And, you know, part of those interests are international, having to do with the relationship with Mexico, but part of them are domestic because the United States is and was even prior to this compact in a set of contractual agreements that -- that give it duties with respect to this water. So do you agree that the interests are pretty strong here?"
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,Yes.
2017.141-orig,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,Okay.
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"Well, I think it -- it -- two ways: First of all, with respect to the treaty interests, absolutely, we think that it's appropriate to include treaty claims in this case. Second of all, with respect to all of those interests, which are identical to those that are at issue in cases like Kansas versus Nebraska, it does what it's always done, which is --"
2017.141-orig,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,I don't know what that means.
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"Yes, the domestic issues which Congress has said for 130 years, project rights are state law water rights that are subsumed within an equitable apportionment that the states either negotiate or this Court sets. So it's no different from the many cases the United States has participated in, either as amicus, which I think is a pretty strong indication that in past cases at least, the United States hasn't saw fit to try to establish the precedent of being able to take states into litigation when they're not in litigation, and -- and it can assert those interests and make all the arguments that it needs to make. And I think it gets back to the --"
2017.141-orig,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,0,0,"But -- but, Mr. Yarger, I'm still stuck on -- on this."
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,I -- I would agree with that.
2017.141-orig,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,0,0,Then why isn't -- why isn't that significant federal interest right there?
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,It's -- it's not that it's not a significant federal interest.

2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"Well, we're --"
2017.141-orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,-- and obligated you to do something to the -- for -- to the -- for the United States?
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"Justice Sotomayor, we're not taking a position on any other type of claim the United States may or may not have under other substantive bodies of law, including state law, treaties, and reclamation law. All we're saying is that this, as Texas said I think several times during argument, at the heart of this case is an apportionment between the states."
2017.141-orig,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,"But think about this. This goes back -- Justice Breyer said, look, Congress approved this compact."
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"And -- and I think the question is how does the United States protect that interest, because the premise of the compact was also the 1902 Reclamation Act, which was in effect for 36 years before this compact was signed and said very clearly: Federal government, go to state court, go to state administrative mechanisms to get your water right."
2017.141-orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"Well, the United States says one reason they need to participate as a party, rather than an amicus, is because otherwise they would not be bound by the decree."
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,I -- I --
2017.141-orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"In other words, you're going -- if -- if you prevail, it's not going to mean much, because the United States doesn't feel bound by it."
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,I think that again flips the -- the legal regime on its head.
2017.141-orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,0,0,Seems to me that's the best argument -- argument you can make for the fact that the United States has a vital interest here.
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,And we don't dispute it has an interest in this case and ought to participate in this case.
2017.141-orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,In this case --
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,Bring the states into the --
2017.141-orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,"-- if -- if -- if a party is bound, but not permitted to be a party, that -- there's something wrong with that."
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"Well, I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.141-orig,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,"Well, it's one --"
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,-- and what Congress --
2017.141-orig,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,-- it's one thing to say that state litigation can bind its own citizens; and it's another thing to say that state litigation can bind the federal government without the federal government being allowed to participate in that litigation.
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"Well, and -- and the United States, for -- for many years, litigating these cases, has participated in these suits despite strong federal interests without being a party and asserting claims under the compact."
2017.141-orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,"But as was pointed out by Ms. O'Connell, the United States was told what -- wasn't there -- I don't know whether Colorado joined it or it was just New Mexico, that said the United States is a necessary party to this litigation."
2017.141-orig,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,0,0,"I -- no, that -- that's certainly not what we're saying."
2017.141-orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"Thank you, General. Mr. Rael."
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I have three points -- main points that I'd like to make on behalf of the State of New Mexico today, the first of which is that New Mexico agrees with the Special Master and Colorado that the United States cannot raise compact claims in this matter. Secondly, New Mexico has not taken exception to the Special Master's recommendation that the United States be allowed to raise a claim under reclamation law in order to protect its interests. Finally, New Mexico does not dispute that the United States can bring a claim for alleged interference with its 1906 treaty with Mexico."
2017.141-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,Are you --
2017.141-orig,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,And how do you think those claims would differ from claims that are brought under the compact?
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"Well, Justice Kagan, the -- the -- the treaty itself has a mechanism which allows the United States to enforce the treaty -- its treaty obligations at any time. And the -- and the -- I think the main difference is that if you -- if -- if -- and as this Court has already deemed, that if the United States is allowed to enforce its treaty obligation of the 60,000 acre-feet a year under the treaty, then you don't open that door under the compact claim that my colleague was just speaking about, which would allow the United States to -- to -- to, for the first time ever, raise a -- a compact claim in a -- in a -- in a compact under which it receives no allocation of water."
2017.141-orig,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,And -- and what about these other obligations that the United States has? You said that you can bring reclamation law claims for those.
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"I -- Justice Kagan, I -- I think everybody cares so much because the -- the Reclamation Act of 1902 is a very comprehensive body of law, and it allows the United States to accomplish almost anything that it's looking to do here. That -- it's important to note that there's no claim -- there's no remedy that the United States is seeking in this litigation that it can't -- under the compact, that it can't receive under that comprehensive body of law that is the Reclamation Act."
2017.141-orig,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,This --
2017.141-orig,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,"Right, but --"
2017.141-orig,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,"-- this Court has never had occasion to pass on that question. You said ""never allowed."" It didn't disallow. It just hasn't ruled on it."
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"Well, Your Honor, I think that's -- that's correct, but I think -- I think what the danger that we're facing here is that if you -- if you read an -- an implicit right here for the United States to raise a claim under a compact which -- which provides it no explicit protections, if you -- if you allow them to -- to -- if you -- if you allow the United States to read that implicit right, then I think you're -- you're opening up a dangerous door in which the United States can raise -- can try to raise implicit rights not only in -- in this compact but in every compact across the country."
2017.141-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,How --
2017.141-orig,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,I suppose one reason the United States may be interested is if it has compact claims that are litigated here.
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"No, Your Honor."
2017.141-orig,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,And not under state law but under federal law?
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"Under the -- under the McCarran Amendment, the -- the -- the United States' water rights are subject to state law, but New Mexico would -- would -- and -- and any -- any compacting state administers the water rights, but we can't do so in a manner which is inconsistent with the compact. Therefore, this Court has already placed those protections in place so -- so that the United States' reclamation law claim and -- and, indeed, in this case, its reclamation project, is protected in the sense that we cannot administer our state water rights, our sovereign water in such a manner that it interferes with the compact."
2017.141-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,"I'm sorry, let's go --"
2017.141-orig,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,Am I right that -- that New Mexico had argued at an earlier stage that the United States was a necessary party to this litigation?
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"Yes, Your Honor, we did argue that, and --"
2017.141-orig,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,And I will ask you the same question I asked before.
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"Justice Ginsburg, I -- I apologize."
2017.141-orig,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,0,0,"But the -- but when you made that claim it was only a compact, this case was about a compact between New Mexico and Texas, and it was in that setting that you said the United States was necessary."
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"You -- you are correct, Justice Ginsburg -- Ginsburg."
2017.141-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,Are you differing from Texas and acknowledging that the U.S. could sue New Mexico for a reclamation claim so that it doesn't have to sue the individual water users?
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"I -- I -- I am, Your Honor, in -- in the sense that -- that the -- the Reclamation Act of 1902 is so comprehensive that the United States under -- under all of the different portions of the Reclamation Act can sue, in our opinion, the State of New Mexico. And I think it's important to note that in -- in -- in Nebraska v. Wyoming, the United States was saying -- actually said: We -- we can't be sued because we weren't apportioned any water."
2017.141-orig,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,Do you think a state could sue the United States under this compact if the United States started acting in a way that was inconsistent with its terms?
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"Justice Kagan, yes, I do -- I do believe so."
2017.141-orig,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,0,0,"So, if the United States is so integrally a part of this system that a state could sue the federal government, why can't the same be true back again the other way?"
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"Because the United States doesn't own any -- any right -- any water, any rights under -- under the compact, or even under the project."
2017.141-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,"I'm sorry, did you say the United States could sue under the project?"
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"They can -- they can sue to enforce, in -- in my opinion, if -- if -- if New Mexico is interfering with their project obligations, they can certainly sue to -- to --"
2017.141-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,But not under the contact -- not under the compact?
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,Correct.
2017.141-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,I just don't understand that.
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I?"
2017.141-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,0,0,Under the compact?
2017.141-orig,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,Sure.
2017.141-orig,3,62912,marcus_j_rael_jr_,,0,0,The -- the -- the United -- the compact doesn't require the United -- I mean New Mexico to deliver any portion of water to -- to the United States.
2017.141-orig,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0,0,"Thank you, counsel."
