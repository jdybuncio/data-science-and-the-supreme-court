1988.87-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.048,"We'll hear argument now on Number 87-271, Harbison-Walker Refractories versus Eugene Brieck."
1988.87-271,0,16354,andrew_m_kramer,,12.549,15.502,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.86,206.267,"Mr. Kramer, when you say, ""The courts below found"", this came up on summary judgment, so you're obligated, of course, to take the facts against you--"
1988.87-271,0,16354,andrew_m_kramer,,206.267,206.645,--Yes.
1988.87-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.645,207.927,--and to the extent that they can be.
1988.87-271,0,16354,andrew_m_kramer,,207.927,208.708,Yes.
1988.87-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,398.092,399.281,Do you challenge that?
1988.87-271,0,16354,andrew_m_kramer,,399.281,400.103,"No, not at all."
1988.87-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.318,409.689,"So, the prima facie case was made out?"
1988.87-271,0,16354,andrew_m_kramer,,409.689,412.171,"--No, it was made out, and we have no challenge to that."
1988.87-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.171,416.863,"And if you hadn't said anything in response, judgment could have been entered against your client."
1988.87-271,0,16354,andrew_m_kramer,,416.863,417.814,"Yes, that's right."
1988.87-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,460.541,480.085,"Is it your position that when you... when you came forward with what you said was a neutral explanation, was it your position that if they... I guess it must be... that if the plaintiff hadn't done anything, then, said anything or offered anything, that judgment should have been entered for you?"
1988.87-271,0,16354,andrew_m_kramer,,480.085,481.384,"Yes, Justice White."
1988.87-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.384,506.132,"You mean after step two of the Burdine phase where the plaintiff has shown a prima facie case, and you have articulated a reason whereby the... a legitimate reason, a nondiscriminatory reason for his treatment, still if a plaintiff has introduced enough to satisfy... to prove his case to a jury--"
1988.87-271,0,16354,andrew_m_kramer,,506.132,512.255,"Mr. Chief Justice, the... if... plaintiff has ample opportunity to show pretext."
1988.87-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,526.404,538.132,"--Well, supposing the plaintiff says, you know, I have proved the following facts, and I think, Trial Judge, that a reasonable jury could infer discrimination from that."
1988.87-271,0,16354,andrew_m_kramer,,543.646,552.01,If there is facts in the record which could allow a reasonable jury to conclude that he was a victim of age discrimination.
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1773.856,1778.217,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1809.529,1812.792,"Well, did this Third Circuit find that way in so many words?"
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1821.748,1830.792,"Well, I think that's right, and perhaps it's because it's an unpublished opinion coming shortly after their en banc decision in Chipollini."
1988.87-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1857.679,1869.656,"Well, is the Third Circuit saying that every time a plaintiff makes a prima facie case, which is simply showing that in this case he's a member of the protected class and he was discharged, that is always enough to get to the jury?"
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1869.656,1870.728,"No, definitely not."
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.746,1899.457,What does it mean if it is does not mean it's enough to get to the jury?
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1900.438,1901.23,The prima facie case?
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.23,1901.65,Yes.
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1901.65,1903.591,"Well, I think Burdine answers that question."
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1915.617,1919.811,"I mean, the moment of truth with the burden of production is if you don't produce, you lose."
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1919.811,1920.43,"Well, that's right."
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.43,1922.203,That means it's enough to get to the jury.
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1922.203,1928.076,"Well, I suspect it depends on the context of the litigation."
1988.87-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.353,1961.036,"Mr. Martin, I have found at page 15A of the petition the statement of the Third Circuit in this case, that"
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1974.447,1984.344,I believe you were quoting from the District Court's opinion.
1988.87-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1984.344,1987.755,Perhaps you're right.
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1989.497,2011.489,"We think that the Third Circuit's legal analysis that a reasonable jury may infer, may find intentional discrimination based on a prima facie case, plus enough evidence to disbelieve the employer follows directly from this Court's decisions in Furnco Construction Corporation and in Burdine."
1988.87-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2065.415,2072.381,"Mr. Martin, what is enough to get to the jury from the Plaintiff's evidence in a case like this?"
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2081.597,2082.917,"--No, it is not enough."
1988.87-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2082.917,2085.318,What else is required?
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2085.318,2094.664,"What is required is what is required in any summary judgment case, enough evidence to prove your case, that a reasonable jury could find that you've proved your case."
1988.87-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2109.354,2120.62,Is proof that the person is in a protected class and was discharged enough to require the employer to come forward with a reason?
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2120.62,2121.111,Absolutely.
1988.87-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2121.732,2129.739,"So, a prima facie case for that purpose is different from a prima facie case in your view to get to the jury?"
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2129.739,2130.348,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.077,2158.745,Is that the question?
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2167.373,2168.343,That's the ultimate question.
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.343,2170.035,"--Oh, but that's quite different."
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2172.385,2175.568,I'm not sure it's quite different.
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.14,2182.851,"By putting it that way, you confuse me in the answer you gave to Justice O'Connor."
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2191.808,2192.429,--Um-hum.
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2192.429,2197.571,"Nothing else to show any age discrimination, just that statistical... what could be an accident."
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2203.885,2204.636,Um-hum.
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.636,2206.206,What happens?
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2213.843,2218.345,If it's refuted in the sense that I could find that was not the basis of the decision--
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.345,2219.246,"Right, that was not the basis."
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2219.246,2224.71,"--then I may infer as a reasonable person that the employer acted on the basis of age, that--"
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.71,2225.23,Why?
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2232.216,2236.727,--You have... you have the evidence of the bare bones prima facie case.
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.727,2237.318,That's it.
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2237.318,2237.909,And--
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2237.909,2238.598,And?
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2238.598,2241.812,"--And the evidence that the employer is lying, that they're covering up something."
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2241.812,2244.772,They're covering up something or trying not to be held liable?
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2259.151,2267.448,I'm saying that it's a legitimate inference based on all that evidence that he acted on the basis of some illegal criterion.
1988.87-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.439,2271.161,"You can say it, but I don't see that it's true."
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2271.161,2281.987,I hear you saying you question the... whether it's appropriate to draw an inference from a prima facie case plus proof that the explanation is unworthy of credence.
1988.87-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.987,2284.268,But you don't have proof when you're talking about summary judgment.
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2286.629,2287.27,Exactly.
1988.87-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.27,2294.734,"Well, you said proof as if the jury had found that the employer's explanation was not good."
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2294.734,2297.837,The Third Circuit found that there was enough evidence for a jury to so find in this case.
1988.87-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2297.837,2304.021,But you mean an argument or facts from which a jury might conclude?
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2304.021,2305.463,Exactly.
1988.87-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.463,2329.489,"Do you agree that if the prima facie case is made out, the bare bones, and then the employer comes forward with this reason, this neutral reason, then does the employer win if the plaintiff then remains silent and doesn't attack that excuse at all and doesn't give any... offer any further evidence?"
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2346.659,2347.33,Yes.
1988.87-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2360.027,2360.487,Yes?
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2360.487,2363.029,--was convicted of armed robbery.
1988.87-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.951,2370.936,"And... so, there might be a lot of other prima facie cases that would have to go to the jury?"
1988.87-271,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2370.936,2372.075,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2372.696,2374.91,"Thank you, Mr. Martin."
1988.87-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2374.91,2376.369,"We'll hear now from you, Mr. Logan."
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2376.369,2383.375,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court:"
1988.87-271,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2415.185,2420.007,Never mind the refutation of the employer's reasons.
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2426.242,2435.797,"There's the evidence that there were three of four individuals who were installation specialists who were in the protected age group, age 55, 59, and 59."
1988.87-271,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2435.797,2436.598,Um-hum.
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2436.598,2441.361,All three of those people were laid off in the initial layoffs in July 1982.
1988.87-271,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.142,2455.53,Um-hum.
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2459.123,2463.457,"That's according to only one individual, and that is Mr. Faust himself."
1988.87-271,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.368,2485.52,"Now, you've limited your response to that affirmative evidence."
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2502.103,2504.063,That's what Burdine says.
1988.87-271,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.063,2516.782,"And that's part of your affirmative proof of discrimination is what you just recited to Justice Scalia, plus your contention which may or may not be supported by the record, that the evidence... that the so-called neutral reason was pretextual?"
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2516.782,2524.035,We're arguing that a jury could reasonably conclude that the proffered reason is not worthy of credence and that they could also--
1988.87-271,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2524.035,2526.598,And that that gives rise to... itself to a inference of discrimination?
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2526.598,2527.448,--That's correct.
1988.87-271,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2527.448,2528.029,All right.
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2540.688,2545.068,"Yes, I'm quite comfortable with the Third Circuit decision, but there's much more than that."
1988.87-271,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2545.068,2547.812,Could you just mention where it is in its opinion that it says that.
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2547.812,2557.417,When it talked about the... what... the duties that Mr. Faust actually performed after his initial retention and after his layoffs.
1988.87-271,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2573.039,2578.002,But that really is just the Plaintiff's effort to break down the employer's explanation.
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2580.142,2581.274,That's correct.
1988.87-271,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2581.274,2586.746,"--Well, then, will it ever be possible for an employer to get a summary judgment in a case like this?"
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2586.746,2589.438,Not under the records... not under the record of this case.
1988.87-271,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.438,2600.446,"But I mean where an employer produces a bare bones prima facie case, and an employer comes up with some explanation which on summary judgment the jury might disbelieve."
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2600.446,2607.981,I think... I can't really think of a case where an employer who's an interested witness could properly get summary judgment.
1988.87-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.981,2608.712,Well--
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2608.712,2610.091,That isn't this case.
1988.87-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.091,2611.493,--you can get summary judgment--
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2611.493,2612.104,We have plenty of disputes in this case.
1988.87-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2612.104,2617.287,--if the employee didn't respond to the neutral explanation.
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2617.287,2619.568,Unless the--
1988.87-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.568,2621.619,If the prima facie case was just a bare bones prima facie case.
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2621.619,2625.612,"--If it were, if it were a bare bones prima facie case, which this one isn't--"
1988.87-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.612,2640.603,"I know, but bare bones prima facie case as the Chief Justice posed, a neutral explanation, and the employee remains absolutely silent, doesn't say a thing, doesn't attack it as pretextual or anything else."
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2643.063,2646.176,--He could cross-examine that interested witness.
1988.87-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.176,2647.988,"Well, I know he has to do something."
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2647.988,2649.288,He has to do something.
1988.87-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2649.288,2656.223,He has to either call into question that excuse or offer some other evidence of direct discrimination.
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2656.223,2657.145,And we also have--
1988.87-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.145,2657.853,Isn't that right?
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2657.853,2658.704,"--Well, in this--"
1988.87-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.704,2659.265,Is it?
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2659.994,2661.406,--If it were bare bones--
1988.87-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.406,2662.017,Yes.
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2662.017,2663.607,--you may have a point.
1988.87-271,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2667.01,2668.322,"Well, I'm not asking... whether I may have or not."
1988.87-271,2,31457,james_h_logan,,2689.513,2691.726,"If it were much skinnier than in this case, sir."
