2009.08-724,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.013,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-724, Smith v. Spisak."
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,7.152,11.056,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-724,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,24.161,24.707,Why?
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,42.934,55.428,"It's a bit of a conundrum, Your Honor, because Mills was issued after the Ohio Supreme Court's decision here, but before it became final on direct review when cert was denied by this Court in March of 1989."
2009.08-724,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,55.428,62.536,"Well, finality in that sense is generally looked at in terms of AEDPA statute of limitations."
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,78.872,89.666,"I'm perfectly willing, Your Honor, to back it up a step and say Mills was not clearly-established law at the time that the Ohio Supreme Court decided, although the issues were current at the time."
2009.08-724,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,118.499,125.307,"We don't have to go any further if we simply address the question, at what point in time are we talking about a State court's decision, correct?"
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,125.307,125.479,--Fair enough.
2009.08-724,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,156.418,175.066,"General Cordray, under the charge that was given, what happens if there is a juror who thinks that the aggravating circumstances don't outweigh the mitigating circumstances?"
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,200.725,203.649,"--Even at the time, if the jury effectively hung--"
2009.08-724,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,203.649,204.944,Yes.
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,204.944,210.267,"--on that question, the consequence would be that the court would then impose some version of a life sentence."
2009.08-724,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,260.668,274.269,"It would be -- under the charge that was given in this case, you say it would be -- then the judge would be obliged to give one of the two life sentences."
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,280.002,282.735,"--I believe that's the case at the time, Your Honor."
2009.08-724,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,319.796,341.209,"Isn't your adversary's position -- I'm sure they will speak for themselves, but their position would be that this is a step further than Jones or other cases because if in fact -- what you are tilling us is that if the jury hangs, the court will have to impose a life sentence or some form of it."
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,364.511,369.761,"--This, as Your Honor notes from your time on the trial court, is the jury dynamic in the jury room."
2009.08-724,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.342,434.372,General Cordray--
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,434.372,435.074,That is not sufficient--
2009.08-724,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.074,440.713,"--in reading that closing argument, it is disjointed."
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,469.513,473.074,"--First of all, I would disagree with that characterization of the closing."
2009.08-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,551.458,555.865,"General Cordray, may I -- may I -- you are basically arguing that he was not--"
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,558.427,558.755,That's right.
2009.08-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.755,568.094,"Assume I am persuaded that there was deficient performance, for all the reasons your adversary argues, and I am focusing on the prejudice issue."
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,589.506,605.28,"I think in Cronic the Court said that if there is effectively a structural breakdown -- I mean, if in fact counsel had gotten up and argued solely a prosecution argument and not pivoted at all to mitigating circumstances, perhaps it would be possible to presume prejudice in that situation."
2009.08-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,607.546,608.435,"No, I -- I understand that."
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,613.996,615.852,That's one of the questions.
2009.08-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.852,616.304,Yes.
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,616.304,626.319,"Although in our cert petition question 2, we also argue that the Sixth Circuit erred by not deferring to the Ohio Supreme Court's application of Strickland v. Washington."
2009.08-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.653,695.523,But does your argument really depend on any deference to the State Supreme Court?
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,710.939,712.655,"I would say three things, Your Honor."
2009.08-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.595,750.468,"But we don't know which prong of Strickland it relied on, do we?"
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,750.468,750.78,We don't.
2009.08-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,783.204,788.858,So you'd say a State supreme court is entitled to more deference if it doesn't tell us the basis for its decision?
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,788.858,790.855,"--It -- it may seem a little odd, Your Honor."
2009.08-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,790.855,791.136,Yes.
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,791.136,795.12,"If they disclaim a prong, then I think it's de novo review, and Rompilla did say that."
2009.08-724,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,812.739,819.563,"Counsel, there are two extremes."
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,873.759,878.396,"We, of course, Your Honor, don't have subjective testimony from the counsel as to what his strategy was."
2009.08-724,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,970.998,978.867,Have you ever heard or read a defense summation that was more derogatory of the defendant than the summation here?
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,978.867,985.523,"I have not read a great number of defense summations, but this was derogatory."
2009.08-724,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1007.341,1008.324,But defense counsel--
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,1008.324,1008.573,That's the context.
2009.08-724,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1008.573,1012.212,--goes so far as to say: Don't look to him for sympathy because he demands none.
2009.08-724,0,39034,richard_cordray,,1029.39,1030.252,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-724,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1183.232,1184.028,"Thank you, General."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1192.01,1194.818,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1247.204,1252.469,"You say -- you fault him for not talking about performance in prison, prospective performance in prison?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1252.469,1252.921,--That is correct.
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1252.921,1256.138,It doesn't look like that's going to be a very strong argument.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1263.153,1264.214,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1284.909,1291.873,"He is on the stand with a Hitler moustache testifying about what a great job he did killing these people, and he says he is going to do it again."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1294.888,1295.855,"--That is correct, it did."
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1295.855,1299.494,And the jury is supposed to believe that this guy is going to do well in prison?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1299.494,1306.32,"If the -- if the lawyer had identified for the jury the testimony of the mental health experts, that would have been the case."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.49,1309.959,These experts said he had improved?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1309.959,1310.599,--Yes.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.66,1313.426,Before this testimony on the stand?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1313.426,1314.097,"--During the trial, yes."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.097,1314.425,Wow.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1314.425,1315.111,That his performance--
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.111,1317.357,That didn't look like improvement to me.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1317.607,1320.481,"--Well, that may be, Your Honor, but that's what the experts testified to."
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1325.164,1330.944,"But I guess it gets back to the -- the point, we are talking about what a jury would think and isn't it possible."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1345.141,1348.093,"If there is no evidence to support that, that would be correct."
2009.08-724,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1360.899,1374.676,"Mr. Benza, do you know of any case where ineffective assistance was found on the basis of a closing argument alone?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1408.691,1409.159,No.
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1417.22,1418.53,What would you have done?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1477.506,1483.675,"He -- what he should have done is what this Court recognized in Penry v. Lynaugh, is that mental health evidence is a double-edged sword."
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1489.139,1490.827,"No, he -- he said why."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1525.232,1528.387,"--Well, we actually don't know what the State court said about--"
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1528.387,1531.214,Or we had at least one State court that found it okay.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1531.214,1535.102,--For whatever reason we had the State court decision that affirmed this.
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1559.247,1560.998,But I agree with all that you are saying.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1579.381,1584.567,"--As the amici points out, there is no strategic reason for this closing."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.375,1600.809,"Well, I think -- I think it was swallowing the worst evidence."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1632.216,1632.403,No.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1633.203,1647.724,"This was an extraordinary trial, and it seems to me that the -- that the technique that -- that counsel used to try to get mercy for this fellow was -- was the best that could have been done."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1647.724,1653.394,"If that's your conclusion, then we -- we don't point on the merits of the claim."
2009.08-724,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1654.396,1674.717,"Well, if -- if the strategy that Mr. Cordray and Justice Breyer and, to some extent, Justice Scalia have outlined is a correct strategy, would you go on to say that the implementation of that strategy was substandard?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1690.178,1690.973,--That is correct.
2009.08-724,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1692.518,1708.124,"What -- what is the case that you have -- the best case that you have, maybe a case in the courts of appeals or the state supreme courts, where it is said that the implementation of the strategy was just inept -- totally inept."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1710.343,1719.007,"--Yes, that the application, that the way the lawyer delivered the closing, the themes that he identified, the things that he said, was the deficiency--"
2009.08-724,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1719.007,1723.648,"Again, that depends on, oh, tone of voice, the ambiance of the courtroom."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1732.238,1735.315,"--They are very difficult, but this case doesn't present those nuances."
2009.08-724,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1751.042,1752.368,"Well, he actually did say that."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1752.368,1754.817,Not in those words.
2009.08-724,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1754.817,1758.693,"Well, but, pretty much, he said, no one's going to fault you if you impose the death sentence."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1758.693,1761.224,"And we will be proud of you, whichever you do."
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1766.719,1781.353,"But, I mean, it seems to me that you are imposing a strategic rule, and the counsel obviously made a decision -- or the record may reflect that the type of advocacy that you are telling us he has to have."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1813.123,1814.92,But that's what we do under Strickland.
2009.08-724,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1822.462,1841.862,"You just told me that, under Strickland, under anything, there has been no case in which there has been a decision for the defendant, based on the inadequacy of the closing argument alone."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1858.072,1865.898,"Yes, but this court has already recognized that the Sixth Amendment applies, the right to counsel applies at closing argument."
2009.08-724,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1882.108,1893.761,"Why -- why isn't it the Strickland analysis that you read the charge in the context of the case that was presented at trial, and, here, the case was."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,1912.798,1920.421,"--That's -- that's correct, and that's the theme that defense counsel said he was going to implement at the closing."
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1925.494,1927.604,"Well, he talked about nothing else."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2002.834,2014.439,"Well, it -- first, as to the question of whether or not the lower court found it adequate, we have no idea, again, what the Ohio Supreme Court determined as to question of deficient performances or to prejudice or to strategy."
2009.08-724,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2014.439,2019.5,How many -- how many issues were before the Ohio Supreme Court?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2019.5,2022.951,There were 67 assignments of error raised to the Ohio Supreme Court.
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2029.951,2031.418,Didn't -- didn't they cite Strickland?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2031.418,2033.838,"They did cite Strickland, along with 49 other claims."
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2033.838,2034.322,"Well, I guess then they concede the argument."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2034.322,2036.069,They dismissed this claim and--
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2036.069,2037.274,Why do we have no idea then?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2039.957,2051.079,"--We have no idea whether they decided that there was deficient performance, but no prejudice -- that there was, in fact, deficient performance, but no prejudice, that this was not deficient because it was reasonable strategy."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.39,2059.185,"So I think that we have to defer to all of those, right?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2059.185,2061.622,--I'm sorry?
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.622,2069.257,"I think, if they could have been relying on any of those, we would have to defer to all, wouldn't we?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2069.257,2070.478,Unless we--
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.478,2071.461,"One-by-one, I mean--"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2071.461,2080.957,"--If we assume that they were then applying the Lockhart v. Fretwell standard as to the question of prejudice, then it would clearly be contrary to Strickland, to have applied that standard of review for prejudice."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.957,2082.099,--Why would we assume that?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2082.099,2085.269,"Well, because we don't know what the Supreme Court actually did."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.269,2092.188,"When we -- when you don't know what a lower court has done, the rule is you assume the best, not the worst."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2094.359,2094.983,That is.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.983,2098.653,"You, very often, don't know on what basis the lower court took action."
2009.08-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2100.746,2104.4,"That's the rule on direct appeal, of course, not on collateral."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2104.4,2106.791,That is the rule on direct appeal.
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.559,2127.904,--How -- how does that work?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2144.348,2145.787,That is true.
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2145.787,2147.16,"Now, that -- that happens all the time."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2147.16,2147.768,That is correct.
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2147.768,2156.842,"And, now, it's very, very common that, in making that argument, there could be some good grounds for rejecting it, and there could be some bad grounds for rejecting it."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2164.591,2168.806,"I would think, no, that you don't send it back, but what happens--"
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2168.806,2171.416,What we do is we assume they did it for a bad reason?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2171.416,2184.675,"--I would -- I think the issue then would become that, when a state court chooses to summarily deny, without evaluation, an explanation of the merits of the claim, that, when it comes to habeas review, the constraints of AEDPA are lifted."
2009.08-724,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2184.675,2205.946,"So the Ohio Supreme Court, faced with 67 issues, would have to write at least a per curiam opinion on each of the 67 to insulate itself against being overturned on federal habeas?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2205.946,2213.207,"Not insulate from overturning, but to gain the benefit of 2254(d)'s restrictive reviews of habeas."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.207,2215.192,Which insulates it from being overturned.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2215.192,2219.86,"If, in fact, it is not contrary to our unreasonable application, it would be insulated or--"
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.86,2221.611,Is there any authority for that?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2236.884,2237.883,--That is correct.
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.883,2246.552,"Now, is there any authority for the proposition that if they reject it summarily, that then we don't assume they are right, but rather we assume they are wrong?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2246.552,2252.249,"No, this Court has never addressed how to apply 2254(d) to a summary decision."
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2304.71,2315.438,"So if you're -- if you're right about that issue on which we haven't had a decision yet, then we would look at prejudice on our own, without deference to the State court findings?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2315.438,2325.201,"It would review -- it would revert to pre-AEDPA habeas review to the standards, and with review of the State court decision but with de novo application in the--"
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.201,2327.635,But that is not what AEDPA says.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2369.758,2372.086,--I would submit it is impossible.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2373.615,2374.945,It's -- it's not impossible.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2381.832,2386.082,--I would -- I would beg to differ.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2400.53,2405.978,So we should revise the statute and it should not say unreasonable application of Supreme Court law?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2405.978,2407.837,--It -- it does not require a revision.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.837,2408.57,Why doesn't it?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2408.57,2429.14,"It simply requires the Court to say that when you have summary disposition, that when evaluating the State claim, the State court decision is given the deference that it is due, and that is that we simply cannot determine whether or not it properly applied Federal law, and therefore, it does not get the safe harbor of AEDPA evaluation."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2429.14,2431.843,That's not how the -- that's not how the statute reads.
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2431.843,2441.042,"Well, why wouldn't you do that as well, then, even a fortiori, where I'm just an appeals court judge and I get a district court opinion?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2460.536,2467.968,The Court does that when it reviews those quarters constrained by what actually happened in the lower court.
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2467.968,2468.128,We did?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2482.541,2483.636,And that is--
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2483.636,2486.335,"If it's trial-based, you look at what the facts are that he might have taken."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2486.335,2497.784,"--And that would be the evaluation that would continue on in habeas review of these claims, is evaluating the State court decision without, though, simply saying, well, we're going to -- and this is what happens in the lower courts."
2009.08-724,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2540.737,2552.856,"Well, I think that assumes that the State courts are -- what the Supreme Court of Ohio and all the other State supreme courts are doing is waiving briefs for Federal habeas courts."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2552.856,2553.449,I don't think--
2009.08-724,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2553.449,2557.103,Do you think that's what AEDPA was intended to do?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2557.103,2567.519,"--I think AEDPA was designed that when the State courts, in fact, are doing their jobs under the Constitution to protect defendants' rights to review their claim, then they should receive the protections of AEDPA."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2569.566,2570.674,That's not what it says.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2579.046,2579.389,--It does.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2591.914,2594.304,"And if they can't, you lose."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2596.554,2598.477,--That's correct.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.477,2602.021,"You want to say if they can't, we have a new statute."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2611.938,2625.964,"That's the other alternative is that then the statute doesn't apply, which as this Court has recognized, when it comes to applying AEDPA, the side that is left untouched regarding that is the issue of the suspension of the writ."
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2625.964,2645.252,"So you are saying -- I mean, this is very helpful to me for a variety of reasons, but is -- in your view, the correct role of the habeas judge vis-à-vis the State judge there is the same as the Federal appellate judge vis-à-vis the district judge?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2673.149,2674.49,It's still the same standard.
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.49,2681.302,"Same -- but if they had made an explicit finding, then maybe it would be a tougher standard."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2681.302,2681.739,That's correct.
2009.08-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.739,2682.691,All right.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2682.691,2692.954,"The standards provided for in AEDPA are there to protect the State court judgments when they have done their job, when they explained their rationale and applied the Federal law."
2009.08-724,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2694.608,2702.948,"Mr. Benza, you might want to use what time is remaining to deal with the other issue, which we haven't talked about at all."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2702.948,2708.026,"--If I may, if I'm turning -- if there are no further questions on the effect, I will turn to the Mills issue."
2009.08-724,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2742.992,2746.852,"Well, what is your answer to the first question that Justice Sotomayor asked?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2764.05,2775.464,"In Terry Williams v. Taylor, this Court recognized in the opinion authored by Justice O'Connor that the issue for contrary to or unreasonable application is going to be governed by the application of Teague."
2009.08-724,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2775.464,2782.307,And are there -- are there not quite a few instances of contrary statements in our opinions?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2782.307,2784.693,As to the application of Mills?
2009.08-724,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2785.758,2791.834,As to the -- as to the time when the -- the law has to be clearly established by a decision in that court.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2791.834,2807.389,"--No, this Court has maintained that the issue regarding the application of -- of controlling established -- what -- clearly established law by this Court is going to be determined by Teague, and Teague determines that Mills v. Maryland decision applies to this claim."
2009.08-724,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2835.189,2842.563,This Court has not said that clearly established Federal law refers to this Court's decision as of the time of the relevant State court decision.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2842.563,2849.824,"That this Court has said, but this Court has also said that the decision to that question is based on the decision of Teague."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2856.776,2859.022,"Counsel, I don't understand that, I don't understand that."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2860.383,2870.144,--This Court has held that the decision of whether a -- when a case is going to be clearly established for review in habeas is going to be based on Teague.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.278,2882.091,Does Teague say anything about time?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2882.091,2900.693,"Teague says that the decision for application of a newly established law or a new established constitutional rule is predicated on the denial of direct appeal, which in this case would be the cert denied by this Court of the direct appeal of the case, which happened in 1989, a year after the decision in Mills was handed down."
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2900.693,2928.351,"Counsel, the Mills opinion has one of those concluding paragraphs at the end that sort of sums everything up, and it says that we conclude there is a substantial probability that reasonable jurors upon receiving the judge's instructions in this case and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2928.351,2928.975,That is correct.
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2928.975,2936.408,Now how is that clearly established law that your claim is -- is contrary to Mills?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2936.408,2943.766,"Because in -- in our case every jury instruction that was given to the jury told them that they had to be unanimous, including the specific instruction--"
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2943.766,2951.136,"That is on death or nondeath, not on whether a particular mitigating circumstance exists."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,2951.136,2957.992,"--Actually they -- they were told that, because they were also told that that included their decisions as to all disputes of fact."
2009.08-724,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2992.198,2993.402,How does that work?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,3002.149,3005.207,"--That's correct, as to that instruction."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.16,3013.532,Where -- where is that in the instructions?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,3017.236,3021.795,They appear at -- let's see.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.592,3036.163,"It's in your brief, I assume."
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,3036.163,3040.3,"--It is in my brief, Your Honor, and I've lost my appendix cite to it but the -- oh, I'm sorry."
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.687,3053.013,Read it again?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,3053.013,3056.293,At page -- the petition appendix page 326.
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3066.711,3070.662,"Where does that say what your summary was earlier, that they--"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,3070.662,3071.774,That the--
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3071.774,3075.926,--can't consider a mitigating circumstance unless they unanimously agree about it.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3075.926,3076.613,New?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,3076.613,3081.628,--Those instructions are given and every reference to the jury is in a collective you.
2009.08-724,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.17,3093.997,"Is that in your brief, too?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,3095.37,3098.653,"I believe it is, Your Honor, I don't at the -- the page cite to it."
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3100.728,3107.412,"Well, doesn't every court tell them it's their duty to decide disputed questions of fact?"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,3107.412,3108.258,That is correct.
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3108.258,3115.894,And you think that includes within it the idea that they -- they cannot consider a mitigating circumstance unless they all 12 agree on it?
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,3115.894,3119.535,"Yes, that then would violate Mills."
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3121.22,3122.484,"Okay, I just--"
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,3122.484,3123.389,That's the question in Mills.
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3123.389,3125.841,--I just want to make sure I have got your Mills argument.
2009.08-724,1,35521,michael_j_benza,,3137.649,3139.271,"When considered in totality, yes."
2009.08-724,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3139.271,3139.895,Okay.
2009.08-724,2,39034,richard_cordray,,3144.395,3147.596,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2009.08-724,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3156.249,3158.671,Is that an argument you made before this Court?
2009.08-724,2,39034,richard_cordray,,3158.671,3159.716,I beg your pardon.
2009.08-724,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3159.716,3168.15,"Is this an argument that you've made before this Court in your brief, that we shouldn't consider whether Mills is the controlling standard because Mills came after?"
2009.08-724,2,39034,richard_cordray,,3168.15,3169.055,No.
2009.08-724,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3170.4,3170.993,Okay.
2009.08-724,2,39034,richard_cordray,,3170.993,3173.821,I am simply summarizing a response to Justice Sotomayor's question.
2009.08-724,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3357.257,3363.446,What -- what is your answer to your friend's explanation that it's hard to defer when they don't even say anything?
2009.08-724,2,39034,richard_cordray,,3363.446,3367.272,I think that we have to read the statute.
2009.08-724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3423.671,3425.293,Can we just go back to that one point.
2009.08-724,2,39034,richard_cordray,,3425.293,3425.636,"--Yes, sir."
2009.08-724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3425.636,3433.713,"Would your deference be exactly the same if, instead of listing all 47 claims or so, they simply entered a one-line order saying, ""Affirmed""?"
2009.08-724,2,39034,richard_cordray,,3433.713,3441.96,"I believe, Your Honor, under the statute, it would be the same, although here they did more than that -- you know, they cited Strickland."
2009.08-724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3453.577,3455.094,Let me -- let me go back to the question.
2009.08-724,2,39034,richard_cordray,,3455.094,3455.422,"--Yes, sir."
2009.08-724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3455.422,3461.029,Do you think they are entitled to more deference because they did cite Strickland if they -- than if they did cite nothing?
2009.08-724,2,39034,richard_cordray,,3461.029,3466.431,"I think that the Ohio Supreme Court is entitled to deference because it adjudicated a claim on the merits, so--"
2009.08-724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3466.431,3469.884,So it would be exactly the same deference whether they say it's Strickland or not.
2009.08-724,2,39034,richard_cordray,,3469.884,3471.303,--I would agree with that.
2009.08-724,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3580.333,3581.94,"Thank you, General Cordray; Mr. Benza."
