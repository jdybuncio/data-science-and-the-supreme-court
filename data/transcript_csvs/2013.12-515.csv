2013.12-515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.42,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-515, Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,7.904,10.722,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,51.116,55.501,"Counsel, before you go on, could you address the jurisdiction question for me?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,82.235,84.437,"That's not quite correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,104.483,106.452,"That, in fact, is not what the district court said."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,130.135,132.318,"Well, again, they were consolidated cases."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,133.603,142.025,I think “ consolidated ” can have two meanings and -- and -- to be heard together or to be joined together.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,148.179,154.683,"--Well, I think it was everybody's understanding that these were joined together because the parties were pursuing the exact same issues."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,159.654,167.341,So why didn't you file an injunction -- why does your brief say that you filed it only in support of Little Traverse and not on your own behalf?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,167.341,174.33,"--Because once the cases were consolidated, and at that point we were even using the same docket entries, there was already a motion on file."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,183.852,192.225,"I'll ask -- I'll ask your opposition, but I don't see why the district court would have made the point it did if it believed that it was dealing with both of you as parties."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,192.225,205.633,"Well, everyone has proceeded up the chain, including in the Sixth Circuit opinion, on the assumption that it was consolidated, that Michigan was requesting an injunction and, in fact, that kind of a procedural objection has never been raised by anybody, certainly not at the petition stage."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,205.633,211.037,"No, but we have to -- we have to, if we're not sure, raise any jurisdictional issue."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,211.037,211.52,Sure.
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,214.905,218.191,"Well, it wasn't eminently clear to the district court who entered the order."
2013.12-515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,218.191,221.911,Is that a jurisdictional objection or a procedural one?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,221.911,223.295,"--Your Honor, it's a procedural objection."
2013.12-515,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,236.002,248.128,"Before you do that, can you tell -- tell us why Michigan didn't resort to the dispute resolution means that the compact provided?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,255.382,259.184,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-515,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,283.216,283.599,I'm sorry.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,302.127,311.551,"--I am, Justice Kagan, and I'm glad you brought up C&L, because there you had a construction contract where there was invocation of an arbitration remedy and it didn't specifically preserve tribal immunity."
2013.12-515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,341.92,353.128,"Why -- why did -- along the same lines, why did you assert sovereign immunity as a defense when the tribe brought a declaratory judgment action concerning the status of those lands?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,353.128,363.001,"Because, again, it wouldn't have done any good for us to stipulate to jurisdiction on the tribe's claim about the status of the lands, because simply having a declaratory judgment wouldn't have given us any relief."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,374.742,377.427,"All roads lead to one issue, I think."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,383.747,384.464,--No.
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,384.464,392.787,"But you wouldn't have gotten their property; isn't that what this suit is about, you trying to take over the -- the casino?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,392.787,394.872,"No, we don't want to take over the casino."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,398.774,400.193,So why not Ex Parte Young?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,412.167,420.522,"Two responses to that, Justice Sotomayor, one kind of a practical consideration and then one a broader federalism principle that I -- that I want to emphasize."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,437.882,441.536,But all you wanted to do was stop them from doing the gaming casino.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,441.536,442.42,"--Well, it's not clear--"
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,442.42,443.12,You would have gotten that.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,443.12,447.94,--It's not clear at all to us that we would be able to get that relief based on the lower court holdings.
2013.12-515,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,473.088,479.659,"That's -- all that -- the enigma that you pointed out, or the anomaly is -- is certainly clear."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,499.472,501.074,"Here's how, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,522.154,525.54,What's your best authority -- what's your best case for that proposition?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,525.54,527.273,For the proposition that States are different?
2013.12-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,527.273,532.794,That -- that States have a lesser burden when they're faced with a sovereign immunity defense?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,532.794,537.431,"I wouldn't say that it's a lesser burden, but I think you need to analyze this as a zero sum gain."
2013.12-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,548.555,549.771,What's your best case for that?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,549.771,559.727,"I would basically just cite all of the cases this Court has decided over the last quarter century involving the ADA, the ADEA where this Court has consistently recognized that States are different."
2013.12-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,560.243,563.179,That's -- that's a big reading assignment.
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,563.962,567.816,The question is this: Three situations.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,575.652,576.169,--Yes.
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,576.169,579.973,"Two, California opens up a casino."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,579.973,580.456,Yes.
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,580.456,584.175,"Three, an Indian tribe opens up a casino, okay?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,584.175,584.475,Correct.
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,584.475,590.329,"Now, what is it that says that the State where the casino is located can sue France?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,597.768,598.785,"Thank you, Justice Breyer."
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,611.442,613.444,Was that a statute or common law?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,613.444,616.229,"--That was common law, common law development in Alfred Dunhill."
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,624.319,624.652,Okay.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,625.252,633.775,"--So California, the case is Nevada v. Hall in which this case said that a State's sovereign immunity from suit does not extend when it's got actors in another State."
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,640.762,641.129,Okay.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,642.414,643.281,All common law.
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,643.281,644.547,--Then what do you do about Kiowa?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,644.547,645.815,"Well, that's the thing."
2013.12-515,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,669.781,680.32,"But I think this is what Justice Kennedy was -- was getting at when he asked you for a case, because what you're saying now is that when the State is the plaintiff--"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,680.32,681.072,--Yes.
2013.12-515,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,681.072,685.374,"--the sovereign immunity of the tribe disappears, so--"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,685.374,686.208,"Well, not disappears."
2013.12-515,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,690.861,693.229,--Okay.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,702.752,717.695,"This Court's case that would suggest that is the Oklahoma Tax Commission case, because that was a case where a State, not exercising a police power, but one of its lesser powers, the power of taxation, was attempting to tax cigarettes that were being sold on Indian trust land by a tribe."
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.669,736.658,"You know, but the question specifically then -- I think we're driving at the same thing -- is, remember, you just cited to me two cases--"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,736.658,737.075,Yes.
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,737.075,739.142,--one involving France and one involving California.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,739.142,739.794,Yes.
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,739.794,753.785,"And I had assumed -- but maybe I was wrong to assume -- that when I read those cases, I will see, although a State can sue France, although Nevada can sue California, a private individual could not."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,756.82,757.489,Well--
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,757.489,760.608,Now I think the answer to Justice Kagan is I'm not going to find it.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,774.781,786.089,"--I think the Oklahoma Tax Commission case would be the closest, because even if you have a private individual who was trying to sue a tribe for conduct that was taking place on trust land, they would not be able to do it."
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,786.089,811.14,"Now, what you're asking us to do then, if the answer is what I now think you're saying, is to say it's awfully complicated that although a State could sue an Indian tribe for something that is outside the reservation, the State -- it's so complicated that I'd like some good authority for it, because a private person couldn't, but a State could sue and it's only in certain places."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,811.14,814.925,"Well, there -- there's lots of places that you could draw the line in this case."
2013.12-515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,814.925,817.044,How about drawing the line with Kiowa?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,817.044,819.146,Here's what I'm going to suggest.
2013.12-515,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,840.326,854.233,"But once the Congress didn't respond, the majority opinion in Kiowa -- I don't know whether it's “ Kiowas ” or “ Kiowa ” -- said, you know, this is an unfortunate result, but Congress can do something about it."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,864.441,865.375,I am.
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,885.189,886.489,"Well, why is the -- why is that important?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,899.448,902.633,"Well, there are -- there are at least two reasons why that is also an imperfect remedy."
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,912.772,920.178,"But in addition to that, couldn't you have stopped this before it even started by insisting in the compact that the tribe waive sovereign immunity?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,920.178,923.397,"Well, that's -- that's a great question and the answer to that is twofold."
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,941.275,942.275,Going forward then--
2013.12-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,942.275,945.593,Why couldn't you at least -- I think this is Justice Alito's question.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,954.166,958.47,--A matter of compact interpretation whether these are Indian lands.
2013.12-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,958.47,958.97,Right.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,967.459,971.211,I -- I didn't get quite the same question from Justice Alito.
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,971.211,973.829,"--Well, that's a more sophisticated version of my question."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,981.25,981.752,Right.
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1001.362,1002.497,"Well, I understand that."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1002.497,1002.997,--any time you take out our--
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1002.997,1005.032,"But going forward, is this of any importance?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1005.482,1007.266,"--Oh, this is of tremendous importance."
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1007.266,1014.238,--It seems to me if a tribe wants to open a casino and the State has to -- it has to have a compact with the State.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1020.725,1026.045,"Well, we had a compact in place in 1993 that limited their casinos so that this wouldn't happen."
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1026.045,1028.664,"Well, I -- but I mean, when will -- when will this compact expire?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1028.664,1029.097,Right.
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1064.101,1064.853,If I could just pursue that.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1064.853,1065.386,--Sure.
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1065.386,1068.905,So the compact has expired and there's -- so then how can they operate the casino?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1068.905,1070.222,"Well, it hasn't expired."
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1071.524,1073.974,"Until they reach a new compact, it continues."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1073.974,1075.409,"--Until they reach a new compact, it continues in effect."
2013.12-515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1075.409,1080.546,Is the status of the land as Indian lands determined by the compact?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1080.546,1082.596,"No, it's not determined by the compact."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1086.934,1088.0,Could I ask you a question?
2013.12-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1088.0,1089.919,But the compact refers to Indian lands.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1097.922,1105.011,"--I don't think we could, respectfully, Justice Kennedy, because the compact does not envision that the tribe has waived immunity for any purposes."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1111.749,1113.267,Could I ask you a question?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1130.829,1131.263,We would not.
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1131.263,1132.863,You would not.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1132.863,1133.329,Correct.
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1139.418,1139.818,All right.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1149.874,1151.392,I disagree with that because--
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1151.392,1153.192,"Well, I know you do and I know why you do."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1161.432,1167.936,"--Federal court interpretation of the Michigan Indian Land Claims Settlement Act, yes, would determine the status of these lands."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1180.493,1183.195,Put -- put this aside of gambling.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1186.899,1187.499,--Yes.
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1187.499,1191.534,Could you have stopped the buying of this land or unravelled it?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1193.819,1197.271,If you're referring to the -- the Patchak case.
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1197.271,1197.755,Yes.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1197.755,1210.598,"In that case, you held that the plaintiff could, quite a bit after the fact, file a lawsuit to unravel that transaction if the lands were not eligible for Indian gaming, if I'm remembering the holding correctly."
2013.12-515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1215.582,1226.724,"Well, wouldn't you have had to follow -- if you were going to object to this land being taken into the land trust, wouldn't you have had to follow the administrative process?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1226.724,1228.909,"We would, but the land has never been taken in trust."
2013.12-515,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1240.884,1250.323,"General, if -- if I could assume that this is not Indian lands and just ask why you need for sovereign immunity to go away?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1283.477,1293.585,"Because we tried to take the least intrusive means necessary to stop the casino, to not go in with the billy clubs and the guns and to arrest tribal members, but to ask for a Federal civil injunction."
2013.12-515,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1293.585,1301.774,"Well, I think that all of our cases suggest that sovereign immunity is quite important to a sovereign's dignity and that it's not nothing to abrogate sovereign immunity."
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1331.46,1332.477,Right.
2013.12-515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1382.826,1386.878,"I mean, is -- is it not correct that the people who work in these casinos are just employees?"
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1391.015,1394.217,"I believe some of the employees are tribal members, some are not."
2013.12-515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1401.888,1405.775,Can you prosecute people who frequent this illegal casino?
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1405.775,1408.044,Michigan citizens?
2013.12-515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1408.044,1408.527,Yes.
2013.12-515,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1408.527,1409.294,"Yes, we could do that."
2013.12-515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1513.727,1514.646,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1521.483,1524.435,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.432,1560.792,"So you think Congress really wanted the States to have power to stop illegal gambling on Indian lands, but not to have the power to stop illegal gaming on State lands?"
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1563.244,1566.529,"I do think so, and if I could say first of all--"
2013.12-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1566.529,1569.714,Why would anybody want such a disposition?
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1569.714,1572.6,"--Two reasons, Your Honor, why I think Congress made the choice they did."
2013.12-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1593.429,1607.006,"Well, you think that rule would apply even when at the time the statute in question was enacted there was no belief that there was tribal immunity on State lands?"
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1607.006,1608.858,"--Well, Your Honor, I know my friend on the other side has said that."
2013.12-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.934,1627.669,I thought that was just on reservation.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1629.521,1629.971,--It is.
2013.12-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.458,1639.06,"Kiowa was later, of course."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1639.06,1646.648,"--Of course, but I think that Congress in enacting IGRA in 1988 certainly was under the same set of assumptions as this Court in 19 -- in the Kiowa--"
2013.12-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1646.648,1648.333,You think they read Puyallup that closely?
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1648.333,1653.137,--I think it's several places in Puyallup and certainly that's what this Court in Kiowa said.
2013.12-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.137,1653.654,I see.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1653.654,1659.041,"And I do think the text is the best guide to what Congress wanted, and the text uses “ on Indian lands ” 24 times."
2013.12-515,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1688.66,1695.231,"You agree with that, that they could -- the State could go in and arrest all the customers that are gambling there?"
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1697.333,1702.568,"--Well, it certainly could arrest the customers, the employees, and so on."
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1714.425,1714.758,"Well, you don't it."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1734.453,1744.627,"--We think that that's a consequence of tribal immunity, that when they are seeking relief qua tribe, that's a different thing, and that's I think a standard principle--"
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1744.627,1749.279,"You as a tribe, you as a tribe would have no objection to that action?"
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1749.279,1754.916,"--Well, Your Honor, I think if that sort of circumstance unfolded we might say let's try and figure out a different way to deal with that."
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1761.853,1766.823,"Well, I know, you could suggest different ways and the State could tell you, you know, go fly a kite, we are prosecuting these people."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1768.056,1768.325,--Absolutely.
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1777.281,1778.514,What about Ex parte Young?
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1792.358,1792.691,Sure.
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1808.817,1814.454,Not just are available; that you would not assert sovereign immunity if they brought an Ex parte Young action.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1814.454,1818.841,"--Well, Your Honor, we would not assert it to the limits of Ex parte Young."
2013.12-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.945,1888.252,I thought the statute says that there is Federal court jurisdiction over any cause of action initiated by a State or Indian tribe to enjoin gaming activity that is conducted in violation of the compact.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1888.252,1890.454,"Yeah, on Indian lands, exactly."
2013.12-515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1893.489,1894.255,Why couldn't this--
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1894.255,1897.974,"--If there is no compact, Justice Kennedy, there is no abrogation."
2013.12-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1913.234,1921.839,"You don't think that 1166 abrogates the immunity, which provides that for purposes of Federal law all State laws are applicable?"
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1921.839,1923.091,"Yeah, not at all, Your Honor."
2013.12-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1935.316,1940.468,And you do not take the position that this casino in this case is part of a compact?
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1940.468,1943.755,--Which casino?
2013.12-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1943.755,1950.842,"The casino in this case in your view is not subject to any compact, is not covered by any compact?"
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1950.842,1951.175,"No, we do."
2013.12-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.75,1969.987,"But he says that if they arbitrated, when they tried to enforce the arbitral judgment, you would assert sovereign immunity."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1969.987,1971.204,"Well, two responses to that, Your Honor."
2013.12-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.423,1978.509,"Well, I mean, that's not an answer."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1978.509,1990.567,"--Well, it is an answer in the sense that, Your Honor, had they asked we -- and I can tell you I've discussed this with the tribe -- that they of course not -- they would of course not assert sovereign immunity to enforce the arbitration agreement."
2013.12-515,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1990.567,1997.571,How do you win in an arbitration when the gaming commission has said it's not Indian lands?
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2011.997,2022.871,"Well, we think that that isn't a final decision and is wrong for any number of reasons on the merits that, you know, laid out in the Joint Appendix, and so we do think that would be the argument that we would make to the arbitration board."
2013.12-515,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2023.404,2028.692,But how does the arbitration board change the mind of the gaming commission?
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2032.477,2043.702,"--Well -- no, I think that -- I think that that isn't itself a final decision and there are any number of mechanisms that may be available to try and get the issue properly teed up to the NIGC."
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2043.702,2045.637,I don't see how an arbitration works.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2054.925,2059.394,"Well, it would bind, I think, the parties before it, and that's what the parties agreed to."
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2060.146,2068.25,"So ongoing, as far as the tribe and the State is concerned, they proceed from then on as if this is Indian lands, even though the Federal government is saying, no, it's not."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2068.25,2075.406,"--Well, I think that we would still have to persuade the Federal government in one way, shape, or form because of the NIGC's authority in this area."
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2076.489,2076.939,Yes.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2079.291,2082.077,"Well, it at least resolves the issue with respect to Michigan."
2013.12-515,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2099.804,2100.988,Just so we understand--
2013.12-515,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2100.988,2109.994,"--What would be the big -- what would be the big change, other than modifying Kiowa, which is a divided opinion, and was dealing with a money claim."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2112.596,2122.804,"Well, certainly this Court's decision in Puyallup as well as Oklahoma -- Oklahoma Tax Commission both did deal with injunctive relief and both were against States to deal with his argument."
2013.12-515,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2150.487,2152.073,"Well, is that right?"
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2177.304,2185.06,"--Justice Ginsburg, the majority of Kiowa, on page 759, responds to that and says that it was actually the political branches that led with the--"
2013.12-515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.06,2188.179,"Yes, but he was wrong on that apparently if that's what he says."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2203.105,2203.689,"--And, Justice Breyer--"
2013.12-515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2203.689,2231.022,"The same thing -- same thing with the State he says in Nevada and California and then he says it would be totally anomalous to think that an Indian tribe could go into downtown Des Moines and open up a clearly illegal business, and you could sue France -- the State, which was not Kiowa -- they could sue -- France could -- the State could sue France, it could sue California, but it couldn't sue the Indian tribe."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2231.022,2246.799,"--Justice Breyer, we would encourage the Court to look at precisely the case he is citing for this proposition, which is Alfred Dunhill, because as the case was vigorously argued by a Justice Department attorney, and what -- and what my friend doesn't tell you is that the pages he is citing actually don't command a majority of the court."
2013.12-515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.702,2253.035,All right.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2254.121,2261.977,"In the California v. Nevada, I think this Court dealt with in Kiowa itself because in Kiowa -- because that's about basically the State--"
2013.12-515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2261.977,2266.362,Kiowa is about -- Kiowa is about individuals who are not the State.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2266.362,2266.612,--Yes.
2013.12-515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2281.169,2281.502,All right.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2296.262,2297.962,We think that--
2013.12-515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2297.962,2298.978,Yes or no?
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2298.978,2302.598,"--that if they are on Indian lands, yes, there is--"
2013.12-515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2302.598,2314.656,"Do you want us to say on that assumption -- now, on that assumption, I look at i and number ii under a, 7(a), and a quick reading of them suggests to me that they're in parallel."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2328.999,2330.283,"--When it's on Indian lands, exactly."
2013.12-515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.283,2330.783,"Well, I know."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2351.412,2359.768,"Your Honor, I may have misunderstood your earlier question, but certainly our position is that you can look to our answer to determine whether or not there is tribal immunity in the case."
2013.12-515,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2368.274,2374.545,"Well, for purposes of sovereign immunity, does it make any difference that you have at least a colorable claim if this is on Indian lands?"
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2374.545,2379.249,"Well, I think that it -- I -- I don't think it matters either way."
2013.12-515,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2381.868,2382.334,Yes.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2394.108,2394.441,Right.
2013.12-515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2408.601,2411.637,That's why I want to -- I'm trying to get what question I'm supposed to answer.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2428.512,2429.764,"The latter, Your Honor, for two reasons."
2013.12-515,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2440.503,2459.384,"--What happens if you can't convince the Federal government that these are Indian lands, and despite the gaming commission's final ruling, there is no other way to overturn it, you decide to operate the casino."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2467.354,2468.239,"--Well, I suppose--"
2013.12-515,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2468.239,2471.374,Who can stop you and using what mechanisms?
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2471.374,2477.528,"--The Federal government has a variety of mechanisms available to it in that circumstance, including closure orders and the like."
2013.12-515,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2489.503,2491.103,"Well, the compact only comes into play if it's Indian lands."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2495.657,2496.024,Right.
2013.12-515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2519.272,2526.709,"--Mr. Katyal, what is the difference -- the State can really -- it can shut down these gambling operations easily if it's off Indian lands."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2532.347,2533.182,I do think so.
2013.12-515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2536.734,2538.836,Maybe that's an important difference.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2542.288,2545.489,"Well -- well, I certainly would disagree with the idea that you, the Court, should."
2013.12-515,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2560.182,2570.722,"Mr. Katyal, isn't it odd to say that when this is the Court -- the doctrine of tribal immunity is something that was announced by this Court."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2582.363,2587.166,"Justice Ginsburg, that was precisely the argument that was made in Kiowa, was accepted by the dissent in Kiowa."
2013.12-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2612.032,2631.362,"But if the tribe takes such an obscure position, such a changing position, as to whether or not we are dealing with Federal lands here, or pardon me, with Indian land, maybe that's a reason why we should confine and limit Kiowa so that it doesn't apply to Indian gaming and we won't have this problem."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2631.362,2632.312,"--Well, I think that's--"
2013.12-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2632.312,2639.868,"Because I wanted to get the answer to Justice Breyer's question, is it your position that these are Indian lands?"
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2641.334,2642.486,--Our position is--
2013.12-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2642.486,2648.307,"And if that's true, then maybe this whole idea of immunity doesn't work very well in the context of gaming."
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2648.307,2661.132,"--Our position, Justice Kennedy, is that they are Indian lands and there is lots of different remedies available both on and off Indian lands, and that this Court in Kiowa set out a way to deal with any sort of cutting back, which is to leave it to Congress."
2013.12-515,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2661.132,2661.665,What remedy--
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2661.665,2663.25,If we get -- go ahead.
2013.12-515,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2663.25,2665.184,--What remedy would a private person have?
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2672.005,2678.843,"I think what the Court should do is the same thing it did in Kiowa, which is bracket that question, because this is as far away from that as you can possibly get."
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2700.773,2703.292,We've talked about this prosecuting the employees.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2711.397,2712.214,They would.
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2712.214,2714.23,That's not much of a--
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2714.23,2718.948,I'm not sure for an element of that crime whether that piece of it would be beyond a reasonable doubt.
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2721.984,2725.786,--That makes it a much more different remedy than the typical injunction action.
2013.12-515,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2725.786,2727.821,But there is still civil remedies and other things going.
2013.12-515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2727.821,2728.99,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2747.217,2749.217,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2013.12-515,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2857.022,2859.04,So you are prepared to live with the following.
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2877.102,2886.625,"The State where that gaming occurs can be, but that's because of Nevada vs. Hall where the Court drew a distinction between -- for States."
2013.12-515,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2887.542,2900.951,"So what the opposition says in your view is absolutely correct, that a foreign nation opens up an illegal business in a State."
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2917.577,2924.081,"--California in the State-to-State situation, it's because of the reciprocity."
2013.12-515,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2924.081,2925.999,"I'm saying that is your view, I just want the bottom line."
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2925.999,2928.885,"Yes, but if I may explain."
2013.12-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.779,2956.535,That statute was based upon judicial decisions that had already held that.
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2956.535,2962.272,"--With all respect, Justice Scalia, it was based upon the executive branch's determination in the Tate letter."
2013.12-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3002.249,3007.485,Took it upon itself to accept the executive's determination of how it ought to play out.
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3007.485,3008.753,Yes.
2013.12-515,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3030.8,3034.335,They are quasi sovereigns.
2013.12-515,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3035.668,3036.035,Dependent sovereigns.
2013.12-515,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3036.035,3044.974,--Dependent sovereigns which is surprising that the scope of their immunity exceeds that of States or foreign sovereigns.
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3044.974,3053.58,"They are dependent sovereigns, but they are dependent upon the plenary power of Congress, not the plenary power of this Court."
2013.12-515,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3053.58,3059.317,So the federal government can certainly take enforcement action against this casino.
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3059.317,3060.233,Yes.
2013.12-515,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3060.233,3068.006,"The Federal Government, the Solicitor of Interior has said these are not Indian lands, the NIGC has adopted that interpretation."
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3089.67,3096.075,"First of all, by -- the casino is promptly closed."
2013.12-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3109.166,3111.252,"Who made these Indian tribe sovereign, was it Congress?"
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3111.252,3112.718,The Constitution.
2013.12-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3112.718,3117.006,"I mean, you are appealing to, you know, other branches' determination."
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3120.791,3122.024,The Constitution--
2013.12-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3122.024,3126.278,Who pronounced them to be sovereign?
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3126.278,3126.912,--This Court.
2013.12-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3126.912,3127.578,This Court.
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3127.578,3128.095,But--
2013.12-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3128.095,3132.516,So I assume that this Court could also determine the scope of their sovereignty.
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3132.516,3135.05,--But this Court didn't do it as a matter of common law.
2013.12-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3139.435,3143.573,We do virtually nothing as a matter of common law.
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3151.443,3158.333,"--As this Court said, it's a general proposition that diminishment of tribal sovereignty is for the political branches."
2013.12-515,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3158.999,3159.916,Why?
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3188.618,3189.168,--Not against--
2013.12-515,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3189.168,3190.787,Not against the tribe itself.
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3198.658,3202.178,"--Well, Congress has addressed this problem in numerous ways."
2013.12-515,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3213.902,3220.473,What about -- what about private individuals who may have a claim against -- as a result of the operation of the casino?
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3226.377,3229.512,Unless -- unless the tribe consents.
2013.12-515,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3243.589,3245.972,Justice Alito's question was the Kiowa case.
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3254.895,3256.162,Exactly.
2013.12-515,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3308.881,3324.057,"Mr. Kneedler, you went through the development of the foreign sovereign immunity, and whether the courts were influenced by the government, it was the courts that recognized this distinction between commercial activity and governmental activity."
2013.12-515,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3342.785,3347.172,--It may well not make sense or it may not lend itself to one answer for the reasons that I said.
2013.12-515,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3367.92,3368.953,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2013.12-515,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3370.772,3373.74,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-515,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3471.903,3482.193,"If we modified it to make an exception for commercial activities off reservation, could Congress reinstitute sovereign immunity if they wanted?"
2013.12-515,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3482.193,3482.878,No question they could.
2013.12-515,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3506.226,3512.647,"Well, there seems something sort of strange about that, General, because as I read Kiowa, what it was, was an invitation to Congress."
2013.12-515,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3535.078,3541.398,"--Actually, Justice Kagan, I think that's the way that the common law works, that the Court does extend invitations to the legislative and executive branches."
2013.12-515,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3541.398,3546.285,"Maybe we've learned something in 15 years, such as the fact that--"
2013.12-515,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3546.285,3548.903,Or that Congress thought that this did make sense.
2013.12-515,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3548.903,3550.922,I think you could draw the conclusion either way.
2013.12-515,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3558.026,3575.652,"But I would have thought, General Bursch, that one of the principles behind Indian law in this country goes something like this: Congress can do pretty much whatever it wants with respect to Indian tribes, but we will not likely assume that Congress means to undermine tribal sovereignty."
2013.12-515,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3592.347,3593.949,I respectfully disagree.
2013.12-515,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3610.325,3621.032,"He's adding one thing, which is as you've just heard, that the Indian tribes are in the same Eleventh Amendment type position as the principality of Monaco before the treaty."
2013.12-515,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3621.032,3621.849,"--Right, but--"
2013.12-515,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3621.849,3630.905,"They didn't participate in the convention and the principality of Monaco was held to be immune, presumably, even from commercial activity."
2013.12-515,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3646.082,3651.386,--I think Alfred Dunhill makes clear that this Court can change the stream of the common law when it comes to -- to immunity.
2013.12-515,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3653.754,3656.623,Then go back to the beginning question.
2013.12-515,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3672.648,3675.85,"I'll explain why, if I may answer the question."
2013.12-515,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3711.29,3712.173,"Thank you, counsel."
