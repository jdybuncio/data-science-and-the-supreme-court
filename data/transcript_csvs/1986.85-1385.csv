1986.85-1385,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.974,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1385, United States versus General Dynamics Corporation."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,80.535,87.606,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,418.388,435.165,"Mr. Horowitz, that quotation might be read to refer to the second prong of the all events test, the amount, the accuracy of the estimate of the amount, and as I understand it you don't challenge that point of the decision below."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,439.134,446.555,"We don't challenge the accuracy of the amount, but we do challenge the method by which they have computed their deduction."
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,446.555,452.126,So is it correct that the case before us would be the same from the point of view of the issue we have to decide?
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,464.167,471.44,"No, it wouldn't be precisely the same, although we think we would win that case also, but I think that this case would be--"
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,471.44,472.356,What would be the difference?
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,474.308,482.061,"--Well, it would depend how they... what deduction they took there, what amount they took as a deduction."
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,482.061,487.032,"--Well, they took the amount that was exactly the amount that the employee told them the bill was, and he showed them the--"
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,487.032,492.769,"That is the crucial difference, because here they don't know anything about what the actual bills were."
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.419,496.305,--But doesn't that go to the amount question rather than the certainty of the obligation?
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,496.305,497.438,"--Well, I don't think so."
1986.85-1385,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,525.324,530.109,Aren't the two questions kind of intertwined with one another?
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,538.565,545.571,"Well, the final event here is the evaluation of the claim determining what they are going to pay."
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,549.773,558.046,"Yes, but your position applies equally to undisputed claims, if I understand it correctly."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,558.046,560.247,"--Well, they don't know whether the claims are disputed or not."
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,560.247,569.869,"But certainly there are some of the claims that are undisputed, and I am just trying to posit a hypothetical with the claims undisputed as to liability, undisputed as to amount."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,580.577,583.363,"Well, let me give an example where we would agree."
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.363,586.565,"Well, let me just... would your argument be the same or not in that case?"
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,588.415,590.517,The claims are not disputed?
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,590.517,591.35,That's correct.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,591.35,591.933,I'm sorry.
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.052,604.442,"The amount is undisputed, the fact of the service is undisputed, everything is undisputed except he just didn't process it, didn't perform the final event of filing a written application."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,604.442,608.228,"--Well, if he has not filed the claim, our position would be the same."
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.228,608.728,Would be the same.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,608.728,611.263,"I mean, we believe the filing of the claim is a--"
1986.85-1385,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,611.263,613.33,Let me put it another way.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,619.517,620.619,"--No, we don't think so."
1986.85-1385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.872,684.292,"Mr. Horowitz, the AAA case, it does have some nice language in it, but really the Court wasn't addressing the kind of situation we have here."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,721.151,748.634,"--Well, I think it is pretty similar, because in AAA they could... it was clear that services were going to be rendered some in one year and some in the next year, and they were trying to make some sort of estimate of when the services will be rendered, and they did it, and here it is clear as a matter of... or it is at least to be expected as a matter of probability that there were some people who went to the doctor during 1972 although in fact they don't know that."
1986.85-1385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.52,755.122,What about the claims that have already been presented?
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,755.122,772.215,"Well, first of all, they don't... there is no way of breaking down in this case which claims have been presented and which haven't, so I am not sure the Court needs to get to that, but as far as claims that haven't been presented, but if you assume that all the claims had been presented before the end of the year and just hadn't--"
1986.85-1385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.215,772.598,Right.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,786.224,804.369,"--Well, then you get to the question of how significant of an event this is, that they have to evaluate it, and our position is that in this case, under the plan that they have, that is still a significant event, because there is a lot of... until they evaluate the the claims and make a judgment over what should be paid there is a lot of uncertainty over what is going to be paid."
1986.85-1385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,804.369,808.59,"Well, Mr. Horowitz, that wasn't the finding of the Claims Court, of course."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,813.842,818.362,"I don't, as we state in our reply brief, I don't read that as a finding of fact."
1986.85-1385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,827.651,839.026,"Well, it seems to... how can you say that their determination of what has to be done for processing is not a determination of fact--"
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,839.026,840.728,"--Well, there is no dispute over what is done--"
1986.85-1385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,840.728,845.43,--as a prerequisite to then applying the all events test?
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,845.43,848.898,--I don't think there is any dispute about what is done in the processing.
1986.85-1385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,860.622,862.307,That was the finding of the Claims Court.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,862.307,881.036,"Well, I don't read the Claims Court finding as being ministerial in the sense that respondent tries to use it here, in the only sense that it would be relevant, which is that if they gave these claims form to any one of their claims processors or punched it into a computer that it would always spit out the same answer."
1986.85-1385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1000.093,1010.866,"Well, it depends a little on whether you treat the filing of the claim within a certain period as a sort of statute of limitations within which it can be filed."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1027.078,1029.613,"Well, again, I think that is a legal conclusion."
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.424,1059.898,"Mr. Horowitz, perhaps it is a little unfair to you, but it seems to me your argument about filing the claim has a certain reminition to the slot machine not being pulled yet--"
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1059.898,1060.332,It is not fair.
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.332,1064.636,"--which I found persuasive in that case, as you may recall."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1064.636,1069.421,"Well, this case is much easier for us than the slot machine case, we think."
1986.85-1385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1117.002,1118.454,xxx they had a liability.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1125.19,1128.892,They had a liability in a particular amount based on a particular fact.
1986.85-1385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1159.477,1163.748,But that gets back to the fact that I thought you didn't challenge the amount.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1163.748,1166.517,"No, that's what I am trying to explain."
1986.85-1385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.981,1250.671,"I think what you are saying is that in these other cases what is estimated is the amount of the liability, whereas what is being estimated here is the very existence of the liability."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1250.671,1253.373,"That is a very good way of putting it, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.373,1256.491,They don't really know that any particular claim is out there.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1256.491,1257.777,They don't know that any claim is out there.
1986.85-1385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.777,1259.56,They just estimate that a certain number of claims are out there.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1259.56,1264.346,"They are just estimating historically, and they can do almost anything if they are allowed to get away with that kind of estimates."
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1264.346,1270.767,"Yes, but these 56,000 people, there's just no realistic basis for assuming there is some liability?"
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1270.767,1275.571,"Well, as a matter of probability, surely it is likely there is going to be some liability, sure."
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1275.571,1276.571,"They are pretty strong probabilities, aren't they?"
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1276.571,1277.254,Sure.
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1277.254,1279.556,Like about 99 million to one?
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1279.556,1292.248,But that is not... but it's misleading to... you can't just look at the all events test and say there is a liability and then pick another number out of somewhere else and attach it to that liability.
1986.85-1385,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.635,1414.277,"Could I ask, suppose that this estimate... suppose you lose this case, but also suppose that their estimate was off, that they had overaccrued."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1421.014,1422.181,Not necessarily.
1986.85-1385,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.899,1435.773,"Well, they took a deduction, they accrued a deduction that exceeded what their... what their actual liability was."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1435.773,1437.806,"--But, you see, they are taking the deduction for the reserve."
1986.85-1385,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.675,1440.092,Right.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1440.092,1447.414,"So the reserve is, if the Court would hold that it was reasonably accurate, the reserve was right, and so their 1972 deduction would still be good."
1986.85-1385,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.547,1475.999,They might... the next year the service might say you are accruing too much.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1475.999,1479.719,"--Well, that would get back to the reasonable estimate--"
1986.85-1385,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.719,1480.402,Yes.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1480.402,1491.027,"--business, but I mean, the nature of reserving accounting is that if they keep accruing too much at some point they are not to be adding to the... in the first year you just take the amount of the reserve."
1986.85-1385,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1495.979,1499.114,You put your finger on it when you said a reserve is self-correcting.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1506.053,1511.072,"Right, at some point it corrects itself, and if you have to reduce the reserves later you will take it into income in a later year, but that is--"
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.072,1521.296,"Mr. Horowitz, does the record tell us whether when... the first year they operated they took over the business from the insurance carriers, did they pay for the reserve in the face amount of the reserve?"
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1524.414,1525.398,--I think they did.
1986.85-1385,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.398,1526.45,"--They did, so that--"
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1526.45,1530.152,Yes.
1986.85-1385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1530.152,1549.364,"--To go back to your simple example there where... suppose they didn't pay out $10 on each doctor's bill, there was some element of qualification in order to get paid."
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1573.245,1575.781,"I think they could not do that, no, but that is the closest--"
1986.85-1385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1575.781,1576.883,Even 99 percent.
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1585.489,1588.857,"--Well, they know as a matter of statistics?"
1986.85-1385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.857,1598.046,"--in this whole stack of bills they cannot say categorically that any single one of those is definitely a claim, is definitely a valid claim, right?"
1986.85-1385,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1598.046,1614.072,"If they can't say that any single one of them is a valid claim, then our position would be that the all events test does not permit them to do that, but I think that is the closest question in this case, and that is really the third ground on why their position is wrong, and I don't think the Court needs to get to it."
1986.85-1385,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.81,1773.976,"Thank you, Mr. Horowitz."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,1777.262,1790.755,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is when it is proper to take a deduction for the liability that the taxpayers have for medical benefits provided to their employees."
1986.85-1385,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1851.594,1857.315,I take it then that you accept the application of the all events test.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,1857.315,1859.517,We do accept the application of that test.
1986.85-1385,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1873.442,1875.894,"That doesn't always assure our position on it, though."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,1875.894,1877.061,True.
1986.85-1385,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1878.68,1880.53,I just wanted to be sure of yours.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,1880.53,1889.036,"--It is clearly the test, and it was reaffirmed by this Court just last term in the Hughes properties decision."
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.055,1920.923,"Well, are those two necessarily totally separate, Ms. McNown?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,1920.923,1930.196,"There is some interrelation between the tests in certain cases, but they are two distinct requirements."
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.915,1950.776,"Supposing you are the Milwaukee Transit Company and you knew that as of December 20th, 1986, you had... your bus had been in an accident, and that you were liable but you didn't yet know the amount."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,1959.132,1961.032,If these are uncontested claims.
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1964.536,1966.702,"No, I am just using that as a hypothetical."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,1969.071,1969.454,Okay.
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.223,1999.792,So in my--
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,1999.792,2000.559,Even though you haven't paid it.
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2000.559,2003.911,--In my hypothesis you would fail Part 2.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2003.911,2013.6,If you couldn't come up with a reasonable estimate of what that liability is you would not be able to deduct it because you have to satisfy both parts of the test.
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2025.257,2029.109,"Before you go on, what do you mean by an uncontested claim?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2053.01,2057.379,--I think contesting the amount of the liability is sufficient contest to dispute the claim.
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.379,2058.914,To dispute the claim.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2058.914,2065.817,You can dispute either the basic underlying liability or the amount that you are going to have to pay to the person.
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.353,2071.638,What if you don't dispute it but you just don't know it?
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2084.779,2098.206,"--The prospects of disputes in tort claims and personal injury claims are so substantial that the courts have looked very askance at those claims because they foresee contests, but we aren't talking--"
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.206,2101.241,"So you would treat that like a contested one, right?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2101.241,2124.42,"--I think you would have to on a case by case basis look at those situations to see if the taxpayer never contests them and always pays out, I don't see the fact that it is a tort claim with no contest either on liability or amount would mean you could not deduct it, but that is not ordinarily what happens in tort claims."
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2127.122,2139.414,"Would your answer be the same even though the Minneapolis Transit Company almost invariably pays out something on all claims, but it may be a lot different than what the plaintiff is demanding."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2139.414,2145.52,If there are contests you cannot deduct the liability at the opening.
1986.85-1385,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2145.52,2153.857,"Well, I suppose there are a good many medical claims that result in some kind of contest, aren't there?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2153.857,2159.744,The record in this case is that there are not substantial medical claims that are contested.
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.755,2201.671,Are there any deductibles?
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2201.671,2205.707,There is typically on the major medical a $100 deductible.
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.347,2302.469,"Well, do you... is it your position that you could just use historical evidence as to what the deduction should be?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2302.469,2305.571,"No, we do not just use historical evidence on the deduction."
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.571,2313.094,"Well, do you know what medical services have been performed during the year?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2313.094,2325.818,"We know at the end of the year that a... we know specific information for all of those employees for whom claims have been filed, and there are employees for whom a claim has been filed with the company."
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.854,2336.524,What about... but aren't there some people you deduct for who have just received medical services but no claim has been filed?
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2336.524,2339.176,There are also people for whom no claim is filed.
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.176,2341.578,Do you know that they have received medical services?
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2341.578,2344.779,Some of those people we do know have received medical services.
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.779,2345.731,But not all of them?
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2345.731,2346.748,But not all of them.
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.731,2350.55,But you just estimate that there are going to be a lot of them?
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2350.55,2354.504,"--We have 56,000 employees."
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2365.093,2366.359,You are guessing the claims exist.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2385.756,2388.172,--We do know many of the claims are there.
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.606,2389.391,"--Yes, but you don't know--"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2389.391,2393.16,"--if people are out of work we probably know that, but knowledge is not required."
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.163,2426.93,"--Well, how did you--"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2426.93,2430.132,And that is very different than not having any knowledge at all.
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.132,2439.738,"--Well, I know, but the fact remains that when you arrived at this figure you deducted you estimated how much medical services."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2445.326,2450.796,"We didn't in fact know all the medical services provided, but that knowledge isn't required."
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.415,2458.867,"So you could just estimate... well, if that is true, then you don't need to know that any."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2462.871,2464.154,"--Well, there are two issues."
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.211,2500.746,So you are saying--
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2500.746,2501.529,We may not know.
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.863,2523.576,--You are saying if there is a challenge to our deduction and you had a proceeding by that time you would know exactly how much medical services had been provided and you could then say that really established the fact of liability.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2523.576,2525.428,"Oh, we know much sooner than that."
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2548.96,2551.928,But as to some of them you don't know even by the end of the year.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2551.928,2553.145,That is correct.
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2564.469,2566.671,But it was certain that there would be a winner.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2566.671,2570.723,--I think it is much more certain in this case that we... we have winners.
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.146,2578.763,You don't know who they are.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2578.763,2579.796,But they have won.
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2579.796,2580.598,You don't know who they are.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2614.336,2620.223,"Well, I submit we are easier than the Hughes case because we could go out and find those employees."
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.232,2646.04,Do you think the slot machine case would have come out the same way if the company had in fact not gone around and looked at the machines and gotten the amount of liability off of each machine?
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2646.04,2651.111,Going around and looking at the machines went to the second issue in that case.
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2663.085,2666.787,0 xxx.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2677.928,2691.918,"Well, I think that in this case the information that we do know, the facts that do exist are sufficient that this Court can find that there is fact of liability."
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.96,2745.487,"But could you deduct for travel expenses if you didn't know that any specific person had traveled but only knew that somewhere in your vast empire there were employees traveling, and that last year there were 15 of them that traveled, and this year there would probably be 15?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2745.487,2749.274,I think that goes to the issue of reasonable amount.
1986.85-1385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2785.613,2803.909,"What if following your advice General Dynamics does deduct for 15 travel payments in 1986 because they had 15 in 1985, and then the Commissioner comes in and says, look, we have looked over this thing and nobody traveled for General Dynamics in 1986?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2808.395,2819.351,"I think the Commissioner would say that that accrual at the end of that year was not a reasonably determined amount and would challenge the deduction on exactly that basis, and it would fail on that basis."
1986.85-1385,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.351,2821.819,"Well, Ms. McNown, beyond that he would say there was no fact of liability."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2824.921,2827.504,"No, it... all right, that is true."
1986.85-1385,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2827.504,2830.206,"For your case, you have to assume that in fact a lot of people traveled."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2830.206,2830.573,Yes.
1986.85-1385,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2830.573,2832.925,"You don't have to know about it, but at least they have to travel."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2835.793,2836.21,Yes.
1986.85-1385,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.431,2843.966,But if you did have nonexistent travelers you would lose.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2843.966,2845.667,--That is correct.
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2846.85,2854.088,"Doesn't that suggest that we are not just talking about the estimate, but we are talking about the first prong?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2854.088,2862.26,"--No, because here when the year ends nobody submits their expense voucher because there aren't any expense vouchers."
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2870.866,2872.235,0 xxx.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2872.235,2874.385,--The claims that haven't been filed will come in.
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2877.603,2887.411,"If your answer to the Chief Justice's question about the airplane tickets is the way it is, why did the insurance companies need a special statute?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2887.411,2898.7,The insurance companies are a whole separate industry which has many different accounting provisions and many different income provisions.
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.171,2930.338,But you do think it is superfluous.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2937.927,2946.45,--On health and benefit claims I think the all events test would satisfy the liability... the reserving requirement for insurance companies.
1986.85-1385,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2961.542,2970.565,"Isn't it true that the special statute enables them to take accrual accounting on a lot of reserves that would not meet the all events test, such as your accident case in Milwaukee?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2970.565,2971.031,It does.
1986.85-1385,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.031,2972.248,I assume those are--
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,2972.248,2972.731,It does.
1986.85-1385,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2996.632,3001.5,--Wasn't there a time when insurance companies were hardly taxed at all?
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3001.5,3012.725,"I believe there was, and there has been a constant fight and reanalysis over insurance company taxation throughout the years before Congress."
1986.85-1385,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3329.914,3332.316,May I ask this question?
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3341.056,3345.96,"Under the record in this case, Your Honor, I am not... the record is not clear on that."
1986.85-1385,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3375.145,3381.816,"Well, sometimes a Medicare claim is not paid or even determined for months."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3381.816,3387.703,There is no evidence in this record that claims processing was in any way delayed.
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3503.426,3514.716,But you also said xxx employees will have been to the doctor or were to the doctor by the end of the year.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3514.716,3518.002,But that goes to the second issue of the test.
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3529.293,3532.495,"Well, it goes to liability, doesn't it?"
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3532.495,3535.964,"--No, the employee is there, he has been to the doctor--"
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3535.964,3537.332,"Well, you don't know that."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3539.268,3555.777,"--In the case where he hasn't filed a claim, if we don't have the knowledge we don't specifically know that, but if he has been there we cannot by January 1 say we aren't going to pay your claim because you didn't get it on file by January 1, and we are going to stop paying claims."
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3555.777,3578.893,"Well, if the Commissioner came in and audited you and you had claimed this deduction and he looked over your books, and it turned out that all of these medical services that you had estimated had been performed never were performed, it would be like the person... like the company whose employees didn't fly."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3578.893,3585.38,"In this case, when the Commissioner would come in and look he would not find that services were not performed."
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3585.38,3590.951,"But if he did, if he did, he would disallow your deduction."

1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3597.604,3598.639,Exactly.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3598.639,3599.772,--we would not be entitled to--
1986.85-1385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3599.772,3602.091,But you are guessing as to how much liability there is.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3602.091,3604.293,--We are estimating the amount of the liability.
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3605.543,3609.662,"Not just the amount, but you are estimating the existence of the liability."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3612.647,3614.232,"I disagree, Your Honor."
1986.85-1385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3621.803,3630.576,"It is a very, very sure estimate, but as to the claims that haven't been filed you are guessing that there is a liability."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3645.168,3648.403,"--It is no more an estimation than occurred in Hughes, I submit."
1986.85-1385,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3681.391,3683.109,"Your real point as I understand it is, you don't have to know."
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3686.795,3688.08,That's correct.
1986.85-1385,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3689.63,3691.032,It doesn't matter whether you didn't know it.
1986.85-1385,1,34893,lynne_e_mc_nown,,3691.032,3692.015,--For the first part of the test--
1986.85-1385,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3692.015,3694.817,As long as you found it out by the time you filled out your tax return.
