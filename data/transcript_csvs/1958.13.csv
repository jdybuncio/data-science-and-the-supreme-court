1958.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,32.884,"Number 13, Federal Housing Administration, Appellant, versus The Darlington Incorporated.Before the argument in this case I make the announcement that the orders of the Court appear upon the list certified by the Chief Justice and filed with the clerk and will not be orally announced."
1958.13,0,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,36.864,39.398,May it please the Court.
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,1962.092,1962.231,Mr. Chief --
1958.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1962.231,1963.555,Mr. Long.
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,1963.555,1967.364,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1985.461,1989.772,Aren't you going to argue the construction --
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,1989.772,1998.585,"I've -- I must say that I'm a little hard to hearing, not deaf enough to one of those ear trumpets and I do have a little complication, so I want to ask the justice to repeat."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1998.585,2003.155,Are you not going to argue that as a matter of construction --
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,2003.155,2003.295,I intend --
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2003.295,2020.58,"-- exactly bars such a construction before you ever reach the constitutional question or added thereto that since there maybe a non-frivolous and serious constitutional question, it ought to be construed the way you contend it."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,2021.249,2022.295,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2022.295,2026.944,"All right, I was just wondering because you started off a simple question with constitutionality."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,2026.944,2029.483,"Well, Your Honor, it's our --"
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2029.483,2029.831,All right.
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,2036.158,2050.424,"Not in the least, I have been fighting that for four years, and I'm right here still continuing that when you read the Act itself, that if you read the Act itself you will find that's an ingeniously worded piece of legislature."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2278.24,2288.99,"It does -- it does shed some light on an earlier act, if Congress in the later act thinks it has to do something which would be needless if it hadn't been accomplished by the earlier act."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2289.264,2292.958,"That has nothing do with technical law, but it has to do with good commonsense."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,2292.958,2301.593,"It certainly does, Your Honor, and this Court has held that and specially in the Sioux Indian Tribe case, in an opinion of this Court."
1958.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2508.928,2530.663,"Mr. Long -- Mr. Long, if we -- if we decide in your favor, does this mean that every apartment house that was built under this program prior to the 1954 Act can now lease any or all of its apartments on a transient basis?"
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,2530.663,2533.088,I would not think so for two reasons.
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2764.977,2765.712,Where is the charter?
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,2765.712,2772.664,On page 184 of the transcript of record.
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2948.693,2956.676,"Mr. Long may I ask you this question, you say for two nights, he might rent part of these things for one night, yes?"
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,2956.676,2956.983,Right.
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2956.983,2960.249,"Now, what I want to ask you is this."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,2980.774,2981.932,"No, sir."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2986.907,2991.871,"Well then one night, I thought you agreed it could be for one night rather than two, that's what I mean by (Voice Overlap) --"
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,2991.871,2995.404,"It could be for one night over two, it could for one week or three weeks."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2995.404,3000.23,"Well now, does that phrase cover that kind of occupancy?"
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3000.23,3011.356,"The part that we state in reference to that, that particular phrase does not, rental housing implies something more than renting by overnight occupancy."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3064.223,3081.984,"Did I understand you to say earlier that they could set apart, set apart not for the kind a mother-in-law visiting a young couple, but set apart a fraction, a reasonable fraction of the total available apartment for transient."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3081.984,3084.783,"I don't -- we don't content that could set apart, no sir."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3120.546,3122.397,"Well, let me -- let me put another question, Mr. Long."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3122.397,3124.141,"Yes, sir."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3124.141,3134.91,"I can understand if this were the letting overnight or for two nights of a transient couple or a transient person, one apartment or two."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3153.588,3166.704,"I -- as a matter of fact, the record would not show that but I think it is in so many words, but I think the record discloses this, that here sits a man with his apartment building."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3212.973,3218.068,I will -- I will wait the Government's reply to what you've just said.
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3235.995,3237.729,"Your Honor, there is the record."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3237.729,3239.163,"All right, I'll do what he said."
1958.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3239.163,3260.794,"Well, Mr. Long, in addition to what you have said Darlington did, didn't they go out and furnish up a large number of these apartments for the -- for the sole purpose of -- of renting them in a -- in a different manner than the -- than the vast majority of them?"
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3260.794,3261.841,"No, Your Honor."
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3354.427,3376.216,"I still do not understand precisely what is this agreement, a part, who are the interested persons, are they stockholders or officers of the company, have they formed the corporation which requires some way of payment of rent to them instead -- for the furniture instead of the The Darlington?"
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3383.902,3397.772,"Absolutely open and shut, set forth in the records of the company, and when requested by the Government that they'd be allowed to send the order to the Charleston, it was agreed that they could send the order to -- in Charleston and do the operation."
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3397.772,3399.895,Who owns that corporation?
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3399.895,3401.862,It's owned by Long Corporation.
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3401.862,3403.253,Who's the Long Corporation?
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3403.253,3406.264,The Long Corporation happens to be relatives of mine.
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3406.264,3407.254,"Well, who are they?[Laughter]"
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3409.557,3412.612,Darlington Corporation is owned by Long Corporation.
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3412.612,3414.156,Darlington Corporation is owned by Long --
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3414.156,3415.447,Long Corporation.
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3415.447,3418.172,And the Long Corporation owns the furniture.
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3418.172,3419.263,Owned the furniture.
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3419.263,3420.527,And it bought the furniture.
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3420.527,3421.279,Bought the furniture --
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3421.279,3428.798,I suppose the transient comes in until -- stay there at night.Does he pay the Darlington or does he pay the Long Corporation?
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3428.798,3430.536,Pays both of them.
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3430.536,3431.636,Pays both of them.
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3431.636,3433.637,And the record shows that.
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3433.883,3435.846,The object -- what's the object of that?
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3435.846,3440.189,"The object of that is this, the furniture does not belong to the Darlington."
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3470.491,3472.396,How much did the Government have in?
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3472.396,3482.048,"The Government has a mortgage for $1,300,000 and they've been paid on that now about a 100 and some odd thousands, paid by my clients at a loss to them each month."
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3482.081,3483.698,And may I -- may I ask you one other question?
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3483.698,3484.301,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3484.301,3493.847,"Suppose you were to lose this case, are there any damages that your company will suffer or is it merely to regulate the use of the building in the future?"
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3494.734,3499.802,"As a matter of audited record, my client would suffer a loss of more than $400,000."
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3499.802,3501.213,How?
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3501.213,3512.812,"Because the Government said the building would cost so much money, and I'd say the Government said the building costs that because under FHA regulation, they set the contract price."
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3534.967,3545.342,Is the Government -- is the Government claiming that it will foreclose or is this an effort to foreclose or is this is an effort to regulate the conduct of the Darlington in the future?
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3545.342,3551.235,"Well, this Your Honor, was a suit where my client brought against the Government because they said this."
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3594.801,3597.346,Has your client since that time --
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3597.346,3597.853,What's that?
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3597.853,3601.371,Has your client since that time been renting for transients?
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3601.371,3602.42,"Yes, sir."
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3602.42,3604.131,It's carried on that practice up to now.
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3604.131,3604.95,That -- that on --
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3604.95,3619.942,"And if you lose this, all you lose is -- so far as I hear what you say, I don't know, is that you filed a suit to enjoin them and try to enforce that regulation against you, and that's what this suit is about."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3619.942,3620.617,That's right.
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3620.617,3625.899,"You wouldn't have to, if I may break in or add to Justice Black's question."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3635.684,3636.277,"No, sir."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3636.277,3640.914,So this is merely a question of whether you can continue to do this in the future.
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3640.914,3641.635,"That's right, but it is --"
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3641.635,3647.063,"Well, I don't understand your answer to Justice Black, you lose -- what is it?$40,000."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3647.063,3647.425,"Well, this is --"
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3647.425,3655.6,"But as far as I can understand it, you don't need to lose that which you would be disabled from renting less than for 30 days."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3655.6,3656.666,We would go broke.
1958.13,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3656.666,3657.816,"Well, Mr. Long, I thought you --"
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3657.816,3662.068,"The record shows in this case that without this rental from this transient, there will be no money to pay them all."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3662.068,3663.707,"In the future, in the future, you would --"
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3663.707,3666.223,"In the past, it's told in the past, and the record (Voice Overlap) --"
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3666.223,3668.18,"Well, I don't understand again."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3672.898,3682.758,"No, Your Honor because while my friend talked about $180 a month, that's presuming a transient -- rents it $180 a month, but there is a little thing about laundry, you understand and cleaning up (Voice Overlap) --"
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3682.758,3688.34,"But this is all -- this is all in futural, this is all for the future."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3688.34,3696.126,"It's all in the future from this standpoint, but without this transient rentals, my client doesn't have funds to make the payments called for by the mortgage which has been insured by them."
1958.13,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3696.126,3707.582,"This is a forecast of the income that you would lose if you couldn't rent for less than 30 days, the access -- the excess apartment."
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3707.59,3708.854,That --
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3708.854,3717.79,What you are saying is that this project which you undertook cannot possibly be operated with a pure rental housing project.
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3717.79,3718.509,It cannot.
1958.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3718.509,3723.269,That you've got to run it as a kind of motel or hotel in part.
1958.13,1,31419,j_c_long,,3723.269,3734.347,"We've got to take advantage of any vacant apartments that we have that we can rent that the people come and ask for and which there's no demand for more than 30 days, I think Justice -- I thought one of you gentlemen --"
1958.13,2,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,4152.434,4153.622,If it please the Court.
1958.13,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4158.154,4159.493,"A question, it wasn't a point."
1958.13,2,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,4159.493,4163.859,"-- question on page 235 of the record, there is a --"
1958.13,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4163.859,4164.563,"What page, Mr. --"
1958.13,2,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,4164.563,4165.653,235.
1958.13,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4184.671,4189.544,But that doesn't -- that doesn't tell us -- that doesn't give you the quantitative light.
1958.13,2,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,4189.544,4198.865,"No, but if the Court pleases, these people, right from the very outset started to rent -- furnish apartments and rent furnished apartments."
1958.13,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4220.403,4225.178,How long has the practice you complain of been going on (Inaudible)?
1958.13,2,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,4225.178,4228.042,The practice (Inaudible).
1958.13,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4228.042,4229.209,(Inaudible) I think it is still going on.
1958.13,2,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,4229.209,4234.177,This building was built in -- finished in July of 1951.
