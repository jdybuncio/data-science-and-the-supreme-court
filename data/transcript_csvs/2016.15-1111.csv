2016.15-1111,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,13.945,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-1111, Bank of America Corporation v. The City of Miami and the consolidated case. Mr. Katyal."
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,13.945,22.26,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether cities can sue under one of our nation's most important laws, the Fair Housing Act."
2016.15-1111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,63.56,85.165,"Could you -- before you do that, Mr. Katyal, could you please tell us: You -- you said, yes, cities can sue under the FHA, but not this -- not on -- in this scenario. Can you tell us what -- under what circumstances could a city sue?"
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,85.165,93.825,"Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. So we want -- our position is to preserve existing law exactly where it is, and existing law identifies two places where cities can sue."
2016.15-1111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,129.615,130.18,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,144.56,159.13,"Because, Justice Sotomayor, in that case -- and this is paragraph (F) of the complaint. It's Appendix page 20 in Havens -- the complaint asks for the City's expenditures to combat -- to identify specific things, including testers and other -- you know, other enforcement things."
2016.15-1111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,159.13,183.87,"Why is this different than the other allegations in Havens that had to do, like here, with lost revenues, with lost tax base, which the Court cited as well? Here there are direct expenditures in terms of increased monitoring of the area by police and other services. Aren't those City expenditures?"
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,183.87,187.09,"So those -- that's not Havens, Justice Sotomayor, with respect."
2016.15-1111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,187.97,188.36,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,189.15,205.89,But -- but -- but our position is that to the extent the City cannot plead a complaint that looks like Gladstone -- and this gets back to Justice Ginsburg's question -- the second bucket in which the City can assert an injury is just like Gladstone in which there is a segregation claim that is being advanced.
2016.15-1111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,225.86,232.32,"I'm sorry, but you're thinking that if banks are forcing people out of a neighborhood, that that's not discrimination?"
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,232.32,232.63,"Oh, no."
2016.15-1111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.41,300.805,"But what about Gladstone, which is the case of a village suing? They were suing for diminished property values that -- which resulted in loss of revenue."
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,314.93,318.58,"So, Justice Ginsburg, I think that that's not totally correct for two reasons."
2016.15-1111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,367.16,370.535,That was a hypothetical the Court brought up on its own.
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,376.905,377.86,"Oh, absolutely."
2016.15-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,409.22,427.015,"Well, is your -- is your concession -- I call it your concession -- your formulation that the City can sue sometimes, are you thinking that the City might be in the same position as Home was in -- was it the -- the Havens case?"
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,427.015,434.55,"So there's two different buckets, and the first bucket -- that was my first answer to Justice Ginsburg -- yes, the City is like Home, the NGO there."
2016.15-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.56,460.64,"That's how you're saying -- and I don't want to foreclose, prevent you from finishing your answer, but are you saying that the City is limited just to the damages that it -- that it can recover?"
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,460.64,464.51,"On that theory, in that bucket, yes, they would be limited to the damages."
2016.15-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,466.73,469.6,"But, I mean, is it just the costs they incur in trying to --"
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,469.6,470.07,Just --
2016.15-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,470.07,471.01,-- eliminate discrimination?
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,471.01,480.19,"Just as it is in the NGO in Havens. Justice Kennedy, I see you're troubled by that, but I point out the second thing is the Gladstone segregation category."
2016.15-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.83,503.35,But would that be added police force or something like that?
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,503.35,503.76,No.
2016.15-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,512.215,521.815,What can the City recover for general damages of having a segregated -- a more segregated community by a result of -- as a result of the defendant's actions?
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,521.815,526.85,"Well, I think that anything that they can directly outlay, and that may be very hard to identify."
2016.15-1111,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,538.74,542.53,Your -- your concession runs into the same problem as your main argument.
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,559.205,560.8,I don't know that it runs into the same thing.
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,591.32,600.355,"But, Mr. Katyal, that suggests that when Congress passed the FHA, it was looking only at individual acts of discrimination to particular persons."
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,639.905,671.56,"Well, we certainly recognize that that is something that is at issue and one of the goals of the Fair Housing Act, but I think the way Congress dealt with that is not by saying, cities are empowered to have some sort of parens patriae standing. That's what they gave the Justice Department and HUD. And as well, by the way, Justice Kagan, in 3610(f), Congress empowered state and local enforcement over housing discrimination to deal with those types of community-centered problems that you're talking about. But here they are not using any of that. They are coming in and saying, we are a person aggrieved."
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,679.17,711.21,"Well, but they are a person aggrieved under the -- given Congress' purposes in the Act, because they are saying, as you did this redlining, as you did this reverse redlining, our communities, the thing that makes us a city was becoming more and more blighted, and that's what we are trying to recover for, the -- the costs of responding to that, the -- the costs of not having revenues in order to carry out our services for that community and for others."
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,711.21,712.46,"So, Justice Kagan --"
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,712.46,713.13,Not parens patriae.
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,724.72,736.03,"Justice Kagan, if the -- if the complaint were written to say that it was about segregation causing blight, we would have no problem with it, which is what I was saying to Justice Ginsburg with respect to zone of interest."
2016.15-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,753.045,759.05,How far out -- how far out would damages extend in -- in the -- the hypothesis you just gave to Justice Kagan?
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,759.05,776.43,"So -- so for zone of interest, I think, you know, you're able to get -- I don't think it matters, that is, to the extent that the City can -- the complaint by the City pleads a segregation harm. Even if it's downstream, they are within the zone of interest. Now to turn to proximate cause, though --"
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,776.43,777.01,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,814.63,820.67,"Justice Kagan, I'd encourage you to just look back at what you just said and then read it against their complaint, because none of that's in the complaint."
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,820.67,827.42,"So do you think everything I just said, if their complaint was written like that, that they could maintain a suit?"
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,827.42,829.7,They could maintain a suit for segregation.
2016.15-1111,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,856.05,857.88,How -- how do you measure that?
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,857.88,858.86,I'm not sure.
2016.15-1111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,913.6,924.175,"Your answer aimed at Gladstone would be, I take it from everything you said, that Gladstone would flunk at the proximate-cause stage?"
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,924.175,931.52,"So I do think that that's right; that is, there would be so many steps involved -- and you could just take a look at this complaint."
2016.15-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,954.0,960.825,"I usually think of proximate cause -- correct me if I'm wrong -- as a question of liability, not damages -- Palsgraf."
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,963.76,965.05,Correct.
2016.15-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,965.32,966.49,So it wasn't a question of damages.
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,969.575,969.98,I do.
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1000.97,1001.25,Mr. Katyal --
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1001.25,1003.08,-- foreclosure crisis. I'm sorry.
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1003.77,1019.46,Can I ask a separate question? We've been talking a lot about zone of interests and the question about whether the zone-of-interest test applies at all. Because you have three cases prior to this 1988 re-enactment of the old 1968 language.
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1043.89,1055.56,"For three reasons, Justice Kagan. The first is that, at most, the congressional ratification doctrine only applies to holdings of the Court, not that -- I know you weren't on the Court for Thompson, but a lot of the rest of us were here."
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1059.76,1061.74,I'm disabled from having thoughts on this subject.
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1061.74,1063.105,"No, no, absolutely not."
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1076.61,1085.63,"I guess I don't understand. I mean, we can argue about whether these were holdings and whether these were a dicta, and there are arguments on both sides of that. But here I am on Congress."
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1113.845,1151.575,"Well, Your -- Your Honor, I think I'd be fired if I did what you said, which is not actually follow what this Court's cases require, which is, quote, ""An express negation of the zone-of-interest test,"" not borrowing from some, you know, implicit doctrine. Because at its high water mark, this Court has said in Jama: ""The congressional ratification doctrine is only a guide to word what Congress implicitly thought."" And at least starting in 1983 in the Block case -- and I think even going before that in the AGC case, perhaps going even before that -- this Court has said, you need an express negation by Congress in order to abrogate the zone-of-interest test. And that is just not what happened here."
2016.15-1111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1152.94,1166.39,"Strange -- strange development, because the zone-of-interest test, at least as it was announced in data processing, was understood to expand standing over what it had been before."
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1174.445,1175.53,"Well, certainly."
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1205.07,1207.3,I don't read the -- the House Report that way.
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1268.46,1281.96,"I'll answer that, and then I'd like to turn to proximate cause. So, Justice Kagan, even if all of that is true, I think this Court has insisted on an express negation for precisely this reason, so that you don't go tap Drew Days and what -- have to --"
2016.15-1111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1281.96,1296.26,"Mr. Katyal, this is not an express -- an express limitation that means we're not -- we're doing away or we are keeping the zone of interest, because Lexmark itself was -- just establishes that rule."
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1346.21,1346.88,Justice Sotomayor --
2016.15-1111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1346.88,1347.965,Why is that --
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1347.965,1349.31,It is not very different.
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1409.935,1419.565,"When you say that -- when you said to me that the complaints that I wrote would have been covered by the Act, do you think it also would fall within proximate-cause principles?"
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1419.565,1423.59,I -- I think that the -- the complaint would have to satisfy a directness requirement.
2016.15-1111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1484.61,1503.165,"But is one understanding -- like, I guess, when I started reading the briefs, I was confused about this, because there's one understanding of proximate cause, which is that usually proximate cause is about foreseeability and only foreseeability. Now, there are definitely places where we've said there's this additional directness requirement, but only in pretty discrete areas."
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1521.185,1533.27,"I'll -- I'll answer that, and then if I could reserve the balance of my time. I think this Court in Paroline said, quote, ""The proximate cause generally falls to the basic requirement, there must be a direct relationship between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct."""
2016.15-1111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1533.27,1533.64,So --
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1533.64,1535.16,I think Paroline and Lexmark both do that.
2016.15-1111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1537.14,1542.0,So what do we do with all of the statements in Havens? I'm quoting.
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1564.93,1566.69,"Justice Sotomayor, I absolutely agree --"
2016.15-1111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1566.69,1567.44,"Well, I mean --"
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1567.44,1568.105,-- with all of them.
2016.15-1111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1569.25,1570.23,-- we have repeatedly said --
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1570.23,1570.58,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1570.58,1576.015,"-- the difference between direct and indirect, it has no meaning in the statute."
2016.15-1111,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1577.955,1580.59,"Justice Sotomayor, we've never said anything about proximate cause."
2016.15-1111,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1584.46,1592.785,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Peck."
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1592.785,1644.09,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The City of Miami brought this -- these cases seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages because the banks' practice of providing minority borrowers with more expensive and riskier loans than they qualified for, or that nonminority borrowers received, actually frustrated and counteracted the City's efforts on fair housing, and -- and tended to -- to cause the City to lose the benefits of social, professional, and business opportunities that come with an integrated community free from housing discrimination. Now, you heard my friend describe these as two buckets, that if the complaint makes that out clearly, then we do have standing that we fit within the zone of interests."
2016.15-1111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1711.994,1749.09,"I'm looking at the Joint Appendix, page 186, your opening paragraph where you say, ""BoA's conduct has harmed the residents of Miami and impaired the"" -- ""the City's strong, long-standing, and active commitment to open integrated residential housing patterns and its attendant benefits of creating a stable community -- community."" And then you go on to the specific damages, the loss of tax revenues, and increased expenses. It's those types of allegations in your amended complaint that you're pointing to?"
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1749.09,1750.32,I -- I point to those.
2016.15-1111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1759.86,1763.375,This pretty much tracks Havens and Gladstone.
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1763.375,1796.35,"It does, indeed, Justice Sotomayor. As so -- so a result, we think that regardless of whether you take the Article III approach to standing in this case, or take a more narrow formulation that depends on the fact that we -- our aggrievement is tied to violations of the Act, the City of Miami has standing. And -- and the -- I don't understand either bank in their briefs should disagree with us on that as long as we make those pleadings."
2016.15-1111,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1804.4,1816.765,Do you think you're a victim of discrimination? Because it seems to me the damages that you seek are not going to be paid to those who were the direct victims of the discrimination.
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1816.765,1821.325,We are seeking -- we are direct -- a direct victim.
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1840.78,1850.62,But your injuries are derivative of the injury to the homeowners who had the subprime mortgages and who suffered the foreclosure and so on.
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1859.12,1872.3,It is a -- what -- what we're saying is the injury here is the injury to our interest in an integrated community that has those business and social opportunities that this Court found cognizable in -- in Gladstone.
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1872.3,1882.835,"Where -- where is the limit to that? I mean you asked for property taxes, but presumably you suffer loss of sales taxes because of the blight on the community."
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1890.5,1891.865,We do not think we can.
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1891.865,1892.56,And why is that?
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1892.56,1892.9,And that's --
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1892.9,1894.21,I certainly can see the logic.
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1898.29,1901.13,But cities are in a unique position.
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1929.35,1931.44,So articulate in a sentence what the difference is.
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1941.13,1945.62,"Well, we believe that because it has to be tied specifically to the property."
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1947.68,1952.76,"How do you -- how do you -- how are costs of increased services, whether it's police or whatever, how is that directly tied --"
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1952.76,1966.98,"We're not claiming for the increased services of police, but -- but our department that has to look for unsafe structures and -- and find those structures because they've been abandoned after foreclosure, that our department that has to remediate neighborhoods."
2016.15-1111,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2000.27,2005.635,Mr. Katyal said that Gladstone never got to proximate cause.
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2012.215,2020.535,"Justice Ginsburg, the -- the Court did not describe proximate cause here, but it's hard to read that sentence with anything but referring to proximate cause."
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2057.61,2062.02,"Well, presumably one of the issues factored into the settlement was the question that's presented today."
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2072.21,2074.2,"You know, it's possible."
2016.15-1111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2092.495,2108.415,"Mr. Peck, would you go back to the question the Chief started with, which is, how do you define the limits of your foresee -- foreseeability tests? Clearly less tourism."
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2125.76,2127.775,I think they are difficult to measure.
2016.15-1111,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2137.19,2145.445,"You want us to use the word, the phrase, the concept ""proximate cause"" in determining how far damages extend?"
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2145.445,2152.38,"You know, I -- I think it -- it provides some help, but not a great deal of help. In Lexmark, for example --"
2016.15-1111,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2152.38,2155.235,So -- so what -- where do I turn next?
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2155.235,2164.0,"Well, you know -- you know, in Lexmark the guidance that this Court gave was that damages incurred for the very conduct the statute prohibits."
2016.15-1111,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2167.54,2171.65,The statute doesn't prohibit decreasing property tax values.
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2171.65,2184.18,"But it does prohibit -- it prohibits discrimination in housing, and this is one of the damages that we suffer that is directly from -- the result of these kinds of home loans."
2016.15-1111,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.17,2242.62,"Do we have to go into that, or not? I'm not -- not saying we should or shouldn't, but I mean, do we have to to decide this case, decide the damages, what damages are appropriate?"
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2242.62,2267.08,"You do not need to decide that. In fact, one of the things that the Eleventh Circuit noted is that in the time between when the briefs were written and when we argued the case, this Court came down with the decision in Inclusive Communities, and in that decision, the Court's mentioned that there is a proximate-cause pleading standard that needs to be incorporated."
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2282.525,2292.085,"So if we include language along the lines that don't worry, it's not going to be very much based on the experience in -- in Baltimore and -- and Memphis? (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2292.085,2332.775,"Well, I just think that the -- you know, the fact that our -- our opponents have indicated that we are talking about billions and billions of dollars and that this is about the 2008 financial crisis, which I also want to deny, needed a response. And -- and -- and with respect to the financial crisis, if -- if the 2008 financial crisis was, indeed, the purpose of this lawsuit, then the statute of limitations, which is two years, would have -- would have ended this lawsuit a long time ago. But instead what we found, and what the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged, is that while the kinds of loans -- the financial crisis was set off by subprime lending."
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2353.6,2361.995,"Is there -- is there a difference? I couldn't -- the -- the complaint was not clear to me, anyway, between subprime loans and predatory loans."
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2361.995,2369.555,You -- predatory loans are used as sort of a generic term to talk about a taking advantage of a borrower.
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2379.995,2385.21,So are all -- all subprime loans properly categorized as predatory?
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2385.21,2392.79,I believe that the subprime loans that -- that fueled the financial crisis are all considered predatory.
2016.15-1111,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2392.79,2400.31,"Suppose you have a business that -- that is losing money, losing employees, because the neighborhood is deteriorating."
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2409.25,2413.27,I think they have a weaker claim. We have a claim that's tied to the fact --
2016.15-1111,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2413.27,2414.995,They are property owners.
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2414.995,2419.11,"They are property owners, but they're also commercial property owners."
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2485.66,2500.42,"But wouldn't the business owner have an interest in running his business in an integrated vibrant neighborhood just as the City would have, I would say, a less direct interest in having that neighborhood preserved in the City?"
2016.15-1111,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2500.42,2504.81,"You know, it may be so that a particular business does have that interest."
2016.15-1111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2715.84,2727.26,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon."
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2727.26,2740.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Gladstone, this Court concluded that a municipality was injured if discriminatory housing practices caused a reduction in property values and, therefore, diminished its tax revenues."
2016.15-1111,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2800.78,2802.99,"Well, that's a very broad statement, Mr. Gannon."
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2812.95,2817.65,"Well, I agree with my friends on both sides that that limit is going to come from the proximate-cause analysis."
2016.15-1111,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2856.31,2874.76,"You may not need to go into it, but how does proximate cause help you? You could have a dry cleaner or you could have a magazine that writes about successes in integration and wants to write about this community before it got wrecked or whatever. Clause could be absolutely clear. Absolutely clear."
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2880.965,2883.44,"Well, if not -- I -- I think that what we are saying --"
2016.15-1111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2883.44,2885.64,"They haven't even argued that, and they didn't decide."
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2885.64,2885.7,No.
2016.15-1111,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2898.15,2914.33,"And you heard -- you heard what the question was -- the question before and it still is -- if we get into it -- we may not need to, but if we did -- it would be somebody in Alaska who writes magazine articles about successes in integration is going to be wrecked because they don't have the integration."
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2920.86,2923.93,"And I -- we -- we think -- no. We think that -- we think that that is further afield, and we think that --"
2016.15-1111,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.93,2925.42,You think it's further afield --
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2925.42,2925.72,Yes.
2016.15-1111,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2926.1,2928.4,"-- not because of causation though, because it's caused."
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2931.93,2933.12,"Yes, it's caused."
2016.15-1111,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2987.01,3001.815,"Mr. Gannon, how do -- how do we write it? Let's take the corner grocer who had a running account with that home or the gardener who every week cleaned the property."
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3020.605,3021.19,I think --
2016.15-1111,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3021.19,3025.99,The company shareholder. What's -- how do we say it?
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3025.99,3044.6,"The link that we see is -- is to property value, and that's the injury that the Court already recognized in Gladstone. This is a question of congressional intent. When you're -- when you're construing proximate cause, you're trying to figure out what Congress intended. This Court had already recognized that a city was directly injured by decreased property value."
2016.15-1111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3069.86,3075.36,"Could you give us some more concrete answers? The -- the utility company, you say it's further afield."
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3076.34,3077.435,We think it's not covered.
2016.15-1111,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3095.74,3100.06,How about real estate brokers whose commission is based on the value of the property?
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3100.06,3100.73,Yes.
2016.15-1111,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3124.65,3127.89,What if they wrote it generally? They said this -- this is now a poor community.
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3130.175,3131.15,I -- I think that --
2016.15-1111,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3131.15,3134.64,They are -- they're somehow different from the corner grocery store? I don't get it.
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3134.64,3134.92,No.
2016.15-1111,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3137.79,3138.9,That is my hypothetical.
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3138.9,3153.66,"That might be harder for them to establish the types of cases that -- that we've previously seen are where developers, brokers, real estate -- real estate agents have -- have talked about specific transactions that they can say were caused by -- by discriminatory housing practices."
2016.15-1111,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3188.79,3189.48,So your answer --
2016.15-1111,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3189.48,3191.305,Perhaps -- please.
2016.15-1111,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3191.305,3210.9,"Your answer, I think, to the question is that it's limited to those cognizable suits contemplated by the statute, and you see contemplated by the statute as having to do with the possession or value of the property?"
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3210.9,3244.97,"We think that the -- the harms that flow directly from changes in property value were ones that Congress contemplated, both in 1968, and certainly in 1988, after this Court had already -- had already enumerated that as a particular type of harm that was at issue here. And we don't think that the City should have to establish that there's been a change in racial composition of the neighborhood in order to bring a suit, because the Fair Housing Act is intended to cover -- is intended to prohibit discriminatory housing practices throughout the United States, and that includes segregated communities that aren't changing if there is discrimination."
2016.15-1111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3244.97,3249.94,So the City can sue based on isolated instances of discrimination?
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3249.94,3250.79,To the extent --
2016.15-1111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3250.79,3273.145,"I thought that the basic pitch of the -- of your position is that it affects the community as a whole, and the City has an interest in ensuring the stability of the communities, not that the City could enforce particular instances of housing discrimination."
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3273.145,3274.63,I -- I think it's both.
2016.15-1111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3286.49,3288.225,Could be one -- one particular home?
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3288.225,3288.665,Yeah.
2016.15-1111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3295.87,3297.39,I don't know if there's that much in it.
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3298.52,3298.85,Yes.
2016.15-1111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3313.065,3322.44,So the City can bring an action of the sort we're talking about here in the case of one subprime mortgage that results in a foreclosure?
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3322.44,3327.38,If they can say that that -- that's -- that that was caused by discriminatory housing practices --
2016.15-1111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3327.38,3327.47,Yes.
2016.15-1111,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3327.47,3328.84,-- and that it injured them? Yes.
2016.15-1111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3336.475,3341.865,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal, you have four minutes."
2016.15-1111,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3341.865,3347.91,"Four points, Your Honor. First, with respect to this complaint, to paragraph 186 and so on, we agree."
2016.15-1111,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3551.79,3559.26,"Well, it's hard to think that Congress didn't know that in 1988, when we've already let a village come in, in a municipality."
2016.15-1111,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3559.26,3564.36,"But, Justice Sotomayor, our position on this -- and this is very important -- we're not quibbling with that."
2016.15-1111,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3577.1,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
