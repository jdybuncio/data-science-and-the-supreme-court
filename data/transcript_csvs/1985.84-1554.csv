1985.84-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.608,We will hear arguments next in Murray against Carrier.
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,68.817,81.89,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents two questions the resolution of which will have a profound effect on habeas corpus litigation."
1985.84-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,289.776,290.479,Excuse me.
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,290.479,291.073,--Yes.
1985.84-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,291.073,298.583,"Did you tell us that he had asserted it among a number of other grounds of appeal initially, but he did not press it by brief."
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,298.912,299.474,That is correct.
1985.84-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,299.474,301.693,Is that under Virginia law?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,304.316,311.673,At that time it was required that your issues be assigned in the notice of appeal.
1985.84-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,312.861,314.094,He did that?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,314.094,314.657,--He did that.
1985.84-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,314.657,315.485,Yes.
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,315.485,321.576,"And that is the first step toward having appellate review, but that is only the initial step."
1985.84-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,326.2,328.278,"Well, may I ask, what is the Virginia law?"
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,333.839,334.667,"--No, sir, not at all."
1985.84-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,334.667,337.979,And the failure to brief is what?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,339.401,345.32,"The failure to brief that issue means that the issue is lost, because only claims that are pursued--"
1985.84-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,345.32,346.412,"When you say lost, do you mean waived?"
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,346.412,350.942,"--Waived or defaulted, so it cannot be considered."
1985.84-1554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,422.147,424.662,May I just ask one point about that?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,440.813,443.093,"--I realize, Justice O'Connor--"
1985.84-1554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,443.093,477.172,"And for the cause and prejudice inquiry and the argument you are making, would you have us focus on the performance of counsel at the trial as a whole, or would you concede that you have to focus on this specific complaint, this one alleged error, and ask if it was ineffectiveness in that narrower focus only, some kind of clear failure to meet a reasonably competent standard as to a single error?"
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,477.391,488.166,"--I believe you would look in both cases at the whole performance, but the focus in each instance would be on the specific default or defect or deficiency of the attorney."
1985.84-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.645,587.596,May I interrupt again to get one thing straight in my mind before lunch comes?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,596.108,596.921,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,597.748,605.761,"And the Virginia Supreme Court doesn't write an opinion, they just say... it is a little one-paragraph disposition finding no reversible error in the judgments complained of."
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,611.291,630.939,"No, sir, I think it is their practice to look at the issues asserted in the petition for appeal, because the Virginia rule says that if you don't assert them or pursue them in the petition for appeal, then they are not considered, so I don't think the Court would look at errors assigned in the notice."
1985.84-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.906,639.732,Is this a typical disposition of a criminal case where they don't write an opinion even identifying the errors they considered?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,643.591,645.042,"Actually, it is not a discretionary review."
1985.84-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,708.174,709.297,We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,722.026,761.948,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as I was saying at the luncheon break, even if this Court accepts our position on the exhaustive question, and we fervently hope the Court will, acceptance of the Fourth Circuit's rule will put enormous pressure on the state courts to lower their standards, to accept mere attorney error and inadvertence as an excuse for serious procedural defaults or face the alternative of simply deferring the federal court without providing the federal court the benefit of either state factual findings or the benefit of the state court's reasoning."
1985.84-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.865,855.051,"May I ask, do you interpret the Court of Appeals... the Fourth Circuit opinion as applying to trial error as well as error on appeal?"
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,855.051,861.658,"I don't see anything in the opinion, Justice Stevens, that would limit their reasoning to the appellate default."
1985.84-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.658,867.813,Do you think we might possibly limit the holding in this Court and then avoid some of the problems that you are discussing?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,867.813,871.389,"I don't think it would avoid the problems that I am discussing, because I think--"
1985.84-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.389,874.401,The examples you gave were trial... errors at the trial level.
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,874.401,879.167,"--Yes, as far as the type of default, yes, on overlooking an issue."
1985.84-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.27,897.41,What harm would the rule cause if we did so limit it?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,897.41,901.11,I am not sure that I am following.
1985.84-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.375,906.875,As applying only to error on appeal.
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,906.875,923.821,"--I Think that would be devastating, because it would have the same problem of allowing... taking the pressure off counsel not to focus on the most important questions, not to carefully analyze the possible issues on appeal."
1985.84-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.821,925.241,What do you do with the problem then?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,938.206,954.558,"Justice Stevens, I submit that if the attorney makes an admission that would result in a defendant who is innocent going free, he would have no difficulty establishing ineffective assistance of counsel, if indeed the default flowed from attorney error."
1985.84-1554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,955.777,958.338,Is there a claim here the carrier was innocent?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,958.338,961.087,There is no claim the carrier was innocent.
1985.84-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.814,1099.327,"If you win on your exhaustion point, what has to be exhausted?"
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1099.327,1110.12,It is our position that he should return to the state court to present his allegation of cause that he suffered attorney deficiency.
1985.84-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1115.65,1122.804,"I know, but the Court of Appeals here said it didn't have to be ineffective assistance of counsel, right?"
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1122.804,1128.035,"That is true, but this is the problem with not requiring exhaustion."
1985.84-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1161.599,1169.408,Wouldn't you be just as happy if we said that momentary lapse of counsel is not cause?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1169.408,1184.949,"--No, we wouldn't be as happy because we think the state court should have the opportunity to make that assessment of whether... in other words, if you are going to say that under all circumstances--"
1985.84-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1184.949,1191.462,"Well, suppose you go back to state court and the state court says, well, this was not ineffective assistance of counsel, denied."
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1210.627,1218.342,"--Well, that is why I think it is essential that this Court find that it has got to rise to the level of ineffective assistance."
1985.84-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.342,1220.076,"All right, so we have to decide that as well?"
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1220.076,1220.764,I think you do.
1985.84-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1225.136,1241.677,"On that same point, as I understand your position, if counsel makes a choice not to raise a point in either the lower court or the federal court, that is just too bad, because it is charged to the defendant."
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1241.677,1241.973,"No, sir."
1985.84-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1250.985,1252.438,He would be bound.
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1252.438,1255.265,But if he does not pass that test he would not be bound.
1985.84-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1255.265,1259.7,"If the prosecutor violates his principles, then that is harmless error."
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1262.466,1263.152,"No, sir, that would be--"
1985.84-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1263.152,1264.386,But they are both lawyers.
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1268.54,1270.775,--The prosecutor would be equally bound.
1985.84-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1272.82,1276.71,Can you give me a case where they didn't find harmless error?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1276.71,1289.782,"Yes, there is a case in Virginia, Rice versus Commonwealth, where the Commonwealth attempted to challenge a state statute for the first time on appeal, and the Supreme Court of Virginia held that they would not entertain the question."
1985.84-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1297.201,1301.167,Did they say... was the harmless error point raised?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1301.167,1304.15,There was no consideration given to the harmless error doctrine.
1985.84-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1304.15,1306.603,That was the kind of case I was talking about.
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1306.603,1311.945,"I am not certain I understand your question, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1311.945,1321.675,Is there a case in Virginia where a prosecutor violated a rule and it wasn't declared to be harmless error?
1985.84-1554,0,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,1321.675,1323.284,"Yes, sir, many situations--"
1985.84-1554,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1359.847,1371.078,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to begin by describing what our position is with respect to attorney oversights."
1985.84-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1867.053,1867.928,Let me try one.
1985.84-1554,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1867.928,1868.662,All right.
1985.84-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1868.662,1884.655,"Tried in the federal criminal court, and claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the only claim is that the counsel did not ask for Jenks Act material."
1985.84-1554,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1890.621,1892.668,"Well, I don't think that the--"
1985.84-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1892.668,1895.588,Would that be ineffective?
1985.84-1554,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1895.588,1900.414,"--Well, I can't answer your question on the basis of the facts that you have supplied me applying the Strickland standard."
1985.84-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1937.789,1940.835,"Well, after you look at all of that, would you find him anything?"
1985.84-1554,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1940.835,1943.991,I... I might.
1985.84-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.002,1961.577,"Mr. Frey, doesn't Justice Marshall's example, just like this case, say that you really... how can you answer without knowing what the Jenks Act material is, or how can you answer this question without seeing the file?"
1985.84-1554,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1961.577,1972.262,"That is to do away with the procedural default doctrine altogether, because the premise of all of these situations is that the defendant had a meritorious claim which he has lost."
1985.84-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1976.433,1982.024,"In your view, does the strength of the claim have any effect on the analysis, or do we treat all the claims alike?"
1985.84-1554,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1982.024,1990.709,"Well, I know that your view was that the strength of the claim would, and I think the strength of the claim would have relevance under the Strickland standard."
1985.84-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2002.015,2004.375,"So the rule would apply, because Justice Rehnquist raised it earlier."
1985.84-1554,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2010.825,2019.15,"--Well, I would have to say in answer to your question again that the premise always is that he would prevail."
1985.84-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2032.926,2035.33,How many judges passed on this in camera?
1985.84-1554,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2035.33,2035.721,Excuse me?
1985.84-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2035.721,2037.657,Did two judges pass on this?
1985.84-1554,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2037.657,2042.125,"My understanding is, the two trial judges did examine this, yes."
1985.84-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2044.672,2049.232,Mr. Cohn.
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2049.232,2071.817,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the issue before this Court is really quite a narrow one, the meaning of the word ""cause"" under the Wainwright versus Sykes doctrine, and it is really narrower than that."
1985.84-1554,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2264.536,2281.762,"Mr. Cohn, now, does the standard the Fourth Circuit applied require holding a hearing in every case that a habeas petitioner alleges some colorable constitutional claim when the record doesn't show why the attorney acted as the attorney did?"
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2281.762,2283.45,In this case--
1985.84-1554,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2283.45,2289.494,And isn't that kind of an unfortunate standard to have in these cases?
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2289.494,2294.242,"--In this case, Your Honor, we have more than that."
1985.84-1554,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2329.885,2345.878,"Well, the Fourth Circuit test does seem to suggest that that would be the result, and I just wonder if that is in keeping with what justified the court's holdings in Wainwright against Sykes and in the Engel case."
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2345.878,2356.311,"Your Honor, in Wainwright versus Sykes there is the cause prejudice exception to the procedural bar."
1985.84-1554,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.799,2396.326,"But if it is that simple, then what the Fourth Circuit has really done, isn't it, is to say that it is a deliberate bypass test, but you apply it to the lawyer and not to the client."
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2396.326,2410.634,"Your Honor, in this narrow situation, that may be so, but it is deliberate bypass in the same sense that the Chief Justice pointed out in Jones versus Barnes."
1985.84-1554,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2428.002,2447.62,"But it puts a premium in a sense on knowledge rather than judgment, it seems to me, because if you say the lawyer knew about this issue but decided to waive it, then he can't make anything of it, whereas it might have been just terribly bad judgment to waive it even though he knew about it."
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2447.62,2462.317,"As Jones versus Barnes points out, any appellate counsel having a series of potential issues before him has to winnow out those issues that he considers to be the strongest."
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.334,2504.473,"Well, counsel, you keep saying the first prong of Strickland would be met."
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2518.218,2524.652,"Well, it all depends on your meaning of ineffectiveness, Justice Blackmun."
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.652,2525.683,"Well, all I--"
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2525.683,2526.777,"I mean, if--"
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.777,2530.946,--The Court of Appeals said it didn't need to amount to ineffectiveness of counsel.
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2530.946,2535.882,--If you mean by ineffectiveness the wholesale--
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.882,2537.054,What did the Court of Appeals mean?
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2538.07,2538.771,--Okay--
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.771,2541.849,"Are you defending the Court of Appeals opinion, and if so, tell me what it means?"
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2541.849,2550.97,--I am defending the Court of Appeals opinion as I believe it is meant in a narrow holding.
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.762,2563.683,So you concede that reading is just wrong.
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2564.34,2565.745,I concede that--
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.745,2567.198,Or you just don't defend that language.
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2567.198,2581.88,"--It is unnecessary to here to begin with, and also, once we get to the question of mere error, whatever that may mean, I have difficulty articulating a test."
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.88,2589.205,"If it is really... if the issue really was ineffectiveness of counsel, why shouldn't you have to exhaust it?"
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2589.205,2604.683,"Because we are here talking about not ineffectiveness as an independent Sixth Amendment claim, which would get the petitioner complete relief in its own mind."
1985.84-1554,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2639.887,2650.29,"But you don't have to meet the second prong of Strickland in showing its effect on the outcome of the trial under the Fourth Circuit's view, in your view, I take it."
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2650.29,2664.925,"Justice Rehnquist, the cause prong of Sykes as construed in this type of situation only gets you over an initial hurdle."
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.61,2675.466,"Well, the Court of Appeals remanded it to find to deal with prejudice if you got that far."
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2675.466,2676.091,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.091,2684.103,"Now, what do you conceive to be the prejudice inquiry if you got that far in the District Court."
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2684.103,2689.975,"I think, Your Honor, that somebody would have to take a look at those notes."
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2689.975,2695.254,"And then you would ask, would they probably have made a difference in the outcome of the trial?"
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2695.254,2696.114,That's correct.
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.114,2703.612,"Which is the other end of the ineffectiveness claim, too, isn't it?"
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2703.612,2719.511,"We have sort of jostled a bit between counsel as to whether the prejudice test under Sykes and the prejudice test under Strickland are any different, and we have each tried to pick out the language."
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.949,2726.055,You don't think there is clearly any difference between them.
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2726.618,2731.771,"--If there is one, I have a strong difficulty in articulating it."
1985.84-1554,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2742.237,2756.309,"If there is no difference in the prejudice prong, does it really make any sense to generate this middle ground and have a new body of doctrine grow up about it if really it isn't going to make a whole lot of difference as to what happens to the habeas petitioner in the end?"
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2756.309,2778.596,"It makes a difference in this sense, Justice Rehnquist, that under Sykes, one is able to get into court, show cause, and get to the constitutional or the claimed constitutional violation, and if that is prejudicial."
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.596,2786.828,"You are already dealing with the merits of that claimed constitutional violation in this case when you deal with the prejudice angle, I would think."
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2786.828,2787.234,I don't know now--
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.234,2791.639,"Because the claimed violation is a failure to turn over these statements, isn't it?"
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2791.639,2801.838,"--But in order to determine whether that is prejudicial, one has to examine the documents that were not turned over."
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2801.838,2802.369,I agree with you.
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2802.369,2803.088,And I don't see how else to do it.
1985.84-1554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.088,2809.193,"And if you have to get to this kind of a question, I would think you would want the state courts to deal with it in the first instance, to exhaust it."
1985.84-1554,2,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2819.003,2824.578,"Well, Your Honor, that is what this Court spoke about in Sykes and in Engel."
1985.84-1554,3,32964,jerry_p_slonaker,,3165.971,3167.268,"Nothing further, Your Honor."
1985.84-1554,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3167.268,3169.221,"Thank you, gentlemen."
