1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.264,Brady against the United States.
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,18.205,20.873,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,293.79,310.956,"I realize yours is a federal case, but in your retroactivity argument, do you think whatever rule that is appropriate here is also appropriate as application of Jackson to the states."
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,310.956,312.363,I feel that it is Your Honor.
1969.270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.807,323.511,You are not concerned for that I recognized.
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,323.511,334.991,"Well, I believe that it should be applicable postulating that we have the same kind of a statute and the same kind of selective death penalty provision, I would submit that it should be applicable to the states."
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,675.55,684.441,"Mr. Adang, does the -- is the decision in your favor on retroactivity have impact far beyond the Kidnapping Act?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,684.441,686.593,I don't believe it would Your Honor.
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,693.196,697.758,"Well that may be in six, seven or eight states."
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,702.694,707.987,"Well, that is a possibility but I don't think that the Government has submitted --"
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,707.987,710.059,Possibility?
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,710.059,711.548,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,712.607,714.571,Isn't it stronger than that?
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,714.571,718.871,"Well, I don't know how many cases we're talking about."
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,723.782,727.745,"Well since we don't know, you can't just say its 120."
1969.270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,762.469,767.023,"That -- that was the holding of Jackson, wasn't it?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,767.023,769.889,"No, it wasn't Your Honor, because Jackson -- the facts in the holding of Jackson --"
1969.270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,769.889,779.831,"The holding of Jackson didn't get the death penalty provision of the federal so-called Lindbergh Law was unconstitutional period, isn't that true?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,779.831,794.733,"I believe that that is correct and I think that while the facts of Jackson were very limited, I think that because of the holding, it encompasses our argument and the retroactivity."
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,859.804,890.258,"Does the rational you are urging on us have any possible application to situation where a defendant enters a guilty plea to, let us say, any lesser offense, manslaughter on a second-degree murder charge where no death penalty is involved, where he is giving up his jury trial in order to avoid a heavier penalty?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,890.258,898.084,"I don't believe that it does, Your Honor, and if I may, I'll address myself to this argument because the Government has raised it in its answer brief."
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,943.281,949.362,Isn't that the whole idea underlying the concept of plea negotiations and discussions?
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1110.574,1132.645,"What about the situation where there is a bargain for penalty without the bargain for a lesser degree or another crime or through the defense, is the straight charge and the plea of guilty in return for recommendation not only in certain sentence, then you are right in fact in Jackson, absolutely as you read it?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1132.645,1139.631,"To some extent, but in that situation, it's obvious that the recommendation is not binding on the Court so there's really no guarantee."
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1139.631,1142.135,"Well, I know, but the Court accepts it."
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1142.135,1142.86,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1142.86,1147.779,The Court accepts it and what if it were acceptable?
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1155.125,1167.073,"Well, again I don't think that would invalidate the plea because the Courts have always held in this kind of situation the recommendation of the United State's attorney or the prosecutor in the case is not binding upon the Court."
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1175.603,1194.591,"But if it were accepted, if the Court followed the recommendation, the Court asked the prosecutor what he recommends, perhaps that isn't the practice but assume it did and the prosecutor made the recommendation and it was taken and accepted and there was a plea of guilty?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1194.591,1213.749,"Well again, I think all I can say about is you get down to a negotiating situation or bargaining situation and we've always held that plea bargaining is not itself invalid whereas in the situation of the death penalty provision, that's there in the statute and it itself creates a compulsion."
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1524.932,1530.99,"Would there always be a definite factor, how could if not be?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1530.99,1536.893,"Well, I think there you can probably postulate situations Your Honor where it wouldn't be."
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1627.969,1646.106,But if there is complete implementation of Rule 11 on the judge who takes the plea makes an inquiry which develops all the facts which accumulatively would make for guilt?
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1654.232,1659.104,That's postulating leaving the selective death penalty provision and I suppose --
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1659.104,1659.63,Yes.
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1659.63,1665.257,"And I would say no, it would not because I think that question has already been dealt within Jackson because --"
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1665.257,1673.504,"If there is a complete demonstration on the record at the time of the plea that the man is guilty, do you say that would not be enough under Jackson?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1673.504,1678.299,"Well, I don't know how you make a complete demonstration on the record at the time of the plea that he is guilty."
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1678.299,1684.445,"Well, isn't that the purpose of -- isn't that the purpose and thrust of Rule 11, the New Federal Rules or the Amended Rule?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1684.445,1689.926,The purpose and thrust is to determine whether he is making his plea voluntarily and not whether he is guilty or --
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1689.926,1696.147,And whether there is a factual basis for the plea? That's the language of the rule isn't it?
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1713.688,1714.23,"Well, if the --"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1714.23,1714.86,In other words --
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1714.86,1732.936,"-- district judge, if the trial judge is doing his task the way it should be done, he will not accept that, he will ask the man to recite what he did and develop on the record the full statement of all the facts that would -- a summary of the facts that would be in the case against him?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1732.936,1745.68,"Alright then adopting the court's line of reasoning, assuming there is some factual basis for the plea, that still does not necessarily rule out that fear of the death penalty would motivate and encourage that guilty plea."
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1751.82,1758.321,Your argument almost carries us to the point that you can't have a guilty plea in these circumstances?
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1758.321,1763.132,"Well, with the death penalty provision in there, I would say that is correct."
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1868.557,1877.853,"Is there anything you didn't have Jackson on the books at all, would you be here at all?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1877.853,1879.502,I don't quite understand the question Your Honor.
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1879.502,1884.829,What if the Jackson decision had never been made?
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1884.829,1896.488,"Well, if Jackson decision had never been made I think eventually if not this case, some other case would have obviously, this case was based upon Jackson because it was cited in the motion."
1969.270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1910.551,1933.908,"Given Jackson Mr. Adang, what if your client had not pleaded guilty but had waived the jury trial and requested to be pleaded not guilty and request a trial before the judge and had been sentence to 50 years in the penitentiary as your client was, would you be here trying to set that aside under reasoning of Jackson?"
1969.270,0,37659,peter_j_adang,,1933.908,1940.355,"I think I would Your Honor, because I think that the third exercise of this right to a jury trial."
1969.270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1955.028,1956.339,Thank you Mr. Adang.
1969.270,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,1961.669,1964.595,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.270,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2450.794,2471.917,"Now, what's you're saying in your argument is leaving out the question for retroactivity that the Jackson decision has now impact upon what the issue is in determining whether the plea of guilty is coerced or not coerced?"
1969.270,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,2471.917,2476.218,That's right Mr. Justice.
1969.270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2630.229,2633.123,Thank you.
