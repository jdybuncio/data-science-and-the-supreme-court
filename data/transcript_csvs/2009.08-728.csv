2009.08-728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.885,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-728, Bloate v. United States."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,5.904,13.058,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,60.054,66.458,"That would allow the prosecutor's time to be excluded, right?"
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,84.835,85.685,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,95.891,100.109,But I'm--
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,100.109,101.878,"--The exclusion -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,101.878,102.411,--Yes.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,102.411,107.513,"The exclusion begins with the filing of the motion, be it the defense motion or the government's motion."
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,110.881,120.821,"But the clock -- the clock would run, on your theory, during the preparation time of the defendant."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,128.908,130.51,"--No, Your Honor, that is not our position."
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,133.545,134.512,Right.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,134.512,135.997,Whether it is a defense motion or a government motion.
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,136.33,136.93,"No, no."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,140.965,142.567,"--Oh, yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,172.753,174.003,Shouldn't we be looking--
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,174.003,180.657,One point that I would like you to clarify.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,212.961,223.769,--It is too late because this Court answered that question -- that very question in Zedner and held that an (h)(7) ends of justice finding cannot be supplied retrospectively on remand.
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,227.804,229.804,But you think it could be found.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,241.076,251.515,Zedner says that as long as it is made -- or the latest it could be made is the time by which the district court rules on the motion to dismiss on speedy trial -- on speedy trial grounds.
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,259.251,264.755,"So the result in your case would be that the case is dismissed, period."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,264.755,266.607,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,276.813,290.988,Is it clear that a period of time attributable to a defense request for time to prepare pretrial motions can fall within (h)(7)?
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,309.7,313.168,"I think that's not an unusual reading of the term ""continuance"", yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,330.78,339.449,"Well, there's -- but the courts of appeals have almost universally read (h)(1)(D), or overwhelmingly read (h)(1)(D) to apply in this situation as well."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,343.901,347.519,"Yes, Your Honor, but this rule wasn't confined to pretrial motions."
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,408.509,429.757,"--Counsel, at the time that (h)(1)(C) -- or (D) was being looked at, wasn't it a fact that some circuits had reviewed the prior exclusion as applying only to the date in which there were actual hearings before the court?"
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,429.757,430.373,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,430.373,440.398,So isn't it -- shouldn't we be looking at what you did with respect to this time period in light of the need that it was addressing?
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,440.398,442.015,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,449.502,474.986,"Well, what's wrong with the logic of district courts who have ruled in this -- in the government's favor, that say Congress was only looking at that particular part of the proceeding -- what related to the hearing, the filing of the motion, its actual adjudication -- but they weren't considering a motion by the defendant for time to investigate, and that can be another proceeding?"
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,486.377,487.377,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,487.76,502.553,"But -- it would seem to me that if a defense attorney comes to a court and says, I need an adjournment, and the Court says, you can have it, isn't that implicitly a proceeding in which the court is saying there is a need for this?"
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,502.553,507.223,"--Not in a speedy trial context, Your Honor, for two reasons."
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,517.262,522.13,"""Proceeding"" doesn't mean an act -- it is an act before the court."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,531.42,537.64,"If that were correct, Your Honor, then preparing your witnesses is a proceeding respecting trial."
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,549.381,549.899,"Well, the Senate did."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,549.899,550.249,--Pardon me.
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,633.883,653.028,"That would certainly encourage judges who don't want to get involved with making findings, which you have to do to satisfy interest of justice, to just say: Motion denied; I'm sorry, I'm not going to let you have the clock run while you -- you are asking me for a favor."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,662.216,663.485,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,693.338,701.158,What must the judge -- the judge must make a finding orally or in writing.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,705.062,708.597,--I think -- I don't believe that precise question has come to the Court.
2009.08-728,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,721.822,743.335,"So the rule that you are arguing for really will accomplish nothing, other than to benefit a small set of defendants who -- who got pretrial preparation time in reliance on court of appeals decisions saying that those could be done without making explicit ends of justice findings on the record?"
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,743.335,744.585,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,763.063,779.758,"Well, how is the public going to benefit if all the judge needs -- presumably, district judges are not granting these extensions of time in situations in which they do not think that the ends of justice are served by granting the extension of time."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,787.345,789.511,"--First, Your Honor, it's not rote."
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.707,839.711,Could you tell me how it works in district courts?
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,855.737,858.006,With respect to pretrial motions specifically?
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,858.006,858.356,Yes.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,858.356,860.374,It varies widely from district to district.
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.146,871.946,And that's -- that's part of -- that there in the local rule of court?
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,871.946,872.765,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,921.012,925.899,But I'm -- I'm not sure that that isn't -- that that argument doesn't cut both ways.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,925.899,928.518,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,928.518,938.04,"I'm not sure if that -- if you have a district where you have five days, a very short period and almost nobody can comply with it, then maybe that's an argument for the government's rule."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,938.04,940.306,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,981.467,990.489,"Well, I think an assumption in your mathematical analysis is that there will be a difference in the time that it takes to dispose of the motion."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,996.293,997.762,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1001.03,1001.53,Right.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1001.53,1004.565,--21 days to respond and call it 21 days to rule--
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1004.565,1004.998,Right.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1004.998,1014.354,"--in a district that allows 21 days of preparation time by default rule, 21 days will burn and then 42 days with response and ruling."
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1014.354,1014.588,Right.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1014.588,1024.11,"In a district that allows only five days, five days burn, and then you have to stop the clock for the additional 16 days of preparation, plus 21, plus 21."
2009.08-728,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1048.356,1052.76,"Where does that show, because the disposition time isn't going to be the same from district to district?"
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1053.493,1054.527,--That's correct.
2009.08-728,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1054.527,1059.581,"Congress could have required, as they have in some instances, to have a judge decide a matter within a certain period of time."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1060.731,1061.897,"That's not correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1118.501,1140.647,"Could a district judge, as part of his normal pretrial order, say that I am inclined to grant normal motions for extensions, but I think so we don't run into these problems that it's in the best interest of justice that whatever time I grant, I issue an order covered by (h)(7)(A)?"
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1150.289,1156.693,"I don't -- that sounds a lot like a prospective waiver of speedy trial, which is -- this court rejected in Zedner."
2009.08-728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1166.882,1168.934,"But presumably, a judge can do it in every case."
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1173.738,1175.905,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1191.097,1191.616,Wait a minute.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1204.857,1205.49,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1216.798,1226.789,"But it's not okay for a district court to say, you tell me how much or you have 21 days to prepare motions and I'm excluding time because of that?"
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1226.789,1227.372,--No.
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1230.574,1235.543,Local rule from a district court judge: Defendant is arraigned; you have 21 days to file motions.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1235.543,1236.726,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1240.161,1243.463,Could you finish answering one earlier question.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1250.636,1251.403,Yes.
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1273.649,1278.636,Could under that retrial provision the court begin excluding time?
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1278.636,1281.838,The speedy trial clock starts anew after a new--
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1281.838,1282.774,That's what I mean.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1282.774,1283.357,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1284.457,1296.432,"Do you have any idea how many convictions would be at risk for reversal under this rule, that would be currently pending and subject to a ruling in your favor now?"
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1296.432,1297.348,I don't know.
2009.08-728,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1314.227,1315.794,In a timely manner.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1315.794,1316.227,--in a timely manner.
2009.08-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1325.082,1343.227,"Is -- is there any indication in the circuits that follow what seems to be the majority rule -- that is that the clock is stopped during preparation time -- that there have been excessive delays, in comparison to the -- what is it, two circuits who go the other way?"
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1343.227,1354.035,"Not that I am aware of, Your Honor, but nor has there been any indication that district courts in the two jurisdiction where they get the rule right in our view deny defense requests for additional time."
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1378.4,1383.371,"Well, what is your systemic concern with the -- with the government's rule?"
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1398.814,1399.447,"Well, that--"
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1399.447,1402.099,Is that's what's driving your concern?
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1402.099,1408.086,"--Well, that would be -- that is the most important function of (h)(7), to screen out the truly unmeritorious delays."
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1410.536,1416.24,But wouldn't judges in many cases do that anyway just in the course of deciding whether to grant a continuance?
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1416.24,1417.359,The court may--
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1417.359,1425.195,Give -- give me the consequences of ruling for the government that you see that are adverse in your view.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1425.195,1434.736,"--The consequence -- ruling for the government would mean that any time a defendant needs any extra time, or -- or we would say either side needs any extra time, the clock stops."
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1456.667,1457.2,But that's my point.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1457.2,1457.833,Yes.
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1457.833,1459.117,I assume the district judge will ask.
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1460.451,1462.334,In the absence--
2009.08-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1462.334,1462.903,--Or do you doubt that?
2009.08-728,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1462.903,1465.303,--I am sure it will vary from court to court.
2009.08-728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1488.686,1489.988,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1495.042,1505.313,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Additional time granted for preparation of pretrial motions is automatically excluded from the Speedy Trial Act deadline for commencing trial."
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1544.438,1548.509,Could I ask a specific date question?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1554.996,1560.484,"Yes, the time from September 7th to October 4th."
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1560.484,1563.686,"Well, that doesn't -- I'm not sure that makes much sense."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1597.34,1614.035,"Well, the delay is just the time that's being used for preparation, which was presumably the time all the way up to the period at which the waiver of the intent to file motions was filed."
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1614.035,1621.039,"Well, but how is that a -- how is the time being spent for preparation a delay, when some of that time was going to be allowed anyway?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1621.039,1622.057,"Well, I think the act--"
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1622.057,1625.426,"In other words, the motions were not due until September 25th."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1632.246,1649.125,"--Well, that's -- that's a result of the fact that the act doesn't exclude the time before a routine deadline for filing the motion, because it only excludes the time -- the delay resulting from an individualized proceeding."
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1671.037,1677.291,What is the -- what is the proceeding from which you count in determining what should be excluded?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1677.291,1684.012,--The time running from the order of the district court granting additional time.
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1684.012,1690.534,"Okay, that order -- that proceeding was initiated and ruled on the same day."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1694.336,1694.836,There were--
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1694.836,1696.688,That proceeding takes a day.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1696.688,1700.99,"--The request -- the request for time, that proceeding was done."
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1709.662,1712.531,The additional time flowing from the order is a proceeding?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1712.531,1718.852,"--The order -- an order is a step in the case, an act of the court--"
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1718.852,1719.485,Right.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1719.485,1720.137,--and it's a proceeding.
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1720.137,1721.154,Right.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1721.154,1722.187,And it's--
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1722.187,1723.172,And that's one day.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1723.172,1729.41,"--Yes, but it's the delay resulting from the order that we are talking about."
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1729.41,1729.91,Ah.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1745.552,1746.085,Yes.
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1746.085,1753.025,"And under your theory that would include the time from the filing of that motion to the end of the determination of mental competency, right?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1753.025,1759.529,"I think courts have excluded from the filing of a motion seeking an examination, yes."
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1764.214,1764.833,Ah.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1780.675,1781.875,--Right.
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1781.875,1794.352,It seems to me redundant if you exclude the delay from the examination and then also exclude mental incompetence.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1794.352,1806.993,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because the delay resulting from the examination would -- would be excluded from the order granting the examination until the examination was complete."
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1811.195,1811.711,All right.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1839.095,1846.249,"I don't -- I think that that's -- that that's a different -- a different deferral, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1884.141,1915.678,"If I disagree with you that, when the time that is extended before a hearing on the pretrial motions and the acceptance of a waiver, which runs from 13 days, September 20, the original date, and the date that it actually took place, which is 13 days, and if I think, contrary to your submission, which is that the whole time from the filing of the extension to the final hearing is delay, even though it was only 13 days that was pushed back, then you lose, right?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1915.678,1918.38,I'm not sure.
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1940.644,1961.057,"Putting aside what Petitioners may or may not have argued, if I think that the delay is only how far the date for consideration of a motion and acting on the motion has been moved -- in this case, from September 20 to October 4; in other words, it's 13 days, not 28 days -- then you lose, right?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1961.057,1963.659,I'm not sure that we lose.
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1972.33,1981.119,"Well, I guess it would be, take 15 days from what time you have calculated, and that's -- that's under the wire -- or is it above the wire?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1981.119,1982.036,--Yeah.
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1983.221,1991.91,"In other words, I am contesting 15 of your days, and you figured out how much days you think can be excluded or not excluded."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1991.91,1993.81,Right.
2009.08-728,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2043.759,2045.711,"What was -- what was the second point you just made, Mr. Roberts?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2056.786,2092.625,"Because the -- on September 25th, Petitioner filed a notice of intent to waive pretrial motions, and then there was a hearing on that on the 4th, and so that filing would be analogous to a motion or a motion that would trigger it's own delay, that it would trigger it's own exclusion of time even if the time starting on September 7th was not excluded."
2009.08-728,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2092.625,2096.827,"Just for my -- just for my information, what's a motion to -- to waive?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2099.279,2123.996,"The -- the court had originally said -- the court had originally provided in its order that on the deadline for filing motions the -- the Petitioner should either file the motions or indicate whether he wanted to waive the motions and then set a hearing on either one, on the 4th, and that's what happened."
2009.08-728,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2136.221,2136.588,I see.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2136.588,2143.458,"And the defendant waived his right to file motions, which had a consequence, you know, in the case."
2009.08-728,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.22,2223.909,"Except for the -- for the language, which -- which says that you -- you time it from the beginning of the time granted."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2223.909,2244.405,"--Well, section -- Section (h)(1), Your Honor, expressly states that it excludes delays, including, but not limited, to the listed delays, so no negative inference arises from the fact that the listed examples don't specifically address delays resulting from the grant of additional motions preparation time."
2009.08-728,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.678,2256.963,"Well, what's the effect of that language then?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2261.331,2289.784,"Because Congress specifically amended it in 1979, in response to previous interpretations by some courts that had excluded only the time that was spent in actual court hearings, and the language makes clear that all the time from the filing of the motion through the hearings, including the -- not just the Court hearing time -- is excluded, and it -- the language continues to -- to make that clear, even if preparation time is also sometimes excluded."
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2289.784,2298.088,"Counsel, do you disagree with your adversary, that there is no statute of limitations problem if we rule against you?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2298.088,2299.04,No.
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2306.21,2307.979,But is it superfluous?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2336.063,2342.2,"--Well, a court should always be doing that in considering whether to grant additional time that's requested, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2349.823,2352.441,But that doesn't answer my point.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2377.89,2379.89,--The -- the judge doesn't have to give him the additional time.
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2390.048,2395.166,So what -- so what additional requirements are we imposing on the judge that the statute itself doesn't command?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2395.166,2396.102,"--Well, what--"
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2396.102,2412.627,"If the judge always has to listen to the reason, weigh it, determine whether or not it is in fact in the interest of justice or not, how much more burden are we putting on a judge than to say, look, you are right, you need a month; I will exclude it under (7)(H)."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2412.627,2421.133,--The judge has to specifically consider all of the specified factors that are in (b)(1) through (4)--
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2421.133,2425.585,We have never required the judge to give a litany of each of the factors under (h)(7).
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2434.255,2449.466,"--Well, the court -- the statute says that the judge shall consider the specific factors, and some courts at least have -- have reversed -- if a -- situations where the court hasn't considered the factors."
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2465.243,2466.912,That's what Zedner seems to suggest.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2466.912,2471.047,--What Zedner says is the findings have to be made before the continuance is granted.
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.908,2489.308,Mr. Roberts--
2009.08-728,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.308,2498.098,And counsel wouldn't know until -- wouldn't know whether the time was excluded or not until -- until a later finding is either made or not made.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2498.098,2498.564,Is recorded.
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.098,2523.915,"--May I ask you, Mr. Roberts, to comment on your opponent's argument that you are creating a rule that if a particular district has a standing order that motions be filed after seven days and then another district has a standing order that it be 21 days, the effect of your rule would be to make the seven-day district an 86-day -- give them 86 days under the Speedy Trial Act?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2523.915,2525.398,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.152,2559.985,That's for response time.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2559.985,2560.818,For response time.
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.818,2565.639,"And that's automatically excluded, so that won't affect the -- well, like you said, it's--"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2565.639,2566.289,It's going to be different.
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.289,2566.839,--Yes.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2566.839,2568.941,So it's the same -- it's the same issue.
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.608,2572.476,But if the difference is specifically authorized by Congress?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2572.476,2583.683,"Well, this is specifically authorized by Congress, too, because section (h)(1) is -- is a general exclusion for delay resulting from proceedings concerning the defendant."
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.276,2614.452,"But doesn't it seem fairly clear that the district which has a 21-day rule, they won't have to -- normally, they won't need extra time in the routine case for an extra motion, whereas the districts with a seven-day rule would pretty automatically need another 10 days or so."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2614.452,2624.908,"I think it depends on the particular case and what motions are in -- or what motions are involved, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2657.962,2663.2,"Counsel, this may be the same question I was asking earlier, but I want to make sure I've got your answer."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2693.802,2714.798,"That's the way the courts have interpreted it, because once the -- once the determination has been made that there should be time to prepare a response, then you know that you're outside of the case where you don't know whether any of this time in the routine deadline is being used for response -- for consideration of motions or preparation of motions."
2009.08-728,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2757.661,2771.135,"And you would argue it wasn't reserved because both sides thought the period was from September 7th until October 4th, and one thought that that whole period should be excluded?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2774.187,2774.837,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2789.513,2790.965,How -- how do you think it should work?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2842.395,2843.081,On the 25th.
2009.08-728,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2843.081,2843.547,Yes.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2847.199,2866.094,"As I was saying before, what -- he did make a filing on the 25th, and the Court took action in response to that filing on the 4th, by holding a hearing at which he waived the motions as he indicated that he was doing on the -- on the 25th."
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2867.196,2875.635,So the delay -- so saying I'm not going to file any pretrial motions results in a delay from a pretrial motion?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2875.635,2890.395,"--Well, in this particular instance, Your Honor, he made a filing and then the Court -- the Court held a hearing in response to that, and actually engaged in a colloquy with the defendant, asked the -- asked the defendant,"
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2898.382,2900.418,Is that a normal course of practice?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2902.62,2906.587,"I don't think it's a general practice, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2913.927,2924.033,--But then the Court's view a decision or statement that no motions are going to be filed as a request for a waiver of that obligation?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2924.033,2929.937,"--Well, it was in fact a waiver notice, a notice of intent to waive, that the defendant filed."
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2930.453,2931.722,Intent to waive.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2931.722,2937.543,"--Well, I mean, it was framed as a waiver, a waiver of pretrial motions."
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2945.279,2946.481,"Well, I didn't see it as a motion."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2948.864,2955.42,"That -- that's true, but the Court didn't -- the Court held the hearing on the 4th."
2009.08-728,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2966.96,2968.126,So it's--
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2968.126,2969.243,--Not at the time it was filed.
2009.08-728,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2969.243,2969.912,--That's what I understand.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2977.897,2979.932,I think that the--
2009.08-728,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2979.932,2981.368,So it comes under (D) or (H).
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2981.868,2986.82,"--It comes under -- it probably comes under (h)(1), Your Honor."
2009.08-728,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2986.82,2988.503,"I mean, I don't mean little (h)(1)."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2997.942,2999.711,"I mean, it could come under (D), Your Honor."
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3026.794,3033.031,Would you repeat that just so I have you: It comes under (h)(1) -- what sub?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3033.031,3044.404,"I think just under -- I would say, Your Honor, just under the general language of (h)(1), because it's not strictly a pretrial motion, but it's the equivalent of a pretrial motion."
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3050.992,3051.459,Did--
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3051.459,3060.698,"Do you have any idea of how many, if we rule against you, until we -- speaking hypothetically, how many convictions would be at risk for--"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3060.698,3068.518,"I couldn't say precisely, Your Honor, but it is the rule that's been followed in eight courts of appeals."
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3068.518,3075.089,--But it's -- it's not everybody who invokes a Speedy Trial Act violation objection.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3075.089,3076.274,No.
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3090.217,3093.252,I would have been -- I would have been interested in knowing the effects of Zedner.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3093.252,3095.152,Yeah.
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3095.152,3099.239,And how -- what kind of burden it placed.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3099.239,3103.024,"I'm sorry, I don't have any precise -- precise information on that."
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3117.967,3122.937,But that's true of all Speedy Trial Act actions by the district court.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3128.089,3129.424,That's right--
2009.08-728,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3129.424,3130.941,--to remind them.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3130.941,3135.512,--And that would be perfectly appropriate if findings under (h)(7) were necessary.
2009.08-728,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3148.903,3150.938,Can I ask you about the language of (h)(1)?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3170.566,3172.268,"No, we -- we agree with that, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3205.239,3207.191,The grant of the motion is the proceeding?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3207.191,3212.143,--That the order granting the additional time of the proceeding--
2009.08-728,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3212.143,3212.862,Is the proceeding.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3212.862,3231.474,"--and if the delay results from that order and the order is ancillary to a listed proceeding, which is the pretrial motions because it facilitates that proceeding, because it provides for adequate preparation, which enabled the motions to be resolved favorably and accurately."
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.474,3234.526,--But what -- what subsection does all this?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3236.478,3238.06,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.06,3242.281,"--Because you agree, as I understand it, it is not covered by (D)."
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3242.281,3243.331,Right.
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3243.331,3245.916,And what subsection does cover it?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3245.916,3251.137,"It's (h)(1), the general provision, which courts have used to exclude numerous--"
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3251.137,3254.505,But it's not governed by any lettered subsection?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3254.505,3254.872,--No.
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3262.326,3263.361,But there is no period--
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3263.361,3263.911,--(h)(1).
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3263.911,3266.313,--no subsection talks about another proceeding?
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3270.365,3275.335,"Well, I think (h)(1) says any period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant."
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.772,3283.356,I see.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3283.356,3284.874,--Then there is a list of examples.
2009.08-728,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3295.999,3302.57,"And you say the order is a proceeding for that purpose, the order granting the extension of time?"
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3302.57,3305.188,"That is the proceedings beforehand, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3342.028,3344.961,But just one quick question.
2009.08-728,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3350.365,3357.371,"It -- there -- there would be an order, so there would be a proceeding."
2009.08-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3374.631,3376.499,That's a tough argument.
2009.08-728,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3376.499,3379.867,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3382.002,3388.906,I would like to quickly address what I hope to be just four points.
2009.08-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3494.057,3499.009,I don't understand -- I don't understand the government to be argue -- to be arguing that they are treated differently.
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3499.009,3502.061,"Well, the government's rule I think is--"
2009.08-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3502.061,3507.881,They are saying whoever -- whoever asked for the extension of time in order to prepare the motion gets it.
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3511.083,3513.249,"--That's not their position in their brief, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3516.135,3516.485,Well--
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3516.485,3518.32,--They don't say anything about government request.
2009.08-728,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3518.32,3523.224,--they made it very clear here that they think it applies to both the defendant and the government.
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3523.224,3535.714,"If that's their position, it's more unmoored from the text of subparagraph (D), because then both types of requests -- so subparagraph -- pardon me -- so (h)(1)'s general standard is expanded even farther--"
2009.08-728,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3535.714,3540.935,"You are right, (D) has a special time limit built into it -- I mean, (h) or whatever the number is now."
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3543.352,3544.054,--Yes.
2009.08-728,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3544.054,3544.837,None of the others do.
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3555.01,3557.362,"Well, I disagree about subparagraph (D) Your Honor."
2009.08-728,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3560.247,3560.997,"No, I know."
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3607.958,3609.142,--But there is no--
2009.08-728,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3609.142,3610.244,At least my interpretation of it.
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3610.244,3615.129,"--There is no difference, Your Honor, between not exceeding 30 days and from and to."
2009.08-728,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3637.411,3643.715,"Counsel, is your friend correct that the issue of the proper calculation is not before us?"
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3650.402,3663.979,"As the question was presented, Your Honor, it was specific to preparation time and the period -- and the period from -- I don't want to get the dates wrong but, September 7th to October 4th."
2009.08-728,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3690.509,3699.984,"I would have thought that whether or not you think that type of delay is excludable depends on what that type of delay is, which requires some sense of how it's going to be calculated."
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3699.984,3701.567,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-728,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3701.567,3703.853,Does six days make a difference to your case?
2009.08-728,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3705.619,3710.107,"I'm not sure, Your Honor, I would have to plead ignorance the same."
2009.08-728,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3710.107,3713.059,"Thank you, counsel, this case is submitted."
