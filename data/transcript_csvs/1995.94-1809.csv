1995.94-1809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.298,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-1809, Matsushita Electric Industrial Company v. Lawrence Epstein."
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,11.359,15.331,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,95.603,98.476,"Subject to due process, though, is that not right?"
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,102.589,114.316,"--Yes, Your Honor, and in addition the Marrese test indicates that full faith and credit must be granted unless there is an express or implied repeal by the after enacted statute."
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,114.316,130.636,"So can you tell me how the due process adequate representation, which I think is the focal point of this case... how did the Delaware judgment satisfy the adequacy of representation essential to due process requirement?"
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,130.636,155.664,"The Delaware Rule 23 procedure, which is precisely the same as the Federal Rule 23 procedure, constituted a full and fair opportunity for the absent class members to contest the process which bound the class, and notice was sent to all class members which contained the outcome of the case."
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,178.66,179.98,I'm still concerned--
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,179.98,180.591,--of the class action.
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,180.591,201.024,"--with the adequacy of the representation, because you said in your brief, I believe, that that was actually litigated and decided, and therefore would have issue preclusive effect, so can you describe... because I don't quite get from the briefs what was the record that was established on the adequacy of the representation."
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,211.613,216.786,"In this case, Your Honor, the objectors appeared and were heard."
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.454,252.109,"So what was the evidence... they made those charges, and then was there any kind of hearing on them?"
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,252.75,255.482,--There was a hearing before the Delaware chancery court.
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,264.196,266.727,But whose burden is it to show adequacy of representation?
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,274.542,281.347,"--In this case, the class in Delaware was represented by 12 class representatives--"
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,281.347,282.737,Were they named?
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,282.737,288.912,"--named class representatives, and they were represented by 20 sets of lawyers."
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,297.219,311.107,"What do you do with the problem that the chancery court judge initially said, I'm not even going to... I'm not going to accept this first settlement because there's nothing in it for the shareholders, there's only something in it for the lawyers?"
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,318.951,346.75,"Your Honor, our position is that if this settlement had been presented to the Federal court, which had dismissed the Federal claims, and the state of the record was the same record which was considered by the Delaware chancery court and the court was looking at the settlement ex ante, and looking at the settlement at the time it was entered into, the same result would have been reached."
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,358.157,368.363,"So you say that any court, looking at the record that was made on the adequacy of representation here, would conclude on that record that the representation was adequate."
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,377.46,389.607,"We believe that it is for the court before whom the case is pending, consistent with Rule 23 procedure, to make a determination concerning the adequacy of representation."
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.607,391.29,Who has the burden under Rule 23?
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,391.29,411.032,"I believe it would be the class representatives, and I believe it important to know that in this case, in which the adequacy of representation was actually litigated, the respondents in this case were not the type of sideline sitters who were referred to by Justice Stevens in his dissent in Martin v. Wilks."
1995.94-1809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,411.032,413.435,There was an appeal to the Delaware supreme court.
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,423.22,423.761,Yes.
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,425.941,426.702,Who appealed?
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,426.702,428.933,--The objectors appealed.
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,428.933,430.355,Who are the objectors?
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,430.355,456.182,"The objectors in this case were a Mr. Krupman and two relatives of Mr. Minton, and significantly, and this goes to the point I made about sideline sitters, significantly the respondents in this case prepared a draft objection which was utilized by the objectors in the Delaware fairness hearing."
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,479.038,493.137,"But the full litigation is still what I don't have a clear picture of, and you told me that there were objections, and then I didn't... I wasn't clear on how the representative met its burden of showing that, despite those objections, its representation was indeed adequate."
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,493.137,493.869,The--
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,493.869,495.258,What was the evidence of that?
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,495.258,505.275,--The representatives presented to the Delaware chancery court a full record of the totality of circumstances that preceded the settlement.
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,505.275,511.79,"Where would I find... if I wanted to look for what evidence the chancery court considered in making that determination, where would I find it?"
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,511.79,520.065,The hearing before the chancery court appears beginning at page 222 of the Joint Appendix.
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.065,522.206,Just tell me everything that's relevant to the adequacy of the representation.
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,522.206,532.214,What is relevant to the adequacy of the representation is that these class members were represented by--
1995.94-1809,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,532.214,536.585,"No, I mean where do I find it, because I don't want to detain you any more, just so I can check on my own."
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,547.793,583.625,"--The full record includes the submissions by the class representatives of all the proceedings in the court, and among the places where these are found are at the Joint Appendix at 269, 270, 271, and those pages reference exhibits that were included in the submissions to the Delaware chancery court which reflected the entire history of the litigation before the Delaware chancery court and the entire history of the litigation in the Federal court."
1995.94-1809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,583.625,596.174,Was it after that record had been assembled and reviewed at the trial level that the trial judge made the remark that there was perhaps a whiff of collusion but that was not proof of it?
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,596.174,598.124,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,598.124,602.829,"So he had seen all of that, and he seemed to put the burden of proof on the other side."
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,602.829,604.539,I believe that--
1995.94-1809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,604.539,606.202,And express a suspicion.
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,606.202,612.995,--I believe that the issue of suspicions abounding was raised.
1995.94-1809,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,617.569,630.337,"Yes, but I guess my point is, he both expressed suspicion and, if I understand his remark correctly, assumed that the burden of proving inadequate representation was on those who objected to it, isn't that... is that correct?"
1995.94-1809,0,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,630.337,642.635,"Your Honor, I believe that what the Delaware chancery court found was that the representatives were adequate, and that the settlement was fair and reasonable, and that the suggestions--"
1995.94-1809,1,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1476.675,1484.612,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1499.091,1512.87,"Mr. Monaghan, the question presented in the petition for certiorari is whether a Federal court can withhold full faith and credit from a State court final judgment approving a class action settlement simply because the settlement included a release of exclusively Federal claims."
1995.94-1809,1,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1534.674,1537.315,"Your Honor, two points."
1995.94-1809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.554,1575.9,"Well, that certainly isn't the question... it's a much narrower question presented by the petition, whether the State court can release Federal claims as well as State claims."
1995.94-1809,1,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1575.9,1580.863,"It can't release those claims, Your Honor, if in doing so it would violate the Due Process Clause."
1995.94-1809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1582.055,1587.198,"Well, that wasn't... the Ninth Circuit... the Ninth Circuit said they couldn't do it simply because State courts didn't have that authority."
1995.94-1809,1,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1587.198,1588.16,The Ninth--
1995.94-1809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1588.16,1591.63,"And so I think, fairly understood, that was the question presented on certiorari."
1995.94-1809,1,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1591.63,1602.669,"--Well, I think... well, all I can say is, Your Honor, that whether or not that's the question that they presented on certiorari, there was countless case law in this Court that we can defend a judgment--"
1995.94-1809,2,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,3122.644,3157.597,"With respect to the Supremacy Clause argument advanced by respondents, we submit that the respondents have made a fatal concession to that argument in footnote 26 of their brief, in which respondents concede that individuals can release Federal claims in a State court proceeding, and a derivative action in a State court can release Federal claims."
1995.94-1809,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3184.257,3212.715,"Mr. Ostrager, your knowledge of Delaware... under your knowledge of Delaware law, if the members purportedly represented here wanted to have this judgment reopened on the basis of the Delaware supreme court's full development in the Prezant case, would it be possible to make an application to reopen this judgment under Delaware law on--"
1995.94-1809,2,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,3212.715,3218.699,"Delaware law has the equivalent of Federal Rule 60, and so there could be such an application made."
1995.94-1809,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3291.1,3297.804,"--Yes, but supposing a State court had litigated the whole case, including the Federal claims over which it had no jurisdiction, and purported to enter a judgment on the Federal claim--"
1995.94-1809,2,17925,barry_r_ostrager,,3297.804,3300.246,--If there had been an adjudication--
