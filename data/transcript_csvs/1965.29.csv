1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.636,"Number 29, United States, Appellant, versus Clarence Ewell and Ronald K. Dennis."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,11.101,13.714,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors."
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,356.791,363.556,Are those -- are those cases limited to the identical issue?
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,363.556,380.625,"Well in Tateo itself, Your Honor, I think some five years had elapsed between the date of conviction and the date when the Section 2255 case was instituted."
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,395.577,399.713,I think I probably didn't -- didn't speak correctly.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,408.321,408.624,Yes.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,408.624,410.435,That they're originally tried for.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,410.435,417.067,"Yes, and I'm going to get separately to the question whether we have a differentiating circumstance in this case --"
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,417.067,417.557,Yes.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,417.557,422.031,– because the reindictment set out three offenses here.
1965.29,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,581.936,584.968,But -- but it would not have to?
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,584.968,588.333,"Unless there were some constitutional requirement, it would not have to."
1965.29,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,588.333,593.492,Yes.
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,593.492,600.052,"Is there any authority to that you know whether that has been done, Mr. Spritzer?"
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,600.052,603.067,We have found no cases one way or the other casting upon on the question.
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,603.067,605.87,You're [Inaudible] -- right to this law.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,609.059,623.619,"Well I can tell, Your Honor something about the practice which the District Court in Indiana where this case comes from has followed in an identical group of cases which followed the Lauer decision."
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,681.953,688.089,Even though he was not charged with a violation of 3704?
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,688.089,689.076,In the original indictment?
1965.29,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,689.076,691.471,Yes.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,691.471,694.193,Certainly I'm sure that was true in some of the cases.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,736.332,739.064,I see.
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,739.064,755.59,"So what you're saying of [Inaudible], you know of no precedent whether in a reported case or in the practice of district courts for allowing credit under a -- in a narcotic act conviction where time already served."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,755.59,761.758,"No, and I know of no opinion which discusses the question of the power of the Court to do what I've suggested."
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,918.485,945.469,"Suppose the Court -- trial court refuse to follow the district attorney and the man was convicted of all three times and he then gave him 10 years under the -- one of the other counts, what would your position be?"
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,945.469,962.841,"I would say, Your Honor, that that problem could only arise if the judge gave a heavier sentence or a sentence which failed to credit and that it is not presented at least until the sentencing stage is reached in a case and --"
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,962.841,964.091,But he is tried for it?
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,964.091,964.632,Pardon?
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,964.632,966.742,"He's tried for it, isn't he?"
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,966.742,967.09,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,967.09,970.728,He should be tried for all three?
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,970.728,986.801,"Yes, and I would say that no constitutional problem could arise in relation to the problem of an increased sentence or would arise unless and until an increased sentence was in fact imposed."
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,987.707,991.951,Let's just take -- let's just take the -- the simple case.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,995.955,996.813,Yes.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,996.813,1003.812,And he is convicted for the identical offense that he was first charged for it --
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1003.812,1006.098,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1006.098,1012.26,And maybe also this count 2 that your -- that you've added on the second indictment --
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1012.26,1013.259,Right.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1013.259,1020.569,"And suppose the judge said, “Well, I'm not going to follow the district attorney in dismissing this count 1."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1038.563,1042.515,If he sat and steam on the other charge but gave full credit for time already served --
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1042.515,1044.037,"No oh no, no, no, no."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1064.379,1080.065,Well I'm -- I'm not sure that I've communicated fully because the additional -- neither of the additional charges which had been made carries a heavier penalty than the charge which was originally made.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1081.53,1092.686,Well it's -- it's heavier in the sense that at least it's arguable that the court cannot mean time off for the time he has already served.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1092.686,1100.865,Well that would be true under the original charge also if that argument were -- were the correct conclusion.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1100.865,1103.343,Well but it wasn't before him on the original charge.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1106.303,1114.159,Well the -- the original charge is again before the judge and two additional charges.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1153.744,1156.22,Alright.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1191.744,1193.611,That is right.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1207.14,1213.028,Well does the district attorney give the judge that flexibility or does the law give it to him?
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1213.028,1226.271,Well I think the law would permit him to credit time as I've indicated even if we brought the charge only under the original charge by bringing the lesser charge as well --
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1226.271,1226.731,Yes.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1226.731,1229.022,-- base upon the same transaction.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1251.352,1279.476,"But as I understand you, you urge upon the Court that even though you have doubts as to validity of any conviction that might be held under count one and three that you ask is to send the case back so that he can be tried under one and three as well as two."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1279.476,1285.826,We have asked the Court to send the case back for trial only on a single count.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1297.027,1305.593,And what authority do you want us to use in saying that he cannot be tried on the other counts.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1306.234,1316.315,"I don't and I don't – whether he can be tried on the other counts is not something Your Honors need to decide because we haven't appealed from the dismissal of the other counts, Your Honor."
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1326.066,1326.62,I see.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1326.62,1335.265,"And in or -- in order to avoid any sentencing problem, we're only asking to go to trial on one count."
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1335.265,1342.217,Have you briefed your point that the judge could give credit for the prior conviction.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1345.758,1348.058,We do discuss it very briefly.
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1376.774,1401.221,Do you know of any other statute in which the same problem would exist under any of federal statute in which the same problem would exist where this is peculiar to the narcotics and that is to say that statute has mandatory minimum coupled with the prohibition of probation?
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1401.221,1412.683,There are very few statutes and I don't immediately call to mind any others which prohibit the suspension of the sentence or probation.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1426.765,1449.519,[Inaudible] discussion as to over these sections that are involved here to the effect that the judge one of the faults of the -- of the statutes are that the judge has no discretion at all and therefore it is too rigid.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1449.519,1451.694,I'm sorry I didn't understand the beginning of Your Honors question.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1453.078,1464.278,"Well, the -- you say that the judge does has some discretion now to -- to grant time off for -- for time served in this situation."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1464.278,1464.628,Yes.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1464.628,1484.774,And I said hasn't there been considerable discussion of the statutes that are involved to the effect that they are -- are too rigid because the judge does not have any discretion of any kind that he must automatically sentence him to the term prescribed by the law.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1484.774,1490.444,"Oh yes, there's been considerable criticism, I think of the statutes."
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1757.604,1772.299,"Mr. Spritzer, I'm concerned about -- about this aspect of the case as I understand it the original indictment was for one offense on the 4705 --"
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1772.299,1773.59,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1773.59,1774.775,Is that right?
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1774.775,1775.779,Quite right.
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1775.779,1781.884,Now the subsequent indictment after the Lauer case was for three offenses.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1781.884,1782.442,Correct.
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1782.442,1786.853,Two of them being under different provisions of the statute.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1826.445,1826.891,Right.
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1826.891,1849.488,"-- but apart from that, these respondents were put on trial for the first time and on the basis of the second indictment and not the first indictment and the second indictment as I understand it was based upon the same transaction as the first indictment."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1873.036,1886.572,"Let me take the prior jeopardy first because I think we -- there, the answer to that is perhaps quickly made."
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1916.34,1917.322,Well perhaps --
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1917.322,1919.743,So I think it is a question of speedy trial and thought --
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1919.743,1934.217,Perhaps you can say that what I'm concerned about is that the reasoning of the holding in Lauer is addressed only to 4705 and I won't burden you with that you go ahead with the speedy trial point?
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1934.217,1954.915,"Yes but going to the first part of Your Honor's question, the reindictments in this case were within two years of the original transactions and we are operating here under a five-year statute of limitations."
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1999.763,2024.221,Well maybe -- maybe there is some prejudice here if it -- if the government have to confine itself to the same count that was in the original indictment I take it from your argument that there would have been some legal problems which you think maybe obligated by the availability of the 4704 count.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2024.221,2024.415,I would not --
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2024.415,2029.421,"In other words, the government entered these two counts for some purpose I suppose --"
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2029.421,2029.788,I think --
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2029.788,2031.45,-- to subsequent indictment.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2031.45,2033.343,"Yes, it did."
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2082.038,2084.318,I don't -- I don't want to take anymore of your time.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2097.97,2098.911,Yes.
1965.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2098.911,2116.01,"Now if you consider 4704 and the other count of the indictment, well it is a question in my mind as to whether the government had a legal -- legally permissible reason for the delay, that's –"
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2116.01,2139.274,I -- I understand Your Honors point and our answer is that the decisions applying the speedy trial concept have said that the Court must look to see whether the proceeding as it has gone forward involves any purposefully damaging or oppressive conduct on the part of the government.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2161.282,2168.788,"Mr. Spritzer, I'm concerned about the same matter that Justice Fortas is, I'd like to ask you this."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2176.219,2177.823,Without a written order form yes.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2177.823,2179.632,"Yes, the original order, that's all he's charged with."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2179.632,2180.424,That's correct.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2180.424,2193.844,"Now incident to that and as a part of that transaction, he could also have been charged with importing without -- without paying the duty, to be charge without registering and --"
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2193.844,2194.973,"And the stamp, yes."
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2194.973,2197.883,"And the stamps and so forth, several things."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2197.883,2198.815,Quite right.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2198.815,2200.744,But now let -- let me ask you this.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2221.867,2224.739,That was I would say in altogether different case because that's --
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2224.739,2226.202,"No -- no, I didn't ask you that."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2231.089,2249.612,I would think that we could not bring repetitive charges based upon the same transaction after he had been acquitted or convicted of one even though we could have charged the multiple transactions under the Blockburger Harris rule at the same time.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2249.612,2250.753,Yes.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2250.753,2271.688,"I'd say this is an altogether different case because the wiping out of the first conviction at the behest of the defendant who brought the collateral attack leaves matters entirely as if no charge, no trial had ever taken place."
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2366.825,2377.903,What case in this Court would most nearly support your -- your argument on this point?
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2377.903,2393.295,I would rely on the line of cases such as Ball and Tateo which indicate that if one invokes a collateral remedy he maybe retried.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2421.0,2431.389,Suppose the man was charged originally with -- with manslaughter and he was convicted and the case was reversed and remanded --
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2431.389,2432.542,He was convicted?
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2432.542,2441.962,"He was convicted, yes, as this – as this man was and it went back and he was then charged with murder."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2446.236,2449.266,I don't know of any of Your Honors' decisions on that question.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2449.266,2451.993,What would be the difference between that case and this?
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2451.993,2461.316,"Well one of the differences Your Honor is that none of the offenses here charged carries a different penalty, a heavier penalty."
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2461.316,2461.428,Well my --
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2461.428,2463.667,And the charge originally made --
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2463.667,2478.868,"It might be that and he would give him 20 years for -- for manslaughter, voluntary manslaughter and -- on a second trial with he is convicted to second through murder he might only give him 15 years."
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2478.868,2480.091,That's perfectly true with the statutes.
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2480.091,2487.902,"But could he be -- could he be tried for it, that's the question not to what the judge might give him but could he be tried for it?"
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2487.902,2488.731,I don't know.
1965.29,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2543.854,2545.196,On the double jeopardy.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2545.196,2545.679,Yes.
1965.29,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2545.679,2546.586,Not in such.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2546.586,2547.049,That's right.
1965.29,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2547.049,2548.382,That's right.
1965.29,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2548.382,2551.964,That's the nearest case I know of one Your Honors --
1965.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2551.964,2555.024,Thank you.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,2556.967,2561.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court."
1965.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2641.831,2643.554,What page is that?
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,2643.554,2643.918,Pardon.
1965.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2643.918,2644.757,What page is that?
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,2644.757,2650.065,"Pardon me, page 25 of the record, Mr. Justice Black."
1965.29,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2674.171,2677.528,Is this a double jeopardy argument?
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,2677.528,2679.858,"Pardon Your Honor, the argument I'm making now?"
1965.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2977.76,2978.138,I beg your pardon.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,2978.138,2979.009,-- Mr. Justice Fortas --
1965.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2979.009,2980.806,"I beg your pardon, sir."
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3025.751,3036.014,"Mr. Justice Fortas, I would distinguish them only in the matter of the prejudice arising under the two counts, under the two counts -- under the 4705(a) and the original count."
1965.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3099.417,3101.112,What -- what is count two?
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3101.112,3110.005,Count two is the stamped package violation 4704(a) which makes it a crime to sell narcotics neither from nor any stamped package.
1965.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3110.005,3110.305,Alright.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3125.596,3127.678,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1965.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3157.181,3161.158,"Mr. Lockton, may I ask you this."
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3189.887,3195.057,"Others -- Mr. Chief Justice Warren, there's absolutely no question that we would not be here on the double jeopardy."
1965.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3195.057,3195.305,Yes.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3195.305,3201.74,"Question in Tateo I think, the defendant who puts doubts on this matter to one side."
1965.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3224.086,3245.197,But you do concede that -- you would concede I suppose that -- that if the case was reversed and sent back for a retrial on the original indictment and the government did not delay it unconsciously that there would be no speedy trial issue involved?
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3245.197,3246.34,On the original indictment?
1965.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3246.34,3249.002,Original indictment.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3249.002,3265.589,"I would say in -- in the general case, yes, but I wouldn't concede that in this case because when a delay results in prejudice, there is a denial of a speedy trial and the prejudice in this particular case would be the inability to credit time under the mandatory sentencing provision."
1965.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3265.589,3273.313,But it wouldn't -- wouldn't that have been in the case no matter how speedily the government had -- had handled the case?
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3273.313,3281.272,"This is true Your Honor, but in this -- if you assume that there is no delay then I will concede that there would be no denial on the right to a speedy trial."
1965.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3282.853,3283.118,Yes.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3305.832,3308.952,I would concede that on -- on the basis of the facts as you post them.
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3312.88,3330.975,"Well I know but I gather this means on the Chief Justice's hypothesis, there had been a second trial brought promptly by the governor even though it was held at this time in a sentence of 20 years the defendant would have no basis to come here, would he?"
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3330.975,3331.627,No.
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3337.418,3339.359,"Now, what was the delay here?"
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3339.359,3357.311,The -- the delay was approximately fifteen and a half months from the date of the offense until the date of the charge on the second indictment in fifteen and a half months from the date of arrest until the date of the second indictment.
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3357.311,3360.062,[Inaudible]
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3360.062,3361.308,"I beg your pardon, Mr. Justice Clark."
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3361.308,3362.857,[Inaudible]
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3362.857,3366.313,December 18th 1962.
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3371.664,3373.051,When was the new indictment?
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3373.051,3375.152,"March 26, 1964."
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3375.152,3376.11,That was two months.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3376.11,3376.48,That's right.
1965.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3390.762,3397.273,And what -- what prejudice by the original count was it?
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3397.273,3406.243,Merely the prejudice under the mandatory sentencing provisions on count -- on first -- on count one under 4705(a).
1965.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3411.539,3414.291,Well that's -- that's what I'm talking about where –
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3414.291,3415.935,"Well, I would rely on the Downum case."
1965.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3426.843,3436.754,"Well, I was only talking about either -- either once in jeopardy or a speedy trial, the only two issues I thought were here."
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3436.754,3440.88,"Oh, we raised the additional issue of the right to be informed and the nature and the cause of the accusation."
1965.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3440.88,3443.859,Yes I -- I recall it.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3443.859,3444.169,Well that --
1965.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3444.169,3446.097,Mr. Lockton --
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3446.097,3446.453,Your Honor --
1965.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3446.453,3513.214,"-- doesn't the Court below with respect to the questions asked a little while ago, then the court below would indicate some discomfort to say the least with the period between July 17, 1963 rehearing was denied by the Court of Appeals in Lauer and the time that the second indictment was returned namely March 26, 1964 and as I recall, the court below points out that the government made no effort to vacate the previous conviction after Lauer came down that the Dennis -- that Lauer, that the respondent here took the initiative and it wasn't entailed March of 1964 that second indictment was returned."
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3516.32,3517.869,"You are correct, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3777.42,3782.119,I expect this has already been [Inaudible] but I just want to be clear about this.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3785.471,3786.536,"Correct, Your Honor."
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3786.536,3792.64,"Now in the posture in which the case comes to us, it's only under the 4704(a) account, isn't it?"
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3792.64,3793.759,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3793.759,3803.626,So he served two years under 4705(a) count but he's -- he's no longer subsequently prosecuted for that.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3803.626,3804.435,That is correct.
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3804.435,3809.806,"In other words for the last one, the 174 account, is now that matters."
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3809.806,3810.922,Because they have not appealed that.
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3810.922,3811.37,That's right.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3822.159,3823.037,That's correct.
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3823.037,3829.144,And this will be on the same evidence I take it with these -- at the trial on the original -- of the original trial.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3829.144,3830.223,The identical.
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3830.223,3833.485,But all he can get now is five years though that's mandatory.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3833.485,3835.215,He could get 20 years and I --
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3835.215,3836.922,Can he get 20 and that's what I don't understand.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3837.948,3849.406,"Because -- because the sentencing provisions provide that before a second offender under 4705(a), the -- this is on the -- the sheet of the counts that the solicitor general gave you."
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3853.504,3854.253,[Inaudible]
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3854.253,3865.599,"It's five to 20 years so there's the possibility that he can get 20 years and there's nothing in the law that will require the judge to give him five to 10 or anything, in the way of credit."
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3865.599,3867.086,No mandatory?
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3867.086,3868.373,It's mandatory.
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3868.373,3869.819,What [Inaudible]
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3869.819,3873.175,It's mandatory in the sense that there has to be at least five years sentence.
1965.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3875.469,3875.822,"Yeah, yeah."
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3875.822,3882.666,"Well let's say again in 10 to four, with the second offense but he hadn't get it, did he not?"
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3882.666,3884.438,That was the minimum here.
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3884.438,3891.388,"So if you thought of the same effect of this time and gave you a minimum that he did before, [Inaudible]"
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3891.388,3893.425,If he did it but he's not required to.
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3893.425,3894.375,I understand that.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3894.375,3899.682,"And to further more, he's pleaded not guilty to this charge and -- and he -- as I point it out --"
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3899.682,3903.762,These are all [Inaudible]
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3903.762,3909.327,We think he has the right to prove his innocence on -- on the second account because he's never been charged with it before.
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3912.57,3916.092,You get a trial of the Court [Inaudible]
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3916.092,3916.802,This is correct.
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3928.764,3932.245,The defendant carried them [Inaudible]
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3932.245,3933.098,On what location?
1965.29,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3933.098,3937.303,What the judge think about this [Inaudible]
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3937.303,3942.881,This was in the Southern District of Indiana at the Indianapolis division.
1965.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3952.309,3961.549,Has the government dismissed the counts on the 4705 and 174?
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3961.549,3963.004,"They have not, Your Honor."
1965.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3963.004,3969.734,Well [Inaudible] saying that they're appealing only from 4704 here.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3969.734,3976.797,This is correct and it seemed they're arguing these two counts but they are not appealing.
1965.29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3976.797,3983.904,The government hasn't dismiss the counts but there are those that were dead now because the action of the District Court is not --
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3983.904,3984.994,Correct.
1965.29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3987.378,3988.989,And the government's failure to appeal.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3988.989,3989.155,"Correct, Your Honor."
1965.29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3989.155,3990.214,That's the end of that.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3990.214,3990.694,That's right.
1965.29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3990.694,3992.709,They're gone.
1965.29,1,21129,david_b_lockton,,3994.577,3999.388,And I don't even cover these counts in my brief.
