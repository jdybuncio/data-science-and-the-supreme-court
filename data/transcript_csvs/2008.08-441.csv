2008.08-441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.07,"We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-441, Gross v. FBL Financial Services."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,7.887,8.72,Thank you.
2008.08-441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,44.379,44.745,Excuse me.
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,64.942,69.994,"--That -- that's true, Your Honor."
2008.08-441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,74.798,75.281,It was dictum.
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,76.181,79.016,"Well, we -- we'd like to think they are right."
2008.08-441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,85.004,95.295,"Well, but -- I just want -- you said that the Court has never imposed a burden-of-proof-shifting requirement absent a directive from Congress?"
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,95.895,96.262,No.
2008.08-441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,97.028,98.43,--Or maybe -- maybe I misheard.
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,98.43,99.897,"--Well, I may have misspoken, Your Honor."
2008.08-441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,104.932,106.051,All right.
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,106.051,109.003,--in the absence of an affirmative directive from Congress.
2008.08-441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,109.003,122.493,"There is some disagreement among the parties, of course, what ""direct evidence"" means, whether it means direct as opposed to circumstantial, or direct in -- in the terms that for example Judge Colloton put it in the decision below."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,122.493,126.714,"Your Honor, there's not a difference between the parties."
2008.08-441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,131.249,137.07,"So you're telling us that we've never required direct evidence, when you're not taking a position on what direct evidence is?"
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,137.07,141.122,--The--
2008.08-441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,141.122,145.776,"I mean, you may be right or you may be wrong."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,147.142,149.793,"--Yes, but the Court hasn't put those two things together in the way you did."
2008.08-441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,169.557,173.759,"Well, in your petition, you asked -- you used the phrase ""direct evidence""."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,176.795,183.134,--We -- it's our view that no particular -- special evidence is required to get the instruction in this case.
2008.08-441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,183.134,192.989,"Is there a variety of views among the circuits on what Justice O'Connor meant by the term ""direct evidence""?"
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,195.708,198.143,"No, it was not, Your Honor."
2008.08-441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,198.143,212.653,"So there is a range of views on what it means, starting from direct versus circumstantial, to something like strong evidence."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,212.653,237.601,"There is a range of views on that, but our view is the -- the burden on the plaintiff is to show by a preponderance of the evidence that in this case age was a motivating factor, but it's not required to show it by any particular kind of evidence or to show it by strong evidence as opposed to merely evidence sufficient to establish that by a preponderance of the evidence."
2008.08-441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,237.601,239.637,Price Waterhouse was a bench trial.
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,239.637,240.487,Yes.
2008.08-441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,240.487,243.339,"And Mount Healthy was a bench trial, wasn't it?"
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,243.339,245.791,"I believe so, yes."
2008.08-441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,245.791,272.941,"Now, would the -- if there is a direct evidence requirement, it may arguably cause a great deal of problem when the trial judge has to give an instruction to the jury, because then the -- the jury will first have to decide whether a particular type of evidence is present in the case before it can tell what -- who has the burden of proof and what the standard is."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,295.538,302.06,"Well, it wouldn't present the same -- there are special problems applying it to jury trials."
2008.08-441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,315.951,341.169,"Well, if it's just an instruction to a judge conducting a bench trial, it could mean that if the -- if the judge sitting as the trier of fact finds that there is direct evidence, strong evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim, then the judge will need to have strong evidence, stronger evidence on the other side in order to rule against the plaintiff."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,349.108,362.432,"Well, it's a particularly serious problem there, but if -- if you were to announce this as a rule, you would -- I think the time has come to explain definitively what ""direct evidence"" means."
2008.08-441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.653,375.14,"In any event, it was the view of only one Justice, Justice O'Connor alone."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,383.43,385.364,"--Your Honor, she made the sixth vote."
2008.08-441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.339,404.826,"Well, would you -- would you urge that we should count Justice White's decision as the controlling decision rather than Justice O'Connor's?"
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,404.826,411.265,--To the extent that you were disposed to resolve this case based on an interpretation of Price Waterhouse.
2008.08-441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,433.845,440.534,"But Desert Palace was a Title VII case, wasn't it, under the 1991 amendment to Title VII?"
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,440.534,441.884,It was.
2008.08-441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,472.32,485.48,"But your -- your position, and you rest heavily on the argument, I think, that there's no textural support in the ADEA for a heightened evidence requirement in order to shift the burden of proof."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,497.721,507.81,"Well, the -- this Court has on a number of occasions allocated the burden of proof among the parties, including to a defendant, without a specific textual basis."
2008.08-441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.403,529.926,"Well, of course, affirmative defenses are usually that the burden of persuasion is on the party asserting the affirmative defense."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,529.926,539.282,"And -- and Justice -- in the case of Price Waterhouse, Justice White characterized this allocation as the burden, as an affirmative defense."
2008.08-441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,548.153,559.445,"I take it the only issue that you have raised before us is whether the evidence that does raise a burden on the defendant's part has got to be, whatever this means, direct or not?"
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,560.478,562.98,That -- that's the only issue before the Court.
2008.08-441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,562.98,572.169,"Am I right that the only source of argument for the proposition that it does have to be direct evidence is Justice O'Connor's opinion, separate opinion?"
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,572.169,576.138,"Well, that has been the primary basis for the argument in the courts below."
2008.08-441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,578.073,582.358,"Well, there are -- there are arguments about the need for substantial evidence."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,587.261,588.445,That's certainly the origin.
2008.08-441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,588.445,590.73,"And are you -- I mean, we're going to hear about this."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,601.355,603.438,"Well, I would be happy -- I would be happy to get into it, Your Honor."
2008.08-441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,603.438,603.838,All right.
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,604.39,617.281,"As -- as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, there are -- there were actually six members of the Court in Price Waterhouse who concurred in the result."
2008.08-441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,637.861,642.682,"As I understand the White opinion, it had nothing to do with the character of the evidence."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,646.917,649.269,"With due respect, no, Your Honor."
2008.08-441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,650.436,652.454,"Then I don't understand what ""substantial"" means."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,654.404,665.845,"--""Substantial factor"" was somewhere on a scale of a very unimportant factor or a very, very important factor, which is separate from how clear the evidence was that it was a small or large factor."
2008.08-441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,665.845,666.963,Okay.
2008.08-441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,666.963,674.717,"In your response to Justice Souter's question, you said you're only focusing on the direct evidence threshold."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,695.983,703.32,"Well, the -- the Price Waterhouse plurality and Justice White didn't see two aspects."
2008.08-441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,720.265,725.919,I understand the difficulty of figuring out who is controlling in -- in Price Waterhouse.
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,746.915,750.034,"--Your Honor, that's precisely the issue on which the lower courts have been divided."
2008.08-441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,761.592,784.957,"But, Mr. Schnapper, there is a difference -- and I think it's critical to your case -- between what's called the prima facie case that a plaintiff would make under the McDonnell Douglas test and proving by a preponderance of the evidence that in this case age discrimination was a motivating factor."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,804.586,805.038,--Yes.
2008.08-441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,816.51,823.166,Can -- can one know if you've met that burden before the case goes to the jury?
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,838.592,844.329,"Well, whether there is sufficient evidence is often tested by a motion for summary judgment."
2008.08-441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,866.177,867.528,"Well, correct me if I am wrong."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,887.692,888.508,That's the -- that's the way it works.
2008.08-441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,900.383,917.377,"Well, in -- in response further to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I think Justice Souter's, too, is there -- are there any tactical difficulties or strategic difficulties that counsel face if they don't quite know which way the burden is going to shift before trial?"
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,924.464,927.316,--No more than would normally be the case.
2008.08-441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,946.012,953.468,"Could -- before you sit down, I -- I have been trying to figure out Justice White's opinion in Price Waterhouse."
2008.08-441,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1019.308,1019.858,All right.
2008.08-441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1071.659,1072.193,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1077.663,1086.269,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think both on a substantive level and a procedural level Desert Palace largely resolves this case."
2008.08-441,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1131.214,1131.814,Can I ask you this?
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1145.474,1151.461,"--I think there's a lot to be said for that argument, and this is a very difficult and unsettled question under Title VII."
2008.08-441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1207.096,1213.1,Couldn't -- couldn't any Title VII case be presented in either framework?
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1213.1,1214.135,Yes.
2008.08-441,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1256.342,1257.109,Why don't you--
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1257.109,1257.544,The third reason--
2008.08-441,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1257.544,1271.285,"--I will let you get your third reason in, in a minute, but why -- do you really think it's fair to pick one part of a complicated test that the court has constructed and say, well, this one doesn't make any sense, and pull it out?"
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1285.195,1289.497,"--I see your point, even though that's exactly what you did in Desert Palace."
2008.08-441,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1312.529,1319.202,"But that was because -- that was because of the 1991 Act, which addressed Title VII and quite deliberately left ADEA out."
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1319.202,1339.179,"Unless you overrule Price Waterhouse, which would be an upheaval in the law, and certainly -- this wouldn't be the appropriate case to do it, all of the courts of appeals have unanimously held under the Age Act and under a wide variety of State statutes and other Federal discrimination statutes that the Price Waterhouse burden-shifting framework applies."
2008.08-441,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1339.179,1345.769,"You are asking us to overrule the aspect of Price Waterhouse involving direct evidence, at least if you look at Justice O'Connor's opinion."
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1345.769,1347.402,"Right, but I don't think you need to decide that question."
2008.08-441,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1405.974,1427.071,"What -- what would be the position of the Solicitor General on just saying let's get rid of all these artificial court constructions and say this is like any other case, the plaintiff has the burden of persuasion, and the defendant can come up with what defenses he has, including that I did this for some other reason -- it wasn't because of age -- and the jury looks at it and decides whom they believe?"
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1427.071,1432.458,You would still have the same issue as you have under the constitutional regime of what is causation?
2008.08-441,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1453.722,1454.722,The statute -- the statute has language.
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1455.905,1456.422,--And it--
2008.08-441,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1456.422,1457.174,Tell the jury that.
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1457.174,1457.874,--Absolutely.
2008.08-441,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1469.648,1473.534,Is there any -- is there any empirical evidence to show whether any of this really makes a difference.
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1484.091,1484.941,--No.
2008.08-441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1522.382,1554.52,"Regardless of what the parties may prefer, isn't it likely that the jury, regardless of instruction, is going to say something like this: If we find that -- that age really was in the boss's mind when he fired the person, and the boss comes in, regardless of the instructions, and says the guy's work was no good, he got late -- he arrived late every day and so on, the jury is going to say: Did they really fire him because he was old or because he didn't come to work on time?"
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1559.991,1562.774,I mean -- there are two kinds of jury findings.
2008.08-441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1608.055,1608.972,You can't know it--
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1608.972,1609.822,--going in.
2008.08-441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1609.822,1618.511,"--but if you said to the jury, do the right thing, they'd probably come out about the same way that they would come out if you gave the burden-shifting instruction, I think."
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1618.511,1630.236,"I think you are basically catching on the point that a lot of counsel in the real world are basically deciding, what do we think the jury is going to be most on our side with, with which instruction?"
2008.08-441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1643.395,1653.684,"But the reason I raise the issue is, if -- if we are saying do we -- do we ditch Price Waterhouse, my questions I guess are suggesting something to the effect, what difference does it make?"
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1653.684,1668.927,"Well, I don't think you can ditch Price Waterhouse as a practical matter, because you're going to create -- I mean -- massive confusion, not only under the Age Act, but under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, a variety of labor statutes, disability statutes--"
2008.08-441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1668.927,1669.713,Juries -- juries are smarter than judges.
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1669.713,1676.8,"--Well, you can do that, but all the problems you think you are solving, you are going to have to face them in Title VII."
2008.08-441,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1682.704,1684.804,Go ahead and make your third point briefly.
2008.08-441,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1684.804,1686.322,"Oh, on why you shouldn't decide it?"
2008.08-441,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1699.563,1700.748,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1704.033,1716.175,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It does seem to me in some ways the Petitioner and Respondent in this case are ships passing in the night because the issues here are unbelievably complicated."
2008.08-441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1786.871,1804.649,"As I understand the court of appeals, it said that Justice O'Connor's opinion was the controlling opinion, it was the decision on the narrowest ground; therefore, the lower courts ought to take that decision as the law made by Price Waterhouse."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1823.527,1826.896,"Well, then -- of course, they go on to say what they think that decision means."
2008.08-441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1853.63,1854.082,Justice O'Connor.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1854.082,1855.099,--Did I say Ginsburg?
2008.08-441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1855.099,1855.732,Yes.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1857.284,1858.351,I'm going to hear about this one.
2008.08-441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1974.474,1974.992,"Mr. Phillips, can I ask you--"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1974.992,1975.342,--I'm sorry.
2008.08-441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.342,1981.313,--Can I ask you your views on a question that I've asked myself over and over again and had trouble finding the answer?
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2005.928,2011.082,"No, I don't believe he would be required to enter judgment for the defendant."
2008.08-441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.082,2015.701,"Because all that would have been proved was that there was one motivating factor there, but not necessarily a decisive one."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2015.701,2023.573,"Right, but I -- it does seem to me that the jury -- it would be fair to ask the jury to decide which of those two considerations probably played the greater role."
2008.08-441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.005,2049.79,But he has only proved that it had been one of two possible motivating factors.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2052.492,2061.532,"I would think that that would be sufficient to get to the jury, because I don't think we have to prove -- I don't think the plaintiff has to prove, you know, obviously, beyond a reasonable doubt or anything."
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2111.881,2112.464,Would you--
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2112.464,2113.564,--we never sought to make this an affirmative defense.
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2113.564,2120.635,--Would you think you should have the burden in the following situation?
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2162.647,2164.064,"I mean, that's the Banner case."
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.064,2164.53,Fine.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2165.432,2165.916,"Yes, absolutely."
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.916,2166.482,All right.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2178.323,2179.858,Played a role.
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.858,2181.208,"To me -- no, didn't say played a role."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2181.208,2181.725,"Yes, it did."
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.208,2186.679,"Well, what it says in this instruction that I have -- I don't see the other one--"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2186.679,2188.179,--It's on page 10 of the joint appendix.
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2188.179,2195.885,"--Well, I have on page 7 of -- of the appellant's brief that the instruction was"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2200.087,2200.605,Right.
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2200.605,2201.855,"--""in defendant's decision""."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2201.855,2202.222,Right.
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2202.639,2204.491,"Now, when I read that, I think--"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2204.491,2207.093,--Can I just -- if you go to the next instruction--
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.093,2207.826,--Yes.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2207.826,2209.059,--it says a --
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.283,2218.333,Fine.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2219.766,2220.566,--as instructed in this particular case.
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.566,2221.102,"Perfect, perfect."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2307.291,2320.266,"Well, I mean -- in the first place, saying that something is a motivating factor or played a role is -- as a sufficient basis on which to impose liability, is flatly inconsistent with what this Court has said numerous time."
2008.08-441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2356.272,2359.843,But Price Waterhouse deviated -- that was--
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2359.843,2360.726,--I'm sorry?
2008.08-441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2360.726,2362.642,--We have these two regimes out there.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2380.521,2396.149,"Well, my basic point on Price Waterhouse is that it seemed to me reasonably clear that a majority of the Court, whether you -- whether you rely upon Justice White or Justice O'Connor -- clearly didn't intend for the jury -- for the burden of proof to shift willy-nilly."
2008.08-441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2401.884,2410.873,"Mr. Schnapper recognized when I asked this question, how does this differ from the prima facie case that you make under McDonnell Douglas and Burdine?"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2424.382,2425.316,--Played -- played a role.
2008.08-441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2438.476,2444.296,"Well, you will get to the jury, and if the jury accepts all your evidence, the jury can find in your favor."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2468.511,2475.315,"Well, there's no question -- I mean, although, again, what a motivating factor means is still to my mind extraordinarily narrow in this--"
2008.08-441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.315,2476.851,"Mr. Phillips, let me just--"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2476.851,2477.617,--or limited in terms of what's required here.
2008.08-441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.617,2479.069,--I'm not quite sure I understand one thing.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2505.45,2506.136,"But, Justice--"
2008.08-441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.136,2506.636,--and he wins.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2506.636,2509.921,"--Clearly he would win under those circumstances, but the problem there is--"
2008.08-441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.921,2512.623,So he does not lose just because you say it's a motivating factor.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2512.623,2516.825,"--No, he doesn't lose, but the question is, what do you do once you make that finding?"
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.849,2557.149,Will you--
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2557.149,2558.718,--an affirmative defense on the other side?
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2558.718,2559.618,--Will you go back?
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2616.321,2617.004,Well--
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2617.004,2619.773,So is the law here -- am I wrong about ordinary tort law?
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2632.266,2633.766,"--I am always reluctant to say that, Justice Breyer."
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2633.766,2634.633,You can say that.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2634.633,2642.372,"I think that, in ordinary tort law, the standard of causation is both a combination of ""but for"" and proximate causation, so--"
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2642.372,2647.793,"And I think ""played a role"" combines at least the necessary condition, but I don't know--"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2647.793,2648.293,"--Well, I don't think--"
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2648.293,2648.676,--if you have to--
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2648.676,2649.059,--that's a fair--
2008.08-441,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2649.059,2653.345,"--""Played a role"" -- how did it play a role if it was not a necessary condition?"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2653.345,2670.289,"--Justice Ginsburg, at least as I read the difference between the plurality opinion in Price Waterhouse and -- and all of the other opinions in that case, Price Waterhouse's plurality said a motivating factor is actually a standard below ""but for"" causation."
2008.08-441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2701.511,2705.63,But that -- that question -- I think it can't be before us.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2748.575,2760.299,"--Well, to be clear about this, I'm not pushing so much the, quote, McDonnell Douglas framework as I am Burdine, Hazen Paper, and the other cases that talk about ""determinative factor""."
2008.08-441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2763.601,2764.734,But your line is following that same formula.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2774.274,2776.242,"--Determinative factor, right."
2008.08-441,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2810.565,2814.451,"The Solicitor General says, well, this is going to affect Title VII."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2816.636,2820.005,"--Well, Justice Kennedy -- clearly not going to affect Title VII."
2008.08-441,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2820.005,2821.621,You -- pardon me?
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2821.621,2823.123,Clearly isn't going to affect Title VII.
2008.08-441,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2823.123,2825.242,Because it's statutory.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2825.242,2835.68,"Right, because there's a specific statute that defines it as a motivating factor, shifts the burden, and creates an entire remedial regime that doesn't exist under the age discrimination statute."
2008.08-441,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2835.68,2844.37,Let's -- let's assume that we have authority to incorporate the Title VII jurisprudence into the ADEA area as a matter of choice.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2849.457,2859.73,"Well, I think the primary one is the 1991 amendment, where Congress clearly changed the language in Title VII."
2008.08-441,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2859.73,2868.086,Are there reasons of administration or fairness other than -- I recognize that one is statutory and the others would -- would be our case law.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2868.086,2870.188,"Well, it seems to me it's beyond that."
2008.08-441,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2892.451,2908.813,"Well, in addition to that, Mr. Phillips, isn't age more closely correlated with legitimate reasons for employment discrimination than race and other factors that are proscribed by Title VII?"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2908.813,2913.28,Both Congress and this Court have recognized precisely that as a problem.
2008.08-441,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2958.078,2961.613,Can I get back to Justice Stevens's hypothetical?
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2970.886,2972.203,"Yes, I believe it could."
2008.08-441,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2972.203,2976.207,"And is it under an instruction that simply says ""because of""?"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2976.207,2982.544,"Yes -- I mean, if you were asking me how I would decide that case, yes, I think it ought to be -- it ought to be ""because of""."
2008.08-441,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2997.37,2998.803,"Well, but I mean -- you say--"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2998.803,2999.572,It has never rejected that as a Court.
2008.08-441,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2999.572,3014.748,"--You say ""but for"" causation, but my understanding of Justice Stevens's hypothetical is that it's going to be very hard to say that one would not have had -- the discrimination, the alleged action, would not have happened but for one factor or the other if they are just two different factors."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3017.784,3019.634,I -- it seems to me juries are asked to make that kind of a decision.
2008.08-441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3022.236,3027.704,"Well, but not only that, but the jury would be free to say, well, there were both causes, and the one was illegal."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3034.794,3036.527,"Right, and I understand that."
2008.08-441,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.789,3120.931,"No, but inevitably in these cases the employer is really -- whether he calls it an affirmative defense or -- or just a regular resistance to the plaintiff's case, the issue is: Did -- would he have fired him anyway?"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3144.796,3146.931,There -- there's no question about that.
2008.08-441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3164.143,3168.345,--But those weren't -- those weren't thought of in the mixed motive framework.
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3213.324,3227.55,"Well, I think you have to go back to the -- to the question that Justice Alito posed actually, to say -- when he asked her: How do you -- how much sense does it make to think about mixed motive versus other motive?"
2008.08-441,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3329.768,3340.741,"And I assume -- and I assume the government, because it would certainly be informative to know what the agency responsible for the administration of Title VII thinks of this question."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3340.741,3344.36,"I -- I don't disagree with that, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3401.697,3402.649,"But we can't get into that, can we?"
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3405.082,3408.553,"Well, there is a question about the adequacy of the jury instruction."
2008.08-441,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3408.553,3414.255,"The adequacy of the jury instruction, but there isn't a question as to whether the issue should have gone to the jury in the first place."
2008.08-441,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3415.29,3415.956,Right.
2008.08-441,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3455.681,3457.533,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-441,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3458.7,3470.108,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We are in agreement with the government that the Court should decide the -- the narrow question presented and not revisit Price Waterhouse."
2008.08-441,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3506.514,3515.387,"Don't those cases involve two independent physical causes of an event, not the breaking down of human motivation into -- into separate factors?"
2008.08-441,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3515.387,3520.023,"Well, it's -- it's -- but it's the analogous area of tort law--"
2008.08-441,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3520.023,3528.379,"What they are trying to say, which is -- which is making me think is a lot about -- we have a human being who did certain acts."
2008.08-441,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3575.194,3582.781,--The -- the problem that comes up with multiple causes is it is hard to reconstruct what would happen.
2008.08-441,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3605.746,3606.429,"Thank you, counsel."
