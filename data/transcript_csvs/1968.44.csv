1968.44,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,22.579,"Number 44, William Skinner et al., petitioner versus Louisiana."
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,24.119,31.652,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors and Associate Justices."
1968.44,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,216.462,217.758,Between the same parties?
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,217.758,218.64,Yes sir.
1968.44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.988,717.016,The evidence was concluded that night?
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,717.016,718.0,Yes sir.
1968.44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,727.627,736.807,But was the defense still free to go forward at more evidence the next morning if they had one or two.
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,736.807,738.031,That's my interpretation.
1968.44,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,829.542,831.973,Is there any finding of fact on that?
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,831.973,837.947,"Sir, the finding of fact by the Supreme Court."
1968.44,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,843.31,845.6,The Court found there was nobody asleep.
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,845.6,847.746,There was nobody definitely asleep.
1968.44,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,859.675,861.496,But you're claiming prejudice --
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,861.496,861.665,"Yes, sir."
1968.44,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,861.665,863.938,Between sleeping is the question.
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,863.938,864.239,Yes sir.
1968.44,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,864.239,865.8,That's an important question to us.
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,865.8,866.169,Yes sir.
1968.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,926.926,929.569,What possible difference could that have made?
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,929.569,930.168,Sir?
1968.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,930.168,936.877,"What possible difference could that have made on the issue of the -- of guilt of the defendants, that is the ownership of the automobile?"
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,936.877,939.813,"It could have because it was a divided jury, 11 to 1 jury."
1968.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,939.813,946.778,"Now, what possible relevance could the ownership of the automobile have had upon the guilt or innocence of the defendants?"
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,946.778,948.301,It could have a lot.
1968.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,948.301,948.701,What?
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,949.813,953.721,Because it would remind them of the question of whether he got anything to do with it.
1968.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,954.662,956.011,"Well, this was a lot."
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,966.187,977.503,I think it does but I submit to my argument because it was circumstantial evidence to compile it and there was a short conflict in another bill as to whether the thing happened at all on the day.
1968.44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,980.254,984.206,Do you say that Mr. Gill was still disadvantaged the next day?
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,984.206,986.221,Yes sir and I say --
1968.44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.221,989.867,That his behavior the next day was not up to par?
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,989.867,992.266,Yes sir and I want to add this one point Mr. Justice.
1968.44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.266,994.568,Because he could have put this witness on the next day.
1968.44,0,25643,george_m_leppert,,994.568,996.014,"Well, that's the day he forgot to do it."
1968.44,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1045.165,1046.557,Mrs. Korns.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1046.557,1047.291,"Yes ,sir."
1968.44,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1095.62,1098.673,"Well, I think you better state your case in --"
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1098.673,1099.518,"Very well, Your Honors."
1968.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1380.167,1386.23,"Mrs. Korns, is there anything in the record to show that Chauvenet waived his right to be at these hearings?"
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1386.23,1386.931,"No, sir."
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1388.737,1395.556,"The only position is that the judge says, you come back and then committed it to jail."
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1395.556,1402.022,Our position is this Mr. Justice that Chauvenet had a lawyer all this time.
1968.44,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1617.838,1618.557,Mrs. Korns --
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1618.557,1618.674,Yes.
1968.44,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1618.674,1621.449,I missed something that you said there.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1625.003,1626.589,Louisiana law.
1968.44,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1626.589,1634.416,"I mean Louisiana law, when one joint defendant files a motion that is considered as if it were filed --"
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1634.416,1637.061,"Not motion Your Honor, bill of exception."
1968.44,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1637.061,1638.217,It applies only for bill of exception.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1638.217,1650.042,Yes but Mr. Link here adopted all the motions of the fail to file of these -- never objected before trial that his client had been in anyway prejudiced.
1968.44,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1758.92,1763.722,Did the Louisiana court say anything about this point?
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1763.722,1771.633,"Yes, they said that they didn't see how Chauvenet had been damaged by this point because this motion was filed."
1968.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1910.236,1913.15,"Just to get it straight, Mr. Gill represented two defendants."
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1913.15,1914.317,"Skinner and Gueldner, yes Your Honor."
1968.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1914.317,1920.502,And Mr. Link represented Chauvenet and no one suggested anything wrong with Mr. Link.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,1920.502,1920.682,Oh!
1968.44,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2013.323,2015.207,Continuance or a recess?
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2015.207,2019.376,"Well, a recess because until the next morning, yes Your Honor."
1968.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.767,2040.985,Is that -- was this very usual trial practice in Louisiana?Mrs.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2040.985,2050.753,"I'll say, let's say that it's not an everyday occurrence but it's not all that unusual specially this Judge Becker likes to keep his docket going and --"
1968.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.753,2052.351,He certainly must.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2052.351,2057.297,"Yes, he does and there have been lots of continuances in this case."
1968.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2074.342,2077.755,Was this all in the front of the jury?
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2077.755,2079.94,"Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1968.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2079.94,2084.733,And it was objected because I remember the last line.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2086.693,2088.429,"Yes, I don't think that --"
1968.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2088.429,2091.27,He said something in the last sentence.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2091.27,2100.927,"He asked, he actually -- I think he did object to the time but I don't think that's been one of the things that they have been complaining about in the Supreme Court of Louisiana here."
1968.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2108.581,2112.276,"Even if you were well, I wouldn't care to try cases at three o' clock in the morning."
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2112.276,2116.682,"Well, the trial judge --"
1968.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2116.682,2118.212,Would you -- would you?
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2118.212,2120.039,"Well, the thing is that -- things --"
1968.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2120.039,2121.591,"Well, would you, would you?"
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2121.591,2123.966,I wouldn't for one night Your Honor.
1968.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2143.966,2147.688,Would you mind if I don't take judicial notice in there.
1968.44,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2151.385,2155.968,"As I recall it, the judge said he knew that Mr. Link had been sick, didn't he?"
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2155.968,2158.527,"That Mr. Gill had been sick, he did."
1968.44,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2268.047,2270.385,But the judge said he knew he was sick.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2270.385,2273.589,"Well, the judge knew he was chronically sick, Your Honor."
1968.44,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2281.652,2286.254,At three o'clock in the morning.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2286.254,2295.548,"If he's functioning alright, I mean, I'm sure Judge Becker would have called a recess if he had seen Mr. Gill faltering but Mr. Gill, he ought to seem in operation."
1968.44,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2339.323,2346.529,"There could have been a great deal of cross-examination of 17 witnesses between 11:30 and quarter to three, could there?"
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2346.529,2351.18,"Let's put it this way Your Honor, the accused did not take the stand before the jury."
1968.44,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2351.18,2352.413,"No, but there's 17 witnesses you said."
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2352.413,2359.366,"They were character witnesses, a lot of them, people to show who was at the lot."
1968.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2385.727,2386.717,Mrs. Korns --
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2386.717,2387.306,Yes sir.
1968.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2387.306,2398.482,Does Louisiana make a distinction on this point between the situation of Chauvenet and the situation of Skinner and Gueldner?
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2398.482,2400.46,You know the words for the counsel --
1968.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2400.46,2402.047,On this late hour business.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2403.135,2421.87,"Yes well, during the oral argument of course -- during the oral argument, I remember an interchange between the Court and counsel that if they should affirm, give or grant a new trial on this point that this couldn't apply to Chauvenet because his attorney was, you know not sick and was -- but --"
1968.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2421.87,2428.496,Do you press that here that even if Skinner and Gueldner were entitled of a new trial on this point that Chauvenet?
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2428.496,2430.766,I haven't raised it but right now I do.
1968.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2430.766,2431.848,I see.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2431.848,2434.445,"I neglected to urge it yes, I did."
1968.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2434.445,2435.549,Mrs. Korns.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2435.549,2436.195,"Yes, sir."
1968.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2436.195,2453.008,"You answered a question earlier about the late trials of New Orleans and I'd like to be more specific, do you -- every once in a while having been run up until three o' clock in the morning."
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2453.008,2453.809,Your Honor.
1968.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2453.809,2455.989,"I mean, take --"
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2455.989,2456.742,This was kind of late.
1968.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2499.806,2504.09,Do you know of any other instance where one is going until three?
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2504.09,2508.835,"I have heard of it around the Court of some going on all night, Your Honor."
1968.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2529.936,2535.035,But the trial goes on for 24 straight hours up to the night.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2535.035,2535.282,Well the --
1968.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2535.282,2540.591,And these lawyers would have to ask for some amendment to cruel and inhuman punishment.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2540.591,2545.566,"Well, Your Honors, you know the trial didn't really start her at three o'clock in the afternoon."
1968.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2545.566,2547.059,"Well, you're picking the jury before that."
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2547.059,2548.791,"They were picking the jury, that's right."
1968.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2550.325,2551.358,That's (Voice Overlap).
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2551.358,2553.116,"Well, that's true, that's true."
1968.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2561.92,2564.052,That what day of the week was this?
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2565.742,2566.413,"No, I don't know."
1968.44,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2598.965,2602.388,"Well what must he have done, collapse in order to --?"
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2602.388,2605.747,No but he could have acted -- he could have acted inadequate.
1968.44,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2608.449,2610.258,Counsel says he was inadequate.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2612.034,2619.207,"Yes, those things they say he forgot to prove were completely immaterial like what call them the marijuana statute in --"
1968.44,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2619.207,2623.941,He might seem so now but it might not seem so in the courtroom.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2623.941,2629.745,"Your Honors, the way you read this record when Chauvenet says the marijuana is in that car."
1968.44,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2636.149,2640.038,Well I can't argue the facts because I don't want to.
1968.44,1,34722,louise_korns,,2640.038,2645.752,See there's no -- there's no -- the state didn't attempt to prove it that the car was Skinner's.
1968.44,2,25643,george_m_leppert,,3209.498,3240.327,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors and in reply to the question as to what the State Supreme Court disposition was of the lack of representation why -- of Chauvenet, I might say that it's covered most succinctly in about 20 lines, the factual background is starting at 391 and the rationale is in about 10 lines on the top of page 392 of column 1 of 204 southern second."
1968.44,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3308.313,3311.682,Was there any evidence offered that was taken under search which is --
1968.44,2,25643,george_m_leppert,,3311.682,3321.034,They -- it was extensive evidence Mr. Justice Black in connection with the motion for a preliminary examination which under our law could have been used at the trial.
1968.44,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3321.034,3326.285,"A set delay you would say, but there was no -- the search did not get it."
1968.44,2,25643,george_m_leppert,,3326.285,3347.208,"No the search that was withdrawn but there was 40 -- between 45 and 50 pages of testimony on the motion for preliminary hearing and motion to -- motion for preliminary examination and bill of particulars, there was extensive evidence on that."
1968.44,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3349.091,3352.216,But none of it was ever offered in trial.
1968.44,2,25643,george_m_leppert,,3352.216,3355.48,No the evidence was offered but I'm saying the motion to suppress --
1968.44,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3355.48,3360.441,None of the testimony that was taken at those hearings was offered to the trial.
1968.44,2,25643,george_m_leppert,,3360.441,3362.494,Except in so far it was repeated.
1968.44,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3414.245,3416.086,Isn't that pretty good philosophy?
1968.44,2,25643,george_m_leppert,,3416.086,3416.277,Yes.
1968.44,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3416.277,3418.557,They went all the Court working justice?
1968.44,2,25643,george_m_leppert,,3418.557,3440.492,"Yes sir but we reply to that that there are limits to it and we stated on page 67 of our brief to the State Supreme Court, a judicial docket which moves along as blindly and inexorably as an assembly line may drop off the volume of oddly shape judicial products and that's what we claim up here."
1968.44,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3440.492,3444.311,"Incidentally, I notice -- I looked at the calendar this was on a Monday."
