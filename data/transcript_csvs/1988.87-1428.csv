1988.87-1428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.028,"We'll hear argument first this morning on No. 87-1428, Patricia Lorance v. AT&T Technologies."
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,12.669,16.292,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,171.233,179.658,"Excuse me, but in Bazemore the violation was not the establishment of the pay structure."
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,191.349,195.19,"Justice Scalia, I don't think it's quite correct."
1988.87-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.521,229.242,"But it was on its face discriminatory, wasn't it?"
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,230.112,230.722,"No, sir."
1988.87-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.722,231.544,--It was not?
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,231.544,250.475,"In fact, the lower court had approved the... well, had said that the pay structure was not discriminatory because, as the lower court said and the Supreme Court credited, the system had been operated in good faith from 1965 through the 1970s when it was challenged."
1988.87-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,253.316,263.765,"I thought the lower court had said it was not discriminatory only because it was a continuation of a prior system and that was okay, even though if you just looked at it objectively at any single moment, it was discriminatory."
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,263.765,266.356,The lower court said both.
1988.87-1428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,277.072,281.697,"So, you don't claim that in '79 when it was set up that it was discriminatory on its face?"
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,281.697,282.716,No.
1988.87-1428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.716,283.317,No.
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,283.317,283.998,It was not.
1988.87-1428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.998,288.141,"When... but it '82 it did become discriminatory on its face, I take it."
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,289.741,290.622,"No, Justice White."
1988.87-1428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.475,312.355,"So your position is, yes, it was intentionally discriminatory in '79?"
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,312.355,314.007,"--Yes, sir, it was."
1988.87-1428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.007,316.088,And how about '82?
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,318.161,320.322,"No, sir, they didn't amend it in 1982."
1988.87-1428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.322,320.833,When did they do it?
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,320.833,325.124,"On the record, the seniority system stayed in effect--"
1988.87-1428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,325.124,325.645,Yes?
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,325.645,336.421,"--as drawn in 1979 through the period pertinent here, and that discriminatory intent established in the system in '79 continued through 1982."
1988.87-1428,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.421,341.236,And... and it's just that... it's just that your clients got hurt by it in '82?
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,341.236,341.834,That's correct.
1988.87-1428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,353.474,354.053,May I ask--
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,358.537,365.35,"Well, in 1979 it was clear that it was the intent of the union to put in a discriminatory system."
1988.87-1428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,398.752,407.718,But in 1979 wasn't it clear that the plan could have that effect?
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,407.718,409.32,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
1988.87-1428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,426.24,439.189,"Mr. Goldstein, could a female tester have filed a suit in your view in, let's say, 1980 before any demotion had occurred?"
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,439.189,440.73,I believe that she could.
1988.87-1428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,440.73,441.982,Would that have been possible to do?
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,441.982,443.311,I believe she could have.
1988.87-1428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,468.97,475.564,"If such a suit were filed, would the proof be essentially the same as the proof in the suit that was actually filed now?"
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,475.564,478.915,There would be a lot of proof that would overlap.
1988.87-1428,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,511.085,513.869,"Well, the problem is how to fit the 300-day limit in."
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,523.064,533.242,"--Well, it can go on so long as the union and the company continue to implement their intentionally discriminatory plan."
1988.87-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.946,588.787,May I ask you a question on that?
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,624.821,626.811,"--Yes, they could."
1988.87-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,631.615,637.858,"But, I mean, the mere fact that there was an intent to discriminate, even though they didn't actually discriminate against anyone--"
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,637.858,638.779,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1988.87-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,638.779,639.55,--it would make the whole plan--
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,639.55,640.251,I misunderstood.
1988.87-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,640.251,649.666,"--I'm just saying the plan worked out absolutely equitably, but somewhere down the line a female had the plan operate against her, as it had against males for the last 20 years."
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,653.869,654.52,Well--
1988.87-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,654.52,657.403,I want to set aside the whole plan now.
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,657.403,659.514,--This is a defensive mistake of fact.
1988.87-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,660.956,661.506,Right.
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,661.506,663.817,"--They tried to put in a plan that discriminated, and they weren't able to because--"
1988.87-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,663.817,664.956,Such as in this case.
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,668.979,673.802,"--Well, under the petitioner's rule, there has to be a discriminatory harm."
1988.87-1428,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,673.802,677.946,"Well, the woman got demoted in this case."
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,679.646,685.191,"If it was pursuant to a plan to intentionally discriminate against women, it would be enough."
1988.87-1428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,687.262,689.874,"Well, doesn't the result have to be discriminatory too?"
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,699.911,700.55,"--I'm sorry, sir."
1988.87-1428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,700.55,702.91,You're here to answer questions as well as to talk.
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,712.107,718.521,"Justice Rehnquist, I think there are two different causes of actions which have to be separated."
1988.87-1428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.99,809.711,Even though the way the thing works is not discriminatory at all?
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,815.026,818.867,"--Well, if there is no discriminatory harm against a woman, she wouldn't have a claim."
1988.87-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.965,844.553,"Mr. Goldstein, this dual violation that there is one when the agreement is executed and another one when the person is fired, this argument was explicitly made and rejected in Machinists."
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,882.16,884.921,"Justice Scalia, two points, if I may."
1988.87-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.819,915.769,"We've said that the two are the same, haven't we?"
1988.87-1428,0,17680,barry_l_goldstein,,925.296,927.288,"As far as I know, you have not."
1988.87-1428,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1073.984,1075.154,"Very well, Mr. Goldstein."
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1076.055,1083.99,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1117.011,1117.542,Mr. Shanor--
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1117.542,1118.614,--rather than first occurrence.
1988.87-1428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1118.614,1124.398,"--when is the first time that a female tester could have brought a suit here, in your view?"
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1124.398,1131.461,"Your Honor, notwithstanding language in this Court's American Tobacco Company opinion that the... quote..."
1988.87-1428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.783,1154.287,"So, there could have been a suit filed right after the adoption of the plan?"
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1154.287,1167.124,"There could have been, Your Honor, but for a variety of reasons we think it would be unwise to adopt the rule that only at that time could a suit be filed because people would not know whether or not they had been injured by that particular system."
1988.87-1428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1176.932,1178.742,"Well, it might alter the remedy."
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1183.196,1184.335,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-1428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.335,1191.14,What about the other people in the unit who take the job thinking that they nave a certain seniority?
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1208.07,1219.518,"Justice Scalia, this Court has never been hesitant to regress discrimination in order to put individuals back into the place that they should have been in but for that discrimination."
1988.87-1428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1223.541,1226.454,--But we're talking about people who could have sued at the outset.
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1242.254,1251.801,"Your Honor, it's fair because the seniority rights of the Petitioners were altered by the Respondents allegedly for discriminatory purposes."
1988.87-1428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.801,1253.471,"And they had a cause of action, as you say."
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1256.143,1259.185,"Correct, Your Honor, they could have sued."
1988.87-1428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.639,1305.026,I don't understand this statement that goes through all the briefs that there is no individual harm if you're being subjected to a seniority system that you don't think gives you the protection that you're entitled to.
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1310.129,1310.968,"Yes, there's--"
1988.87-1428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.968,1313.241,"That's why a lot of women voted against this thing, I think."
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1314.359,1316.192,"--Your Honor, we--"
1988.87-1428,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.192,1317.883,That was... isn't that right?
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1319.803,1322.945,--There is harm to loss of seniority.
1988.87-1428,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.995,1337.056,"Well, that's true--"
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1337.056,1337.505,--competition with someone--
1988.87-1428,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1337.505,1339.628,"--but you, nevertheless, have right then and there lost seniority."
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1339.628,1341.118,"--I would have to agree with that, Your Honor."
1988.87-1428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.118,1342.88,And that is a harm.
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1342.88,1346.624,There is no question but that it is a harm.
1988.87-1428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1358.091,1361.22,"Well, that's like saying you don't care if my life insurance policy is going to be cancelled because I might live forever."
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1364.713,1387.938,"--Well, Your Honor, the argument is not that they weren't harmed, but simply that this statute designed where there is a continuing violation of a seniority system in effect over many years, designed to intentionally harm Petitioners can be challenged at the point of that harm, not merely at the time when the system was put into place."
1988.87-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1387.938,1396.793,--Suppose that a woman was demoted and did nothing and the 300 days passed?
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1401.588,1403.168,"No, Your Honor."
1988.87-1428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1439.293,1446.846,What about language in Machinists Local and Delaware State College?
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1446.846,1457.254,"In Machinists Local, Your Honor, we would have to concede that there is language which, if strictly followed in this case, would cause Petitioners to lose the case."
1988.87-1428,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1458.336,1459.145,And Delaware State College?
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1459.145,1469.153,"In Delaware State College against Ricks, Your Honor, there was absolutely no allegation that the tenure system involved in that case operated intentionally to discriminate."
1988.87-1428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.558,1481.31,"But there was a claim that it discriminatorily harmed him, wasn't it?"
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1481.31,1486.743,"--Yes, there was a claim that there was a discriminatory harm of the particular tenure denial."
1988.87-1428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1486.743,1495.399,"So you say that statute limitations questions should be treated differently if the plan was intentionally discriminatory, as opposed to discriminatory in fact?"
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1495.399,1497.741,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.694,1508.279,It seems to me the issue in Ricks was the same as the issue here.
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1525.83,1539.117,"Your Honor, this case would be... would be the Ricks case if on the day of the adoption of this seniority system this woman had been bumped out of her job and she waited more than 300 days to challenge being bumped out of that job."
1988.87-1428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1539.117,1540.369,He wasn't bumped out of his job.
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1547.205,1561.392,"But the specific and predictable, indeed inevitable event of that single event, tenure denial, was simply a specific effect a year later that he lost his job."
1988.87-1428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.911,1575.762,"Well, was it clear in Ricks that he had to be dismissed a year later?"
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1578.924,1585.139,"The system in effect, the tenure system, said no, after a terminal year you're out."
1988.87-1428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.139,1586.929,Uh-huh.
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1597.684,1602.259,"Your Honor, that's a very difficult question."
1988.87-1428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1617.519,1618.399,Let me put it another way.
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1637.563,1641.385,--We would concede that would be lawful under Section 703(n).
1988.87-1428,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1657.445,1657.886,I understand.
1988.87-1428,1,20163,charles_a_shanor,,1657.886,1659.248,--or a non-sheltered system.
1988.87-1428,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1671.844,1673.296,"Thank you, Mr. Shanor."
1988.87-1428,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1675.167,1683.712,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.331,1928.0,"Mr. Carpenter, what about... what about a female employee of AT&T who was not in the tester unit at the time it was originally set up but later came into it and came into it without seniority because of the system that was adopted originally."
1988.87-1428,2,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1933.776,1943.931,"Well, as a matter of fact, Your honor, some of the most vehement opponents to the adoption of this tester system in 1979 were women who weren't testers."
1988.87-1428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.158,1952.798,And you think they could have sued?
