1978.77-1359,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.055,Case is submitted.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,111.12,117.421,Thank you and Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1359,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,134.232,140.471,"Well, I get it Mr. Barnett that specific indefinite, simply synonymous with choate?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,140.471,155.541,"Well, I use the words Mr. Justice Brennan so as not to rely completely on the technical term developed by this Court, but for functional purposes I think choate is the word for better or worse."
1978.77-1359,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,155.541,159.646,Does this mean that the claim must be reduced to judgment?
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,159.646,184.291,"No, Mr. Justice Powell, we do not take that position, the Crest Finance case, which we distinguish here may clear that when a lien -- when the amount of a lien is evidenced by notes, notes bearing face values, that lien is choate as the government conceded and as the Court held in that case, even though it was not reduced to judgment."
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.978,268.902,"Mr. Barnett, would it be an equally appropriate phrasing of the question to say that this is a case where the government requests that this Court extend the choateness doctrine that is previously applied in tax areas to non-tax activities of the federal government to give it priority there?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,268.902,288.194,"To apply, I would accept your statement Mr. Justice Rehnquist except for the last phrase to apply in those cases, the same rules, the first in time and choateness to give the government priority therefore when it prevails under those rules to give the other party priority when it prevails under those rules."
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.194,293.984,"Well, do you think that Fifth Circuits decision in this case was the violation of the first in time, first in right?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,293.984,294.981,In this case?
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.981,296.574,Yes.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,296.574,311.404,"Not a direct violation, but this Court has made clear in its decisions that the -- there is a violation of this Court's interpretation of the first in time, first in right rule as embodying the choateness approach to determining when a lien arises."
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.404,314.868,But that is previously been applied by this Court only in the tax area.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,314.868,315.66,That is correct.
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,315.66,321.296,"So, you are asking us to extend it in this case from the tax area to the field of commercial lending."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,321.296,322.709,That is correct.
1978.77-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,387.47,389.82,"Mr. Barnett, at what way does that argument cut?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,398.951,405.781,"Well, it takes greater risks but it needs protection that is consonant with those risks."
1978.77-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.124,469.599,"Yes, but it takes security that would not be sufficient to induce a commercial lender to advance the fund."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,474.335,495.182,"That is true and the question here is you are correct to what extent that would justify imposing on the government, this Court imposing on the government when Congress has not done so risks greater than had been imposed on the government in the context of federal tax liens."
1978.77-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,495.182,504.801,"Well, no with the rule I suppose would be that it has to follow the same precautionary procedures that any other lender has to follow, have to search the title and if it is searched here, it would have found there was a perfected lien --"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,504.801,512.811,That is the rule that is contended for here but the rule that has previously been established with respect to interest of the federal government by this Court --
1978.77-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,512.811,519.857,"Yeah but the difference there is I understand it is that the government has no way of protecting itself from the tax case, he doesnt know who is going to fail to pay his taxes."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,527.634,539.028,"Well because Congress has not said so for one thing, the rule was laid down by this Court and the tax lien area has been followed by the Courts of Appeals was unanimously followed by the --"
1978.77-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,539.028,542.566,"But you just told Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you are asking us to extend that rule --"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,542.566,559.717,I'm asking this Court to extend this since this Court has not done so but the Courts of Appeals found no difficulty at all in concluding that the reasons this Court had given for the rule and the tax lien contacts were equally applicable to contractual liens.
1978.77-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,559.717,566.035,"Well, I suggest you they are not equally applicable because in one case the government can check title and in the other case it cant."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,566.035,567.242,That was not one --
1978.77-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,567.242,570.431,It is not a justification for rather different approach to the problem?
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,570.431,570.994,It maybe.
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,576.384,580.059,Doesn't the government expect to lose some money on its SBA loan?
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,580.059,585.961,"Indeed it does, it loses approximately 4% in the latest year."
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,593.57,602.418,Well or whether this Court should confine the rule to the tax area where it now let Congress determine whether it should be extended further?
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,602.418,605.149,"Well, but the question from what basis would Congress start?"
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,622.038,631.836,"Does the government in theory at least so far as the statutes are concerned, expect to collect all its taxes?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,631.836,640.044,"Expect to collect all its taxes, I'm sure as a matter of practical prediction doesn't expect to."
1978.77-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,640.044,643.225,It knows that some tax payers are going to be bankrupt?
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,643.225,644.204,True.
1978.77-1359,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,644.204,646.848,And some are going to evade and never be caught.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,646.848,657.941,Right and despite that this Court by laying down certain rules prior to the Tax Lien Act of 1966 gave the government a certain measure of protection.
1978.77-1359,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,705.651,707.958,Couldn't Congress do the same thing in this area?
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,707.958,722.258,"Well, it could precisely but what the Court below has done and what respondent urges this Court to do is something very different, something that would give much less protection to the federal lien than Congress decided to give to the federal tax liens in the 1966 Act."
1978.77-1359,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,722.258,729.69,"Mr. Barnett, along with what my brother Steve told about, you don't want us -- you say that the SBA loses a lot of money."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,732.364,733.532,"Exactly, not."
1978.77-1359,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,733.532,740.269,"Well, what may be doing that if we tell them, do not use normal choate?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,740.269,741.892,I do not think the court --
1978.77-1359,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,741.892,745.448,"Well, I am checking to see if there is lien outstanding?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,745.448,748.864,I don't think the Court would be telling them not to use normal choate.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.579,772.109,"Well, Mr. Barnett, would not that if they check, it would have required that the other lien be waived."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,772.109,773.468,"It might have, but Kimbell might have --"
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.468,775.208,"(Voice overlap) lender to do, is that?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,775.208,780.558,It might have made that request or demand and is equally possible that Kimbell would have refused.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.558,783.012,"Oh, that's highly unlikely on these facts, don't you think, because --"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,783.012,784.044,No I don't think.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.044,793.693,-- you have the outstanding indebtedness they could have easily said to cancel your outstanding lien and it gets really very unrealistic to assume that they would not have been able to clean it up.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,793.693,797.372,"And then Kimbell would have continued to make loans on the same basis, I don't --"
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.372,806.138,"Or ask for an additional security like any outstanding balance, I think that's highly unrealistic."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,806.138,821.031,"Well, but Kimbell here concededly might have said, if you pay us off we will release our collateral, but Kimbell here was also demanding that it keep its collateral with respect to the future advances."
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.502,823.566,"Is they demanding, they just did not talk about it."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,828.904,835.663,But there is no reason to assume that Kimbell would have agreed to make future advances without keeping some collateral for that.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.663,837.106,Perhaps not.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,852.359,861.139,"But maybe if the borrower okay, we are not assured of be able to purchase future inventory on credit."
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.139,867.767,"So, we are going to turn down that $300,000 because we may need to borrow $5,000 in the future, that is very outstanding."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,867.767,877.89,"Well, I concede that the SBA here could have demanded of Kimbell that it released its collateral."
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,955.572,962.547,But the rule you want Mr. Barnett which you defend certainly gives the government more protection than the Tax Lien Act.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,962.547,963.972,It does and Congress is fully --
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.972,972.192,Importantly more not only in right across the board expect with respect to this future advances.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,972.192,975.661,"That is true, Mr. Justice White and Congress is fully able to --"
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.661,1000.266,"And can I ask you another -- shoot a question, if a private lender had made this same loan that the SBA did in the face of an inventory financings scheme, how would the private lender have come out on these facts under the Uniform Commercial Code."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1000.266,1005.574,"On these facts the private lender would have lost, would have had its liens subordinate --"
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.574,1019.882,"So, it would have under the Uniform Commercial Code, if a perfected inventory arrangement calling for future advances would take precedence over a later perfected mortgage?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1019.882,1022.292,Over an intervening perfected mortgage.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1022.607,1024.026,Later perfected mortgage.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1024.026,1026.644,"Yes, later to the initial agreement prior to the advances."
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.644,1041.996,"Yes and so that the private lender, if he had to lend under these conditions here would have been on notice that there would be future advances and he would take subordinate to that."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1041.996,1050.165,"Would have been on notice that there could be future advances, these were optional but yes, would have taken subordinate to those future advances if they were made."
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.996,1058.606,"Well, if is that a rule in some all the states under state law or is it 49 states or what?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1058.606,1064.34,Well that raises the question of how uniform is the Uniform Commercial Code.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1087.133,1103.216,"But it says they I suppose if the question is, is it of course federal law applies here, the question is from what sources do you draw the federal law I suppose?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1103.216,1104.495,"Well, the proposal of response --"
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.495,1111.649,You are saying just take the Tax Lien law and apply it but you don't want the Tax Lien law because that's now been replaced by statute.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1111.649,1123.901,"No, no, no, we are saying take the common law principles that this Court developed on the basis first of the Insolvency Statute and then of the Tax Lien law."
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.204,1131.845,But calling it common law does not give it any greater or less substance.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1131.845,1132.309,I agree.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.309,1137.556,And so that it's a federal rule that was crafted in this Court.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1137.556,1138.859,"That's true, that's true."
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.859,1146.238,"So, the question is now in the ordinary commercial settings, what source should have be drawn?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1146.238,1147.419,Well that's true.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.139,1157.628,"My comparison with some area that Congress is already discarded, I mean the rule for Tax Liens, Congress has already put aside."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1157.628,1159.865,We don't agree with that characterization of it.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1161.228,1163.177,"What it supposed to, what does the Congress did there?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1163.177,1165.495,Congress has modified it and limited it.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.898,1170.7,"Well, so you now look to the statute not to our cases?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1170.7,1171.876,"No, not in all cases."
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.417,1202.034,"Right, right."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1204.466,1207.033,That's the choice although it's not the choice to Court of Appeals show after all.
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.033,1213.883,"No, I would disagree with apparently both my brother White and you Mr. Barnett."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1219.893,1223.629,"Well, but the law of Texas is the UCC."
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1223.629,1224.127,Right.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1242.728,1261.578,The reason why that is not a good idea we would submit is because state law is varying and the varying reason why this Court decided in Clearfield Trust that the choice of law question here was a federal question in the first place was primarily the need for uniformity.
1978.77-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.49,1270.708,Have the Yazell's case on the other side of the scale.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1270.708,1272.036,Yes.
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.036,1273.32,On household finance does --
1978.77-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.32,1274.542,Household finance.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1274.542,1292.991,"Yeah, but a rule that a rule that simply incorporate into the law at various states with respect to this question which is very much a question of the nationwide operation of a program and which is rather close to questions of commercial paper would undermine the purpose of uniformity."
1978.77-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.991,1296.745,Was the Yazell case and SBA case?
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1296.745,1300.9,"I think it was, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.77-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.113,1331.494,"Mr. Barnett, are you familiar with the position the government took in the argument of Butner case arising out of the second mortgage situation in North Carolina?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1331.494,1331.742,I am not Mr. Justice Stevens.
1978.77-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1331.742,1357.506,"The question is whether in determining whether the second mortgagee has to reduce the property to possession whether they should be governed by a federal rule or by reference to state law and the United States in that case, where it's a creditor, argued that the reference should be to state law, the federal rule should be that we should refer to matter to state law and it's one of those any basic difference between the two kinds of situations in connection with the need for uniformity."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1357.506,1359.348,I'm sorry that I'm not familiar with that case.
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1469.325,1482.136,"Aren't they greater there than in this case because in Crittenden as I understand the Fifth Circuit's opinion we don't know what the Georgia law was, but here I thought that Judge Gee was quite clear as to what the law of Texas was."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1482.136,1491.283,"Well, but even if we knew what the Georgia law was the proposal would might be to adopt the UCC, even if the Georgia law is different."
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1491.283,1497.992,I certainly don't read the Fifth Circuit's opinion in this case is saying that in Kimbell Foods.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1497.992,1504.963,"Well, with respect to when the state lien arises, I read the opinion as saying we will follow UCC principles on that."
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.152,1550.145,"What would be in that respect, if you just follow the law of each state at least you might have some common understanding in the state what the rule was."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1550.145,1557.031,"You would have in the state but you would a complete overturning of the principle of uniformity, which --"
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.031,1558.36,What principle is that?
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1583.979,1589.604,"Well because Congress has not said so for one thing, if that precise approach was a prose to --"
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.604,1591.162,I know that is bootstrapping.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1592.573,1600.539,"No, that precise approach was made to Congress in the drafting of 1966 Tax Lien Act as cited in our brief here."
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1604.344,1604.911,That's taxes.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1609.432,1610.439,"Well, is it or isn't it?"
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1612.99,1615.077,"Of course, it isn't."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1615.077,1619.041,"Well, then we would cite the need for uniformity, which this Court rely."
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.041,1621.238,"What need is that, I don't see understand that need?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1621.238,1634.959,"Well, one need is that a federal agency operating a nationwide program has to have some ability to rely on nationwide standards, it uses --"
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.959,1641.077,"It obeys the speed limits where it's employees in every state, it doesn't want it national speed limit?"
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1641.077,1644.319,"No, it uses similar forms."
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1647.321,1650.847,Household Finance managers in all 50 states.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1650.847,1653.401,It is not the federal government.
1978.77-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.401,1663.215,"But you are saying there is a need, not that the government sovern but that the government needs it because of some peculiar difficulties of operating in all 50 states."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1663.215,1668.194,And also because this Court has recognized that that is a reason for applying federal law in these states.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1668.194,1669.49,"Not yet, not yet."
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1669.49,1669.665,No.
1978.77-1359,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1670.652,1674.194,Not yet in this commercial area.
1978.77-1359,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1674.194,1686.273,"True, but in Clearfield Trust the proposition was that the need for uniformity is the reason for making it a question of federal law in the first place in a commercial area such as this."
1978.77-1359,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1695.339,1696.879,Mr. Teofan.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,1696.879,1700.665,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1359,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1763.601,1774.525,"Are you arguing, Mr. Teofan that if Texas was the only state that had this code and the other 49 states had a different uniform code."
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,1775.69,1783.634,"Yes, based on United States versus Vermont."
1978.77-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1984.335,1987.058,Does the SBA make direct loans or --
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,1987.058,1988.898,Yes.
1978.77-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1988.898,1998.692,"And under what law do you suppose it the lien that arises, when it makes a direct loan?"
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,1998.692,2011.979,"The basic proposition, we have no quarrel with it is that it is federal law governs but when the SBA enters into a field of consensual loans, it should be governed by the same law as all the rest of these cases."
1978.77-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2011.979,2015.573,"Well, let's say in this case, it was a direct loan by the SBA."
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2015.573,2016.378,It should be.
1978.77-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2016.378,2020.44,And let's assume that it had been under what law would the lien arise?
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2020.44,2022.891,It would have arose under Texas law.
1978.77-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2028.281,2031.123,What makes you think so?
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2031.123,2034.153,Because the SBA when they make these kinds of loans --
1978.77-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2034.153,2038.71,"Was it the statute said it should be perfected when the money is paid out, it would be perfected with that."
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2042.361,2052.187,"I think yes, I think and I'm not positive on that, but I think the SBA statute says that the lien shall be recorded and perfected in accordance with state law."
1978.77-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.187,2053.263,It does say that?
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2053.263,2055.775,I think so.
1978.77-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2062.342,2073.973,"I would think that would be a rather important in that if we would argue, if that were true in this case that Congress certainly intended to accommodate the laws of each individual state."
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2073.973,2084.549,"Well, I think that the regulations may direct the SBA offices to file their liens in accordance with state law, perhaps so government can --"
1978.77-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2084.549,2090.893,"Well, that it seems -- sounds to me like a rather substantial matter."
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2090.893,2093.955,I would be happy to look it up and submit something to this Court on that with your --
1978.77-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2093.955,2096.685,"Well, maybe, Mr. Barnett, will have something to say in response."
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2096.685,2097.994,"Yes, but with relation to the --"
1978.77-1359,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2097.994,2102.508,"Perhaps, you can do it while you are having lunch."
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2102.508,2105.831,I will try.
1978.77-1359,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2203.6,2209.193,But that doesn't have retroactive effect in this case?
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2209.193,2209.474,No sir.
1978.77-1359,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2219.26,2223.072,That doesn't get to how a government priority is to be established.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2237.042,2239.144,"No, it does not answer those questions."
1978.77-1359,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2257.957,2275.057,We will resume then at 1 o'clock at this point.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2277.114,2279.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.518,2378.792,State or rather a SBA regulation with this --
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2378.792,2383.826,"Yes, it's the financial assistance manual of the Small Business Administration."
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.977,2388.552,That's not bad.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2388.552,2390.366,Thank you.
1978.77-1359,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2390.366,2394.016,Hope you manage and get it done (Inaudible).
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2394.016,2394.722,Yes.
1978.77-1359,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2394.722,2399.319,Whereas in this case no defensible reason governed by the state law.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2399.319,2401.101,That's exactly our position in this case Your Honor.
1978.77-1359,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2401.101,2403.648,As the last paragraph in the Yazell says?
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2403.648,2404.39,Yes.
1978.77-1359,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2404.39,2408.824,I know how to argued with.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2408.824,2428.896,"In their brief and in the argument, the government here strongly insist that there is a coherent, well-established, well-understood body of president that would establish that the choateness rule should be applied in this case."
1978.77-1359,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2700.786,2706.637,Of course you could say that by lots of groups of decisions in this Court currently in other fields of the law.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2706.637,2707.909,"Say, what Your Honor?"
1978.77-1359,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2707.909,2709.611,That it isn't all that clear.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2709.611,2711.715,"Yes, yes and what?"
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.715,2712.729,(Inaudible)
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2712.729,2723.822,Yeah and what we are trying to do here is to fashion a federal rule that is a little bit clear at least clear and fair than the choateness test.
1978.77-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2723.822,2727.38,"I notice you dint say crafted, but it's the word that you use before."
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,2727.38,2754.779,"Alright, the word is fighting with me Your Honor."
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.284,3167.542,"Do you know what the SBA practice is when they buy a participation in the loan, is there any filing done under the state law then?"
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3167.542,3169.274,Naming the SBA?
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.69,3180.249,Could any lender ever discover that to what he thought was a good lien against the Republic National was now no longer good lien because the government has bought part of it.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3180.249,3182.291,He would have to search the records daily.
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.291,3183.804,"Well, what records?"
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3183.804,3187.664,"In the case of the Uniform Commercial Code, he could search the record --"
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3187.664,3194.316,I know but I just asked you would the SBA do any filing whatsoever when it bought into the republic loan.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3194.316,3195.54,It need not.
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3195.54,3196.747,"Well, does it or doesn't it?"
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3196.747,3197.648,It does.
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3198.951,3199.275,It did.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3203.291,3217.352,When it acquired undivided 90% interest in Republic loan in 1971 on I believe it was January 18th or 28th the later part of January 71.
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.255,3223.427,"Yes, why did it do that?"
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3223.427,3226.174,"Well, the reason you file those kind of things Your Honor is."
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.174,3229.275,"I don't know the reason private people did, and I wonder why that SBA did?"
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3229.275,3239.413,"Well, they may not have trusted Republic National Bank after their initial encounter in this case and didn't want Republic National Bank to be put in a position to either release or prejudice that lien."
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3256.032,3257.522,But it needn't have?
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3257.522,3258.598,It needn't have because it did.
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3258.598,3266.797,"In which event the person making future advances might think that it was perfectly good against Republic, which it were."
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3266.797,3267.018,Yes.
1978.77-1359,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.018,3268.529,They were but not against the United States.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3268.529,3272.806,Right and that's exactly what happened to Kimbell in this case.
1978.77-1359,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3306.739,3308.601,Kimbell is not an insolvent in this case.
1978.77-1359,1,43677,vernon_o_teofan,,3309.27,3312.812,"Okay, Supermarket Your Honor was the debtor, it is not an insolvent."
1978.77-1359,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3323.27,3325.437,"Very well, do you have anything further Mr. Barnett?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3325.437,3327.321,"Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3383.448,3390.814,Are there anything in the SBA Act it says when this precisely when and what a federal lien arises?
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3390.814,3404.728,The only thing in the SBA Act that relates to liens is the section that we have quoted in our brief and discussed which provides that SBA liens are specifically subordinated to state and local liens for property taxes.
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3404.728,3405.279,Yes.
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3405.279,3409.336,Congress specifically did that --
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.336,3417.951,"So what makes you think that it is by virtue of the federal law that a lien arises, I mean by some specific provision of the federal law?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3417.951,3421.861,"Well, a lien does not arise under state law or the UCC."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3435.34,3440.366,What gives that a rank in the priority?
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3440.366,3444.44,"Well, that is the question in this case whether the federal law does and the question in this case --"
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3444.44,3448.372,"Well, there isn't anything in the federal law that just says that is in."
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3448.372,3453.743,"Well, this Court has relied on the first in time rule as federal law for one thing and the --"
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.743,3455.26,There is nothing in the SBA Act?
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3455.26,3464.259,There is nothing in the SBA Act except that specific provision which does subordinate SBA liens but only for a carefully tailored exception.
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.748,3488.202,"If that's also an answer to your argument about uniformity, they don't seem to be put so much store in the uniformity if they instruct all their local people to be awfully careful about the state law?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3488.202,3503.109,"Well, as a matter of convenience and as a matter of allowing other people to rely in the commercial world, they do file, but it doesn't follow that their lien is thereby created under state law and it doesn't follow the state law should govern their priority rights."
1978.77-1359,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3503.109,3505.742,What if they didn't file?
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3505.742,3506.794,That is not this case.
1978.77-1359,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3511.023,3513.09,On a practice so.
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3513.09,3514.758,Yes that is the practice.
1978.77-1359,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3514.758,3520.007,"But what if they didn't trample their practice in the legitimate case, what about the other -- rights of other people?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3520.007,3524.008,We would have or at least would have difficulty defending that situation Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3524.008,3528.865,"Why, the lien is a reason under federal law?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3530.334,3542.199,"Well, I think there are reliance rights that the government would have to respect, and I think it is the government's practice and should be the government's practice to comply --"
1978.77-1359,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3542.199,3548.237,"To look to state law, to look to state, to not to look to non-uniform state law, so that people operating in that commercial market will know where they are."
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3548.237,3563.407,To comply with the local procedures and forms is all not to follow or not to be bound by state law as to government rights and priorities and I see my time is up.
1978.77-1359,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3563.407,3566.631,It would be the time to watch the state laws and follow them.
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3566.631,3568.936,So far as procedures and forms are concerned.
1978.77-1359,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3568.936,3578.306,"In drafting service provisions, counsel should carefully consider the applicable laws of the states, that's what this regulation says."
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3578.306,3588.628,"True, but not that does not imply that state law governs the rights as the earlier part of the regulation says the state law governs the governments rights."
1978.77-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3588.628,3607.461,"Mr. Barnett, the second sentence of that footnote 35 from the Yazell case, which you just read however it is frequently necessary in the (Inaudible) of a market rule title or enforceable security interest and property to follow local procedural requirements and statutes."
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3615.129,3624.952,I don't think it carves anything out except as a matter of the government's discretionary decision to follow the state procedures.
1978.77-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3624.952,3629.359,But it says that's frequently necessary to obtain an enforceable security
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3629.359,3643.067,"Well, this is an abundance of caution in a manual that the SBA is directing towards employees, it is not a statement of applicable law being made in court or elsewhere."
1978.77-1359,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3644.657,3646.762,Thank you gentlemen the case is submitted.
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3712.497,3717.506,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3814.658,3817.816,"Indian Towing arose on the Federal Tort Claims Act, didn't it?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3817.816,3821.711,"Yes, it is cited in our brief in Kimbell."
1978.77-1359,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3916.54,3925.386,"Are tractors like automobiles, passenger automobiles, is there artificial obsolescence."
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3925.386,3928.544,"I don't know Mr. Justice Stewart, I'm not a farm boy."
1978.77-1359,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3928.544,3931.875,That's the reason I asked the question.
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3931.875,3939.631,"Well, the Court of Appeals in Kimbell Foods rejected the choateness rule for determining lien priority."
1978.77-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3965.073,3973.818,"The Fifth Circuit also rejected the principle that federal law would refer to state law in this case, didn't they?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3980.644,4018.724,"Yes, it did, not quite a UCC principle, the court here took a rather hybrid approach, it's started with the UCC but the UCC in this case incorporates state law the Court then looked to see what Georgia law was decided that either Georgia law was unclear or it was unfavorable, the Court then looked back to the UCC decided that it would adopt the UCC provision but without the part of the UCC provision that says unless Georgia law -- unless state law provides otherwise and then finally the Court picked up a piece of the Federal Tax Lien act of 1966 to complete its collage."
1978.77-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4018.724,4026.5,What if this Court were to decide that as a matter of federal law the reference would be the Georgia law in this case.
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4035.79,4054.803,"Well, we take the position that Georgia law is that the District Court was wrong that under Georgia law there is no such super priority here but it's not a position we rely on, it's not a question of state law."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4258.823,4268.366,"Mr. Barnett, I take it you think that the SBA by regulation could subordinate its lien to purchase money mortgages and has?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4268.366,4269.387,It has.
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4269.387,4277.23,And I take it that you think that by regulation it need not -- it could have come out with other result on purchase money mortgages.
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4277.23,4278.996,"Yes, I think it could by regulation."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4278.996,4289.08,And similarly here it could have if it wanted to provide by regulation that their liens would not be subordinate to mechanics liens clause?
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4289.08,4290.777,I think it could by regulation of --
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4290.777,4293.583,And but it has been silent on that.
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4293.583,4300.994,"Yes, it has the specific security agreement here gives that the specific authority to subordinate its lien if it wishes to in this case."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4300.994,4306.045,"Yes, but you think by regulation the SBA could protect itself."
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4306.045,4309.887,"I don't see, well, I don't could protect itself, yes."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4309.887,4314.976,In a situation -- from developing mechanics liens.
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4314.976,4316.376,"Oh, no, no I'm sorry."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4316.376,4331.986,"We will say it, it has an lien; it has a lien on a piece of property that the borrower sends to a mechanic and he does some work on it and he says pay the bill and the owner says I cant pay, so he just holds this."
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4339.084,4356.371,"No, I don't think so I misunderstood, I thought you are asking whether it could subordinate its lien by regulation and in this case it tried to protect itself that provided in the security agreement that the borrower may not encumber the tractor without its permission, I don't think the SBA could do that simply by regulation."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4356.371,4357.807,But Congress could I suppose.
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4357.807,4359.118,Congress could.
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4359.118,4365.508,But you don't think that you don't think under the statute the SBA will have the authority to provide so provide by regulations.
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4370.979,4387.539,"I don't know, I will have to recheck my statement Mr. Justice White, I simply don't know whether would have the authority under regulation to do that or not to protect itself, to enact the rule that we are saying here is a rule of federal common law."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4387.539,4394.652,"Well, you mean that a rule that this Court would enact?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4394.652,4396.166,"Yes, would recognize as federal common law."
1978.77-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4403.101,4423.91,"What if the FHA here at foreclose, or its during the shoes of the tractor owner and the tractor was being held by the repair people pursuant to the mechanics lien and the only claim made was the amount owed for that particular repair by the eighth time."
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4432.151,4447.591,"Yes, yes, as I was saying the first in time rule goes way back in this Court and has been uniformly applied by this Court."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4619.632,4623.557,Unless that happened to be varied by an agency regulation?
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4623.557,4628.796,"Well, again I don't know about an agency regulation but certainly it could be varied by Congress."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4628.796,4637.381,"Well, didn't the SBA regulation on purchase money mortgages vary that?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4637.381,4640.284,It varied by subordinating its claim.
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4697.24,4712.123,"Well, Mr. Barnett, I take it from what you said while ago I just want to check that, you say 13 states would permit the lien or the credited lien or to replevin the property from the mechanics lien holder."
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4712.123,4726.414,"Yes, at least 13 states have statutes that had been held to give priority to the earlier lienor against the subsequent repairmen and I assume that would allow replevin as well as --"
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4726.414,4728.773,Without paying his bill?
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4728.773,4734.577,Yes.
1978.77-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4781.509,4786.855,Don't state Courts also frequently differ in their interpretations of provisions with the UCC?
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4786.855,4808.396,"That is another respect in what the UCC is inconsistent, it is not uniform, it has not been adopted everywhere, it has not been adopted in the Louisiana at all, the provisions of the original UCC the 1962 version have themselves not been adopted everywhere as illustrated by Georgia's failure to adopt the provision in this case."
1978.77-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4885.236,4892.779,You need the transposition of choateness from the tax insolvency field under the commercial loan field in this case to win for you?
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4892.779,4898.233,"No, not in this case because in this case our lien is first in time by any definition."
1978.77-1359,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4902.06,4908.389,"Choateness really isn't an issue here, the lien simply didn't exist choate or un-choate until later?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4908.389,4914.804,"Exactly, whatever choateness means a lien is presumably inchoate when it does not yet exist."
1978.77-1359,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4914.804,4915.252,Right.
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4915.252,4918.091,But what's really being challenged here is the first in time rule?
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4918.091,4920.358,"Yes, exactly, exactly."
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5077.89,5085.299,But how much the Court below say the mechanics lienor had a first lien for?
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,5085.299,5091.466,The Court of Appeals said only for the $500 worth of repairs.
1978.77-1359,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5091.466,5093.54,"That's all you are appealing, that's all you are appealing?"
1978.77-1359,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,5093.54,5095.902,That's all we are appealing in this case.
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5223.926,5227.391,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1359,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5322.615,5330.926,"So the first in time rule was applied by courts long before the term choate was claimed, wasn't it?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5330.926,5342.927,The choateness test was -- my understanding was developed to determine that point in time at what you are competing lien was entitled to compete with the federal lien.
1978.77-1359,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5356.609,5364.92,"But if you go back to 1827 to the case that applied the first in time, first in right rule as the federal rule."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5372.25,5375.485,That's correct.
1978.77-1359,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5383.168,5397.347,"I understand in Georgia if it's been private there would be no problem other than the FHA, I mean if it had been a private loan or private instrument, they would had no problem."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5397.347,5417.655,There would be no problem if we were in a state court but there is a problem in as much as the government contented in the Fifth Circuit that state law is not clear as to whether or not the mechanic would have a priority under split Georgia statute.
1978.77-1359,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5417.655,5419.61,Do you say it is clear?
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5419.61,5433.024,I say it is clear by virtue of the argument which we made in the later portion of our brief and which the District Court Judge applied in this case.
1978.77-1359,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5433.024,5437.917,Do we have to buy that in order to affirm?
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5437.917,5447.902,No this Court can affirm the Fifth Circuit court by adopting the federal common law rule based upon the Uniform Commercial Code that the Fifth Circuit adopted.
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5585.161,5595.017,Does FHA act or statute say that whenever money is advanced the government shall have a lien?
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5595.017,5613.848,"No, the statute itself requires that FHA advances be secured as the secretary deems necessary and appropriate so directs that FHA conduct himself as a commercial lender that they take back security for moneys advance."
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5614.523,5628.394,"Well you know the tax law say that at a certain time in the process of collecting taxes, a lien shall arise and specifically gives the government creates the lien."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5643.979,5656.491,"The reading the regulations is somewhat experience from reading Uniform Commercial Code, you have the concept of a security agreement, which was developed in the --"
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5656.491,5658.669,"So, all this is right in the regulations I think?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5658.669,5661.598,"Yes, sir it goes it's part and parcel."
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5675.779,5691.96,"So what if you found in these set of regulations they provision that, that is strictly in conflict with a the Uniform Commercial Code, the Model Act and b the way its enacted in a particular state."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5696.459,5699.464,Under the government's position --
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5699.464,5715.197,"Well, talking about your position, if say the regulation was flatly contrary to a provision in the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the relevant state, would the regulation govern or not?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5715.197,5717.204,To determine priorities.
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5717.204,5718.94,Yes for example.
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5718.94,5720.909,We contend that it would not that the uniform.
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5720.909,5723.53,Because of what?
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5723.53,5730.922,Because the Court should apply a federal rule such as the one fashioned by the Fifth Circuit as you --
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5730.922,5735.992,You apparently concede that it would be federal law?
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5735.992,5749.595,I don't concede that this Court should apply federal law but apparently the Court has already indicated that the base question is whether or not to consider this as a federal case or a purely state case.
1978.77-1359,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5749.595,5751.95,"Well, aren't there two different questions."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5773.068,5779.374,I think that's exactly what I'm attempting to say is that those are the two questions.
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5788.581,5809.397,"But if it is a federal law then, if it is a federal question and then agency regulation was issued covering the disputed issue precisely wouldn't it take precedence over the state law?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5809.397,5814.415,I suppose if the regulation was not in conflict with the federal rule that was adopted that it would.
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5814.415,5820.374,"And if it working conflict with the statute as well, with the federal statute."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5820.374,5826.506,"Well, in this instance, it would have to be in conflict with the case law because there is no statute."
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5826.506,5852.57,"If we decide in this case that it was the duty of the Court stating federal to apply state law for example that as a matter of federal law whatever the duty was to apply state law then the FHA could hardly come out with regulations since to the effect the state law would be disregarded, could it?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5852.57,5859.165,"Well, I understand it and the way that understood the discussion early, the FHA can issue almost any kind of regulations it wants to."
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5859.165,5867.611,"Quite and defines of what might be decided in this case by this case, that's my question?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5867.611,5868.672,"I'm not sure, whether they --"
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5868.672,5883.919,"Let's say this Court should decide in this case and its predecessor that what is applicable is the body of state substantive law in this area, whatever the state might be of all -- each of the 50s wherever the transaction is made."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5903.18,5909.024,"I don't, I think they could but it would not seem to me that they will be enforceable regulations."
1978.77-1359,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5909.024,5943.316,Why not unless we put our decision on a constitutional basis saying that this is the only way the government can run its business is constitutionally is by following state law but its never -- non of our cases ever suggested that first in time rule and choateness was a constitutionally with it and it just been a sort of a federal common law that Congress is perfectly free to preempt and supercede and similarly I suppose one of its agencies if it was authorized by a statute to do so.
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5943.316,5948.259,"Yes, but isn't the question whether there is any statute giving it any such authority."
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5961.928,5965.683,And also shows inconsistent with whatever the Court says in these two cases.
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5965.683,5977.253,"Well, I don't know I think there is partially relying on it because the FHA has already subordinated some of its liens to some state liens when it didn't have to, hasn't it?"
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5977.253,5977.891,Yes.
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,5977.891,5979.559,Yes.
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5979.559,5991.011,If the first in time rule is applicable it has.
1978.77-1359,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5991.011,6012.64,"But in case, you feel like an innocent bystander, do you agree with the implication contained in my brother Steven's question that the agency would have either employed or expressed authority under the statute to draft the regulations which my brother White has referred to?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6012.64,6034.358,"The way I read the regulations, The Enabling Act, the agency has given the authority to do specific things which is to make farm loans or operating loans and the entitle to draft legislation of regulations to implement that."
1978.77-1359,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6106.116,6108.496,With respect to federal tax claims.
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6108.496,6142.823,"With respect to federal tax claims alone, we contended in our brief that the logical extension of the first in time rule would mean that the government would take superiority over purchase money security interest and its reply brief, the government notes that in analyzing that contention that the purchase money security interest would fail, it relies upon the Tax Lien Act of 1966 and the Uniform Commercial Code and some tax revenue rulings."
1978.77-1359,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6209.754,6230.668,"Aren't there some problems Mr. Hollies with if you apply a federal common law presumably the reason that you are doing it as to achieve some sort of certainty and yet if you resort to the UCC as interpreted by the states, you run into quite a variety of interpretations of some provisions."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6230.668,6260.213,"Well, the policy question from the other side of the coin is are you putting certainly in the commercial business arena, certainly it is it is certain and sure and claim for the government but it is reasonable to anticipate that people would attempt to make an effort to work within the confines of the choate lien doctrine the first in time rules."
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6284.845,6321.043,"Oh, it's quite apart from differing constructions of the UCC by the various state courts you have in this context the UCC itself gives this super seniority to mechanics liens of this type unless the lien is created by state law and unless that state law provides that there should be no super seniority and were told to some 10 to 30 states don't give super seniority, so you wouldn't get anything likes uniformity in this area, wouldn't you under the UCC itself?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6321.043,6323.2,Under the UCC itself you would not.
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6323.2,6326.516,"No, he would get defers to state loan in this respect."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6326.516,6330.023,Under the Fifth Circuit rule you would get uniformity.
1978.77-1359,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6330.023,6335.685,"But you don't know where the Fifth Circuit is going from one case to another under Judge Goldberg's opinion, do you?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6335.685,6345.085,"Well, they will face with the mechanics lien and the priority these are the affected security interest by the government and they decided that one question."
1978.77-1359,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6345.085,6346.784,Then where do we go next?
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6346.784,6347.05,Well.
1978.77-1359,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6347.05,6348.618,John (Inaudible).
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6348.618,6350.325,Alex Chalmers (ph).
1978.77-1359,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6350.325,6359.22,With somebody name Jack Crittenberg is the mechanic.
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6359.22,6369.797,"Where you go, there are traditional exceptions to a first in time rule as the Lehman would know it, who ever gets their first wins."
1978.77-1359,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6424.697,6447.521,"What is the situation with respect if it's possibly relevant and if you know in most of the states as to a lien of a materialman, a painter or anyone else who paints a house which has a mortgage on it in all the states I know about firsthand, which should be 5 or 6 or 7."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6466.083,6475.511,"There is the relationship, the concept of the materialman or the mechanic is the he is one who improves and enhances value of property."
1978.77-1359,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6475.511,6481.131,"He has preserved well if he didn't answered it, he is at least preserving the security, isn't he?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6481.131,6492.651,At least -- at least and as the Fifth Circuit rule fashioned in this case provides protection for one who says that it does not preserve it.
1978.77-1359,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6492.651,6506.644,"Let me put it another way if you know, do you know of any state in which the materialman's lien would be subordinate to the first lien of the real estate mortgage and the circumstances I mentioned."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6506.644,6508.135,There are.
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6771.782,6778.229,Could I make sure did you say earlier you sought the District Court was right on Georgia law?
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6778.229,6781.113,I believe the District Court was correct and with respect to that.
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6781.113,6793.408,"And so you think under Georgia law this lender, if the FHA had been a private lender having perfected its lien the way it was perfected here."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6798.966,6800.101,No.
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6806.722,6810.195,Not only for the last bill but all of them.
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6813.781,6818.255,As I contend that and I contend it in the Fifth Circuit.
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6818.255,6820.041,But is not what the District Court did?
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6820.041,6821.429,And that's what the District Court did.
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6821.429,6824.479,And you think that's consistent with Georgian law?
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6824.479,6830.466,It was the Fifth Circuit noted no case where anybody ever -- property back and then were wouldn't got it again.
1978.77-1359,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6830.466,6835.298,"Well, the District Court expressly found that whether under Georgia law or under a federal law?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6835.298,6837.51,Federal law state.
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6837.51,6841.488,Did the District Court so find with respect to the first six repair jobs?
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6841.488,6842.576,In the entire pay bill.
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6842.576,6847.523,"Entire but you are no longer asking, I mean you are just trying to defend the last $400 as I remember."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6848.626,6851.637,I have not cross petitioned if --
1978.77-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6851.637,6857.144,"So that you do not know I have a claim for the first five repair bills, I understand."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6857.144,6858.836,By virtue of not having cross petition.
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6859.492,6864.513,"That's true, but it is a matter of the rule to be adopted."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6878.94,6890.417,We would adopt that we believe the Fifth Circuit rule where adopted the Uniform Commercial Code with reference to state law is the appropriate rule.
1978.77-1359,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6890.417,6891.504,"Yeah, I know you."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6898.815,6903.287,It did not decide the whole case.
1978.77-1359,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6945.293,6959.86,"You clarify for me if you will, what you say is the status now here in this Court of the District Court finding about Georgia law."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6959.86,6976.774,I believe that the District Court's decision with respect to Georgia law could be the basis for this court upholding its interpretation of Georgia law in granting Crittenden the super priority in this case.
1978.77-1359,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6976.774,6979.152,What the Fifth Circuit do about that?
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6979.152,6982.837,The Fifth Circuit did not need to reach the question of --
1978.77-1359,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6982.837,6994.14,"Should we decide that here when the Fifth Circuit is assuming thought we should reach it, should we decided here and the Fifth Circuit did not reach it?"
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,6994.14,7004.224,I don't believe that this Court should decide it first of all or second that it need to that it can either remand it to the Fifth Circuit or that it can adopt the opinion of the District Court.
1978.77-1359,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7004.224,7015.414,"But I take it to agree with if the Court concluded we needed to decide that, we needed to decide that, we shouldn't decide it here when the Fifth Circuit didn't reach it."
1978.77-1359,3,27220,howell_hollis,,7024.23,7029.371,I don't believe you need to decide that.
1978.77-1359,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7045.609,7046.203,Thank you.
1978.77-1359,4,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,7047.799,7050.662,"Just one single point, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1359,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7121.31,7130.262,It doesn't remove the matter from congressional reach or from agency reach if Congress gave the agency the regulatory authority.
1978.77-1359,4,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,7130.262,7131.448,That is true.
1978.77-1359,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7142.423,7143.141,"Thank you, gentlemen."
