1984.83-832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.362,"Mr. Nicholas, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,45.362,48.747,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-832,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.439,257.901,"Would there be any justification on that latter point for taking the position that as soon as the time expired so that the Paulsens could withdraw the funds from the saving account that it would become taxable, as opposed to when they actually withdraw?"
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,257.901,258.301,Yes.
1984.83-832,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,329.914,333.568,"Was that a decision of a single judge, or was it reviewed by the court?"
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,333.568,335.001,"--It was the decision of a single judge, Your Honor."
1984.83-832,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.597,415.62,We'll resume there at 1:00.
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,421.024,425.328,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-832,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,992.262,992.862,Mr. Nicholas.
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,992.862,993.479,Yes.
1984.83-832,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,993.479,1001.785,"Do you draw any distinction at all between the certificates of deposit, on the one hand, and the passbook savings account on the other?"
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1001.785,1003.151,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1984.83-832,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1011.406,1017.21,"If you prevail here, how is the gain taxed?"
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1017.21,1025.916,"When the share account holder withdraws the money from the association... in other words, takes out his investment... the he must pay the tax."
1984.83-832,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1025.916,1029.535,"As a practical matter, how is that enforceable?"
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1029.535,1050.781,"Well, I think that particularly in these types of mergers, Your Honor, usually these accounts are segregated, and of course, since it is a reorganization, the organizations must file the necessary information with the Commissioner under the regulations under Section 368 that would tell that there has been a reorganization."
1984.83-832,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1050.781,1062.32,"But it certainly is unusual to... when money cash is drawn out of say a passbook savings account, to have gain realized thereby."
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1070.176,1073.394,"I don't believe that that really is an administrative problem, Your Honor."
1984.83-832,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1092.538,1093.373,"Well, there is some... there is some difference."
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1123.142,1138.819,"--I think, Your Honor, as a practical matter certainly the mergers that we have been involved with when the decision has been made to withdraw the accounts by the parties involved, the tax has always been paid, and in particularly in these types of situations where these accounts are segregated and marked as exchange accounts."
1984.83-832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.371,1147.006,"Well, it says between the bank, though, and the... and the account holder it is."
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1150.291,1156.779,"--Well, remember that in these reorganizations, Justice White, first those accounts could not be withdrawn for one year."
1984.83-832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.779,1157.214,Yes.
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1157.214,1160.249,And so they were segregated in that manner so that--
1984.83-832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.249,1162.166,But after that he can draw it out any time he wants.
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1162.166,1162.633,--That is correct.
1984.83-832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.367,1165.45,"You would know how much gain there is, wouldn't you?"
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1165.45,1166.319,--Yes.
1984.83-832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.319,1166.985,And in advance.
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1171.037,1175.839,I think the basis would be allocated over the full amount in each portion of--
1984.83-832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.839,1176.941,So for every $100 there would be X dollars.
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1176.941,1178.041,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.041,1186.063,And if he draws out $100 and then he deposits $200--
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1186.063,1186.697,"Well, I think--"
1984.83-832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.697,1191.599,"--And then... and it becomes an active account, how would you ever know?"
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1191.599,1202.822,"--I think from a practical standpoint, Your Honor, that if he wanted to put any additional money into a passbook savings account, he would have to open a new account so that this could be kept segregated."
1984.83-832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.822,1206.008,Would that be a Treasury regulation or what?
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1206.008,1214.797,"Oh, I think... I'm sure the Commissioner has the authority to issue regulations that would cover this situation, and there would be no loss to the FISC."
1984.83-832,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1214.797,1218.016,"Well, suppose it doesn't?"
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1223.736,1234.293,"Well, I don't think there is basis in cash, Your Honor, and... and I think that what a passbook account holder has is an interest in that savings and loan association."
1984.83-832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1254.791,1259.326,When does he give up... at what stage does he give up those rights?
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1262.547,1278.222,"Well, his rights go down as he withdraws your $100... the rights that he has are to participate in the earnings of the... of the association, so that if he has $100, his rights are less than if he has $1,000."
1984.83-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1289.28,1297.97,"Do you think those additional rights... say he has a $100,000 account... do you think those additional rights make that account worth more than $100,000?"
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1297.97,1298.786,"Oh, yes, they do."
1984.83-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.044,1315.162,"Well, could he sell the account to a third party for more than $100,000?"
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1315.162,1316.597,"--Probably not, Your Honor."
1984.83-832,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.597,1318.633,"If it had market value, I don't know why not."
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1318.633,1339.63,"Well, I think that perhaps in certain circumstances that does exist, and there is a much litigated case, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board v. Elliot which involved a Long Peach savings and loan association, and when it was going to liquidate and there was a substantial surplus, there was a sudden influx of large depositors."
1984.83-832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1546.615,1563.643,"When you say that the Ninth Circuit was mistaken in determining that the right to share residual value... residual proceeds had no value, do you rely on some sort of evidence or somewhere that that type of thing does have a market value?"
1984.83-832,0,45725,william_r_nicholas,,1563.643,1566.409,"Well, it has a value, Your Honor."
1984.83-832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1795.157,1807.798,Mr. Lauber.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1807.798,1811.667,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2018.368,2039.381,"Well, Mr. Lauber, had the taxpayer obtained stock in a... or obtained the interest obtained in this case on a merger with another mutual, assuming the ownership had been in a mutual to begin with, there would have been a tax-free reorganization apparently?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2039.381,2039.867,That's right.
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2053.108,2056.077,And if there'd been a mutual into a stock type savings and loan--
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2056.077,2057.027,"There again, typically the mutual--"
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2057.027,2059.129,--it would be a tax-free reorganization?
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2059.129,2060.481,"--We agree with that as well, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2060.481,2062.581,Or a stock type into a stock type.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2062.581,2064.116,"That would also be tax free, or it could be done tax free."
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2064.116,2069.92,So it's just this one instance where it's a stock type into a mutual--
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2069.92,2070.403,Right.
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2070.403,2072.372,--that IRS takes a contrary view.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2074.339,2082.644,"Well, the reason is it's only in this stock into mutual regime where you have shareholders cashing out an equity investment."
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2096.337,2113.514,"Well, is our proper inquiry, since it meets technically the statutory requirements for a tax-free reorganization, is our inquiry in... should it be directed to whether it's a continued proprietary interest?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2115.366,2130.291,"That's one of our two submissions; that there is no continuing proprietary interest because the value of the proprietary interest obtained is very close to zero, and that is not a substantial interest within the meaning of Minnesota Tea and this Court's other cases."
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2130.291,2145.651,"Well, does this mean that in the future you would be urging that we would apply a similar analysis to all hybrid instruments... for instance, preferred stock received on a reorganization?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2145.651,2148.72,"Well, preferred stock has always been treated by the Commissioner as stock."
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2149.489,2152.074,"Well, but you can make the same kind of an argument."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2167.333,2175.689,"--I don't think that's true, Justice O'Connor, because this interest here on its face is not stock; it's a savings account."
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2208.66,2220.985,"Mr. Lauber, isn't the Government's position as simple as this: that there can never be a tax-free measure of a stock S&L into a mutual S&L?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2220.985,2222.268,That is our position.
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2222.837,2227.139,Do you think Congress intended that in the Reorganization Act?
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2227.139,2230.074,"--I think, Justice Powell, that Congress never really spoke to that."
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2255.122,2262.978,"You're not assuming that one who wishes to merge always can find precisely the partner that would be desirable, most desirable?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2270.501,2271.434,"Well, that's right."
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2271.434,2272.884,Let me ask another question.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2272.884,2275.17,"Well, may I finish answering your first one?"
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2275.17,2275.586,"Yes, sure."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2275.586,2283.376,The other alternative Commerce had was to have Citizens convert from a federal mutual association into a federal stock association.
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2284.509,2287.077,Or they couldn't have merged at all.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2287.077,2287.71,--Right.
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2386.909,2392.963,"Well, doesn't that assume the answer to say what they got back was a garden variety savings account?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2399.617,2400.3,"--Well, let's analyze that--"
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2400.3,2406.271,It carries characteristics that may make it equivalent to a proprietary interest.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2412.775,2416.661,"--Well, let me address it more directly then, because that is the key question in the case."
1984.83-832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2480.419,2493.06,"Well, what do you say in response to your opponent's contention that the Elliot case and some others have recognized the fact that there is a residual value that the owners have?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2493.06,2504.95,"Well, some... it's possible that some merger deals might be constructed where you might be able to kick out a little bit of bonus money to the mutual shareholders, but that was not done here."
1984.83-832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2513.89,2519.627,But in those other cases I take it that the residual value may not have appeared until liquidation.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2526.216,2544.177,"Well, it's possible, although this Court in Society for Savings v. Bowers characterized that residual interest in the liquidation as being so remote a contingency as to reduce to the vanishing point on the theory that the solvent liquidation of an S&L is very unlikely."
1984.83-832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2544.177,2545.961,"But that's a question of fact, isn't it?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2554.633,2564.675,"Well, I could point out that the Federal Home Bank... Home Loan Bank Board, which must approve liquidation, has never approved liquidation of a solvent federal savings and loan."
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2577.482,2578.148,Mr. Lauber.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2589.806,2591.492,It is contrary to all those courts.
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2591.492,2597.329,"And is it your suggestion that all, what is it, five of those failed to exercise common sense and good judgment?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2598.029,2600.864,I think they were just... they were just bamboozled by the form of the thing and--
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2600.864,2601.948,Bamboozled by whom?
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2601.948,2604.483,--They never looked to the substance of it.
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2606.002,2607.452,Wait just a minute.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2659.452,2661.588,"--Well, we didn't just come along now."
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2699.963,2706.117,"Well, Mr. Lauber, had the Commissioner taken a contrary position prior to 1969?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2706.117,2706.55,--I don't think--
1984.83-832,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2706.55,2716.156,It was my understanding that the Commissioner treated it differently and thought it was a proprietary interest to have an account in a mutual before that time.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2720.025,2728.614,"--Well, as I understand it, the Commissioner had not taken any public ruling position on the question before 1969."
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2851.095,2860.618,"May I ask you a question about... you mentioned that the value of the stock before the merger, the stock in Commerce, was set up on the balance sheet as a retained... equivalent to the retained earnings."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2863.752,2865.437,"I don't believe they are, because the case--"
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2865.437,2868.723,"Do you know what, for example, their fixed assets were?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2868.723,2876.043,"--I don't think that's in the record, because the case is stipulated on the tax court, and there's a very brief set of stipulated facts."
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.043,2885.399,"I gather it's your position that the stock, in effect, represented sort of the net worth of the company, the excess of assets over liabilities."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2885.399,2886.535,"In Commerce, that's right."
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2886.535,2904.479,"And why wouldn't it be possible that after the merger you would have a new company that had some kind of big... a couple of buildings and maybe owned some real estate and one thing and another, in which there would be fixed assets in which the various depositors would have a prorata share just as if they owned stock?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2908.364,2911.4,"It would probably be peanuts really, because when you think about it, the--"
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2911.4,2915.62,"Well, I've been in some pretty big savings and loan company buildings that are pretty fancy-looking buildings."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2915.62,2918.906,"--But the bulk of their assets are mortgage loans, not, you know, bricks and mortar and typewriters."
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2919.356,2923.124,But the net worth sometimes is partially represented by their fixed assets.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2923.124,2925.31,--That... there could be... could be some.
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2954.162,2961.333,"Yes, but also, I suppose if they struck oil just after the merger in the new company, that passbook would give you an interest in the oil well, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2961.333,2969.839,"I suppose if they struck oil right after the... after the merger, and they were then to liquidate the company, the shareholders--"
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.839,2971.205,Which might be advisable under circumstances.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2971.205,2974.909,--might get... might find... might get some... something beyond their savings account.
1984.83-832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2974.909,2977.176,"Well, sometimes a bond is issued at a discount."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2989.502,3009.147,"Well, if we assume that these people negotiated the merger at arm's length and that the savings accounts... or an arm's length rate of interest, as they must have done, the right to withdraw $12 from a federally-insured savings and loan... this is a federally-insured deposit we're talking about... must be equal, more or less, to $12."
1984.83-832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3017.67,3027.877,"But that... that's a very abstract, hypothetical type of argument you're making; that because... and, you know, you can certainly argue that, but we're not a fact-finding tribunal."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3037.499,3051.74,"Well, the court of appeals... I guess it wasn't really a finding of fact; it was a characterization... said that the proprietary interest had no value; and they relied on a number of... of reasons for that."
1984.83-832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3107.309,3110.028,"Well, what if this outfit were to merge into some other outfit?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3110.028,3113.563,If Citizens were to merge into another organization?
1984.83-832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3113.563,3114.499,Yeah.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3114.499,3117.951,"Well, it would depend on how that merger were... were constructed."
1984.83-832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3126.223,3127.54,What if it were mutual to stock?
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3127.54,3143.582,"--If it was a mutual to stock, the way those deals are done in practice, as I understand it, is that the mutual account holder will get back another account in the same dollar amount from the new enterprise."
1984.83-832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3164.848,3174.621,"Of course, your... your opponent disagrees with you, and I wonder if these aren't arguments that should be made to a fact-finding tribunal to a tribunal that simply decides questions of law."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3174.621,3186.011,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, I think all these arguments are simply directed to show that the interest these people got beyond the interest of account holders as proprietors was not substantial."
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3216.915,3221.268,"On that substantiality question, may I just interrupt because I'm trying to think this thing through."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3246.917,3252.99,"--But the thing is the petitioners would never get anything beyond the... what was, in effect, a passbook rate of interest."
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.823,3288.477,"If it were a stock-for-stock transaction, could he sell the stock separately without selling his account after a merger?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3295.732,3304.671,"--I don't think... no, as I understand it, there usually isn't any linkage between stock ownership and depositor status in a stock S&L."
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3384.437,3385.154,Mr. Lauber?
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3385.154,3385.954,Yes.
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3385.954,3388.339,May I ask you one more question?
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3417.391,3419.86,"It would not, Justice Powell, because in that event it would--"
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3419.86,3424.764,"So it... it's immaterial how long they... they had the right to vote, for example."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3424.764,3425.214,--Right.
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3426.247,3429.499,"You would... you would concede that's normally an equity interest, wouldn't you?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3429.499,3432.685,"--No, we would not say a long-term bond is equity."
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3432.685,3434.803,If it had the right to vote?
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3434.803,3436.572,"No, that would not be equity either."
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3439.005,3441.874,It's a proprietary right.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3444.076,3448.879,"--Well, the right to vote is normally... is something stockholders normally have, so that people who--"
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3448.879,3449.262,Yes.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3459.501,3461.934,"--Well, the fact that you have a right to vote doesn't mean you have stock."
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3466.738,3467.055,What's the difference?
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3469.738,3475.409,"Well, what you need to have an equity interest is more than a right to vote in an organization."
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3482.481,3486.367,"If you had a common stock ownership, what would you have other than the right to vote?"
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3491.936,3492.87,--That's right.
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3506.611,3522.555,Suppose you had a capitalization for the very small issue of prior preferred stock outstanding with a very substantial common equity underneath it so your preferred stock let's say matured in five years with a right to vote.
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3525.122,3525.807,--Could you give that to me again?
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3526.657,3540.351,"Preferred stock, prior preferred stock that... that had to be surrendered in ten years or could be redeemed within five or ten years, but a right to vote accompanied it."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3541.701,3542.217,--That would--
1984.83-832,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3542.217,3543.569,--Would that be a proprietary interest?
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3543.569,3546.255,--The Commissioner has probably ruled on that kind.
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3565.566,3567.001,May I ask one other factual question?
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3593.485,3595.168,I don't think the record reflects that.
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3600.072,3615.165,"Because if it... if... if it were, then it would be... that would be a difference between the character of the ownership before the merger and the character afterward... the character of the ownership interest and the equity in that institution."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3616.799,3621.653,I don't think it reflects whether the shares were freely transferrable before the merger.
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3621.653,3627.307,"Because if they're not, they're kind... they're really not much different from... from mutual ownership."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3627.307,3634.562,"Well, I mean if... if it were the case they had to simply withdraw their money from the account in order to sell their stock, that wouldn't be a terribly onerous burden really."
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3638.03,3642.882,"No, but it would... would prevent the stock from having an independent value from the accounts."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3651.238,3654.54,No.
1984.83-832,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3669.3,3672.502,"Well, you say the record doesn't tell us."
1984.83-832,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,3672.502,3676.12,I don't... I don't believe it does.
1984.83-832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3676.12,3680.922,"You have one minute remaining, Mr. Nicholas, if you have anything further."
1984.83-832,2,45725,william_r_nicholas,,3680.922,3681.774,Thank you.
1984.83-832,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3724.535,3731.874,"Mr. Nicholas, is there anything in the record to respond... enable you to respond to Justice Stevens' last question?"
1984.83-832,2,45725,william_r_nicholas,,3731.874,3734.306,"I do not believe there is anything in the record, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-832,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3739.443,3740.277,They could be sold separately.
1984.83-832,2,45725,william_r_nicholas,,3740.277,3741.145,Yes.
1984.83-832,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3741.145,3743.764,But you didn't bring that out in the record.
1984.83-832,2,45725,william_r_nicholas,,3749.149,3750.749,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1984.83-832,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3750.749,3751.482,"Thank you, counsel."
