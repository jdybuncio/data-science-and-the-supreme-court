2011.10-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.42,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-694, Judulang v. Holder."
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,7.454,9.522,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-694,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,58.803,66.958,"How do you explain -- I mean, I think that is a principal point, whether Blake and Brieva changed the law."
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,91.141,93.257,"--Two responses to that, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-694,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,192.007,192.69,Mr.--
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,192.69,194.157,"--And in fact -- yes, Justice Kagan?"
2011.10-694,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,194.157,195.391,--Please finish.
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,195.391,208.382,"If I may, I was just going to say that a number of these cases, crime of violence cases, reached the merits in both the BIA and the courts of appeals without the government even suggesting that there was a statutory counterpart problem."
2011.10-694,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,216.305,219.007,You cite some cases.
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,271.973,276.026,"Obviously, Justice Kagan, we don't think that is the proper way to understand Blake."
2011.10-694,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.534,314.986,"Well, reliance on confused law is certainly not reasonable reliance."
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,326.626,330.678,"I don't accept the premise at all, Justice Scalia, that the law was confused."
2011.10-694,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.678,331.447,"Well, that's a different point."
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,331.447,361.549,"But even if -- even if there was some lack of clarity in the law, and we don't think there was, I think the record in this -- before the Court is very clear, that people were advised by competent counsel and that the government itself took the same position in front of the immigration courts and the courts of appeals that someone with a crime of violence aggravated felony conviction could seek relief because that conviction would make him or her excludable and the availability of relief in deportation proceedings is meant to be the same as it would be in exclusion proceedings."
2011.10-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,361.549,366.52,"I understand the advice of counsel, but what is the reasonable expectation of that's been altered?"
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,366.52,379.761,"The reasonable expectation that once someone pleads guilty, Mr. Chief Justice, to an excludable offense, one that would be waivable in exclusion proceedings, that a waiver may be sought in subsequent deportation proceedings on exactly the same basis."
2011.10-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,382.113,393.938,"So you're saying that the expectation is when he pleads guilty to a violent felony, that he expects, well, if I am deported because of that I am going to be able to seek discretionary waiver?"
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,393.938,396.54,"Yes, that's quite correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,413.349,414.601,How often are these waivers granted?
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,414.601,416.534,"Quite frequently, I think."
2011.10-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,456.611,473.99,"But in terms of the expectation interest, we have to visualize someone who is facing a serious charge and is entering a plea bargain, where presumably the consideration of what he's pleading to, how much of a sentence he's going to get, all that, are dominant considerations."
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,485.88,487.38,"On the contrary, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,511.796,512.146,"No, no."
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,529.24,530.742,"I -- I understand, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-694,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.548,545.686,"And the violent felony -- the violent felony in this case, he had a suspended sentence, didn't he?"
2011.10-694,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,545.686,550.321,"--He was sentenced to -- to time served essentially for this conviction, that's right."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1429.006,1431.239,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1482.907,1483.24,That's true.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1633.538,1640.542,"Well, I agree that the history and the law here is relatively complicated and it has had a lot of moving pieces over the years."
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1661.805,1668.625,"Rape, burglary, manslaughter, second-degree robbery -- all of those cases -- about seven or eight of them."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1668.625,1671.244,--If I could go back for a second to firearms offenses.
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1693.926,1703.298,Is there any aggravated felony crime of violence that is not a crime involving moral turpitude?
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1703.298,1704.8,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1739.338,1744.125,Was Judulang's crime a crime involving violence?
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1744.125,1745.961,"--Yes, it was a crime--"
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1745.961,1747.411,I mean a crime of moral turpitude.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1747.411,1748.244,"--Yes, it was."
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1754.983,1756.666,Don't -- that may be his approach.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1759.301,1760.185,"--And, Justice Breyer--"
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1760.185,1760.801,Look to the category.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1780.631,1784.502,"--Well, but -- but the category that is relevant is the crime of violence."
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1791.772,1792.789,But you're not -- you're not--
2011.10-694,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1792.789,1795.072,Can I hear this answer?
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1799.876,1802.245,Thank you.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1802.245,1808.215,"--If I could finish up on the firearms analogy, I think that this is responsive, Justice Breyer, to your point about looking at the category."
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1863.632,1864.467,What -- what--
2011.10-694,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1864.467,1867.669,Let's let Justice Sotomayor jump in now with her question.
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1867.669,1871.388,--I go back to Justice Breyer's question.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1925.04,1925.69,--No.
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1925.69,1928.408,"That's how I read your categorical comparison, though."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1928.408,1939.365,The board has made it clear from as early as the Meza decision that it would look into the specific category within the definition of aggravated felony -- in order to be a category--
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1939.365,1942.667,So now why is manslaughter not a crime of moral turpitude?
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1942.667,1946.619,--Because that is not the category in the aggravated felony definition that we are talking about.
2011.10-694,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1952.123,1953.975,"But, Mr. Gannon, suppose this."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1971.754,1972.837,--We do have that category here.
2011.10-694,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1972.837,1973.404,--That's right.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2018.999,2023.869,"Well, I think that there's no dispute about that between us and Petitioner."
2011.10-694,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2028.773,2036.627,"But the Petitioner -- the Petitioner just says we look to manslaughter, and we ask whether that qualifies a person for relief on the exclusion side--"
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2036.627,2037.444,And what I'm trying--
2011.10-694,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2037.444,2046.402,"--But you are saying no, first, we have to put manslaughter in a category on the deportation side, and then we have to match that to the category on the exclusion side."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2054.672,2062.344,"--Well, what it -- the reason it makes sense is because the statute only provides for relief from grounds of inadmissibility or exclusion."
2011.10-694,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2063.094,2068.331,"You are so far from the statute, Mr. Gannon, you can't even tell what's closer to the statute."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2071.283,2089.745,"--Well, the way -- the way this doctrine developed, Justice Kagan, is that it developed in the context where the board recognized that the statute only applied to waiver of grounds of excludability, and it extended that to deportation cases when it was on the basis of the same grounds that could have been presented in the exclusion proceeding."
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2093.064,2100.719,--But what your position means that it's up to the agency -- up to the person who makes the charge.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2125.168,2132.691,--The reason why that's so is because the thing that is going to be waived at the end of the proceeding is the ground of deportation.
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2143.029,2153.604,"If -- if the officer labels the manslaughter in this case a crime involving moral turpitude, then there is a match--"
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2153.604,2154.554,--That's--
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2154.554,2161.375,"--And if he labels it aggravated felony, crime of violence, then there is no match."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2166.512,2167.947,--That's true.
2011.10-694,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2186.408,2188.76,"But this isn't a question about the history, Mr. Gannon."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2198.816,2212.393,"--And I think that this is not only consistent with the history, it is consistent with the text of the regulation the Petitioner is invoking here, which makes it clear that what is being waived is a ground of exclusion or deportability or removability."
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2223.181,2245.097,"Then -- then you have to say yes, you can have somebody who would get a waiver of inadmissibility for a crime, and the very next day be put in deportation without any waiver for that same crime."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2245.097,2247.649,--We have no cases in which that has happened.
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2258.689,2259.874,But these categories--
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2259.874,2260.641,--Pardon?
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2260.641,2261.975,--These categories.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2261.975,2268.646,"No, there -- there are no cases that address that principle in the context where there is no comparable grounds."
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2368.928,2370.361,Can we go back to the second one?
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2444.426,2449.896,"--The chief examples are the ones that the board gives in the Brieva-Perez opinion, which are simple assaults, which has--"
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2449.896,2453.282,"That is not a crime of -- that is not a moral turpitude, simple assault?"
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2454.784,2457.117,"--That is correct, it is not a crime involving moral turpitude."
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2467.357,2470.476,Burglary -- isn't burglary where it might be an occupied building?
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2470.476,2472.845,"--If it were an occupied building, if it were a dwelling--"
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2472.845,2474.411,"Well, no."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2480.199,2486.153,"--In the Ninth Circuit, burglary of a residential dwelling that's occupied is not a crime involving moral turpitude."
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.153,2486.803,"--Oh, really?"
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2487.255,2489.405,In -- in a case that is cited in the concurring opinion--
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2489.405,2490.473,So there are some.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2491.373,2492.39,--There certainly are.
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.39,2493.659,"They're a little odd, but what I'm raising--"
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2493.659,2496.377,They tend to be minor -- minor -- more minor offenses.
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2496.377,2496.744,--Okay.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2514.838,2515.572,I don't--
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.572,2532.55,"You are saying good-bye to Jackson and Thornburgh, because you have driven such a wedge between these two statutes that there's hardly anybody who would be able to qualify for the Jackson-Thornburgh approach to this statute."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2532.55,2533.2,--I just--
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2533.2,2535.002,"I overstate slightly, but you see my point."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2535.002,2552.796,"--I see your point, Justice Breyer, and if you look at all of the cases that predate the era that we are talking about here, they all -- almost all involve two categories of defenses, drug trafficking or controlled substance offenses and crimes involving moral turpitude, things that were actually charged under the ground of deportation for crimes involving moral turpitude."
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2576.01,2577.262,"Well, I keep going back to my question."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2588.902,2590.919,"--That's -- I disagree, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2590.919,2596.056,"If it qualifies as an aggravated violent felony, it cannot be a crime of moral turpitude."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2596.056,2600.61,I disagree with that -- the fact that that's the category we are looking at.
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2623.976,2628.711,Let's go back to a concrete example following Justice Ginsburg's example.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2653.076,2654.412,"Yes, the officer could say that."
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2654.412,2658.98,And could he then waive that ground under 212(c)?
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2658.98,2660.432,"Generally, yes."
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2664.034,2668.087,"Now let's assume that he did, that he waives that crime of moral turpitude."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2693.553,2697.774,"We don't have any examples like that, and--"
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2697.774,2698.391,Would you?
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2699.041,2700.041,--And -- I--
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2700.041,2701.576,Is that where your test leads you?
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2701.576,2709.748,"--Well, ultimately, even the durability of the 212(c) waiver wouldn't necessarily have protected somebody against a subsequent proceeding."
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2709.748,2711.748,"But yet in your brief, I thought you conceded that."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2711.748,2712.616,We--
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2712.616,2716.502,That -- just the example that Justice Sotomayor gave.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2759.345,2763.216,"--Well, we -- the brief did say that this is hypothetically possible."
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2840.149,2871.77,"You are also telling me that -- I didn't know this; I learn something in every argument -- that if we have Jack the cat burglar who was burgling dozens of office buildings -- and abroad -- and assaults people and hits them over the head or whatever with his -- I guess with his fist, that we have no way of excluding that person, should he try -- I -- I have heard criticisms of our immigration policy, but this is surprising to me, that we have no way of excluding that person who is filled with the simple burglary of office buildings and assaults."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2871.77,2875.572,"--Well, there was a separate ground which is two crimes, any two criminal offenses."
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2875.572,2877.056,So he has only done it once; we have to let him--
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2877.056,2879.524,"If he has only done it once, then it may well be that it wouldn't qualify."
2011.10-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2900.288,2901.474,--I take it they haven't decided.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2902.007,2922.553,"--No, I'm saying that the board repeatedly declined to apply this analysis in the context of firearms offenses and visa fraud offenses where the alien said my offense is a crime involving moral turpitude; I could have been charged with being -- I could have been excluded on the basis of my visa fraud offense or my assault with a firearm, because assault with a fire arm is a crime involving moral turpitude."
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2922.553,2924.603,Could I ask just a practical question?
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2936.395,2944.401,"Well, there -- there is a new provision, cancellation of removal, which indisputably just simply is unavailable to anyone with a aggravated felony conviction."
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2944.401,2944.967,Exactly.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2944.967,2946.169,And -- and--
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2946.169,2967.249,"And so really the issue that we have at the moment is whether your decision to effect what has happened now in the past, to do what Congress has done moving forward, and to avoid St. Cyr, is just to say, if it's an aggravated crime of violence it just doesn't qualify anymore."
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2971.97,2979.557,"--Well, we're -- we're giving it to aliens like this, aliens who have older convictions, pre-1996 guilty pleas--"
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2979.557,2985.544,But you were just saying if they are aggravated -- if they've committed an aggravated crime of violence they are not getting it anymore.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2985.544,2990.615,--That -- that is if it was a crime that was -- a conviction that occurred after 212(c) was repealed.
2011.10-694,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2996.851,2999.737,But this whole thing goes away once all the St. Cyr people have--
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2999.737,3006.041,"Yes, because 212(c) only lives on by virtue of St. Cyr right now."
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3055.974,3064.413,But he also said that there are only two grounds for deportation that have no analog in the grounds for exclusion.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3064.413,3065.38,That's -- you're--
2011.10-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3065.38,3067.965,Entry without inspection and firearms conviction.
2011.10-694,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3067.965,3070.9,--That -- that is what footnote 4 of the opinion says.
2011.10-694,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3259.138,3262.007,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-694,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3603.341,3610.345,"If they weren't law-abiding, they would have committed a new felony that would render them inadmissible--"
2011.10-694,2,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3610.345,3613.131,"--And potentially subject them to removal, exactly."
2011.10-694,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3658.093,3659.276,"Thank you, counsel."
