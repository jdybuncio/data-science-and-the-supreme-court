1976.75-1019,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.244,"We will hear arguments next in 75-1019, Boston Stock Exchange against State Tax Commission."
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,55.563,58.92,Mr. Chief Justice may I please the Court.
1976.75-1019,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,310.977,313.293,The challenge here is only on the commerce clause.
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,313.293,314.802,That is correct.
1976.75-1019,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,314.802,318.917,Whatever else relied on the State Court to abandon.
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,318.917,328.585,That is correct; we have dropped the other two claims in the complaint which were the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.
1976.75-1019,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.758,432.45,Mr. Pascal sometime during your argument are you are going to treat the effect of the enactment of Section 28-d of the Securities Act?
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,432.45,442.529,"Yes, in fact, let me move to that right now Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1976.75-1019,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,511.203,521.029,"But whether or not it moots it, it conceivably could have an effect on the burden that the New York tax does put on Congress."
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,521.029,522.397,That is true Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1976.75-1019,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,630.394,642.359,"Mr. Pascal would you give a example, two of deliveries, of securities in New York that would not be affected by the amendment to the Act of 34 but still be covered by the New York statute?"
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,642.359,661.187,"Yes, Mr. Justice Powell, I might be basically trying to summarize one or two examples given on Page 8 of our yellow reply brief but the one that we give first and the one that I think is somewhat classic is an example of New York Life Insurance Company, purchasing securities."
1976.75-1019,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,689.859,707.489,"So even after the transfer, which would be exempt under the transfer on the books by the transfer agent would be exempt under the Federal Act if the securities in the name of the life insurance company were delivered to New York that would be a taxable transaction."
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,707.489,713.147,"That is correct, that is precisely the situation right now."
1976.75-1019,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,802.745,807.446,What kind of transaction gets the benefit of the new 29-c?
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,807.446,819.239,"Well, the transaction where for example I suppose and I would suggest Mr. Justice Brennan and this was not intended but it does probably is the effect right now."
1976.75-1019,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,854.035,865.131,Have we any idea of the proportion where of transactions in which there are deliveries thus subject to the tax in the proportion where they are not perhaps outside the New York tax.
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,865.131,866.931,You mean after the impact of Section 28-d?
1976.75-1019,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,866.931,868.775,Yeah.
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,868.775,881.136,"No I do not think we do indeed I think you can tell from the date of Mr. Crotty’s opinion, December of last year, things were still being worked out until fairly recently and the record in this case has been frozen for a few years."
1976.75-1019,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,888.276,894.838,"Mr. Pascal do you think our decision in the Hughes’ case of last year has any bearing on this, are you familiar with that case?"
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,894.838,925.229,"Yes Mr. Justice Blackmun I am, I think it has baring in the sense that while the court and the opinion of the court reports to be confronting a situation of First Impression according to the language of the opinion of the court and as reemphasized by Mr. Justice Stevens concurring opinion and that situation of First Impression is not present here."
1976.75-1019,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.511,1160.036,They did not think it already was?
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,1160.036,1166.974,I suppose I wanted to secure their position Mr. Justice Rehnquist and that is what is wrong with the statute.
1976.75-1019,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1267.28,1273.6,There are causing a burden on those (Inaudible).
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,1273.6,1275.702,Exactly.
1976.75-1019,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1350.114,1359.929,Do the jurisdiction in which these regional exchanges operate impose no local transfer taxes whatsoever?
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,1359.929,1361.115,"That is correct, none of them do."
1976.75-1019,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1367.91,1370.441,What is the PBW in the stock exchange?
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,1370.441,1381.504,"PBW, well name has changed a few times, it is the PBW is stands for Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington that is I think now the Philadelphia Stock Exchange."
1976.75-1019,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1381.504,1390.265,"And these names listed as plaintiff’s appellants on the appellants brief, all of the plaintiffs is appellants?"
1976.75-1019,0,40233,roger_pascal,,1390.265,1393.723,"They are all six of them, that is correct."
1976.75-1019,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1396.997,1413.245,"Well, I think we will not ask you to spend the minute-and-a-half, we will resume at 1 o’clock."
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1417.098,1420.411,Mr. Chief Justice I may please the court.
1976.75-1019,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1439.923,1441.857,Just one tax will you all add.
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1441.857,1460.671,"Well, part of this tax is earmark to guarantee to the Municipal Assistance Corporation of the City of New York, the federal loans which congress has authorized to the city and to the Big Mac, so called Big Mac Corporation under legislation."
1976.75-1019,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1460.671,1465.308,"We have the figures of theirs,   the aggregate amount of the tax shown on the records?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1465.308,1469.385,It has shown in the legislative history for the years on review.
1976.75-1019,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1469.385,1470.262,What was the?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1470.262,1482.241,Well it is in the neighborhood of $200 million annually although the volume has decreased since the enactment of the 28-d last year of the SEC Act.
1976.75-1019,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1482.241,1487.096,That is what your friend is complaining about that that is a pretty heavy burden on interstate commerce.
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1487.096,1500.009,"Well, we do not think there is any burden here whatsoever, Your Honor, as a matter of fact that a tax does not operate outside of the State of New York, there is no extra territorial tax imposed whatever."
1976.75-1019,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1563.498,1576.956,"You may suggested that 28-d is going to reduce the return, did you suggest how much if it would have been about $200 billion annually wealth?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1576.956,1581.315,"Well that was a roughly, at the beginning of this lawsuit that was the annual yield from our..."
1976.75-1019,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1581.315,1583.527,And what would be the effect of 28-d?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1583.527,1588.138,"28-d which I think reduces it somewhere around $60, $70 million a year."
1976.75-1019,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1588.138,1589.204,That was about a 130…
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1589.204,1590.63,"Yes, somewhere in there."
1976.75-1019,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.765,1629.8,"Well do you think the interstate commerce argument would be different than this case, Mr. Bush if instead of earmarking the tax proceeds for big mac that earmark has raised Governor Carey’s salary to $5 million a year."
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1629.8,1665.421,"Prior to 68, Your Honor, the revenue from this tax went into the General State Treasury at the same time this 270-d was passed the revenue was transferred to the City of New York for general purposes and then during the fiscal crisis, the revenue was earmarked to guaranty to the federal government that the loans borrowed by the city would be backed up in part by the revenue from the stock transferred tax, along with other revenue."
1976.75-1019,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1665.421,1682.729,"Other than your inspection Fee type case,  have our interstate commerce burdened decisions ever given any intimation that the purpose for which the state uses the proceeds of the tax effect the termination is to whether or not it burdens interstate commerce?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1682.729,1699.772,"Well, if I, my recollection of reading those cases it vary with tax to tax, as long as the money is used for a public purpose by a state or one of its municipalities and it is a legitimate function of government."
1976.75-1019,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1713.503,1720.853,"Well there is the federal question turn on, how worthy we regard the cause to which the proceeds are put?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1720.853,1722.805,"I think in part it does, Your Honor, I do not think that the…"
1976.75-1019,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1722.805,1730.172,Do not we assume that all taxes are for good purpose and that all taxes are money that the state needs?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1730.928,1732.043,I would think so.
1976.75-1019,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1732.043,1734.704,What good is this argument?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1734.704,1744.776,"Well, I do not think that the constitution contemplates especially in this case the death nail of the sovereign state of New York through fiscal collapse which is…"
1976.75-1019,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1744.776,1749.201,You mean that the state of New York looses $30 Million has gone?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1749.201,1750.353,It maybe gone if we cannot.
1976.75-1019,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1750.353,1755.496,But there's some part in terms of what lies in the newspaper they said you needed a whole lot more than that.
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1755.496,1757.571,"Your Honor, we need every nickel I can get, and part of it is, it is from this slot."
1976.75-1019,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1757.571,1767.121,"Well, why not put a hate tax of $100.00 on everybody?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1780.818,1787.097,"Well, it is our possession, Your Honor, that the statute has not infirmed constitutionally."
1976.75-1019,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1793.102,1796.793,"I submit that, that is the argument that we are here to listen to."
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1796.793,1797.807,That is right.
1976.75-1019,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1799.906,1803.722,We will assume that New York needs the money.
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,1803.722,1835.725,"We need it desperately, there is no question about it, but I mentioned this public assistance because at the same time that that was passed last year and the Congress had before the consideration of the amendments to the SEC Act one of which was this amendment 28(d) but that did not divest the state of New York of its taxing power in other areas, on the transactions within the State of New York in the sale of securities."
1976.75-1019,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2139.771,2152.043,"Mr. Bush I might interrupt you, am I correct though in understanding that there is one rate of tax paid if the transaction is over the exchange in a different rate but it is not, if it is over the New York Stock Exchange?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2152.043,2161.515,If it is done within the State of New York we offer non-residents a reduced tax if they sell within the State of New York.
1976.75-1019,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.515,2163.293,Over the New York Stock Exchange?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2163.293,2165.263,Over the New York State residents.
1976.75-1019,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.145,2173.914,How much difference in rate is there?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2173.914,2184.692,"Well, it is a graduated beginning back in 68 down through 73 roughly now 50% less for out-of-state non-resident."
1976.75-1019,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2184.692,2187.887,"Now, it is your defense that it is the differential independant."
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2196.833,2211.535,"Our Stock Transfer tax we argue is at the end of commerce, it is upon a sale or a transfer occurring within the State of New York after commerce has come to an end."
1976.75-1019,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.874,2241.234,What is the reason for differentiating them for having two different levels of tax?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2241.234,2246.427,Merely as an inducement to bring the out-of-state business into the State of New York.
1976.75-1019,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.427,2250.85,Is it intended to affect out-of-state business?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2250.85,2256.884,"Well, you mean affected by keeping it out of the state or bringing it in?"
1976.75-1019,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2256.884,2264.958,"Well, is it intended to change the way in which out-of-state business would be done but for this particular taxing scheme?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2264.958,2295.215,"Well, the tax has no extra territorial effect if there is no later transfer within the State of New York, if the sale is made on say at Chicago Exchange the tax is not imposed on that, it is only if that stock is thereafter transferred within the State by a corporate transfer agent that the local taxes is imposed on the transfer but no tax is imposed on an out-of-state sale."
1976.75-1019,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.215,2303.878,Is it correct that the act of the transfer agent generates one tax if the prior sale was made over the Chicago Exchange and a different tax it was generated over the New York Exchange?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2303.878,2305.058,That is right!
1976.75-1019,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.058,2308.741,"So there is the discrimination, but you say it is not a burden."
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2320.262,2321.831,That is the allegation made by the plaintiffs.
1976.75-1019,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.831,2328.012,"What is your answer to the allegation that is what I understood, that happens does it?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2328.012,2343.685,"Well, I think it does happen but the SEC is reporting, their volume goes up every year anyway so the tax itself I do not think has that much of an adverse effect upon regional exchange located in Chicago."
1976.75-1019,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2343.685,2351.366,But the New York legislatures indicate what is the purpose along the lines of Justice Stevens?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2351.366,2397.45,"The purpose was to retain the New York State stock exchanges within the City of New York which at that time was threatening to move out of State because they could not afford to continue business within the State, and that is part of our legislative history which is shown on our brief and also in the new jurisdictional statement, and as an inducement to keep those exchanges within New York it was agreed upon by the City of New York, the State legislature, the governor’s office and the New York Stock Exchange that something had to be done and one means of doing it was to reduce the tax for future years on this type of transaction."
1976.75-1019,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2470.173,2488.556,"Mr. Bush, may I ask, before this reduction in tax was the old right such a burden on transfers on the exchange that the exchanges were suffering and this is why they want to leave New York to escape to tax?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2488.556,2505.633,"That was part of it; that was only a small part of it, Your Honor that the stock exchange thought that because of this increased competition that it was receiving from these regional exchanges something had to be done."
1976.75-1019,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2505.633,2508.498,Was it losing business to those regional exchanges?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2508.498,2509.688,Yes it was.
1976.75-1019,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2509.688,2519.787,"Then the idea was if you reduced the tax in the manner that it was reduced, this would not only retain the business that otherwise will be lost but also increase the amount of tax…"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2519.787,2525.255,"Hopefully, it would bring in additional business into New York."
1976.75-1019,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2525.255,2537.462,Was one of the reason it was losing business that New York imposed a tax on transactions on the New York Exchange and the other states did not impose the taxes on transactions on their exchanges?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2537.462,2538.115,Yes sir.
1976.75-1019,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2579.276,2588.641,"What analogy do you draw; Judge Walker’s opinion in the Court of Appeals rested one point as I read it, kind of on the use tax analogy."
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2588.641,2608.125,"Well, that was the argument that we were making in the court below that the transfer tax was similar to a local sales or use tax in the City of New York and which has been constitutionally sustained in the past."
1976.75-1019,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2639.524,2644.612,"Well, it be a poor lawyer who having lost in two appellate courts did not change its tactics."
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2644.612,2658.41,"That is right, that is right, and we are not embarrassed by that, we I think met this head on and at every stage."
1976.75-1019,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2684.887,2696.666,"I suppose in Gibbons against Ogden like New York could have argued that they needed the revenues, you should do here?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2696.666,2718.031,"Well, in Gibbons in that line of case Your Honor I think dealt with more in the nature of the license fee for the privilege you engaging in interstate commerce or that no one was free to do unless they had a permit to do it."
1976.75-1019,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2786.104,2791.643,What about the deliveries that were affected by your --
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2791.643,2793.263,"Well, Your Honor, I think counsel --"
1976.75-1019,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2793.263,2796.529,the institutional deliveries --
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2796.529,2819.713,"Counsel I think has misread that ruling of the commerce, the counsel of the tax department it is limited to the specific statutory provisions of 28(d) of the SEC Act and all these doing as rephrasing that language and it says, “Either delivery or transfer within the State of New York”."
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.687,2871.789,"Mr. Bush, did you challenge the standing of the respondents or the petitioners here?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2871.789,2875.009,"Yes, we did up through the Court of Appeals of the State of New York."
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2875.009,2876.248,That was rejected.
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2876.248,2878.982,It was rejected.
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.982,2881.021,What was your standing argument?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2881.021,2883.764,"Well, I think that this Court of its own motion could just…"
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.764,2886.161,"Yes, but what was your standing argument in it?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2886.161,2891.118,"Well, what we urged at the very beginning that they had no standing to maintain the law."
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.118,2894.144,What kind of standing you are talking; case or controversy or what?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2894.144,2902.094,They were not aggrieved because no tax was imposed on them and they hadn’t a legal standing to question the constitution.
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.094,2906.08,You say they did not suffer any injury in fact from these taxes?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2906.08,2931.76,"That is right and that is spelled out in our knowledge of motion on grounds which is in the jurisdictional statement, Mr. Justice White has to -- but we felt that since the Court of Appeals decided the way it did that it decided as a matter of State Law that they did have standing to institute and maintain the lawsuit."
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2931.76,2933.399,Does that one bind those?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2933.399,2935.299,No that is right.
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.299,2936.791,"What have you got to say about it, do you hear anything?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2936.791,2949.978,"Well, I think we still maintain, Your Honor, that they have no standing to question the constitutionality of this statute and we think that the…"
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2949.978,2965.936,"One of the mechanics of paying the tax, let us assume I live in Boston and I have a large block of stock to transfer and I called my broker, tell him to sell it in Boston, he sells them and then I have to get it transferred to New York."
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2970.695,2974.038,"Well, most of the…."
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2974.038,2977.343,"I suppose, I give my shares to my broker."
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,2977.343,2996.927,That is right and he has ever been designated as a Stamp Issuer and affixes the stamps to the paper or send into New York in some bank or some other member firm affixes the stamps to the certificate.
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.921,3042.827,"I suppose if I do what I say in my example, I pay this tax in New York and I am talking to my brother in New York and he says, “Well, why don’t you send them down here the next time you have it, it will only cost you half as much,” and I said, “Well, I’ll do that and I tell my broker and he says, “Well, that’s great except that now I don’t get a commission.”"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,3045.95,3056.627,"Well, the Article Twelve of New York State Tax law provides for penalties in the event of evasion and things like that."
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3056.627,3068.351,What is evasion I am just trying to find out if there are some regional Stock Exchange really is hurt by this law?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,3074.213,3075.68,That’s right.
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3082.568,3087.989,You’ll hope that’s terribly successful because you want to bring all the sales in a New York account.
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,3087.989,3091.389,That’s right and we want to retain what we...
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3091.389,3095.972,"To the extent you are successful, to that extent the regional exchanges are hurt, I think."
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,3095.972,3098.011,Well I have read the reports of the SEC.
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3098.011,3099.442,"Well, isn’t that right or not?"
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,3099.442,3105.266,"Well, no because the SEC reports, annual reports showing their volume going up every year."
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.266,3106.902,Or maybe they might have gone more.
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,3106.902,3110.486,"They might have gone out more, who knows that’s a matter of speculation."
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3110.486,3122.444,"I don’t know, your tax system is devised to give people a break if they don’t use the regional exchanges."
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,3122.444,3124.502,"Well, all I can say is that…."
1976.75-1019,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3124.502,3126.384,Isn’t that?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,3126.384,3144.817,"Our revenue was falling off in recent years from what it was back at the time when this thing was first passed, I know that, as a matter of fact, although our record here does not clearly reflect that."
1976.75-1019,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3209.114,3220.437,Are you taking the position Mr. Bush that the Congressional Act here makes this case one less worthy of our consideration?
1976.75-1019,1,38696,robert_w_bush,,3220.437,3260.688,"I think it does since this legislation was enacted because I think it indicates the unwillingness of congress to preempt a field  and which under the constitution I think it has the power to do, that has not yet been fully done, Your Honor but I don’t think the constitutional question is as significant today as it was three or four years ago when this thing was first started and I think that Hughes opinion sort of points that out also."
1976.75-1019,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3260.688,3265.206,Your time is up Mr. Bush.
1976.75-1019,2,40233,roger_pascal,,3268.395,3271.361,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would suggest."
1976.75-1019,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3271.361,3273.533,How are your clients heard Mr. Pascal?
1976.75-1019,2,40233,roger_pascal,,3273.533,3285.661,"Well Mr. Justice Brennan, the injury in fact to which Mr. Justice White referred is the direct open-bald attempt by the state to take her customers away."
1976.75-1019,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3309.473,3321.868,Can you think of any case involving burden of interstate commerce from this court where we have permitted someone in the position of your client to raise the interstate commerce argument?
1976.75-1019,2,40233,roger_pascal,,3321.868,3327.418,I think that the elements have not come together in the interstate commerce case that I know of Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1976.75-1019,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3337.235,3344.989,"That’s Administrative Procedure Act standing, conceivably you can carry it over if you want to into this area but I don’t think it follows as the night, the day."
1976.75-1019,2,40233,roger_pascal,,3344.989,3352.881,It doesn’t follow as night follows day but it has I believe and subsequent sighted in non-administrative procedure cases.
1976.75-1019,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.979,3412.704,Your clients are the only ones  who would raise it that I suppose because the ones who get the break would never raise it.
1976.75-1019,2,40233,roger_pascal,,3412.704,3414.956,"Well the might theoretically, Justice White."
1976.75-1019,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3422.088,3431.131,"But as New York suggested, all we have to do is complain a little more and you will have to pay the tax, the higher tax wherever you sales."
1976.75-1019,2,40233,roger_pascal,,3431.131,3432.357,That’s right.
1976.75-1019,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3432.357,3434.702,They know nothing about the complaint that.
1976.75-1019,2,40233,roger_pascal,,3434.702,3437.046,Well that’s why the exchanges are the plaintiffs.
1976.75-1019,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3514.462,3516.395,How come they don’t realize it?
1976.75-1019,2,40233,roger_pascal,,3516.395,3527.838,"I am afraid that the time to ask that question is passed Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I can’t, because the only effect, the relief we see could have would be to reinstitute the previous higher tax."
1976.75-1019,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3543.027,3543.965,Thank you gentlemen.
