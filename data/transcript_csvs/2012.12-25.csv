2012.12-25,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.237,"We will hear argument next in Case 12-25, Maracich v. Spears."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,6.987,9.456,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,29.685,31.535,Does it create an exception for research?
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,48.314,66.692,"--Our view, Your Honor, as we indicated in our reply brief, is it would not because we believe (b)(12)'s consent requirement governs commercial bulk use of DMV information, which is clear from the fact that it's focusing on marketing and solicitation, and also from the history behind the statute, which is very much aimed at use of DMV information--"
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,66.692,69.744,"It says surveys, not just marketing or solicitations."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,69.744,71.596,"--Yes it does, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,71.596,75.798,"I mean, there is a commercial component, but there appears to be a noncommercial component as well."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,75.798,84.504,"We think, Justice Sotomayor, that this statute is sensibly construed to, under the noscitur a sociis principle that we are relying on elsewhere in our argument with respect to (b)(4)."
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,102.949,121.862,"Does that apply to the States, too, when they want to market against drunk driving, they want to market against -- for their health insurance processes, versus private processes for State drug provided--"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,121.862,129.349,"--Justice Sotomayor, I believe what your first question -- your first example sounded like it was a noncommercial use."
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,243.158,247.843,It says anticipation of litigation in connection--
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,247.843,252.164,Yes.
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,252.164,260.37,"--Not only ongoing litigation, but it can be used in connection with anticipation of litigation."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,260.37,261.62,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-25,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,285.718,292.122,"Mr. Guerra, I have to admit that given what a mess this statute is, those three words don't quite do it for me."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,326.645,339.02,"Well, Justice Kagan, with respect, number one, I don't think you can so readily dismiss the interpretive import of those three words, because they don't have any function other than to override the express consent requirement in (b)(12)."
2012.12-25,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,383.065,389.987,"It's kind of hard to argue, when you have (b)'s (1) through (14), that (b)(12) is the core provision."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,393.772,401.545,"Mr. Chief Justice, what I mean by that is that we know it's core in the sense that it's aimed at one of the core problems that Congress was addressing."
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.49,452.061,You recognize that you could use (b)(4) to identify class members?
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,452.061,453.311,"--We do, Your Honor."
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,465.552,481.311,"So if it's a solicitation, suppose this information was a recent automobile purchaser was asks: Did you buy a car recently?"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,487.015,491.019,"Your Honor, yes, it would be okay -- well, let me just say--"
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,491.019,494.555,That would come under (b)(4).
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,494.555,500.625,"--Justice Ginsburg, if I may just qualify my answer, yes, if you were investigating claims on behalf of a potential client."
2012.12-25,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,519.336,532.394,"Well, aren't we going to be told the whole essence of the class action is you have to see if there is an injury that goes beyond some particular clients that you know."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,537.881,549.122,"Your Honor, Justice Kennedy, if they had limited their activities to conducting an investigation to determine the scope of a potential claim, we would have no quarrel with that."
2012.12-25,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,549.122,551.891,"Well, the anticipation is, are you willing to join the class?"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,554.274,557.109,"No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think so."
2012.12-25,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,567.817,584.279,"Well, I do think you are helped somewhat by the chronological progression here, including the service of process, which means the case has already started, and then investigation in anticipation of the litigation that follows the service of process."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,597.936,602.84,"They would, and I think they do make that argument, Justice Kennedy."
2012.12-25,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,618.35,625.237,"Mr. Guerra, where do you get that from in (b)(4), this focus on tribunals rather than lawyers?"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,634.11,635.545,It comes from the phrase
2012.12-25,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,642.115,645.917,But then it includes things that are clearly done by lawyers.
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,645.917,646.352,Right.
2012.12-25,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,662.779,670.151,"Well, are -- are you saying that the study must be either a solicitation or an investigation, it can't be both?"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,671.035,685.477,"Because, Justice Kennedy, the DM -- the DPPA is designed to -- it was aiming at a fundamental problem of private individuals obtaining the DMV information for commercial solicitation purposes."
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.891,712.145,I want to make sure I understood your prior answer.
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,733.875,736.927,"Justice Ginsburg, I apologize if I am not making myself clear enough."
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,745.516,758.257,"Well, isn't that -- wasn't that crystal-clear here, because the dealers were saying, you can't go forward unless you have a plaintiff to match every dealer."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,779.439,795.032,"--Justice Ginsburg, determining that there are -- there are enough plaintiffs to justify a class or group action is the investigative activity, but when you go on to invite them -- and the Fourth Circuit ruled that these letters were solicitations, and that ruling is not before this Court--"
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,795.032,801.685,Suppose we had -- it was limited to -- to class notice -- somebody who--
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,801.685,806.839,"--Justice Ginsburg -- I'm sorry, to interrupt, but something distracted my -- I couldn't hear the beginning of your question."
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,806.839,813.576,"--We have just those questions, no -- are you interested in joining a lawsuit, please call us."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,837.375,848.832,"If the lawyer answers by asking investigative questions, when did you buy the car, were you charged these fees, were you advised, were they prominently displayed, all of which is in gathering information for the lawsuit."
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,853.218,866.044,"--If the lawyer had said more -- did you buy a car, did you get charged the fee, we're investigating this to determine whether this is -- violates the law."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,867.294,868.744,"--It still is, Your Honor."
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,869.796,874.984,"So the only -- the only thing that's bad is to say, come call us for a consultation?"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,874.984,878.186,--If you were interested in participating as -- in this proceeding.
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,878.819,886.541,So what's the difference between that and how you answered Justice Ginsburg when she said class notice would be okay?
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,886.541,891.659,--Because class notice is not a proposal of a relation -- a commercial transaction.
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,892.528,893.145,Wait a minute.
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,895.813,896.547,--Correct.
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,896.547,902.801,"And when you join the class, you have a commercial relationship with the lawyer no different than being a named plaintiff."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,902.801,906.686,But the function of class notice is not to enable class lawyers to solicit clients.
2012.12-25,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,918.961,934.772,"Well, that distinction -- I understand that you are deriving some of it from (b)(12), but if I -- just assume with me that (b)(12) has nothing to do with anything, and you were just limited to (b)(4), can you find that distinction in (b)(4)?"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,934.772,956.519,"--Your Honor, I think the point here is that if you look at the conduct that is specified in the three examples, it is all activity that lawyers would be engaging in as officers of a court, and this Court has repeatedly recognized that there is a fundamental difference between lawyers acting in their own commercial capacities as opposed to officers of a court."
2012.12-25,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,956.986,964.707,How -- how is somebody conducting an investigation in anticipation of litigation -- hasn't started yet -- acting as an officer of the court?
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,964.707,975.099,"--Because they're discharging their responsibility to ensure that they bring well-founded claims and don't file suits -- I mean, under Rule 11, you have to have a well-founded factual basis for the allegations in the complaint."
2012.12-25,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,976.132,980.467,"Well, that just seems to me to be saying that lawyers are always acting as an officer of the court--"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,980.467,982.103,"--Mr. Chief Justice, with respect--"
2012.12-25,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,982.103,988.24,"--when you're preparing a discovery request, when you're -- anything -- anything that the officer functions--"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,988.24,997.529,"--I think most times when you are in -- engaging in litigation or pre-filing an investigation, that would be true, and that would be all protected under (b)(4)."
2012.12-25,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1008.503,1011.188,"Mr. Guerra, don't you think -- I mean, I understand the distinction."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1033.119,1050.997,"--Well, Justice Kagan, for one thing, I think that even if you decide that (b)(12) is not governing (b)(4), it's still part of the statute, and it still demonstrates that Congress was concerned about people using DMV information in order to engage in commercial activity."
2012.12-25,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1110.186,1123.779,"Well, I understand your argument about (12), but I do think that you ought to assume we might interpret this statute so that each of these is independent, and you have to concentrate on (4)."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1150.513,1151.379,Justice Kennedy--
2012.12-25,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1151.379,1152.295,I don't know why you concede that.
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1152.295,1158.716,"--I guess I've never understood that -- after service of process, it's still in anticipation of litigation."
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1161.068,1167.555,"It doesn't necessarily follow, that they are describing only what goes on in the court."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1177.078,1179.946,"--I am not disputing that, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1199.443,1211.065,"You -- you said earlier, and it set me to thinking, that why would in anticipation of litigation permit access to all of this very personal information?"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1229.759,1236.93,"Justice Sotomayor, that's true in this case, but if you read before, the way Respondents are asking you to read it, there's no limitation in the statute that says--"
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1236.93,1238.115,"Well, yes, there is."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1254.125,1262.648,"--If you interpret (b)(4) to authorize access to lawyers in connection -- based on the theory that it's in connection with some litigation, they will have access--"
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1262.648,1263.331,You have to explain why.
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1263.331,1267.734,--The request in this case simply said pursuant to (b)(4) of the statute.
2012.12-25,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1267.734,1268.668,"No, no, no."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1289.982,1291.417,"Justice Sotomayor, two points."
2012.12-25,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1324.655,1333.911,"Mr. Guerra, suppose I am a lawyer and I want to bring a toxic tort case, and I am really -- I am looking for witnesses who have the same kind of symptoms as my client had."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1350.353,1354.038,"Two points, Justice Kagan."
2012.12-25,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1366.715,1372.952,"Well, I guess what I was suggesting was that if I was just asking for witnesses, you would have to say that that was included by (b)(4)."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1373.469,1373.869,I do.
2012.12-25,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1374.152,1380.79,"Now, the court -- the lawyer is saying in addition to your help as a witness, if you have the same symptoms, you know, you can join the suit."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1380.79,1383.908,And I think that that's an improper use.
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1405.254,1418.228,"I don't know why this case doesn't fit that description, because the position that the dealers were taking was, you can't -- you ought to maintain a representative action."
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1436.124,1440.009,"--You can ask every question up to, would you like to be a plaintiff in the lawsuit, and that would be fine."
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1441.592,1447.48,Might that get the lawyer into some difficulty with the bar association?
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1467.226,1476.099,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that the fact that that might trigger an obligation to make a disclosure is not dispositive of whether it's a solicitation."
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1516.326,1526.015,"But then there is a whole string of defendants who were doing the same thing, the same allegedly unlawful practice, they couldn't reach without getting additional--"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1526.015,1530.751,--But their -- their clients have no interest or need to reach those other dealerships.
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1533.537,1538.239,"--But their client as a group, this is not an individual act--"
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1538.239,1539.524,"--That's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-25,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1539.524,1542.393,--The statute says for the benefit of the whole.
2012.12-25,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1542.393,1551.249,And the South Carolina State court said that each named individual could sue for the benefit of everyone who dealt with the same dealer that that plaintiff dealt with.
2012.12-25,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1562.588,1563.64,"--Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1566.692,1569.293,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1646.127,1660.034,"One thing we also know about the in connection with language is we have said, it can't really mean in connection with as broadly as that -- the Morales case, I guess, it has to have a more narrow meaning."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1660.6,1661.552,"Mr. Chief Justice, that's exactly right."
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1711.347,1729.226,"Can they do this: Can Lawyer Smith say, you know, there are some products in this State that I really suspect are not being properly made and I have probably a tort suit; and the damages are awfully small; I would like to get 10 or 20,000 plaintiffs."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1759.477,1763.046,--It may or may not depending on where you draw the line.
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1768.533,1768.883,Yeah.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1768.883,1777.538,"--they can go to the phone book, they can go to the title records office, there is lots of places they can go if what they want is just general information about people."
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1783.776,1785.644,Maybe they -- maybe this is all passe.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1792.132,1793.798,"But, Justice Breyer, that's part of the reason I'm pointing--"
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1793.798,1805.123,"--So maybe what they want is they want the names of all the people who've ever had a car, you know, because they think there's something special about a car, and they think that's going to be connected."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1806.273,1806.656,--I--
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1806.656,1816.68,"You have no lawsuit, but you are going to get one if you can, and you have grounds for thinking that there is some suspicious defendants and what you are looking for is plaintiffs."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1817.098,1817.548,--Sure.
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1817.88,1818.865,All you are looking for is plaintiffs.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1827.386,1835.459,"--I think actually the best answer at the end of the day is it depends on whether you are focused on a specific transaction, occurrence, defect."
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1836.827,1843.815,Is your answer what I have in my mind -- I'm just repeating the same question.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1862.542,1864.978,--I would say the best answer is that you can.
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1868.096,1869.132,"No, no, I'm not liking or disliking--"
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1869.132,1869.948,"--Well, here's the thing."
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1905.555,1907.59,"--Now, that's your -- now, that's the line."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1936.675,1938.993,"--No, they are not in the following sense, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.571,1956.454,"Now, repeat to me -- I've got your point, you have don't have to prove it to me."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1978.187,1978.853,--Right.
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1978.853,1987.458,"I want it south of that, and now you will tell me the words I can use that will both help your client because they will cover this case, but will also be south of that."
2012.12-25,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.458,1988.458,What is south?
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1991.377,2001.433,"South means -- south means it does not -- you can't just go and troll for clients simply because you think a defendant has done something wrong, and you have no client."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2001.433,2014.324,"If you want to draw the line south of the trolling line, then I think what you would say is this is an easy case because no communication took place until my clients had a client."
2012.12-25,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2028.35,2029.883,I want to interrupt for just one moment.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2052.882,2056.068,A FOIA request was made before the suit was filed.
2012.12-25,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2061.388,2063.923,"Yes, but the FOIA suit was made before the suit was filed."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2063.923,2064.306,Sure.
2012.12-25,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2078.683,2088.789,Suppose you -- you said that you had a few people came and complained to the lawyers and then the lawyers wanted to see how widespread this was.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2114.939,2127.164,"I think it would, Justice Ginsburg, because I think that when you are trying to figure out where to draw the line you look to the words in the statute which you know that investigation in anticipation of litigation is covered."
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2132.318,2146.41,It would be -- it would be a very poor lawyer who couldn't figure out how to write the letter he's going to send out in a way that it could not be said to be investigation as opposed to solicitation.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2172.209,2183.267,"I couldn't agree more, Mr. Chief Justice, which is why the line can't really be between investigation in anticipation of litigation and solicitation in anticipation of litigation."
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2186.953,2187.82,Where is the line?
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2187.82,2193.189,The line is whether or not it is in anticipation of litigation or in connection with litigation--
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2193.189,2194.274,"No, that's the words of the statute."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2208.651,2219.44,"--I think the way you do is you would basically say that when they are saying in anticipation of litigation they mean in anticipation of a particular litigation, particular problem, and so it's different--"
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2219.44,2222.911,"That doesn't have to be filed in court, that may just be--"
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2222.911,2224.011,"--Oh, absolutely not."
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2224.344,2227.712,--residing in the brain of any lawyer who's looking for work.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2227.712,2235.135,"--They are concerned about a particular thing, and I think the in anticipation of litigation language, I mean, that's not the only time you have ever seen it before--"
2012.12-25,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.135,2235.935,It's not just that language.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2244.924,2245.657,--It--
2012.12-25,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.657,2246.859,Isn't that your position?
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2246.859,2256.299,"--I think it is, though I guess my point would be even if you can identify some solicitation that is not investigation, as long as it's in connection with litigation it's in (b)(4), and then I think--"
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.299,2274.76,"So you are saying that really this is a -- the way the statute works is it says nobody can solicit but for lawyers, and that's not -- that makes more sense than you might think, because this was not a statute that was meant to interfere with solicitation rules, it was meant to interfere with commercial selling."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2284.901,2289.853,--I agree with everything except the first thing you said which is that this is a prohibition on solicitation.
2012.12-25,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.811,2330.68,I don't think that is fair.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2372.424,2373.29,"--No, you don't."
2012.12-25,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2421.987,2424.789,(B)(4) is about -- (b)(4) is about very sensitive information.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2450.423,2458.112,"Justice Alito, it is important to recognize lawyers presumptively get it under Federal law, but Federal law is only a floor."
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2502.474,2512.597,"The difficulty that Justice Alito brings out is -- I see your interpretation, and I hope the other side will give me some line, because they have the same problem in reverse."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2529.791,2532.66,It's certainly not an all-purpose privacy statute.
2012.12-25,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2575.237,2593.532,"But in anticipation of litigation does come after service of process, and an additional way to harmonize this statute with (12) is to say that after the suit has been filed, then in anticipation of the litigation that that suit will engender, then you may get the information."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2594.651,2599.603,"There's two problems with that way of looking at the statute, I think I would respectfully suggest, Justice Kennedy."
2012.12-25,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2633.209,2635.476,That's the way the statute's written.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2635.476,2642.797,"--Yes, but I don't think that that was an intentional thing on the Court's part, that we're going to name these and we're going to name them in chronological order."
2012.12-25,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2644.833,2648.968,"Mr. Clement, I'm not sure I'm satisfied with the answer you gave to Justice Scalia."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2691.628,2694.23,Last word conflicting?
2012.12-25,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2694.23,2697.866,"Conflicting, exactly, or conflicting or overlapping."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2700.834,2703.753,I think they are necessarily overlapping.
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2769.028,2769.912,"Well, that's right."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2791.394,2799.982,"--But as we've discussed, Mr. Chief Justice, if you are saying you are not going to apply the specific controls the general, but you may be using a junior varsity version of it to harmonize the statute--"
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2799.982,0.0,Exactly.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2800.567,2812.991,"--as we suggested in our colloquy, I think the line between solicitation in anticipation of investigation and investigation in anticipation of litigation is far too thin a line to make a $200 million difference."
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2861.222,2871.68,"Well, the reason -- the reason that would be so -- I agree with you that it's very hard to figure out what the line is here between the investigation and solicitation."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2883.571,2885.955,Not under South Carolina law.
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2887.305,2890.574,"Not under South Carolina law, but then under another State under this statute, they could."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2937.538,2942.776,"But, Justice Breyer, let me try to help you this way, which, is first of all, every State in the country is focused on identity theft."
2012.12-25,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2953.917,2963.106,"By the way, that is helpful, because do we know under how many States' law the DMV would be forbidden to give Social Security numbers?"
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2963.106,2964.456,--I don't know that offhand.
2012.12-25,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2972.211,2974.58,Is there a Federal law to that effect?
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2974.58,2975.38,--What's that?
2012.12-25,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2975.38,2976.613,There may be a Federal law to that effect.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2976.613,2977.063,Right.
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2996.494,2999.879,If they were thinking they might bring an ADA suit--
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2999.879,3000.898,--Fair point.
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3000.898,3008.635,--Their position does create -- the point your friend makes -- it does create a special exemption from a solicitation bar for lawyers.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3013.872,3015.907,"Well, sure."
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3021.894,3021.894,"In connection with something they hope might someday become litigation, depending upon the answers they get."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3021.894,3029.382,"--Well, again, if you're going to draw a line -- there's two things here."
2012.12-25,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3038.154,3040.19,"Can I ask about your line, Mr. Clement?"
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3040.19,3040.64,Sure.
2012.12-25,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3040.64,3043.308,Let me just see if I understand it and I'll give you two things--
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3043.308,3043.658,Sure.
2012.12-25,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3043.658,3045.594,--and I think one falls on one side of your line--
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3045.594,3045.877,Yeah.
2012.12-25,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3045.877,3049.728,"--and the other falls on the other, but this is just to clarify where your line is."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3087.937,3089.622,"I think that's right, Justice Kagan."
2012.12-25,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3097.609,3098.311,But your line--
2012.12-25,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3098.311,3099.378,"They're north of that line, right?"
2012.12-25,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3100.261,3100.778,--is a contemplated litigation.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3100.778,3101.111,Yes.
2012.12-25,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3101.111,3103.596,A specific contemplated litigation.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3103.596,3104.382,Exactly.
2012.12-25,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3125.712,3126.262,Would you want to start the suit.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3128.331,3132.382,"--Yeah, that's -- that's not my case, because these people came to us before we did anything."
2012.12-25,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3143.173,3167.039,"Well, if Congress wanted to draw the line between possible, you know, some unknown lawsuit and an actual lawsuit that's in the mind of the lawyer, why did it use the term litigation when it had already used earlier in the same subsection proceeding, civil, criminal, administrative, or arbitral proceeding?"
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3167.039,3175.561,"Well, Justice Alito, I think when it uses in anticipation of litigation, it actually wants to cover activity that takes place before there's an actual proceeding."
2012.12-25,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3213.769,3215.969,I don't know which is specific and which is general.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3217.555,3218.488,I agree.
2012.12-25,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3230.946,3236.969,"But which do you say, Mr. Clement, that you and your varsity version of the -- which is stronger than the other one is--"
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3236.969,3237.419,Paradoxically.
2012.12-25,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3237.419,3247.408,"--is something like if (b)(4) is hard, we have to draw a line someplace, we can look to (b)(12) as expressing some kind of concern that we can use to draw that line."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3247.408,3247.991,Yeah.
2012.12-25,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3249.11,3257.03,"It's not a conflict, we don't have to -- you know, it's not inconsistent, it's just this is an expression of what was Congress was thinking about, we're going to use it as a clue."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3257.03,3257.632,--Right.
2012.12-25,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.398,3311.6,I don't understand what you're saying.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3317.671,3322.658,"--Well, and -- they would -- it's so natural that somebody will say, can I join your lawsuit--"
2012.12-25,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3322.658,3323.008,Yes.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3323.008,3328.729,"--that they would require all the language that says, you have alternatives, other people can -- can -- can hire you."
2012.12-25,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3328.729,3334.18,"Well, that's because -- that's because the State is allowing solicitation and it puts certain conditions on what your solicitation--"
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3334.18,3334.798,Exactly.
2012.12-25,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3334.798,3340.869,"--You point to page 94, you say, oh, it's just the last line, the whole thrust of the letter was solicitation, you have to be fair about that."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3340.869,3341.136,Exactly.
2012.12-25,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3341.136,3342.102,You have to be fair about that.
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3342.102,3352.177,"And Justice Scalia, the last thing you can infer from the statute that Congress wanted, for the first time ever, get in the business of managing attorney solicitation, a subject they'd always left to the States."
2012.12-25,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3352.66,3359.998,"Counsel, I just want to, before you leave, because in response to Justice Kagan, I think you've changed positions a little bit."
2012.12-25,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3377.042,3386.748,"--My -- my preferred reading is that transaction, occurrence, defect, which I took her red light camera to be an example of a particular identified defect."

2012.12-25,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3429.491,3432.11,Why don't you give us the line that's north.
2012.12-25,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3435.812,3437.445,--My line -- my line--

2012.12-25,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3497.182,3499.551,--I'm not sure I understand the question.
2012.12-25,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3499.551,3505.788,"Can they go to the board and say, look, Dealer Smith here, we're in the middle of the case, we're finished with discovery."
2012.12-25,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3509.157,3509.64,Are you talking about--
2012.12-25,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3509.64,3518.763,"--we want to find three others and I'm sure there's loads of evidence here that there were a hundred thousand others who bought this defective thing from this defendant, we want to find out the names and addresses."
