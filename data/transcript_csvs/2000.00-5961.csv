2000.00-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.6,"We'll hear argument next in No. 00-5961, Melvin Tyler v. Burl Cain."
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,20.062,32.201,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,83.842,85.161,How about EDPA?
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,85.161,86.525,EDPA.
2000.00-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.513,138.415,"Just getting back to EDPA for a moment, Mr. Larson."
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,159.137,164.71,--You yourselves must have said that it is retroactive in a successive petition.
2000.00-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,173.049,178.418,"Well, when... first you said said, and then must have done something to communicate."
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,181.594,184.484,"Well, made is the word I'm looking for, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.82,198.89,"But, you know, one obvious choice in this language is to say, yes, the Supreme Court has held that this rule is retroactive."
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,204.834,206.282,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.282,208.428,How would you define made?
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,208.428,221.021,That it would be clear that the unmistakable import of an action taken by this Court would be that the new rule that had been announced was to be applied retroactively.
2000.00-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.021,225.972,"But this Court need not have said so in haec verba, so to speak, in so many words."
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,225.972,226.965,"Precisely, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,251.819,262.964,"So you think that it is the unmistakable import, to use your words, of the Court's opinion, earlier opinion in Cage, that it was meant to be retroactive."
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,262.964,268.842,"No, I would say that it was the unmistakable import, Your Honor, in the Court's opinion in Sullivan--"
2000.00-5961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,268.842,269.402,In Sullivan.
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,269.402,283.065,"--that Cage was meant to be applied retroactively, and that unmistakable import was received by seven circuit courts of appeal that have applied Cage retroactively since Sullivan."
2000.00-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,431.263,438.732,"But I think an equally simple plain meeting is to say, made retroactive would be that this Court has said they were retroactive."
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,438.732,446.412,"That would be, Your Honor, but if that were to be the case, it creates an entire host of problems."
2000.00-5961,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,546.146,566.413,"On the other hand there is a thirty day requirement in the court of appeals to determine whether or not to decide the issue, and that indicates, it seems to me, that the only thing they can do is look to see whether this Court has decided it."
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,573.722,585.405,"--Well, but that's precisely the type of decision that lower courts make every day in terms of first petitions, as was done in this case."
2000.00-5961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,652.279,664.623,How many jury instructions do you suppose have been given out there in the past on reasonable doubt that would fall within Cage?
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,671.598,683.282,"The... my understanding is, Justice O'Connor, is that this instruction was the standard bench book instruction for Orleans Parish for a period of time."
2000.00-5961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,684.972,687.861,"Yeah, but how about other states and other jurisdictions?"
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,694.26,711.988,"--There were unquestionably a wide variety of reasonable doubt instructions, but I don't think that there would be many states, and I have not seen many cases indicated, that would meet the requirements of Cage that have all three of the elements that Cage had that would be condemned."
2000.00-5961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,728.623,734.095,"Yes, but presumably the Orleans Parish bench book instructions came from somewhere."
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,753.62,764.849,"--Your Honor, in all the reading I have done everywhere, I have never seen an instruction as bad as the Cage instruction from any other jurisdiction."
2000.00-5961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,770.876,794.487,"The... is this... we tried to look this up, and I'll tell you what I found and see if it corresponds... either of you... that there were six or seven states right after Cage that had similar instructions, then the Court decided Victor v. Nebraska, and that seemed to suggest that all but in one or two, maybe the Louisiana and New York, that the instructions were okay."
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,809.719,815.292,"My understanding is that very, very few states gave this type of instructions."
2000.00-5961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,832.632,833.291,What you're saying--
2000.00-5961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,833.291,834.961,"--If that's all, why is it a watershed?"
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,834.961,836.634,--Beg your pardon?
2000.00-5961,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,836.634,841.093,"I mean, if they're only going to affect fifty or sixty people, why is it a watershed rule?"
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,841.093,851.002,"It is a watershed rule, Your Honor, because what happened in Sullivan changed the way that we understood reasonable doubt."
2000.00-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,851.867,855.005,"Sullivan is a watershed rule, or Cage is?"
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,855.005,857.068,"--Cage is the new rule, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.436,866.318,What makes Cage a watershed rule... but your position is that Cage is a watershed rule.
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,866.318,867.571,"Cage is the new rule, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.571,873.765,"Do you know of any other watershed rule that we have announced in a per curiam, unargued opinion?"
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,873.765,874.508,"No, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,874.508,878.717,Wasn't Cage just an application of Winship?
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,878.717,879.626,Cage--
2000.00-5961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,879.626,884.084,"I mean, I don't know that you can say that Cage was more than that."
2000.00-5961,0,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,891.077,893.577,--Winship was the principle.
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,1672.786,1677.283,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1710.803,1717.573,"Before you get started, may I just ask, do you agree that Cage was a new rule?"
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,1717.573,1718.605,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1811.773,1814.168,Can you give an example other than Gideon?
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,1831.342,1841.001,"Well, I think you need to go back in history to an extent, and a lot of our principles have not evolved in such a dramatic fashion."
2000.00-5961,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1852.025,1859.66,"Well, I think we would like to know if you have a positive example, not what isn't a watershed rule, but what is, other than Gideon?"
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,1859.66,1874.809,"You know, I think you look to the Bill of Rights and the defendant's opportunity to confront the witness against him, to have a public trial, a fair and impartial jury, and--"
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.809,1876.628,But isn't the--
2000.00-5961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.628,1878.403,--I would think all of those are not watershed rules.
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,1883.354,1883.809,"--Well, in the sense that--"
2000.00-5961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.809,1885.212,--What makes it a watershed rule?
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,1885.212,1890.042,"--Well, in the sense that to be a watershed rule... a watershed rule requires two components."
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.298,1917.989,"Well, why wouldn't this one be, then?"
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,1990.889,1994.855,--I think the question of structural error is distinct from retroactivity.
2000.00-5961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2025.729,2033.038,"Well, now every court of appeals to have considered the question has said it has... Cage has to be applied retroactively."
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2033.902,2034.645,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2034.645,2037.784,"And they're all wrong, I guess, in your view."
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2037.784,2039.93,"That's our position, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.474,2070.561,Can I just interrupt with one--
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2070.561,2071.592,"--of the bedrock procedural elements for a fair trial, then it's clear--"
2000.00-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.592,2072.873,"--Mr. Heuer, can I just interrupt with one--"
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2072.873,2073.04,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.04,2074.275,--one thought.
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2088.931,2098.219,I think the retroactivity... whatever the--
2000.00-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2098.219,2102.761,"Doesn't that ask the question what was the law at the time of the trial, and you're saying--"
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2102.761,2103.42,--That he was entitled to a reasonable doubt--
2000.00-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2103.42,2105.278,--he did not need a better instruction than he got.
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2105.278,2108.25,"--Well, Your Honor, correct."
2000.00-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.451,2129.221,"But if it's a new rule... if it's a new rule, he was not entitled to that instruction at the time of his trial, it seems to me."
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2129.221,2153.164,"Well, you know, this language fell within the logical compass of the reasoning in Winship, but, you know, I don't think that anything we knew before dictated or compelled the conclusion that this instruction failed to accurately delineate the standard of reasonable doubt, so this--"
2000.00-5961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2153.164,2167.487,"Can you shed any light for us on how many verdicts would be affected by our clarification, if we made it, that this must be applied retroactive?"
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2168.314,2191.802,"--I checked with the Department of Corrections, and there are 1.057 inmates in Angola currently whose trials came from Orleans Parish, and whose trials commenced approximately a year before Cage."
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.802,2199.232,It's been eight years since the Court decided Sullivan.
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2220.203,2221.978,"That's all I do, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2221.978,2222.638,What?
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2223.836,2228.832,There's hardly a habeas petition filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana that does not include a--
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.832,2229.287,--Okay.
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2237.932,2238.369,--No.
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.311,2246.477,"How many habeas petitions have been filed, to your knowledge, that include this question?"
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2246.477,2249.349,"--I can't answer that, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2249.349,2252.404,Do you come across in your personal experience more than one?
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2252.404,2254.429,"Oh, yes."
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2254.429,2254.733,Yes?
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2254.733,2259.546,"Clearly over a hundred... you know, in the hundreds, since Cage was announced."
2000.00-5961,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2268.38,2280.89,"Counsel, based on your argument was the Fifth Circuit wrong in allowing the district court to consider this successive petition?"
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2280.89,2282.005,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2320.93,2329.929,"Well, I am asking the question because of the short time frame that the court of appeals has to determine whether it's going to allow a successive petition."
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2345.616,2346.731,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2367.536,2374.307,Let's assume that we have never said whether or not Cage is retroactive... let's assume that.
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2384.831,2385.369,"Well, I believe--"
2000.00-5961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2385.369,2398.911,"The only thing that the court of appeals can answer, according to you I take it, is whether or not we have said that, and if the court of appeals is right that we've never said that, isn't that the end of the matter?"
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2404.029,2419.511,"--Well, I believe... I believe that Congress believed that the finality concerns were so critical in terms of second and successive habeas petitioners that it would leave that judgment to this Court, and presumably that would occur at the time of a first habeas petitioner."
2000.00-5961,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2419.511,2424.629,So we have to wait for a first habeas petition or a direct review to say this?
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2424.629,2425.743,Correct.
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2425.743,2428.715,What do you think of unmistakable imports?
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2432.43,2433.379,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2433.379,2442.833,"Unmistakable import is their idea, that sometimes this Court might not say, and it is retroactive on collateral review."
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2449.016,2459.468,"Your Honor, I believe the fair reading of the statute makes the inclusion of this Court superfluous under that rationale."
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.468,2464.298,"But can you answer just yes or no, I'm not sure whether you... I said, is that good enough for you?"
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2464.298,2465.208,"No, it's not, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2465.208,2466.323,Because?
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2466.323,2493.527,Because I believe the only fair natural reading of the statute is that Congress put such a... had such great concern over second and successive habeas petitions that they have given this Court the additional responsibility of announcing the retroactivity of a rule before a second or successive habeas petitioner can come back to court and challenge his conviction.
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2493.527,2497.818,And you put up with the anomaly that that creates?
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2497.818,2498.728,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2498.728,2514.126,"Even if, for example, there were such cases just obvious... like flag burning, the Court says flag burning is... you can't punish that, or you can't punish writing an editorial in a newspaper criticizing the government."
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2545.539,2554.622,"Your Honor, in cases... the first exception cases clearly present a more difficult argument than the second exception."
2000.00-5961,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2567.791,2570.02,But you would accept dicta.
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2598.09,2600.652,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2606.429,2620.341,"Well, if we... if EDPA does not require a holding, in other words, for example, an appeal from a first habeas in which there's no question that the issue can get up and in which case our declaration would be a holding."
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2644.507,2664.636,"Well, my principal argument would be this case itself... that the courts have seized on the conclusion that Sullivan, without deciding any retroactivity concerns, because it found the error structural, made it retroactive."
2000.00-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.636,2670.58,Aren't you saying in response to Justice Souter that we should read the word made to mean said?
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2670.58,2671.695,Yes.
2000.00-5961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.695,2674.007,But they didn't say it said.
2000.00-5961,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2674.007,2682.18,One of the problems with--
2000.00-5961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2682.18,2684.327,--Unless you believe that what we say has effect.
2000.00-5961,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2686.079,2693.78,"But is it appropriate for this Court to say, now we've got this case before us, and we decide this case."
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2714.464,2728.21,"And in the case of second successive habeas petitioners, you know, they may have to wait until this Court has had an opportunity to address a first habeas that raises that issue."
2000.00-5961,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.646,2756.938,"Well, it's more than sitting and waiting."
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2769.57,2770.024,--Right.
2000.00-5961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.024,2776.218,And the Congress was not particularly sympathetic to second habeas petitioners in EDPA.
2000.00-5961,1,19188,charles_e_f_heuer,,2776.218,2777.249,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2798.342,2799.457,"Thank you, Mr. Heuer."
2000.00-5961,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2803.089,2812.932,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-5961,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2822.286,2842.432,"In answer to the question Justice Breyer asked your colleague, where primary conduct is held to be not punishable as a matter of law, is that also subject to the same retroactivity principles we're talking about, or is there a different rule?"
2000.00-5961,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2850.066,2851.348,I don't think there is.
2000.00-5961,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2862.001,2864.617,Even if it's beyond the power of the law to punish?
2000.00-5961,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2867.323,2868.975,"--Well, I think the fairest reading is what I said."
2000.00-5961,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2879.583,2880.121,Which case?
2000.00-5961,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2880.121,2897.932,"The Eichmann case, the flag burning case, in which... you could distinguish some cases under the first Teague exception in which the application of that exception is just absolutely crystal clear, but I don't think all first exception cases are even close to that, and I don't think that any second exception cases would be like that."
2000.00-5961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2922.081,2933.764,"But that's fair because then if it's this Court... I mean, it's this Court and not some other court that writes an opinion, the unmistakable import of which is that it is retroactive on collateral review."
2000.00-5961,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2938.678,2939.625,"No, that wouldn't."
2000.00-5961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2969.347,2971.909,"You mean... no, I'm sorry--"
2000.00-5961,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2976.672,2977.52,--I think so.
2000.00-5961,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3003.86,3010.88,I take it that the only conclusive determination by this Court could be a determination on a first habeas.
2000.00-5961,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3010.88,3016.742,"I think on a first habeas in a case like this whereas a kind of, whereas a kind of--"
2000.00-5961,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3016.742,3017.856,When the defendant takes an appeal on the second.
2000.00-5961,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3017.856,3019.175,--On an original petition--
2000.00-5961,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3019.175,3020.207,But in terms of what?
2000.00-5961,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3038.883,3045.182,"--Yeah, I would go maybe just an inch beyond holding, which is either a holding or a statement that's not dicta."
2000.00-5961,3,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,3420.473,3431.702,"To respond to Justice O'Connor's question regarding the number of people who might be affected, the number one thousand I would submit is very inaccurate."
2000.00-5961,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3496.223,3498.619,How long a term was your client serving?
2000.00-5961,3,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,3498.619,3500.038,"He's serving a life sentence, Your Honor."
2000.00-5961,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3500.038,3500.681,A life sentence?
2000.00-5961,3,27532,herbert_v_larson_jr,,3500.681,3501.258,Life sentence.
2000.00-5961,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3594.138,3595.79,"Thank you, Mr. Larson."
