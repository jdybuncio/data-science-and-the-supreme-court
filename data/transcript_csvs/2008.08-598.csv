2008.08-598,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.167,We will hear argument next in Bobby versus Bies.
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,6.481,24.473,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three separate lines of double jeopardy analysis lead independently to the conclusion that the Double Jeopardy Clause commits the Ohio postconviction court to hold a hearing to determine whether Mr. Bies is mentally retarded for purposes of Atkins."
2008.08-598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,98.07,106.924,"But they all agreed that he was mentally retarded, and that was a mitigator."
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,137.568,153.794,"The reason to do it again, Your Honor, is because the -- the standard set forth by the Ohio Supreme Court in Lott when it was implementing this Court's decision in Atkins contained three definitions -- three elements of the Atkins definition, of the definition of ""mental retardation""."
2008.08-598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,206.461,212.771,"I don't want to take you too far outside the record, and you can come back to it, but I -- I just have this question."
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,241.303,242.305,"No, it cannot."
2008.08-598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,242.305,243.646,Or must that be reopened?
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,243.646,246.271,"It can, Your Honor, for two reasons."
2008.08-598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.271,247.644,It can -- can be reopened?
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,247.644,248.49,It can be.
2008.08-598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,280.961,295.814,"But could the -- could the defendant argue the -- that -- the accused argue that at least as to the finding of the 65 IQ, that that is a given."
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,295.814,296.61,--And--
2008.08-598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,296.61,302.686,"And that that issue, i.e., the level of IQ, cannot be relitigated, the number?"
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,302.686,312.119,"--And the answer to that is no, Your Honor, for issue preclusive purposes, because the issue is completely different in the mitigation context from the post-Atkins context."
2008.08-598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,384.041,388.023,"Well, when you say 65 IQ?"
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,388.023,394.191,"--The -- the clinical judgment that I refer to, Your Honor, is that required by -- by Lott."
2008.08-598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,397.942,398.316,Okay.
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,422.166,426.226,"Because, Your Honor, I think there are two different meanings of ""necessary""."
2008.08-598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,434.426,441.765,"It wasn't necessary to reach that particular -- in other words, the determination of 65 was not necessary to reach the conclusion that they reached."
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,441.765,442.657,--Correct.
2008.08-598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,442.657,448.281,And you -- you are saying the very fact that it was not dispositive of the result means that it cannot be preclusive now?
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,448.281,449.545,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,449.545,449.982,Okay.
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,449.982,451.358,And -- and--
2008.08-598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,451.358,459.836,May I ask how it worked pre-Atkins when mental retardation was a mitigator?
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,502.801,511.064,--The -- the appellate courts engaged in a de novo record and new -- new evidence doesn't come into the record on direct review.
2008.08-598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,515.435,524.29,"So -- so that the prosecutor could still argue that was unreasonable for them to find mental retardation, so there shouldn't be that mitigator?"
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,524.29,535.725,"That's correct, Your Honor, but there wasn't at the time a -- a great deal of incentive to litigate that question because the Ohio Supreme Court had said that mental retardation only merited some weight in mitigation."
2008.08-598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,606.555,608.368,"May I interrupt right there, Mr. Mizer?"
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,626.189,638.621,"--I think, Your Honor, that it's fairest and the record that's easiest to go by is what the Ohio Supreme Court said, because the jury didn't make any specific remarks about mental retardation as a mitigator; the Ohio Supreme Court did."
2008.08-598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,663.234,683.384,"If they didn't make a finding on mental retardation, how -- how could the appellate court determine that it was a mitigator but overwhelmed by the aggravating -- what did the judge charge the jury about mitigators and aggravators?"
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,683.384,691.334,"--The judge charged the jury that -- first of all, Your Honor, the mitigating evidence introduced by Mr. Bies was not extensive."
2008.08-598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,730.333,731.475,First go back to the jury.
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,737.048,738.456,"--We don't, Your Honor."
2008.08-598,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.92,842.398,"I understand the argument that the issues are not quite the same, that the Atkins issue of mental retardation is not quite the same as the issue that was litigated."
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,892.361,902.625,"--The answer is that the State is not bound, for two reasons, the first relating to issue preclusion and the second relating to the double jeopardy doctrine in Ashe."
2008.08-598,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,920.353,922.958,I'm not -- I'm not going to go into double jeopardy.
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,944.514,955.585,"--No, Your Honor, because it is important to remember that this is -- this is a double jeopardy case because of Ashe, and because this is in Federal habeas."
2008.08-598,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1041.3,1043.409,Could I ask you about -- about exhaustion?
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1048.081,1054.063,"Your Honor, we're not contending that the Ashe claim is unexhausted."
2008.08-598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1101.73,1108.866,"Let -- let me just ask, does the State have any position now as to his IQ?"
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1108.866,1110.274,"No, Your Honor."
2008.08-598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.906,1136.217,Wasn't there some testimony that one test was only 50?
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1136.217,1145.931,"--That evidence is in the JA, and it was introduced after -- after the Ohio Supreme Court had issued the decision at issue in this case."
2008.08-598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1158.581,1166.938,Will the State -- would you say the State has an independent obligation to -- to ensure itself that he has an adequate IQ?
2008.08-598,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1166.938,1173.311,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, in order to be constitutionally consistent with -- with Atkins."
2008.08-598,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1180.009,1182.945,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1190.35,1201.671,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: Much of the discussion so far has focused on issues which did not form the basis of the panel's decision."
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1250.138,1255.195,"But even -- even if that's so, that's not necessarily an -- an Atkins finding, isn't that correct?"
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1255.195,1256.992,"No, I think it is."
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1257.913,1261.57,Atkin -- Atkin -- we didn't determine what the definition of retardation was.
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1286.872,1292.01,And the Ohio Supreme Court acting years before Atkins.
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1292.01,1293.979,--Pardon me?
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1293.979,1300.366,The -- wasn't the Ohio Supreme Court decision in this case pre-Atkins?
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1300.366,1301.708,"Yes, it was."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1302.145,1314.83,"And it was dealing with retardation as a mitigator, not retardation as conclusive that there can be no death penalty."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1314.83,1330.105,"--That's true, but the -- the important point, I think, that formed the basis of the Sixth Circuit opinion was that in Lott versus -- which is the Ohio decision post-Atkins, in Lott they said we're embracing the clinical definition of mental retardation."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1330.105,1340.489,"But before you get to whether -- anything like that, you are urging issue preclusion against the winner."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1382.739,1391.331,"Well, clearly that is the more typical procedural context, and it happens normally in the criminal context of someone that's been acquitted."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1433.937,1455.24,"But the question is what is the issue, and an intermediate finding, say mitigation, on the way to the ultimate conclusion, life or death, is not the same issue as if retardation is found, no death penalty."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1482.638,1493.585,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that minimizes or does not give adequate significance to what the Ohio Supreme Court describes as its role in -- on the appellate review."
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1538.72,1544.499,"In -- in response to Justice Ginsburg's question, I don't see why it makes any difference which court is doing what."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1587.405,1592.405,"Well, on the first point, I didn't mean that it necessarily matters which court it did."
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1615.661,1630.92,"If -- if the Ohio court had found, the court of first instance had found, that the IQ was at some different level, it could have come out exactly the same way it came out in this case, couldn't it?"
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1630.92,1631.887,"--Yes, it could have."
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1631.887,1635.058,So the finding was not necessary to the result?
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1635.058,1636.138,Well--
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1636.138,1662.186,"I mean, we went through this with your brother, and he pointed out, yes, it was necessary to -- to consider the issue and to make some kind of a finding -- I don't know how precise it had to be -- but the finding that it made, the -- the actual number that was used or the characterization that was used to describe that number was not necessary in order, in fact, to impose the death penalty."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1662.186,1662.736,"--Well, I--"
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1662.736,1670.793,And -- and the sense of necessity which is used normally in -- in this kind of preclusion analysis just doesn't apply here.
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1670.793,1674.401,"--Well, that is not my reading of the necessary cases."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1682.773,1708.512,"How do you say you have -- you don't find that in the cases when you said to me, and I think frankly you were right, that issue preclusion -- and there are many, many cases on issue preclusion -- is something that a judgment winner uses, not a judgment loser, and here the Ohio -- yes, they weighed and they found retardation, but they also found overwhelmed by the aggravating circumstances."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1737.19,1742.672,"--Well, I mean -- again, that is not my understanding of the role the necessary clause plays."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1754.574,1756.976,But Ashe is about somebody who was acquitted.
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1759.632,1760.665,--I understand.
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1760.665,1762.895,"It didn't say anything about, well, suppose he didn't win."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1762.895,1770.301,But the Ashe rule is stated in terms of when an issue of fact has been determined in a defendant's favor it's binding in any subsequent litigation.
2008.08-598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1806.784,1809.674,It's not reopen -- it's -- it's the same problem.
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1861.529,1862.497,--Well--
2008.08-598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1862.497,1866.544,--that didn't proceed on the theory I've just announced or just said.
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1866.544,1872.76,"--Well, I -- I mean, I can't give you a case exactly like that, but, again, I think the procedure--"
2008.08-598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.76,1874.585,"No, I want a case even vaguely like that."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1875.587,1883.581,--I think what you have are the cases -- you had the cases which essentially are the legal equivalent of insufficient evidence on appeal.
2008.08-598,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1897.125,1902.668,How far -- how far down do you go on applying the issue preclusion?
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1912.258,1913.604,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-598,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1938.248,1940.276,"Well, that's narrowing it to your particular context."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1965.05,1974.529,"--Well, it's a theory of collateral estoppel which is based in the Double Jeopardy Clause, which is what -- the issue on which the panel resolved this question."
2008.08-598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2011.095,2013.794,"Your argument, then -- we're getting somewhere maybe."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2013.794,2014.64,--Pardon me?
2008.08-598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.64,2034.395,"You're saying to me, think of Jackson and Denno, If you're in a collateral proceeding and the Federal judge said there wasn't enough evidence to convict him under the Constitution, like the Shuffling Sam case, there isn't enough evidence; it isn't that he gets a new trial."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2044.268,2044.892,That's correct.
2008.08-598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2044.892,2045.469,All right.
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2067.743,2069.147,That's more or less the argument.
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2069.834,2074.442,"But if that is the argument, then what is being preclusive here is not the first judgment."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2104.914,2119.704,"--Well, it is the combination of the determination that Mr. Bies is a person with mental retardation using the same definition according to the panel, which is now in effect in the State of Ohio, which would apply in a Lott proceeding if he were to have it tomorrow."
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2119.704,2122.157,"Sure, but you're coming up with a brand new rule."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2128.857,2135.31,"Well, it is the combination of that factual determination with the subsequent rule, a retroactive new rule."
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2141.37,2165.562,"No, but what your rule is, as I understand it in your response to Justice Breyer's question, is if there was a subsidiary fact determination in the first case, even though it was entirely consistent with the judgment against your client, that's subsidiary fact determination can be used as a defense by your client in the second case."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2172.465,2185.208,--It could be used if there is a later legal ruling which means the significance of that fact would either absolve the criminal defendant of liability or make him ineligible for death.
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2185.208,2189.427,"Well, you -- do you agree with me that you're asking for a brand-new rule here?"
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2189.427,2191.221,I don't think it is a brand-new rule.
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2191.221,2193.221,"We have never held this, and I don't know of any court that's ever held this."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2193.221,2195.736,But I think the reason you haven't isn't--
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2195.736,2197.004,"Well, why isn't it brand new?"
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2197.004,2200.985,--It's because of the unique procedural posture of this case.
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2200.985,2205.482,"Well, maybe the unique procedural posture is precisely the reason that the rule is brand new."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2207.966,2208.621,But--
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2208.621,2222.522,"We have the factor that you would preclude Ohio from doing, when we expressly said that here is the rule: You can't execute the mentally retarded."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2282.076,2288.058,"--Well, I don't think that's a fair determination of what the panel did in this case."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2319.89,2325.7,"But the incentive is vastly different, which is an important factor in issue preclusion."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2373.352,2392.877,"--Well, I don't think, Justice Ginsburg, the incentives have to be identical, but certainly prior to Atkins the prosecution had the incentive to contest the mental retardation question, and in fact in this case the failure to more adequately contest it wasn't due to a lack of incentives, it was due to a lack of evidence."
2008.08-598,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2399.187,2403.87,"Well, this strikes me as the sort of case where their incentives might well be different, as Justice Ginsburg suggested."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2419.678,2423.145,"Well, I think for three reasons, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2496.912,2509.563,"Did they admit that as a finding of fact, or did they say that mental retardation had been found as a mitigator by the Ohio Supreme Court?"
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2509.563,2515.263,"No, they said the record reveals Mr. Bies to be a person with mental retardation, with an IQ of 69."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2524.883,2526.821,It was an admission; it couldn't have been a finding of fact.
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2540.361,2550.686,--It is in the Joint Appendix at 153.
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2572.925,2581.501,"You told me that this -- that State conceded that the defendant was mentally retarded, and I'm -- that's what I asked you."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2581.501,2592.934,"I'm sorry, that is both at JA 143 where -- JA 143 in the State's motion, response for judgment:"
2008.08-598,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2604.554,2611.097,What does that have to do with issue preclusion?
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2620.531,2628.763,"I think it primarily does raise a question of judicial estoppel, which we raised, which is -- and that is not a technical basis on which to grant habeas."
2008.08-598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2653.925,2683.554,"But I'm not sure that there's even anything -- I mean, it does raise a judicial estoppel issue, but I'm not sure there is a -- a record hereupon which a -- a judicial estoppel claim could be maintained, because in the passages that you referred us to, first the State's concession and secondly the finding which -- which followed from it, it was a reference to mild mental retardation and a specific reference to an IQ of 69."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2707.996,2716.15,The very next sentence is as a matter of law -- the law as it was then -- such a person may be punished by execution.
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2721.258,2723.193,"Well, not in regard to this particular claim."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2734.891,2739.765,"But that must have been, the page you called my attention to must have been pre-Atkins."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2739.765,2742.842,"--It was pre-Atkins, but the claim was a pre-Atkins Atkins claim."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2751.714,2756.6,"No, no, we're back -- what you called my attention to was pre-Atkins."
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2793.79,2795.334,"Well, that was the claim."
2008.08-598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2809.61,2811.388,"Since Atkins, we're talking about--"
2008.08-598,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2811.388,2812.796,"I'm sorry, since Penry."
2008.08-598,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2866.288,2867.599,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-598,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,2872.598,2900.352,"First, with respect to the judicial estoppel arguments and the State's purported concessions, as Justice Ginsburg noted, the statement to which Mr. Bies points was pre-Atkins, and Mr. Bies's argument ignores that Atkins changed things in two ways: one consequential, by enacting, by placing a categorical bar on the States; and the second, definitional."
2008.08-598,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2980.023,2982.554,"Mr. Mizer, can I just get one clarifying question?"
2008.08-598,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3010.841,3017.992,"No, Your Honor, the -- this statement will be beside the point, and the question now post-Atkins--"
2008.08-598,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3017.992,3021.319,So you'll offer evidence to show that statement is inaccurate?
2008.08-598,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3021.319,3031.285,"--The -- the question is, the question posed in Atkins doesn't hinge so narrowly on IQ."
2008.08-598,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.562,3039.514,I understand that.
2008.08-598,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3062.177,3080.84,"Yes, Your Honor, as the State postconviction court stated in this case, that -- the record evidence pertaining to IQ is not clear; and so IQ, among all of the other elements of the mental retardation, will be up for determination."
2008.08-598,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3084.872,3085.34,"Thank you, counsel."
