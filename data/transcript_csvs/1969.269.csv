1969.269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.317,"Under for our argument today is number 269, Price against the State of Georgia."
1969.269,0,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,37.909,43.972,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1969.269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,108.184,109.813,In your own way Mr. Wallace.
1969.269,0,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,109.813,112.853,Thank you sir.
1969.269,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,314.058,315.837,Could I ask you question?
1969.269,0,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,315.837,316.075,Yes.
1969.269,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,316.075,326.392,(Inaudible) Court again for overruling your motion for being barred which took on?
1969.269,0,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,326.392,340.119,"I believe if Your Honor please, the appendix will show that no reason was given except that the motion was denied if my memory serves me correct, that's correct."
1969.269,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,340.119,341.355,You don't know the --
1969.269,0,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,341.355,345.291,That's correct.
1969.269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,346.031,358.058,Was your position Mr. Wallace that the second trial he could be charged and tried only under the charge of voluntary manslaughter?
1969.269,0,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,358.058,358.522,"Yes, that's correct."
1969.269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,358.522,359.52,Nothing more?
1969.269,0,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,359.52,360.968,Yes.
1969.269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,360.968,363.53,Did you cite Green against the United States?
1969.269,0,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,363.53,385.596,"I certainly did, yes, and I think the appendix will show that and not only Mr. Chief Justice did I cite the Green case, but there was a case out of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and I believe Justice Marshall wrote that opinion when he was on that bench."
1969.269,2,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,414.237,414.903,Yes.
1969.269,4,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,422.341,430.815,"Under Georgia law, I believe that is correct sir and that was what I insisted that a new indictment be brought."
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,443.464,448.525,"I believe he could, yes, that's my humble opinion."
1969.269,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,448.525,457.385,Why were you so much concerned about whether he was reindicted or whether was tried on any charge higher than voluntary manslaughter?
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,457.385,463.958,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I felt that to try him again would be double jeopardy."
1969.269,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,469.567,483.374,"Well, whatever he's thinking of it is if there's a practical matter in the second trial, the district -- the trial judge had ruled that he would submit no charges to the jury higher than voluntary manslaughter, would that have satisfied your situation?"
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,483.374,484.94,Yes sir.
1969.269,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,484.94,486.183,Could he have done that under Georgia law?
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,486.183,489.402,"Yes sir, under Georgia law, yes sir."
1969.269,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,672.006,680.804,What was his -- what is the injury your man has suffered in this case?
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,680.804,695.628,"Well, Mr. Justice Black, I feel that the injury was -- you got me a little ahead of my thought, I was going to bring that out but if you give me just a second --"
1969.269,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,695.628,700.344,Now you wait -- just wait?
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,700.344,740.929,"I feel that the -- the injury is that if the jury had been given the opportunity to decide the question of whether or not he was guilty of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder, they would have given and I believe, I may not be stating that as it was said in the case of Justice Marshall wrote the opinion on and the Green case but I feel that they would have considered his innocence, probably given more thought, a more consideration to his innocence rather than to -- considering his conviction if he had been tried for manslaughter because he was tried the second time for murder."
1969.269,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,743.578,747.954,"Yeah, you probably answered to my brother's ability can be answered."
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,747.954,748.766,Yes sir.
1969.269,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,748.766,751.175,I not only say is not a good answer.
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,751.175,752.332,Yes.
1969.269,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,752.332,766.063,"Mr. Wallace, if he had been indicted the second time for voluntary manslaughter, under Georgia law, what other offenses are lesser included offenses under that charge?"
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,766.063,784.884,"I believe the Court under this statute would have -- could have â€“ they could have found as if a misdemeanor and given him possibly a sentence of one year maximum, a thousand dollar fine plus six months in jail, I believe that's maximum on misdemeanor --"
1969.269,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,784.884,788.503,"But the worst, there's -- there was -- are lesser included offenses under Georgia law?"
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,788.503,788.997,Sir?
1969.269,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,788.997,789.816,There are lesser --
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,789.816,789.933,"Yes but, yes, --"
1969.269,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,789.933,790.548,-- included offenses?
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,790.548,791.566,Yes.
1969.269,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,791.566,799.579,And your position is that faced with that the jury might have found them one of those lesser included offenses if the --
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,799.579,800.226,That's correct.
1969.269,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,800.226,802.278,-- murder indictment were not hanging over?
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,802.278,803.607,That's correct sir.
1969.269,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,867.227,870.005,Thank you Mr. Wallace.
1969.269,6,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,870.005,870.864,Thank you sir.
1969.269,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,870.864,874.573,Mr. Robins.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,874.573,878.131,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,947.846,975.21,"Do you think its possible to argue that now under the law of the District of Columbia there might be prior -- an acquittal on the first degree of murder under these circumstances of a general jury verdict of manslaughter, still the law of your jurisdiction is different and that of jury verdict of manslaughter after a trial on an indictment of murder is not under the law of your jurisdiction --"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,975.21,975.621,I'm going to say -- I am suggest --
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,975.621,977.502,-- but it's not little as first degree murder?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,977.502,977.708,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1032.04,1033.428,"Well, they were here though, weren't they?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1033.428,1037.108,"Yes sir, they were in this particular case but I emphasize the point that there is discretion."
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1037.108,1039.714,What lesser crimes were they charged off?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1039.714,1040.928,In this case?
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1042.569,1046.69,In all?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1046.69,1047.589,I'm not certain Your Honor.
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1070.672,1077.768,"Under Georgia law, does the jury fix the penalty in every case or is it just an option to the jury?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1077.768,1081.277,"Well, it's a strange relationship, if Your Honor please."
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1229.133,1234.955,"As I understand it general Robins, you're conceding in this aspect of your argument?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1249.107,1251.044,"With that trial today, yes sir."
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1251.717,1253.654,You are disputing that at least for purposes of argument --
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1253.654,1253.848,"Yes sir, I --"
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1253.848,1255.205,In this aspect of your argument.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1267.561,1267.734,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1267.734,1269.27,-- and no constitutional error --
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1269.27,1269.419,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1269.419,1270.217,Is that your point?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1270.217,1278.698,"Yes sir, that is my point in so far as applicability of the Benton and the Green rule made that comes under that."
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1280.289,1282.933,This is quite a case quite unlike Green because in Green --
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1282.933,1283.186,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1283.186,1287.626,He was tried again and that time convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1287.626,1287.936,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1288.202,1290.347,And that this therefore is quite different case?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1290.347,1291.431,This is quite a bit different.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1345.148,1352.907,Has he been given full credit in his -- in serving of his second sentence for the time he served and as result of the first conviction?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1352.907,1355.624,"Sir, no Your Honor, he did not serve anytime after --"
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1355.624,1356.17,None at all?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1356.17,1357.776,None at all to my understanding.
1969.269,7,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.776,1359.281,Has he yet?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1359.281,1366.243,He is serving now I believe Mr. Justice White but he did not serve anytime after the first sentence.
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1380.493,1393.515,"Now, General Robins, the language the constitution prohibition is against being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense."
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1413.597,1413.977,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1519.802,1520.555,Mr. Robins.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1520.555,1520.668,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1520.668,1528.363,Can we take any consideration to sentence when the constitution says he shall not be tried.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1532.171,1543.489,I believe Your Honor that this Court could take it under consideration in the -- under the proposition of harmless error whether or not a --
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1543.489,1549.296,Is there any provision of the Constitution that you couldn't excuse under harmless error?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1549.296,1551.587,"Well sir, yes sir."
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1564.823,1568.374,It didn't say double jeopardy?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1568.374,1571.381,I don't believe -- I don't remember that it did sir.
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1571.381,1581.088,"Well, isn't the whole argument about Double Jeopardy is that you should make the man be exposed to it the second time?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1581.088,1585.884,That is the -- yes sir that is the contention of this Court.
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1585.884,1596.661,And then the error in this case you admit was at the beginning of the trial and the trial should not admit him?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1596.661,1596.844,Under --
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1596.844,1597.59,Is that true?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1597.59,1600.238,"Under the law today, I would have to admit that that --"
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1600.238,1605.525,"And despite that fact, you can try in harmless error?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1605.525,1614.271,"Yes sir, because I submit to the Court that that error if it were in fact error did not go to a substantial right of this man."
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1617.52,1623.244,His right was not to be twice charged with the same crime?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1623.244,1623.892,But so were the --
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1623.892,1633.455,"Once he was put to trial on that, is it not true that the constitution was violated as of that moment?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1633.455,1645.523,"Yes sir it is true, but so were the rights of all the defendants for instance that come -- that came before the Miranda decision, that came before the Gideon decision."
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1659.715,1661.267,We're talking about harmless error?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1661.267,1666.933,Yes sir and I'm saying that this is not such a substantial right that he has been harmed.
1969.269,7,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1666.933,1691.57,"You don't think the prolonged trial with the possibility he can be electrocuted is not a right that entitled to the full protection of this Court, just the right not to be charged with it, certainly not to be tried with that hanging over your ear?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1691.57,1700.294,"That is and I have admitted and I admit now that would seem to be the rule where that case decided today, but I'm saying there are other elements."
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1700.294,1713.067,"Supposing you -- supposing you lose this case, can you reindict this man for manslaughter?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1713.067,1716.401,I don't see any reason -- I do not know Your Honor.
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1718.344,1722.116,"If you reindicted him, there wouldn't be any double jeopardy problem?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1722.116,1727.241,"No sir, this would be the standard that you may retry a man for conviction set aside."
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1727.241,1735.206,"Well, what I'm asking you now, supposing you lose this case, can you reindict him now for manslaughter and try him again?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1735.206,1737.052,"I would believe so, yes sir."
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1737.052,1739.582,"Well, is there -- that's what I asked you."
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1745.742,1748.855,"Your Honor, I have not considered that, I don't know."
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1748.855,1757.721,"Well, it seems to me that's the essence of your -- and that's the essence of your -- of your harmless error point?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1757.721,1758.061,"Well, --"
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1758.061,1771.388,If you can try him again now even though he has been put in jeopardy as Justice Marshall says you can try him again for the manslaughter charge and give him a sentence.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1776.399,1777.503,It might be --
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1777.503,1778.931,-- your harmless error claim?
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1778.931,1780.78,It would be better to differ Mr. Wallace --
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1780.78,1782.191,Isn't that your harmless error claim yet?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1782.191,1788.552,"I have not considered that but however, that is a point that I wish I had considered and presented to the Court."
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1790.426,1792.69,You can tell me whether the -- whether the --
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1792.69,1793.689,Statute of limitation --
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1793.689,1794.887,--statute is run?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1794.887,1795.637,No sir I'm sorry.
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1795.637,1798.59,Are your witnesses still available?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1798.59,1799.952,I do not know that sir.
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1799.952,1800.033,Oh!
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1800.033,1801.089,Of course we have taken this case --
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1801.089,1808.621,"As far as I'm concerned, I wish you'd let the Court know whether the statute is run on this manslaughter charge."
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1808.621,1813.152,"Well, he was tried the second time -- I do not know Your Honor."
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1814.752,1815.903,"Well, won't you let us know?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1815.903,1817.308,"Yes sir, certainly."
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1817.308,1834.861,"When you address yourself to that question, will you also indicate whether there are any legal barriers to being tried under the existing indictment provided the Court does not submit any charge higher than voluntary manslaughter to the jury?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1853.3,1855.51,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1971.103,1974.132,How about the Ashe against Swenson?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1974.132,1976.061,"Well, I've studied --"
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1976.061,1977.811,And Pearce against North Carolina?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,1977.811,1980.512,"Well, in Pearce if Your Honor please."
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2060.436,2069.985,But in the two cases you said where you had -- why since Green said that the double jeopardy provision does not apply to this case?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2069.985,2090.58,"Particularly one -- one Your Honor was Barktus versus Illinois which was in the late 50s, 1959, the earlier one was Hoag versus New Jersey, though that's not a holding of the Court, it is dictum, that's a 1958 decision."
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2091.286,2093.726,"In the Barktus case, there was a -- Where is it?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2093.726,2095.237,Barktus versus Illinois.
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2095.237,2096.569,What page of the USC --
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2096.569,2101.242,"Oh I'm sorry Your Honor, I don't have the citation in front of me."
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2114.641,2115.808,How do you spell that?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2115.808,2121.591,C I C H O S.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2121.591,2125.447,359 US 121.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2125.447,2128.636,So we have here them --
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2128.636,2132.861,Were you going to say something about the -- would you whether Ashe --
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2132.861,2133.283,Oh.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2133.283,2134.294,-- dealt with this question?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2134.294,2136.024,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2171.464,2178.307,"The opinion by footnote or otherwise, didn't it not say something explicit in the question of retroactivity?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2178.307,2181.043,"Yes sir, it is quite explicit, it is."
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2181.043,2182.036,How did it lead?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2182.036,2195.62,"There can be no doubt of the retroactivity of the Court's decision in Benton versus Maryland, and North Carolina versus Pearce decided the same day as Benton, the Court unanimously accorded fully retroactive effect to the Benton doctrine."
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2198.097,2201.077,"Are you aware of the word there is fully, is it?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2202.014,2202.374,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2231.894,2242.896,"Difficulty is I think that General Robins as my brother Brennan has implied in his question, Ashe could not have been decided the way it was."
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2252.853,2254.217,Yes sir that is correct but --
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2254.217,2255.198,So how did the -- how did they cross --
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2255.198,2255.551,-- however --
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2255.551,2257.51,-- that bridge for better or for worse.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2257.51,2258.978,That's a difficult bridge to cross Your Honor.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2258.978,2263.997,So haven't we done it difficult or not?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2263.997,2269.582,"Well, it's hard for me to see how this Court has done it and I've tried to study the opinion."
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2311.61,2320.653,"Well, that involves the Fourth Amendment where the test is whether or not there's the searching officers act to after the brief --"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2320.653,2320.902,It's a -- yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.902,2339.162,"And part of reason is relying on the existing on the Court decision of that but haven't we as I say rightly or wrongly, for better or for worse haven't -- hasn't the Court whether to approve or not and hasn't the Court crossed that bridge."
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2341.722,2342.136,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2342.136,2350.14,How could Ashe possibly have been decided the way it was without holding the doctrine of Benton against Maryland retroactive?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2350.783,2350.854,"Well, --"
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2350.854,2352.964,-- remember on collateral --
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2352.964,2353.384,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2353.384,2355.687,On the collateral proceedings and federal habeas corpus?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2355.687,2357.565,This Court has crossed that bridge.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2359.698,2361.143,"To cross, to go back to --"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2361.143,2361.552,-- to consider it in --
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2361.552,2362.109,-- cross the line now?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2362.109,2371.029,--a different perspective than it had because of the departure from its earlier decisions in determining retroactivity.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2389.986,2396.655,Every state has -- has guarantee against double jeopardy usually in the state constitution.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2396.655,2396.987,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2396.987,2409.724,"I think one or two or three by either statute or Court decision and while they're not exactly coincidental with the guarantee as the federal constitution, they're so close that the disruption of state procedures would be minimal, wouldn't it?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2409.724,2410.256,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2411.346,2411.82,Yes.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2411.82,2417.346,About 18 or 20 of the states do in fact provide for the retrial under higher charge.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2417.346,2417.67,Right.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2417.67,2421.126,And Georgia of Course is one of those and that's why we have this problem then.
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2421.126,2433.093,But aren't there quite a few states that have either by statute or a Court decision said that where you find a guilty plea of a lesser offense is actually an acquittal of the other?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2433.093,2434.201,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2434.201,2435.06,The majority of the state?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2435.06,2435.602,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2442.977,2447.212,So if Georgia could have done it in this case?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2447.212,2448.946,"Well, yes sir but I --"
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2448.946,2450.117,In this case?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2450.117,2464.586,"Yes sir Your Honor but please remember that this Court in an identical factual situation in Brantley versus Georgia, a 1910 case said it didn't violate the constitution of the United States and an identical factual situation."
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2464.586,2471.068,Am I to understand that Benton was argued to the Court in Georgia?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2471.068,2475.035,"No -- well, the proposition of double jeopardy --"
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2475.035,2476.579,Benton itself?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2476.579,2481.136,"No Your Honor, the case before the Court now was before the Benton decision."
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2481.136,2481.864,But where did --
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2481.864,2483.199,Brantley was argued.
1969.269,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2483.199,2483.912,Brantley?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2485.648,2518.562,"So I'm saying that the State of Georgia and the other states too have had a determination by this Court at least since 1910 and certainly since 1930 whatever it was in the Palko decision that the Fifth Amendment was not applicable to the states, and even more recently since 1959 in Barktus and 1966 in Cichos and all of a sudden now the states have going to have to go back and retry these people and this will be a terrible burden on the states because some of these people have been in jail for quite a long time."
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.075,2534.718,"As I understand it, Georgia under 4208 Georgia that that at the first trial he was not in fact acquitted of murder, is that correct?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2534.718,2537.759,"As a matter of fact he was not, he was silent on the fact that --"
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2537.759,2540.451,"That is the law in Georgia, that he was not acquitted?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2540.451,2541.12,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2541.12,2547.548,"Unlike the law as in the district of Columbia as construed by this Court in Green, is that you point so that --"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2547.548,2549.448,"No, Green -- Green wasn't implied."
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2556.656,2557.071,Yes I understand.
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2557.071,2560.216,But this Court has determined that that wasn't implied acquittal.
1969.269,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2560.216,2561.03,In the District of Columbia?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2561.03,2562.342,In the District of Columbia.
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2601.74,2626.03,"General Robins, the Courts -- the Court is not unmindful of the burdens that these things can impose on the state sometimes but when you consider the language of the constitution, is it that he shall not twice be placed in jeopardy, that must mean he shall not twice be put at the risk of this conviction, is that not what it must mean?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2626.03,2626.311,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2635.007,2649.795,"Well, then let's put ourselves back in the posture that he was at the end of the first trial and the verdict and it was relatively a much less sentence than he might have gotten?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2649.795,2650.48,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2650.48,2665.58,"Now then he's put by the State of Georgia at risk again and the risk is not the risk of being found guilty of an offense that would give him 10 to 15 years but he is again put at risk of the death sentence, isn't he?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2665.58,2666.083,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2666.083,2674.266,At least he thinks so even if his lawyers may tell him about the Green case and about the Benton case and the other cases?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2674.266,2674.428,And the --
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2674.428,2684.765,"Now, isn't that kind of a -- isn't that kind of an apprehension, the fear, the risk, the kind of thing that's embraced in the term jeopardy under one thing?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2684.765,2692.494,"Yes sir, and at that time the Court should have probably passed upon a proper motion raising double jeopardy."
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2693.034,2694.743,But the Court didn't and that's why we're here?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2694.743,2712.657,"That's right, yes sir, but I say all this was vitiated when the jury rejected that apprehension that he was placed under, and said do not concern yourself with that, you are being convicted of voluntary manslaughter and we are sorry for the apprehension but you have not been convicted of that murder charge."
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2712.657,2719.972,"But in the meantime, he and if he has a family were subject to that apprehension, not fear but jeopardy, were they not?"
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2719.972,2720.589,Yes sir.
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2722.247,2723.646,You can't turn the clock back on then?
1969.269,7,36515,mathew_robins,,2723.646,2727.375,"No sir, I cannot do that."
1969.269,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2728.424,2728.847,Thank you.
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,2729.49,2732.692,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2849.711,2851.005,May I ask you this question?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,2851.005,2851.476,Yes.
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2851.476,2855.295,"When you talk of the term the congress there, let me put in terms of remedies."
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,2869.307,2884.782,"If Your Honor pleases, if I understand the law correctly of Georgia, the remitted duo has never gone down from the Supreme Court of Georgia or the Court of Appeals of Georgia to the Trial Court and is still in the presence of Supreme Court of Georgia opinion the outcome of this case here in this honorable body."
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2884.782,2885.399,What should our --
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,2885.399,2887.809,"Now, they can be -- he can be reindicted."
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2887.809,2888.379,He what?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,2888.379,2890.385,He can be reindicted for manslaughter.
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2890.385,2892.583,Should our mandate prevented him from that?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,2892.583,2893.797,"No sir, I can't see that."
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2893.797,2895.533,Shouldn't do that too.
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,2895.533,2897.153,"I don't think so, no."
1969.269,8,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2918.282,2929.375,Would it be appropriate in your judgment and I want you to consider this question before you answer because perhaps you wouldn't want to answer it today.
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,2951.193,2961.878,"If I may go outside of the record if Your Honor pleases, that issue came up in the argument in the Court when I argued the plea of double jeopardy."
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2985.793,2986.821,Mr. Wallace.
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,2986.821,2986.881,Yes.
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2986.881,2990.27,"Under the laws of Georgia, can you proceed by information?"
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,2990.27,2990.838,Yes.
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2990.838,2992.769,Rather than indictment?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,2992.769,2996.141,"No, no, not in a felony, no sir, no sir cannot."
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2999.778,3003.482,What's the minimum sentence for manslaughter?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3003.482,3006.124,One to 20 years I believe.
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3006.124,3007.634,And he got how many?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3007.634,3008.895,10 to 15.
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3008.895,3010.474,The last time?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3010.474,3014.984,"The last time 10 sir, the first time 10 to 15."
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3014.984,3017.735,And nowadays the jury has to fix the -- or fix his --
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3017.735,3018.67,"Trick the jury at that time, yes sir."
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3018.67,3020.122,-- that and number of year?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3020.122,3021.731,The jury fixed the sentence.
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.731,3025.024,"No longer can the jury say 10 to 15 as I understand it, is that correct?"
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3025.024,3034.815,They can come in with a recommendation if it's -- if it's up without recommendation then the Court has no other alternative but to inflict the death penalty.
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3034.815,3035.989,Not for manslaughter?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3035.989,3036.755,Not for manslaughter --
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3036.755,3036.865,No.
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3036.865,3038.495,"-- if they fix it, jury fixes it."
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3038.495,3039.866,And what if the jury --
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3039.866,3042.704,The jury is charged from black years to black years.
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3042.704,3043.006,Right.
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3043.006,3045.977,"What makes a minimum of a year, maximum of 10 years -- 20 years?"
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3045.977,3053.189,But must may the jury come in and say we find him guilty and we recommend a sentence from one to 20 years?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3053.189,3055.496,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3055.496,3057.189,They did it the first trial from 10 to 15 years?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3057.189,3058.69,"One to 10 to 15, yes."
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3058.69,3059.892,Second trial they fixed it at 10 years?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3059.892,3061.007,That 10 years.
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3061.007,3071.347,"I had understood in the course of oral argument here that the law was changed in the interim and that a jury must now fix it a definite number of years, perhaps I misunderstood, did I?"
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3071.347,3072.173,Yes.
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3072.173,3073.194,I misunderstood that?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3073.194,3074.943,"I think you do, yes."
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3074.943,3079.763,But in the second case in any event the jury did fix a definite number of year --
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3079.763,3080.261,They did sir.
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3080.261,3082.039,In the first conviction they did not?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3082.039,3084.669,That's -- except within a minimum of 10 to 15 years.
1969.269,8,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3084.669,3087.408,10 to 15.
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3087.408,3092.657,"Now, to the question of retroactivity."
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3262.878,3263.954,Will you commit them on --
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3263.954,3265.334,Sir?
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3265.334,3280.334,Would you have state again what you considered to be harm that he has suffered being tried on this indictment instead of one simply for manslaughter?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3280.334,3296.8,"Mr. Justice Black, I feel that had he not been tried for murder the second time as was I believe you wrote a dissenting opinion in the Cichos case and this is your language sir."
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3348.248,3349.367,What's the counties here?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3349.367,3353.322,"Effingham county Springfield Georgia, and I feel that --"
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3353.322,3355.249,"And where is it, below Savannah?"
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3355.249,3360.612,"Its about 30 miles out of Savannah, on highway 21."
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3379.455,3395.726,"The substance you were saying and where there was a top match to which present can be affirmed, those on then that a jury might have some inclinations to compromise rather --"
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3395.726,3405.794,"Yes, it might even acquitted him and this case is -- well, I can't go outside and recommend."
1969.269,8,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3406.235,3410.093,The record doesn't show us much about what kind of case it was?
1969.269,8,17225,allyn_m_wallace,,3410.093,3419.848,"Well, that's true and as I mentioned a moment ago, I personally paid for that record, I'm without Pearce."
1969.269,8,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3672.572,3676.095,"Thank you Mr. Wallace, thank you for your submission."
