1998.98-377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.357,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-377, Q. Todd Dickinson v. Mary Zurko."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,61.513,65.075,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,133.41,139.725,"Can I interrupt you, Mr. Wallace, and I know you don't care for that very much, but let me do it anyway."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,200.853,203.275,One does not preclude the other.
1998.98-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.241,218.485,"Well, why aren't you arguing that it's required under the statute?"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,222.118,237.178,"--(E)... we think (E) comes in because under the patent code, the court of appeals is reviewing these determinations of the Board on the record before the Board."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,267.677,268.378,--That doesn't mean--
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,268.378,271.52,"The Board proceedings are provided for in the patent code, and--"
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,271.52,276.713,"--Mr. Wallace, I thought the distinction was, indeed, I wrote a law review article on this--"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,337.335,338.605,--I agree entirely--
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,338.605,339.146,Thank you.
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,339.146,340.646,--and I wish I could've put it as well--
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,340.646,341.477,"Well, good, if you agree, fine--"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,341.477,343.199,--and I'd amend my answer to Justice O'Connor.
1998.98-377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,343.199,353.074,"--If you agree, then we come back to the question that was asked about whether or not the proceeding before the Patent Office is a proceeding on a record."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,412.193,422.521,"Well, the... there is a record compiled based on what the applicant and the examiner submit to the board."
1998.98-377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,438.06,446.947,"Do they keep that... does the stenographer's thing all kept and nobody can... there's like a... like a district court record, is that what it looks like?"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,446.947,450.478,"Well, there isn't always an oral hearing."
1998.98-377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,460.546,469.802,"But when they do have oral proceedings, when somebody goes in and talks to that examiner, is there a stenographer present, or the equivalent thereof, that keeps this record which is then official?"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,469.802,475.856,"--I... I could not say, Justice Breyer."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,489.083,490.235,It says on the record before the Patent--
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,490.235,498.22,--has to be on the record and the preceding section says that the commissioner is required to transmit the record.
1998.98-377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,533.232,540.357,"--You're going to sweep all... you'll sweep in informal rulemaking in general, then, and you'll suddenly have the substantial evidence standard applying to... to--"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,540.357,541.387,"--Well, this is not rulemaking."
1998.98-377,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,541.387,542.429,--550... I understand that.
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,555.318,557.759,"Well, I... we would not go that far."
1998.98-377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,569.987,570.558,"--Well, Mr.--"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,592.341,596.514,"Well, I think for purposes of the present case it does not."
1998.98-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,597.785,606.36,"Well, if we'll... if we get over that hurdle and can conclude it doesn't matter, would you enlighten us on one other thing."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,615.057,616.116,"--Well, they--"
1998.98-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,616.116,623.082,"And I always thought maybe that was a... a standard that was more generous, really, to the agency finding."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,634.769,635.22,--That--
1998.98-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.22,636.27,--explain that to me?
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,636.27,649.308,"--that has been the reaction of a number of lawyers not familiar with this long-standing controversy that... they... when I tell them what the issue is in this case... or at least they want to know, well, which is the more deferential--"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,649.308,649.829,Yeah.
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,649.829,650.25,--standard.
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,650.25,650.62,Right.
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,650.62,711.8,"What counts for purposes of this case, since this is a determination of what... of how review should proceed in the Federal circuit, is the understanding of the Federal circuit about the difference between the two standards and why they're choosing one standard rather than the other, and they explain that, I think quite candidly, in the en banc opinion that they were insisting on what we would term a more intrusive, less deferential standard where they can proceed on their own reasoning rather than in compliance with the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act, which would require them to determine the case not on the basis of their own interpretation of the record transmitted to them, but on the basis of whether the board's reasoning was justifiable as not arbitrary or capricious--"
1998.98-377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,711.8,724.299,"Well, if you'd... if you'd take our opinion in U.S. Gypsum, which was many, many years ago, but there the Court said, I think, that clearly erroneous gives the court more latitude than enough evidence to go to the jury."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,732.844,744.962,"--That... I think that is precisely the concept of the en banc court, that they have more leeway to make their own determinations that otherwise they would--"
1998.98-377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,744.962,759.422,"Mr. Wallace, although that's true as to the current members of that Court, is it not possible that Justice O'Connor's suggestion would apply to the use of clear error, those words, in all the cases decided before 1947?"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,759.422,764.695,"--Well, that certainly is a way of looking at them."
1998.98-377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,791.342,808.783,"Well, it was well settled... well settled, wasn't it, that if the patent examiners were not in agreement, did not concur, the predecessor to the court of appeals for the Federal circuit would give a very searching analysis of the record."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,808.783,810.383,That... that was true--
1998.98-377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,810.383,815.658,"And so they were consistent in that, at least, but they were not consistent, we all know, in the words they used."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,815.658,829.396,"--The en banc court said that until the early fifties, at least, the CCPA as it was called, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, had disparate approaches to review."
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.117,832.739,But that's not... it seems to me that that's fatal to your case.
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,870.253,871.725,"--But that was our contention, precisely."
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.725,885.823,"--But you say it's one way when there are dissenting opinions in the board, it may be another way in another case, that they may have been using clearly erroneous to mean the same thing as substantial evidence in some cases."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,892.289,897.01,"Well, that's the... the other side is arguing that it has that kind of clarity."
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.169,911.559,Or either--
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,914.161,918.836,--Right.
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,919.447,922.948,"Well, this will give them time to--"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,936.367,936.958,Right.
1998.98-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,936.958,967.366,"--And then the Federal circuit is reviewing... so, you have one mode of review where undoubtedly the standard is clear error and my thinking is, if there is any doubt, why should the standard vis-a-vis the Federal circuit be different if you come to it through another court, and one would think that you've had an extra layer of review, that the Federal circuit at that point should be more, not less deferential."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,975.64,978.883,"Well, when you say get clear error, it depends on what you're talking about."
1998.98-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1055.443,1067.043,"Well, then you're suggesting that it's really the would-be patentee's choice, because the patentee could say, district court, look at the record from the PTO, but I'm going to put in some other things."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1067.551,1076.227,"There is that choice, which has been a historical choice of proceeding by a bill in equity, and the direct review proceeding was added later on."
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1117.664,1122.389,"--I don't understand what your position is as to what the district court should do, if the person does go the district."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1136.438,1147.684,"--De novo as to claims on which additional evidence is put in, and to the extent both parties are standing on the record that was made before the board, then it's review of the--"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1147.684,1148.285,--You use substantial evidence.
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1148.285,1149.086,--Right.
1998.98-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1149.086,1149.594,So you have two standards.
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1149.594,1157.101,"It's a hybrid proceeding, is what those cases that I just said call it."
1998.98-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1176.762,1182.827,"Yes, but if you see that the price at the end of the line is a patent, you might be willing to put up that money."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1206.272,1237.534,"--Correct, that the commissioner will expand the record unless they are adverse to the applicant, because the record can be expanded by either party, whereas the applicant is in much greater control of the record he's been making in the administrative proceedings, which are basically ex parte, and there are also ways of continuing the administrative proceeding and then reapplying again under section 120."
1998.98-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1246.45,1257.726,"It's not simply... I had thought of the model with the tax court and the deficiency you can't pay up, so you go that route, and it's not because of a greater risk or something, it's just, I don't have the money."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1257.726,1258.687,"--Right, right."
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1282.313,1291.62,"It's a strange... I'm unaware of any other case where you have a court that takes evidence, yet which is not reviewing it de novo."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1301.875,1306.479,--They make the decision de novo with respect to any matter as to which they've taken evidence.
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.479,1306.937,Oh.
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1309.091,1309.641,That's correct.
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.951,1311.963,--It's totally... it's their call.
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1311.963,1313.212,--But there may be--
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.212,1316.494,And then it would be reviewed on appeal de novo in a Federal... I can see--
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1316.494,1322.509,--That there may be claims as to which neither party introduced any evidence and relied solely on the record before the board.
1998.98-377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1374.662,1391.314,"--Mr. Wallace, if we... if we were to adopt the respondents' and the C. A. Fed. 's position, would it have destabilizing or uncertain effects in other areas of administrative law?"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1411.046,1465.913,"We're not aware of active litigation which has raised similar claims as to other agencies, but it... this reading of section 559 certainly could raise such questions, if it were established, as is certainly not clear on the face, that requirements, where it's used five other times in the original section 12 clearly to mean requirements for the administrative proceeding itself, or the conduct of the administrative proceeding, could also refer to the standard of judicial review, and that additional could mean instead of the standard specified by the act, which is not what I found in looking at a number of dictionaries about the meaning of additional, which means supplementary, but not to displace or instead of--"
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.913,1468.795,"--Well, the argument that they're making is that it doesn't displace it."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1481.712,1512.343,"--But it is contradictory to it, and it is a situation in which after a 10-year enterprise in formulating the Administrative Procedure Act to bring some unity and coherence to bring order out of what, if not chaos, had been disarray, the Savings Clause would be read in a way to really contradict the effect... the effectiveness of that--"
1998.98-377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.343,1514.825,"--Well, I don't think that's correct entirely, Mr. Wallace."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1534.507,1549.966,"--A practice in the agency, what would the... certainly an example of what would be something comparable to a statute otherwise required by law would be an agency rule that did not contradict a statutory requirement."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1550.718,1551.318,Do you agree--
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1551.318,1556.642,--of review really doesn't change what requirements there are in conducting the agency proceeding.
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1556.642,1566.958,"--Do you agree, Mr. Wallace, that the cases that respondents cite in their brief are a fair sample of the pre-APA patent cases, as far as whether this standard was actually applied?"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1566.958,1571.643,"A fair sample selectively described, because many--"
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1571.643,1575.396,"Well, what other cases do you think are relevant that they haven't pointed out?"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1582.499,1583.06,"--Well, we--"
1998.98-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1583.06,1585.8,--can I rely on the cases they've set forth in here?
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1585.8,1608.636,"--We discussed some in our reply brief, and we generally think that the Federal circuit very candidly and accurately described the state of the law as being ambiguous and as having what they... what could be called a menu of standards that were being applied and selected from, and they say any of these are recognized by law within the meaning of this provision."
1998.98-377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1608.636,1613.788,"Well, I thought they said that the phrasing might have been uncertain, but the practice was consistent."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1616.59,1619.802,"No, they said it's too ambiguous to... to--"
1998.98-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1619.802,1623.466,"Well, Mr. Wallace, we can ask them what they said, but let me ask you this question."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1649.833,1652.654,--It's a court with many other responsibilities as well.
1998.98-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1658.009,1672.87,"--Yes, but there is an expertise... forgive me... expertness in that court that... even in the staffing, and the Congress did that deliberately and said, patent's going to be one of your main--"
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1672.87,1675.35,That better enables them to perform--
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1675.35,1676.061,--So it's not... at least--
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1676.061,1676.289,--their review function.
1998.98-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1682.366,1695.252,"--All I'm attempting to say is, it isn't the standard agency with know-how in a particular area, generalist court, which is what I think Congress had in mind in the forties when the APA was written."
1998.98-377,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1695.252,1697.244,If I may reserve the balance of my time.
1998.98-377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.244,1698.485,"Very well, Mr. Wallace."
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,1704.97,1707.282,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.171,1820.836,"Mr. Gellhorn, may I just on that very point, because this is... I have the same concern Justice Scalia does, of how clearly established was the rule on which you rely."
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,1837.388,1846.174,"--They, as far as we know, fairly summarized them, but we would point out that their argument is in effect... first of all, there are not just 36 cases."
1998.98-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.917,1856.37,"But in those... in that number, were there more that... where they reversed the patent examiner?"
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,1856.37,1861.292,"--Not that we could identify, but there are, of course, other cases where they reversed the examiner."
1998.98-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1904.442,1914.407,"But how can we really make a judgment about that consistency without literally going back and examining the record in every one of those cases, which we clearly can't do?"
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,1932.168,1936.352,"Justice Souter, the Federal circuit said there was a clearly articulated standard."
1998.98-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1950.792,1952.003,But may I just clarify one thing.
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,1958.946,1962.578,"Yes, Your Honor, and it goes back to Morgan v. Daniels in 1894."
1998.98-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.578,1966.081,And has the... was the term clearly erroneous used in any of those terms... cases?
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,1966.081,1967.313,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1969.194,1969.594,They did.
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,1969.594,1971.094,They used the term manifestly wrong.
1998.98-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1971.094,1971.815,You know this--
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,1971.815,1973.885,They called them... they stated that they were interchangeable.
1998.98-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1976.587,1979.76,"--Well, would you answer the same question I asked Mr. Wallace."
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,1990.278,2001.053,"--As this Court has said, in fact, it is more and, as it has been used by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, it was always more, and what we're talking about is two elements."
1998.98-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2028.302,2041.401,Do you have any case that... from the board that makes it clear that that's the... that there is a difference between their clearly erroneous test and substantial evidence?
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,2075.243,2088.252,"Please recall, Your Honor, that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals continued with its jurisdiction over the Patent Office from 1946 to 1982, so they were continuing a tradition they had already started."
1998.98-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.077,2099.138,Why did everybody assume that?
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,2107.974,2110.506,"--As far as we know, the issue was not raised."
1998.98-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2111.047,2121.421,"But it is odd, because your approach basically tells us, well, the APA just sets a minimum standard, and any other standard that's more, well, then that applies."
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,2129.138,2141.166,"--As quoted on page 38 of our brief, Your Honor, Senator McCarran, in discussing the Administrative Procedure Act, made clear that it is an outline of basic essentials."
1998.98-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2208.239,2214.794,--But we have no case where you can show us that it really would make a big difference in any particular appeal.
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,2218.026,2226.301,"It clearly matters in terms of the view of the court of Federal appeals... excuse me, the court of the Federal circuit."
1998.98-377,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2261.065,2285.301,"Mr. Gellhorn, I... apart from this case, where the Federal circuit said to... said to this Court, we want you to tell us which standard is right and we're telling you that this case is going to come out differently if we apply the more deferential substantial evidence than if we apply the slightly more stringent clearly erroneous test."
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,2303.702,2305.134,"Not to our knowledge, Your Honor."
1998.98-377,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2362.11,2391.831,"In answer, or further exploration of Justice Souter's question about what are we supposed to do in determining what the earlier practice was, can we say at least that the patent bar is in general agreement that, a) the standard makes a difference, and b) the reviewing courts and the court of appeals have been consistent in using the strict standard?"
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,2397.245,2407.61,"I think that's... I think the bar is united on that, and the summary is perhaps best expressed in the New York Intellectual Property Lawyers Association brief, which goes through the cases, the 90 cases."
1998.98-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2411.363,2417.808,Do you know any bar that would not favor a more liberal standard of review?
1998.98-377,1,22349,ernest_gellhorn,,2418.138,2418.727,"--Of course not, Your Honor."
1998.98-377,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3472.047,3488.42,"On page 26a of the petition appendix, the court of appeals en banc, after reviewing all of the cases, said that the clearly erroneous was simply one of several standards discernible from the case law prior to the 1947 enactment."
1998.98-377,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3508.782,3510.845,But although the court of appeals thought differently.
1998.98-377,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3510.845,3513.086,They... would they--
1998.98-377,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3513.086,3515.578,"You know, I mean, I have the... I have real difficulty--"
1998.98-377,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3515.578,3519.481,"--They did it partly on the basis of stare decisis, their own precedent since 1982."
1998.98-377,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3519.481,3528.517,--I have real difficulty trying to figure out from this lofty perch whether they were indeed consistently using a clearly erroneous test.
1998.98-377,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3538.461,3540.604,"Well, they conscientiously looked at these cases."
1998.98-377,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3548.819,3558.306,"But I thought they also said that they used different word formulas, but in any case the thrust was a little tighter than arbitrary and capricious."
1998.98-377,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3558.306,3562.458,"Well, that... not exclusively."
1998.98-377,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3565.47,3566.762,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
