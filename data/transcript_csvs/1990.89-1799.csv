1990.89-1799,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.809,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1799, Jeffrey M. Masson against New Yorker Magazine, Alfred Knopf, and Janet Malcolm."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,10.809,28.927,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court:"
1990.89-1799,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.575,175.151,"Well, Mr. Morgan, do you take the position that every misquote gives rise to an inference of actual malice?"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,175.151,189.301,I take the position that every misquote that is defamatory and is not just a very minor misquote--
1990.89-1799,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.301,193.455,"Well, what is defamatory is typically defined under State law, right?"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,193.455,194.486,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.486,195.595,Not Federal law.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,195.595,196.486,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.486,198.328,So we're not concerned with that here.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,198.328,199.469,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.051,277.468,Do you think the injury to reputation is different when the injury occurs by virtue of a misquote than when it occurs by virtue of a characterization?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,277.468,278.499,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,298.24,306.753,I suppose the law has always recognized that when it admits an admission by a party but excludes hearsay.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,308.284,309.548,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.438,320.514,"Mr. Morgan, what if... what if I'm in an interview with someone and I make some statements that are very racist."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,347.159,347.845,Yes.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.845,349.829,"Now, that's an inaccurate quote."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,349.829,350.282,That's right.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.282,353.156,Is there liability for that?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,356.685,359.809,"Well, not necessarily, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.113,383.487,"Well, that's right."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,412.835,421.425,"If I devine what I think you're saying, and what I think you're posing, you're really dealing with the concept of incremental harm."
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,421.425,421.956,Yes.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,421.956,424.97,Because you use the term defamatory.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.749,432.108,Right.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,432.108,433.624,--it's defamatory.
1990.89-1799,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.212,490.427,"Mr. Morgan, in any event, wouldn't any issue of incremental harm be a matter of State defamation law--"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,490.427,491.162,I believe so.
1990.89-1799,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,491.162,492.334,--rather than of First Amendment law?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,492.334,492.787,Absolutely.
1990.89-1799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.299,504.611,Could I change Justice Scalia's hypothetical just a little?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,518.183,519.932,Have I proved malice?
1990.89-1799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.433,563.867,"Well, whether what... whether these quotes, whether they were fabricated or not and defamatory isn't involved in this case, is it?"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,566.803,570.505,"Well, but malice requires defamation, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.426,580.735,I think a lot of people can defame people and not be liable because they didn't do it maliciously.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,580.735,587.608,"--Well, but maliciously is the wrong word, and I say this most respectfully to this Court, from a man who has tried a number of--"
1990.89-1799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,587.608,588.201,What is the issue here?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,593.605,594.34,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.739,609.098,Whether malice was involved.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,610.442,610.989,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.989,613.128,"Well, that's what I asked you and you said no."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,613.128,615.253,"Well then I misunderstood you, and my apologies, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,615.253,620.891,"Well, you don't like the term malice because for many people it excludes reckless disregard."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,623.233,631.823,"Your Honor, all I can tell you, and I have seen it occasionally from the courts, say that it was a poor choice of words, and I say this most respectfully, it's an abomination."
1990.89-1799,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,633.714,635.119,But it's our words.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,637.541,640.524,"--But it's a bad word, and it's time to change it."
1990.89-1799,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,644.679,646.46,"Well, in any event we're probably getting off the point."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,667.653,668.872,"--Well, two things."
1990.89-1799,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,720.585,723.849,"--Well, I'm not sure that's a good way to put it, to say he has a right under the First Amendment."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,735.422,739.889,Except that we are confronted with the First Amendment--
1990.89-1799,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,739.889,741.638,The First Amendment used as a shield.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,741.638,743.67,"--That's right, because he's a public figure."
1990.89-1799,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.79,756.993,No.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,768.16,769.316,"I will accept that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,774.5,782.186,"Under your rule, aren't you going to create serious disincentives to use direct quotes or even to have a tape recorder?"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,782.186,782.575,--No.
1990.89-1799,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,823.231,831.681,"Well, but you are, because you're arguing that every misquote gives rise to an inference of actual malice."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,847.909,850.079,"--At risk, but not liable."
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.259,878.522,"Excuse me, you wouldn't get by a motion for summary judgment unless, I take it, there was clear and convincing evidence that there was an intentional misquote."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,878.522,878.944,That's right.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.944,884.472,"Not just clear and convincing evidence of a misquote, but clear and convincing evidence that the misquote was intentional."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,885.472,886.457,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,994.068,998.614,"--He didn't... he didn't say... he was not quoted to say ""I am an intellectual gigolo""."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1008.438,1009.687,"But it was his words, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1009.687,1011.452,--But how is that defamatory?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1014.468,1015.45,No--
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.45,1018.934,Can I think it's not defamatory and still find for you in this case?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1019.903,1020.558,"--Of course not, of course not."
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.995,1021.261,I can't?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1021.261,1022.745,It has to be defamatory.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.745,1023.401,Oh.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1023.401,1027.054,Otherwise there is no basis for a lawsuit.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.492,1033.864,How is it defamatory of me that somebody else treated me like an intellectual gigolo?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1034.536,1039.769,"--But it's you who in this fabricated quote is saying,"
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.924,1046.361,In context it didn't mean I was like one.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1076.27,1077.644,That's a question for the jury.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.003,1080.628,The reasonable interpretation--
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1080.628,1091.56,"--Well, as Your Honor knows, if there are two reasonable interpretations, one defamatory and the other not defamatory, the court will assume it's defamatory."
1990.89-1799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.274,1234.908,"--Every new... every new decision is for the first time, and every new decision doesn't have any precedent."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1239.093,1240.031,--I do.
1990.89-1799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.906,1243.233,"I know you do, but it won't be because there isn't any precedent."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1243.233,1247.778,"This is one time I have no hesitation in saying that absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.6,1358.281,"Suppose... suppose what he had said was there is no greater analyst than I other than Freud, and she quotes him as saying I am the greatest analyst ever other than Freud?"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1358.281,1359.966,"Oh, I think there's no problem with that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1359.966,1361.185,Why is there no problem with that?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1361.185,1362.872,Because all that has happened--
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.872,1364.2,"It's a misquote, right?"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1364.2,1365.372,--Of course it's a misquote.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.372,1368.807,And she... let's say she intentionally misquotes it because it takes up less space that way.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1368.807,1370.791,"Well, I don't think it'll take up less space--"
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1370.791,1371.166,Whatever.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1372.197,1372.759,--but all that has happened is--
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.759,1374.056,"But she knows, she knows it's a misquote."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1374.337,1374.915,--That's right.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1379.585,1382.256,"She has changed the words, but they are the same words?"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1382.256,1382.443,That's right.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1383.068,1384.411,That's nice.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1388.05,1388.675,That's right.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.501,1391.549,"Now, that has to go to the jury, right?"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1398.546,1398.56,No.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.045,1400.263,"Well then, why?"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1403.293,1408.011,"As we put in our brief, and I think it's the same thing."
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.304,1417.132,Um-hum.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1417.132,1419.318,They're basically the same thing.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.474,1427.8,Is it defamatory in isolation?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1430.127,1435.234,"--Because the words are the same, except for the one change."
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.234,1445.776,"So built into your doctrine then there is some comparative, if indeed her quotation is a fair summary of what he has said then, it shouldn't go to the jury."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1445.776,1446.057,Yes.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1446.885,1447.182,Right?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1447.182,1450.15,--It's not because of incremental damage or incremental harm.
1990.89-1799,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.15,1450.4,Why?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1450.4,1454.523,It's because of the substantial truth doctrine.
1990.89-1799,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.193,1498.973,Especially if he weighs 315 pounds.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1498.973,1499.332,That's right.
1990.89-1799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.275,1532.884,What if it's just reversed?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1538.21,1539.598,"--Well, that's the Hotchner case."
1990.89-1799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1539.598,1541.692,"Well, I don't know the Hotchner case."
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1544.613,1551.157,"Well, I really don't think that you can show any damage there."
1990.89-1799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.797,1556.03,It seems to me it was easy when we asked you at the beginning of the argument.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1561.543,1561.793,That's right.
1990.89-1799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1564.714,1567.494,"So it goes to the jury, or does it not go to the jury?"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1567.494,1574.398,"I have a feeling in that one that the court would grant summary judgment, and I don't think any appellate court would--"
1990.89-1799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.398,1576.975,"Well, what if we thought each of these was just like that?"
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1580.426,1582.019,"--Your Honor, if--"
1990.89-1799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.019,1582.972,If we thought that.
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1583.363,1583.894,--I understand.
1990.89-1799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.894,1585.299,--what if we read it carefully and we come to that conclusion?
1990.89-1799,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1585.299,1600.403,"If you thought that the two statements I related were equivalent to Mr. Masson saying I'm an intellectual gigolo, I'll pack my bags and leave now, you know, because--"
1990.89-1799,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.403,1601.653,"Well, but it's a question of your theory."

1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1744.423,1745.11,"In general, that's correct."
1990.89-1799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.235,1747.421,You feel you can make that sort of generalization?
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1747.421,1747.702,Yes.
1990.89-1799,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.996,1806.82,"So if I'm running in an election campaign and I... and my opponent accuses me of being a racist on the basis of some substantive positions I take, and it's arguable."

1990.89-1799,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1863.625,1864.999,It's my hypothetical.
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1867.077,1869.389,"--Well, let me explain that point that I am trying to make, if I may."
1990.89-1799,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.389,1869.576,All right.
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1869.576,1881.039,"The point that I am trying to make is that the inquiry is into whether the writer is knowingly misrepresenting something that was said, the substance of something that was said."
1990.89-1799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1912.481,1925.35,"So you say that a false statement by a reporter in an article, such as Mr. Masson said this when he in fact did not say it, is... cannot form any basis for inferring malice?"

1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1939.391,1942.077,It would depend on the particular circumstance.
1990.89-1799,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1954.9,1957.461,What about Justice Scalia's hypothetical?
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1957.461,1959.335,--If I understand his hypothetical--
1990.89-1799,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1959.335,1962.287,"Yes, I am a racist is the false quote."

1990.89-1799,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1970.596,1982.498,"Well, I would suggest that the very, that the very circumstance that someone makes an admission of that sort, allegedly, is itself a fact that is being highly misrepresented."
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1983.655,1990.136,"If he has made an admission, if... again, maybe I'm not clear on the hypothetical."
1990.89-1799,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.879,2045.347,"Mr. Farr, why should it be that way?"
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2087.739,2090.19,"Well, first of all I think that there are two parts to the answer."
1990.89-1799,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2108.527,2108.917,I don't think so.
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2115.618,2121.006,"--The question, though, is what exactly is the gist of the action?"
1990.89-1799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2132.907,2133.188,But the--
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2133.188,2135.046,The falsity you must show is something different.
1990.89-1799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2135.046,2141.825,"--But this falsity of the gist is something that you have urged, but I don't know that our cases support it."
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2141.825,2144.152,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe they do."
1990.89-1799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2150.431,2153.258,But we don't have any question of California law before us.
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2153.258,2162.755,"--Well, it is the California law that is intersecting with the First Amendment in this case, so there... that's correct, you don't have to decide California law, but that is what the California law represents."
1990.89-1799,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2182.98,2184.699,"Well, I think the question is a little different."
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2201.817,2202.801,"--Well, Justice O'Connor--"
1990.89-1799,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2202.801,2210.58,"And a quote is fabricated to that effect, which under State law would be regarded as defamatory."
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2222.355,2225.245,"--The accusation by itself, I think, does not."
1990.89-1799,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2229.228,2230.242,The quote.
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2238.38,2247.142,--I think it does not by itself raise the inference of malice as I believe it is correctly interpreted.
1990.89-1799,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2347.538,2350.677,Why don't you get to look at the evidence on the question of damage?
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2350.677,2353.598,It is... well--
1990.89-1799,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2353.598,2355.692,The evidence would come in on the subject of damage.
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2355.692,2356.488,--It might.
1990.89-1799,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.446,2392.099,"You have no... I mean, I don't see this distinction between knowingly misrepresenting substance and knowingly misrepresenting words."
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2400.706,2412.28,"It is knowingly... I mean, in that hypothetical case where the writer in fact is proved to have known of the misrepresentation it, arguably I suppose, could be said to be substance, but not defamatory substance."
1990.89-1799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.454,2495.433,"No, I don't think your point... your point of view makes enough allowance for the fact that putting words in someone's mouth as having said it themselves can hit a lot harder than having some third person describe what they think the person said."
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2495.433,2501.603,"--Justice Rehnquist, I think that is true, but perhaps less true than it seems at first blush."
1990.89-1799,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2522.766,2529.17,"No, what makes the difference, Mr. Farr, is that you, as the writer, you take yourself out of the picture."
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2561.485,2568.887,"But the question, as I understood the Chief Justice to ask it, isn't the fact that words are attributed to somebody much more powerful."

1990.89-1799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.161,2668.38,Yeah.
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2688.559,2689.823,--His burden--
1990.89-1799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2689.823,2692.838,He wouldn't have to prove the falsity of the content.

1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2708.113,2709.301,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.672,2718.563,You think he would have to prove that?
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2727.949,2728.261,I'm sorry.
1990.89-1799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2734.072,2734.353,--Exactly.
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2734.353,2735.383,"I'm sorry, if that's what you're saying."
1990.89-1799,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2735.383,2735.586,Exactly.
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2735.586,2750.44,"But what he would have to do if he sued... let's say under my... under the hypothetical I was using, if he did sue and say this misrepresents what I said about what I would do, he would have to show that he did not in substance say that."
1990.89-1799,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2758.562,2768.823,"But Mr. Farr, we have here self valuative statements or alleged statements, greatest analyst, honorable man, intellectual gigolo."
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2786.175,2788.55,"That's correct, and I don't dispute that."
1990.89-1799,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2878.669,2892.96,"To put it differently, if a reasonable person could have given the words that interpretation, even though another reasonable person might not have given them that interpretation, putting it in quotation marks is okay, right?"
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2904.955,2909.328,"I don't mean to be ironical, but I don't think that's a reasonable interpretation of what I said."

1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2941.94,2945.22,"Well, I mean, I suppose I guess it depends on the other issues."

1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2962.963,2963.729,Pardon me?
1990.89-1799,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2963.729,2965.165,In the eyes of a reasonable juror?
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2965.165,2967.712,"That's correct, if we're talking about the summary judgment stage, that's correct."

1990.89-1799,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3106.327,3109.138,"Well, you can't say it means nothing if it's admissible competent evidence."
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3134.753,3136.112,All right.

1990.89-1799,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3147.78,3148.702,May I try the distinction?
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3205.194,3209.426,"Depending perhaps on the amount of difference, but generally that is correct."
1990.89-1799,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3209.426,3209.645,Right.
1990.89-1799,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3239.992,3241.133,That is correct.
1990.89-1799,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3241.133,3259.718,"Justice Scalia's example is the third person quote, or we'll say just the non-first person evidence, which is suddenly placed by means of a misquotation into a... into a statement in quotes attributed to the first person."

1990.89-1799,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3280.272,3281.475,And take his example.
