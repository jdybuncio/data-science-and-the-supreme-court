1986.85-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,68.727,"Ms. Wilson, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,68.727,74.898,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.238,243.705,"While we're on the subject of the lower court's holding, I think that I understand the lower courts here to have held that under Arkansas law even the non-subscription sales of these so-called exempt magazines are exempt?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,243.705,244.74,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.74,250.311,It doesn't turn an whether the sale is by way of subscription or not?
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,250.311,251.411,That's right.
1986.85-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,296.507,310.367,"Well, Ms. Wilson, I guess we don't even have to look at the newspaper question if we focus on just the particular types of magazines that are exempt."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,320.372,331.846,That is correct if the remedy were necessarily to be to extend the exemption to sales of Arkansas Times Magazine.
1986.85-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,359.449,360.415,"Ms. Wilson, excuse me."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,381.279,383.731,--I'm not sure I understand your question.
1986.85-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.731,386.35,"Well, I'm not sure I understood your answer to Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,412.584,413.75,That's right.
1986.85-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.35,421.773,But that same thing could happen even if we rested our decision on the discrimination between your magazine and newspapers.
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,436.532,437.399,--That is correct.
1986.85-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.399,437.815,Okay.
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,445.971,476.24,"Well, again, if this Court were to find that the discrimination between newspapers and magazines was unconstitutional and the Arkansas court then found that the remedy was to delete the exemption, the result would be that all publications would be treated the same, whether they be newspapers or magazines or sports journals or whatever, and that would end the discrimination and we'd have a constitutional result at that time."
1986.85-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.24,480.478,"But that wouldn't defeat your right to a refund, would it?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,480.478,484.513,I don't know whether it would or not.
1986.85-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,484.513,487.815,You couldn't go back and collect the tax retroactively from all the others?
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,487.815,494.369,"That... yes, I think to bring us even we would have to get a refund of past taxes."
1986.85-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,494.369,511.312,So the case isn't a moot case just because the... just because the exemption could be eliminated.
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,511.312,516.631,"No, not as to the taxes collected up through the time of the decision, that's correct."
1986.85-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.631,525.221,"Yes, all right."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,525.221,536.946,The discrimination obviously in the magazine exemption and also in the newspaper exemption is based almost entirely on content.
1986.85-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,546.568,559.042,"Ms. Wilson, you know, when we think of a discrimination based on content in the freedom of speech area, we think of the state as trying to suppress or disfavor certain kinds of content."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,585.11,585.543,--No.
1986.85-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.064,618.766,"Yes, I can understand that argument."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,637.978,650.551,"Well, the recent cases that the Court has decided where there was content-based discrimination were really not cases where the government was trying to suppress a particular point of view or anything of that sort."
1986.85-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,687.343,699.484,"Here you think the intention of the legislature is to consciously favor religious, professional trade and sports journals, at the expense of other kinds of journals?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,699.484,708.907,"That's what the Arkansas Supreme Court found when it decided the case, that's correct."
1986.85-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,720.981,731.189,"Well, when you look into some of these sales tax laws, I think you have a question in your mind in almost every one of them as to how certain exemptions came to be on the books."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,765.993,773.032,"Well, that's certainly true with things which don't... with taxing statutes which don't involve First Amendment rights."
1986.85-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,799.25,810.455,"Well, Ms. Wilson, you argue that the legislature in its sales tax cannot distinguish between magazines and newspapers."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,832.988,843.278,"It's possible that the state could assert some interest that would justify a discrimination between videotapes, for example, and newspapers."
1986.85-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.861,846.48,"A state interest, a compelling state interest?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,849.765,854.467,I don't know what kind of interest the state could show in that type of discrimination.
1986.85-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.852,859.371,"Well, we're asking about the legal standard."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,865.774,876.582,"--I think it depends on the nature of the tax, how general the tax is, you know, the nature of the exemptions, and many other factors."
1986.85-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,890.842,905.768,"Well, the Court has traditionally given a great deal of leeway, has it not, to state taxing schemes and to let the state distinguish among objects of tax?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,905.768,913.172,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is correct, except in the area where it has burdened First Amendment rights."
1986.85-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,913.172,925.932,"Well, did Minneapolis Star indicate that a general sales tax would be different, and that we wouldn't have the same concerns?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,925.932,937.74,"Minneapolis Star did indicate that a general sales tax could be generally applied to publications, as to all other items of commerce."
1986.85-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,955.534,972.394,"Well, do you think that the price and frequency and the volume of newspaper sales in general is different from that of magazines, and that that difference might justify the difference in the tax application?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,972.394,981.233,The state has not shown any information whatsoever concerning the volume and so forth of newspapers.
1986.85-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.115,1025.727,"Ms. Wilson, what if a state exempts from the general sales tax subscriptions to publications by charitable organizations... boy scouts, churches, museums, and so forth?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,1028.244,1037.234,"That type of publication, it might be able to show that the state had an interest which was strong enough to justify the discrimination."
1986.85-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1037.234,1040.771,"Oh, it needs a compelling state interest to do that?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,1040.771,1053.996,"Well, yes, I think it does need... either a compelling state interest or to have some other rights implicated, such as possibly religious, the right to religious freedom or something of that sort?"
1986.85-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.164,1068.672,"You're comfortable with that, that the state can't except the boy scout publications or museums publications from its sales taxes unless there's a compelling state interest?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,1068.672,1079.814,"--That would be the general principle, Your Honor, unless they could assert an interest which was sufficient to justify the discrimination."
1986.85-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.814,1089.17,"Well, how do you... how does the state justify exempting charities from taxation at all, then?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,1089.17,1095.157,"Okay, you mean just generally, like exempting charities from property tax?"
1986.85-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.157,1095.69,"Yes, yes."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,1108.147,1115.653,"Well, I'm not saying that the Court has to... that if it exempts anything, it has to also exempt the press."
1986.85-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.061,1142.47,"Well, if the state can exempt a charity from taxation, why can't it exempt the sale of its magazines from sales tax?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,1142.47,1145.506,--Exempt the sale of a church or something?
1986.85-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.506,1150.208,"No, exempt the sale of its magazines from sales tax."
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,1150.208,1151.743,"Well, it might be able to do that."
1986.85-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.743,1152.66,"Well, it might?"
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,1159.932,1164.634,"I would say that it should be scrutinized closely, yes."
1986.85-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1187.016,1195.855,Let's assume... you ended it earlier than I thought you would.
1986.85-1370,0,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,1247.888,1249.39,"No, I really wouldn't say that."
1986.85-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.792,1303.292,"Thank you, Ms. Wilson."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1307.362,1311.814,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1370,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1396.503,1411.013,"General Clark, the statute, though, does seem to prefer certain journals... sports, religious, professional, and trade journals... on the basis of their content, does it not?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1411.013,1413.548,"No, Your Honor, I submit to this Court it does not."
1986.85-1370,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1425.189,1431.593,"Well, could we talk about the exemption of certain types of journals, please?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1431.593,1433.459,"--Yes, ma'am, Your Honor."
1986.85-1370,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1473.77,1478.824,"Well, is it a type of content-based treatment?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1491.215,1494.184,"Your Honor, it's only those four generic types of publications."
1986.85-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.686,1525.638,So the exemption has never been applied?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1525.638,1526.721,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1370,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1526.721,1531.459,Is it true that the Arkansas Times is the only one that's ever been taxed?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1531.459,1532.075,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.898,1548.819,"Does the record show... just to be sure, the record shows that the exemption has never been applied?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1548.819,1552.622,"Your Honor, the exemption... we have gone back to our tax administrator and reviewed all of our records."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.272,1557.49,But was that evidence... but does the record show that?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1559.709,1560.978,"No, Your Honor, the record does not."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.132,1568.715,--Right.
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1568.715,1577.571,The only affidavit from the state tax administrator was to the effect that there were other publications subject to this general sales tax other than the Arkansas Times.
1986.85-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.975,1588.545,Are there any magazines sold in Arkansas that would qualify for the exemption?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1588.545,1589.928,"Your Honor, I think the answer to that is yes."
1986.85-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.747,1597.317,"Well, do they just out of the kindness of their heart collect the sales tax?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1597.317,1600.953,"--Your Honor, I do not know the reason why they do not seek this benefit."
1986.85-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.653,1606.673,"Well, your answer is that they do collect the sales tax when they sell?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1606.673,1613.777,"--There are three publications, Your Honor, for which the sales tax is to be collected and remitted back to the state, the Arkansas Times being one and there are two others."
1986.85-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.815,1620.783,That do not what?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1620.783,1623.219,--That in fact would be exempt from the tax.
1986.85-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.219,1624.535,And they don't collect it?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1624.535,1629.372,"But they have not applied for the exemption, and so it's not applied to them."
1986.85-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.1,1650.886,"Well, not a failure of enforcement."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1655.773,1664.979,"Under our sales tax scheme, Your Honor, all sale of tangible personal property is subject to tax unless a benefit is granted through an exemption."
1986.85-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.331,1672.799,"Well, I find it difficult to believe that people collect the tax when they don't have to."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1672.799,1677.103,"--Well, Your Honor, as I said, the record reflects no one has asked for that benefit of that exemption."
1986.85-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.103,1689.577,"Well, are you saying that under Arkansas law one cannot simply read the statute, if you're in the business of selling tangible personal property, and say, look, I'm exempt, so I won't collect the tax?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1692.529,1693.413,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1714.126,1728.819,"May I ask, what would happen to a publisher who was perfectly... talked to a lawyer and the lawyer said, oh, you're clearly exempt because this is a religious publication, and he said thank you and started to publish, and didn't... he published a purely religious thing they sent out every Sunday or something like that."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1736.058,1740.427,"Your Honor, he could be penalized through civil penalties for failure to pay those taxes."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.427,1741.629,"No, but he doesn't have any tax."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1760.69,1767.161,He would not be penalized for that conduct for the publication that was exempt from the sales tax on the sale.
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1774.85,1793.661,"Well, I was just going to say, it seems to me the fact that no exemptions have been granted in this category, as you've explained to us, does not mean that it is not entirely possible that there are a lot of religious publications that simply didn't bother to apply for the exemption because they realized they wouldn't get into any trouble."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1793.661,1801.417,"Your Honor, I think the answer to that is yes, there are a number of religious publications that are not printed and published in Arkansas, but circulated there, and they wouldn't qualify for the exemption."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1802.384,1804.969,"No, I'm talking about those that would qualify for the exemption."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1817.594,1826.55,"Your Honor, I believe that there may well be publications in Arkansas who would qualify for the exemption, but just never have made application."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.55,1826.818,Right.
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1826.818,1833.305,And the penalty... there would be no penalty assessed in the sense of confinement or jailing.
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1835.507,1835.857,Or any other sense.
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1835.857,1837.207,--Or any civil penalty that would be assessed.
1986.85-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1837.207,1846.379,"Well, usually somebody who is supposed to collect the tax and doesn't is going to have to pay the tax."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1846.379,1849.165,When they have the responsibility to collect the tax.
1986.85-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.165,1849.665,Yes.
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1849.665,1851.017,"In this instance, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.017,1851.317,Yes.
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1862.658,1864.941,"--Your Honor, there are none that have applied for the exemption."
1986.85-1370,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1869.879,1876.215,How many people... how many firms are in the same position as petitioner?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1876.215,1877.167,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1986.85-1370,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1877.167,1880.619,How many are in the same position as the petitioner?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1880.619,1881.619,There are two others.
1986.85-1370,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1883.987,1884.704,It's a total of three.
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1886.404,1890.058,"For the Arkansas Times, $15,800."
1986.85-1370,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1895.712,1898.747,I just wanted to know.
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,1898.747,1907.352,"All the state of Arkansas, I submit to this Court, needs to demonstrate is that there is some rational basis for these four generic classifications found in the exemptions granted."
1986.85-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2023.895,2033.767,"General Clark, is the exemption for religious, professional, trade, and sports journals... is that conditioned by the fact that they're published in Arkansas?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2033.767,2038.237,"Yes, Your Honor, they must be published and printed within Arkansas and sold by subscription."
1986.85-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2038.237,2047.427,And your argument is that a sports magazine would have a less general advertising base than a general interest magazine?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2047.427,2059.068,"Your Honor, a think a general sports magazine, the example being Sports Illustrated, might have a broader base than one which deals with duck hunting or deals with fox hunting or deals with bass fishing."
1986.85-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.839,2069.172,"So limited that no one might ever try to publish them, it sounds like."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2070.375,2073.409,"--Yes, Your Honor, that could well be true."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2128.812,2132.614,"But General Clark, I guess it does involve content to this extent."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2147.523,2149.891,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that you would."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2183.047,2191.552,"But you said the purpose basically is to foster communication by magazines that would not otherwise be able to make a profit, in effect."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2191.552,2211.216,"Your Honor, think that was the original legislative purpose with all of these types of publications, to foster this communication in our rural state of the printed word, whether it be newspaper, general interest publications, or these four generic types of publications that might only have, say, a limited audience, a limited advertising base, and have difficulty in administering a tax of $400 of $500."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.132,2219.655,"But then it's to foster some communication and not others, for a purpose that is not evident on the face of the statute."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2230.177,2231.629,"Yes, Your Honor, I think there could be."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.633,2246.305,"Say publications on how to play poker, or publications on how to do lots of things that aren't necessarily one of those categories."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2246.305,2249.857,"--As I said, the legislature inartfully drafted this statute."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.749,2267.903,What about the very publication we've got before us in this case?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2271.337,2285.347,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that one thing that this Court should consider is the fact that this case might be ripe for remand on the basis that we have such an incomplete record, and that the Arkansas Times by stipulation stipulated it was not a newspaper."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.12,2301.874,"Well, hadn't it been denied the... or the state was assessing the... you say it had never applied for the exemption, is that what it amounts to?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2301.874,2303.226,"Your Honor, the Arkansas Times did not."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2342.084,2347.052,"Yes, but they must have made that stipulation at your request, at the tax authority's request."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2348.738,2350.654,"--Well, Your Honor, they made that acknowledgment on their own."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.654,2353.237,They did?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2358.491,2359.51,I would submit to this Court--
1986.85-1370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.51,2365.145,You did say that they have substantial revenue from advertising?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2365.145,2365.847,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2365.847,2369.366,Which is exempted under another provision of Arkansas law?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2369.366,2369.832,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.832,2381.689,"To that extent, your response to Justice Stevens' question could have been that would seem to indicate that this is not one of those publications that needs the kind of help that the narrow categories do."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2381.689,2383.475,"Yes, Your Honor, that would be correct."
1986.85-1370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.475,2385.591,How much advertising?
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2387.093,2388.143,"No, Your Honor, it's not."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2421.916,2424.535,"Would you just clarify one thing, because I didn't quite follow it."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2436.426,2438.793,"No, Your Honor, they would not."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2438.793,2444.997,"So really, it would be in their interest just to get out of the four... to get into that category?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2444.997,2445.516,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.769,2458.606,"So if we have a marginal sports publication, it can get both the advertising exemption and the sales tax exemption?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2458.606,2459.875,A marginal publication?
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.875,2463.677,"Yes, it fits one of the four categories, sports or religion for example."
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2463.677,2470.147,"If it were sport, and determined on these four generic categories, it would be exempt from sales tax on the sale."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.187,2479.92,It would get both.
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2479.92,2480.453,The answer is yes.
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.453,2494.029,"So the advertising space, if there is discrimination here, the advertising exemption really doesn't have any effect on the discrimination in the sales tax area, if it does exist, because everybody gets the advertising exemption?"
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2494.029,2495.298,"Everyone would get that, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.504,2515.36,So that what they should have done is describe the category they tried to protect as those publications who don't have substantial advertising revenues.
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2517.462,2519.164,"That certainly would have clarified it some, Your Honor."
1986.85-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.734,2530.02,It seems to me that's easier to apply than this four-pronged standard they came up with.
1986.85-1370,1,29671,john_steven_clark,,2530.02,2547.314,"If this Court were to decide that the Arkansas statutory scheme of general taxation fails, then 45 states like Arkansas, I submit, are at a loss to impose a constitutionally approved taxing scheme on the sale of any commercial commodities that have any ties to any First Amendment outlet."
1986.85-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2590.443,2592.26,"Thank you, General Clark."
1986.85-1370,2,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,2595.195,2597.014,"Yes, if it please the Court."
1986.85-1370,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2621.129,2622.397,He didn't volunteer that.
1986.85-1370,2,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,2624.831,2625.349,Yes.
1986.85-1370,3,29671,john_steven_clark,,2659.737,2661.022,"Cockfighting, yes."
1986.85-1370,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2688.924,2710.789,"Ms. Wilson, could I ask you about your thesis that the state cannot in its management of its fisc, in either the imposition of taxes or, I suppose it would follow, in its disbursement of state funds, favor one subject over another, like sports or what-not."
1986.85-1370,4,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,2751.597,2761.805,"Well, the Court has made a distinction between subsidies of that sort versus classifications which burden types of speech."
1986.85-1370,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2817.475,2818.059,"Well, why is this different?"
1986.85-1370,4,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,2824.312,2830.032,"Yes, I think it could, yes."
1986.85-1370,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.032,2834.853,"At which there would be, you know, speeches and all the communication that goes with that."
1986.85-1370,4,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,2837.02,2837.52,Certainly.
1986.85-1370,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2837.52,2845.309,"Well, why can't it foster the sales of sporting magazines then, if it wants, so long as it's not trying to stamp out your magazine?"
1986.85-1370,4,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,2845.309,2857.867,"Well, it probably does subsidize the Razorback magazine or something like that, in that there is probably a sports publication at the University of Arkansas which is subsidized by the state."
1986.85-1370,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2873.026,2873.945,But they're not burdening anybody.
1986.85-1370,4,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,2906.532,2917.59,"Well, I think a systematic program of the government where it systematically favored publications that espoused a particular point of view and then denied the same benefits--"
1986.85-1370,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.59,2925.511,"Not a particular point of view, a particular subject: sports, I don't know, politics."
1986.85-1370,4,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,2944.824,2956.482,"--Well, again, it's an enhancement rather than a burden on some elements of speech."
1986.85-1370,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.696,3001.944,It's a general tax.
1986.85-1370,4,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,3010.034,3024.609,"--Well, of course, the benefits that they've granted are such that I still assert one publication is singled out for taxation, where every other publication is exempt from taxation."
1986.85-1370,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3081.696,3083.315,"But you don't really know that, do you?"
1986.85-1370,4,17244,anne_owings_wilson,,3093.088,3099.508,"We did not argue that it was a religious publication or a sports publication, no, Your Honor."
1986.85-1370,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3139.402,3141.085,"Thank you, Ms. Wilson."
