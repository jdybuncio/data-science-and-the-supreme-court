1965.27,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,33.872,"Number 27 F.J. Gunther, Petitioner versus San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway Company."
1965.27,0,18795,charles_w_decker,,37.002,42.065,May it please the Court.
1965.27,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,236.258,243.06,We'll recess now Mr. Decker.
1965.27,0,18795,charles_w_decker,,243.06,257.523,That the judicial remedy provided by Section 153 (p) of Title 45 is of extreme importance to the railroad worker.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,1790.731,1796.654,"Mr. Chief Justice the associate justices, and may it please the Court."
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2001.0,2005.374,No appeal are you telling us to the just cause provision?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2005.374,2006.119,Pardon me Your Honor?
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2006.119,2009.344,What about that provision agreement on â€“
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2009.344,2011.312,The agreement provides that --
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2011.312,2013.143,"Just cause, is that the one is that the --"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2013.143,2014.11,In essence yes.
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2014.11,2014.695,"Yes, thank you."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2014.695,2020.518,It provides for no dismissal without prior investigation and --
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.518,2022.419,And for fault.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2022.419,2025.724,"And for fault, being guilty as charged, right."
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.819,2070.422,The word is bad -- how does good and bad faith get into the right--
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2070.422,2072.263,"Well, good and bad faith --"
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.263,2076.297,"I mean, if you're relying on the contract there's something this contract about good and bad faith?"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2076.297,2080.318,"Well, the interpretation by the adjustment board so states Your Honor."
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.318,2086.835,"Well, yes but you take their interpretation of the contract for one purpose and not another?"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2086.835,2088.103,Pardon me Your Honor?
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.103,2093.438,Will you take their interpretation of the contract for one purpose and not another?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2093.438,2114.328,"Well, I think Your Honor that when they set forth the question -- first of all, they don't point to any provision, as far as I can see, that limits the carrier in making these decisions as based upon its doctor's findings as to the ability of an engineer for foreign service."
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.166,2145.662,"Well, now I know it doesn't refer to any particular provision, but in response to the carrier's contentions, it said in its initial ruling that the matter of a fitness had to be adequately determined than the contract."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2148.836,2150.089,That's true.
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2150.089,2153.579,Is it now then that their interpretation of the contract and I take it.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2153.579,2155.237,"Well, as a --"
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.237,2169.852,And then they go on and say that the words challenged where the physical fitness findings the carrier challenged that they will appoint a three-member panel to determine the matter.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2169.852,2170.288,"Well, they said --"
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.288,2172.867,"It will deprive them on that, doesn't it?"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2172.867,2177.975,"Well, Your Honor in the 1956 award, we say first appointed this board."
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.452,2240.901,"So your specific point is not that the board couldn't have reviewed this finding of fitness, but that it shouldn't have reverted to a three-doctor panel?"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2240.901,2241.547,Our --
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.547,2249.782,The only thing that's wrong here is that they did use the three-man panel instead of determining the matter itself making evidence in determining the matter itself?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2249.782,2252.35,"In determining the bad faith question, yes Your Honor."
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.35,2262.18,"On the adequately determined question, I mean that's an adequate determination as this much as they're ruling here as good faith."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2262.18,2271.989,"Well, my position on that Your Honor is that this adequate determination is a statement made by the board which doesn't appear to be founded in the contract."
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.989,2274.492,Nor does good faith.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2274.492,2275.63,"Now, that's true too."
1965.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2294.253,2313.405,"Well, what -- as I understand what you just said, you conceded at least for the purposes of this argument that if it could be shown that the finding that this man was in questionable health was in bad faith on the part of carrier, the man would have a grievance under the contract."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2317.165,2318.667,Right Your Honor.
1965.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2318.667,2326.171,When what if it could be shown that the violator was no bad faith.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2347.803,2349.093,I think not Your Honor.
1965.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2349.093,2357.948,Wouldn't he then under the collective bargaining agreement have his seniority rights to serve as an engineer if he was in perfect good health?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2357.948,2358.405,I would --
1965.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2358.405,2359.835,In fact?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2359.835,2371.127,"Well, Your Honor, I would think not because I don't think that you -- the carrier can state that its doctor is always correct."
1965.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2410.069,2424.878,"Well, I don't question the carrier's right -- if not the carrier's duty in the first instance to take this man out of the cab of the locomotive, if they have a finding by their chief surgeon that he's going to have a heart attack."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2463.452,2469.535,"Your Honor, I wouldn't think that would be the end of the collective bargaining agreement but I would think that he would have the right as a grievance."
1965.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2470.422,2474.385,Well the grievance would have to be under the agreement wouldn't it?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2482.97,2483.997,That's true.
1965.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2483.997,2485.622,"So it would have to be under the agreement, wouldn't it?"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2485.622,2486.299,Yes.
1965.27,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2494.275,2495.459,"Then there'd be bad faith if that's the case, as what you said."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2495.459,2496.473,That's right.
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.361,2552.591,But he would never be recalled.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2552.591,2566.832,"He wouldn't be recalled except under these circumstances Your Honor, if he should go and take a physical under this 1959 agreement and if he were well and then he would pass and he would be entitled to go back on an engine."
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.832,2568.639,Even of 82?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2568.639,2574.121,If he passed the physical we would have no choice but to follow our agreement.
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2575.743,2577.34,Even at age 82?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2577.34,2578.802,"Well, Your Honor --"
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2578.802,2582.302,I wouldn't be much interested in riding your railroad then.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2582.302,2583.545,I agree with you Your Honor.
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2743.727,2748.592,He made a (Inaudible) did he not in the Court of Appeals?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2748.592,2751.914,"No, well Your Honor, he did this."
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2879.249,2899.552,"You spoke with the great importance of this case to the railroad, what is the great importance of it now saying that if you have agreed to adhere with the unions that in the future this three-doctor board would in such cases be appointed?"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2899.552,2901.945,"Well, Your Honor."
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2965.045,2983.593,Was there anything that before that agreement was changed that cause -- that require the railway to adhere to that I mean the standards specially those member anything of that kind and determining the physical condition of the employees.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2983.593,2984.185,"No, Your Honor."
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2991.375,2996.191,"Well, is there any other ground between the case that they were all specialists in this case?"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,2996.191,2999.029,No.
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2999.029,3016.815,"Well then, didn't the board determine, did it not, that there should've been some standards that the railroad have to go by in determining whether a man was physically fit or not?"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3016.815,3017.927,Yes.
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3017.927,3019.46,Do you think they were not?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3022.008,3023.781,Well I said they did have standards.
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3023.781,3024.469,What?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3028.298,3037.086,"Well, they are articulated in Rule 74 or in the standard as set forth but they're not in the record."
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3037.086,3041.839,Were they articulated for this particular petitioner?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3041.839,3042.636,"Yes, they were."
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3042.636,3044.406,You know where could you find it?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3044.406,3050.929,I would have to go outside the record but there are standards set up in the hospital department.
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3066.952,3071.149,"Is one standard, I believe you're wrong."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3084.856,3086.305,That end thing you said sir?
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3086.305,3087.515,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3087.515,3088.999,Yes.
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3088.999,3104.49,In other words (Inaudible) --
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3104.49,3105.782,"Well, Your Honor --"
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3105.782,3111.078,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3111.078,3111.838,Well it's --
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3111.838,3112.577,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3112.577,3117.17,"Well that's from the railroad standpoint, the railroad will follow the doctor's advice, but the railroad --"
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3117.17,3119.029,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3119.029,3119.617,Right.
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3119.617,3135.195,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3135.195,3139.226,You mean this 1959 agreement?
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3139.226,3160.636,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3160.636,3163.265,Not before this agreement Your Honor.
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3169.104,3170.38,He did not have you say --
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3170.38,3170.628,Right.
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3170.628,3173.571,-- in the absence of some showing of what you call bad faith.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3173.571,3175.119,"Right, the absence of bad faith."
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3175.119,3184.626,Otherwise under the agreement the determination by the railroad's position is conclusive upon it and he does -- and he is without a remedy.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3184.626,3185.154,Right.
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3185.154,3195.945,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3195.945,3213.553,"Well, Your Honor it wasn't under the agreement, our position is that since there's nothing in the agreement which takes away the right of the carrier to decide the physical capacity of the engineer or to review its doctor on that decision that therefore there is no agreement restriction."
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3213.553,3215.43,Did you have an agreement with this one.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3215.43,3216.984,"No, we did not Your Honor."
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3216.984,3217.969,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3217.969,3222.535,"That's -- we had a collective bargaining agreement, yes, but not relating to that subject."
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3222.535,3227.449,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3227.449,3228.444,Yes.
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3228.444,3234.626,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3234.626,3237.297,Well our position -- yes.
1965.27,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3237.297,3253.496,Well you say that they can discharge him (Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3253.496,3255.09,"Well, Your Honor our position is that that --"
1965.27,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3255.09,3256.992,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3256.992,3268.157,"Well first of all, I would think it was just cause but actually I don't think it comes under that provision because I don't think that physical fitness, I think that's an act of God, it's not something that the carrier is doing --"
1965.27,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3268.157,3271.636,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3271.636,3272.023,Well --
1965.27,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3272.023,3273.837,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3273.837,3279.155,Well it would -- the doctor making the decision who would be to man with the --
1965.27,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3279.155,3281.015,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3281.015,3285.821,"I guess so Your Honor, so far as we are concerned."
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3290.6,3293.054,What I don't quite get.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3314.582,3315.491,Layoff.
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3315.491,3316.134,And the layoff.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3316.134,3317.55,That is seniority in reversed order of layoff.
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3317.55,3321.707,"Yeah, now that's the posture in which you've got to the board."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3321.707,3322.448,Yes.
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3322.448,3331.004,Now why is it you say the board's decision was not a decision of the contractual claims made by Gunther?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3331.004,3337.884,Because we feel that the contractual claims had to do with seniority --
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3337.884,3339.425,"Excuse me, that wasn't my question."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3339.425,3339.559,I'm sorry.
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3339.559,3349.351,"My question is why do you say that the board's decision, favorable to Gunther was not rested on a resolution of one of those contractual claims?"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3349.351,3355.126,"First, because the board itself setup what its test was, good faith."
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3368.944,3371.148,But they did find in Gunther's favor.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3371.148,3379.104,They found in Gunther's favor by saying â€œWe will just turn this over to a panel of three doctors and whatever they say goes.
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3379.104,3394.592,"And is it your position that nothing in the agreement, even though these contractual -- this Gunther's claim was rested on contract provision, none of those embraced in the authority and the board to delegate the reexamination --"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3394.592,3394.898,True.
1965.27,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3394.898,3396.918,"-- to a doctor -- of three-doctor board, is that it?"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3396.918,3398.683,Yes.
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3398.683,3406.737,"Well, I have seen this and this suggests that the board didn't even purport to be relying on the contract in doing this."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3406.737,3408.611,That's true.
1965.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3408.611,3424.463,"You don't -- you say, you suggest to us that we should not accept this adjustment board's decision as being rested on the contract, as being an interpretation of the contract as claimed in the presentation."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3424.463,3426.528,That's correct.
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3426.528,3438.823,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3438.823,3439.461,Right.

1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3443.594,3456.72,"Well, at that point Your Honor, page 43 of the record there's an exhibit which is a black book, which is the rules of the company, and just cause is --"
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3456.72,3457.101,What?
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3457.101,3469.167,"The rules of the company, general rules and regulations of transportation department, those rules set forth all of the things that govern the employee such as the --"

1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3493.311,3506.568,"Well, Your Honor no, there's no such rule but Your Honor we feel that that's not covered by any agreement provision and if it was covered by the rules of course, the rules are not part of collective bargaining agreement."

1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3520.441,3521.325,Right.

1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3537.391,3543.151,"Well, Your Honor of course the question is what was the opinion of the doctor?"
1965.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3544.063,3561.176,(Inaudible)
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3561.176,3566.44,"Well, Your Honor that's bad faith again but in the absence of bad faith, I would say, yes."

1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3595.787,3601.35,"Well, Your Honor, I think it's a question of physical condition as against the exercise of seniority under the agreement."
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3606.56,3627.967,"Mr. Gregory, what can prove this as to the only way it could be turned to the carrier and remove petitioner from service and good faith on the basis of a fair standard of fitness was to have petitioner examined by a neutral board of three physicians."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3629.989,3635.762,"Well, nothing is wrong with it as except this that some --"
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3635.762,3637.994,That you lost before the board.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3637.994,3638.289,Well --
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3638.289,3639.851,Show them that they were wrong about it.
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3639.851,3646.71,"No, Your Honor the thing that's wrong is that it's a majority of two out of three."
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3672.602,3683.518,"Well, the board said it had two -- there were two rights under the contract, one accruing to the carrier and one accruing to the employee."
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3683.518,3684.012,True.
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3684.012,3693.271,"First, that the carrier in a fair way could determine who is fit to act --"
1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3693.271,3693.818,Right.
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3693.818,3695.658,-- and be employed by it.

1965.27,1,44715,waldron_a_gregory,,3738.908,3749.136,"Well, the thing is wrong with it Your Honor is that it was a fashioning of a remedy that wasn't provided for in the agreement."
1965.27,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3799.052,3801.021,Very well.
