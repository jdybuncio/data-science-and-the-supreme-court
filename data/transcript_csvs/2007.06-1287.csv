2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.168,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1287, CSX Transportation v. the Georgia State Board of Equalization."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,10.369,24.52,": Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress in what is now Section 11501(b)(1) crafted what this Court described as a straightforward approach to determining whether a State is unlawfully taxing railroad property."
2007.06-1287,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,96.319,105.875,Is it realistic to think that you can calculate with any degree of precision what the true market value of CSX's property is?
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,135.851,140.114,"No, I think it's pretty clear that Congress did not adopt that particular formulation."
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,167.85,177.47,And do you want the district court to in addition determine which methodology most accurately reflects that true market value?
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,177.47,178.004,"No, I don't--"
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,178.004,182.86,You want to be able to challenge the state's chosen methodology for determining market value?
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,182.86,183.25,--Yes.
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,189.465,202.228,"So if the, so if the district court says this methodology, Methodology A, most accurately yields true market value, that is giving rise to a Federal rule of determining value, isn't it?"
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,202.228,202.618,No.
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,210.677,212.959,"Well, I don't see how it varies based on the particular circumstances."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,234.403,236.321,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's not accurate."
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,257.125,258.845,"That happens, that happens once every 25 years."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,274.073,274.557,Right.
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,285.74,295.438,"So if a district court says in one case Method A is the best way to get market value and another district court says Method B and they both appeal, the court of appeals is going to have to resolve that conflict, isn't it?"
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,295.438,298.999,"--Well, at the end of the day the district court's going to make a valuation."
2007.06-1287,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,309.492,315.446,I think you said that CSX has properties in 15 States that use the unit method of calculation.
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,315.446,316.241,I believe that's correct.
2007.06-1287,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,316.241,328.503,"So if you challenge all of those there could be 15 different district court findings on true market value, and so within each circuit the court of appeals would have to decide which district court was correct as a matter of fact?"
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,328.503,331.127,"Sure, Justice Alito, that's exactly what could happen."
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,364.924,375.562,"Well, but it's already been pointed out if the range is a variable of $4 billion I think it probably is worth their while to challenge what they think is a low valuation."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,375.562,376.03,Yes.
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,405.83,419.482,"What if we were to adopt a different approach which said that you can challenge the methodology, methodology, when different methodologies are used, but if the State is using the same methodology that's their choice?"
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,426.369,432.912,"Well, I don't think there's ever a reason why the Federal court has to adopt a single methodology and I don't think that's what Congress intended."
2007.06-1287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,451.937,456.449,"I suppose there are a lot of valuation cases under the Takings Clause, aren't there?"
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,456.449,458.933,"Yes, Justice Scalia, there are."
2007.06-1287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,458.933,461.511,Is there a standard Federal rule for how you evaluate--
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,461.511,474.803,"If you read footnote 8 of the district court's opinion, the district judge says, if this were a typical valuation case what I would have done is I would have listened to the railroad, I would have listened to the State and I would have made a judgment as to what I think is the right--"
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,474.803,476.145,Isn't that how it works in utility rate regulation?
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,482.376,486.674,--But that's because there's usually... which rates affect the taking of property?
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,486.674,487.548,"--Yes, if it's challenged--"
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,487.548,488.78,Or what the rates ought to be?
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,488.78,491.061,--The rate of return in a public utility.
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,491.061,496.762,But that's because that's regulated by a Federal agency that formulates a very precise approach typically.
2007.06-1287,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,504.183,506.96,I was going to ask this question.
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,528.749,532.388,It's permitted for them to use different methodologies because typically they do.
2007.06-1287,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,543.931,552.49,So is a large part of the argument you would make that other utilities are comparable or not comparable to a railroad?
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,552.49,560.956,"You would make that argument, but you'd also make an argument as to sort of what data are available in any particular case to allow a particular methodology to be used."
2007.06-1287,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,560.956,574.635,Suppose an accounting journal or some prestigious group of accountants and tax appraisers came up with a new theory for evaluating railroad property and it was conceded by all to be highly accurate.
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,579.494,583.382,At the end of the day the test here is purely a results-driven test.
2007.06-1287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.767,596.815,Mr. Phillips--
2007.06-1287,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,596.815,607.34,"So that if had the Platonic, the ideal valuation method, the State could use it only if it ended up with the right ratio?"
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,607.34,614.009,"--Well, the State can use any... the State can assess any way it wants to in defense of its ultimate outcome."
2007.06-1287,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,614.009,615.744,But in the end it has to have the right ratio.
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,615.744,617.616,At the outcome it has to have the right ratio.
2007.06-1287,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,621.632,629.942,"Well, Congress uses the word ""true market value"" and under this hypothetical I come very close to true market value, and you say it doesn't work."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,629.942,635.222,"Well, my guess is that the district judge in that situation would probably say that that is the true market value."
2007.06-1287,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,645.934,652.964,"I thought your... I thought your submission was that even if is true market value for the railroad, the ratio still has to be in line if the methodology is different."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,652.964,653.479,Right.
2007.06-1287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.707,668.955,"--Mr. Phillips, could I come back to this question of whether or not there's going to be a uniform Federal rule or not."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,675.141,676.217,"I believe that is, yes."
2007.06-1287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.217,679.781,And it would be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard by the court of appeals?
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,679.781,680.81,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.81,697.586,"And if there were various methodologies that were possible and this was one of the ones that was ballpark at least reasonable, would the court of appeals have any basis for reversing the, how could you say it's--"
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,697.586,700.57,"More often than not, my answer would be no, there wouldn't be any basis."
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,700.57,701.287,"Well, more often than not."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,731.071,740.629,"But the protection that we're seeking, Justice, to answer Justice Scalia's question, is to have the independent de novo assessment by the district court."
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,743.768,755.389,"What if the district court... what if there is one methodology that gets you an answer within 20 percent margin of error, up or down, and there is another methodology that gives you an answer with a 5 percent margin of error, up or down?"
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,759.527,761.024,"Well, it depends on what you're asking me."
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,764.334,765.726,"Well, of course you can challenge it."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,765.726,771.501,--because the question for the district court is not with deference to how the State is evaluating this issue.
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,779.421,789.341,"My question... my question assumes that the methodology leads to a value that is either 20 percent higher or lower in one case, and 5 percent higher or lower in the other case."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,789.341,797.226,"As I understand the way this statute applies, this is not a statute that worries about sort of how you get to the numbers."
2007.06-1287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,825.138,828.215,May I approach the same issue this way?
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,842.96,845.097,"--Well, in some ways it's difficult to know."
2007.06-1287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,846.864,848.645,"Well, what should the reasons be?"
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,848.645,852.86,"--Well, I think they should be applying the professional standards of appraisal."
2007.06-1287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,852.86,863.608,"Well, but the professional standards, I take it, are not simply rules that one can grab out of thin air depending on one's mood."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,864.31,866.4,"Trust me, having read them, you can't grab them out of thin air."
2007.06-1287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,866.4,881.194,--Doesn't one have to choose the methodology based on some factual determination on... which would support a conclusion that this is a better methodology for this case and others--
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,881.194,881.553,To be sure.
2007.06-1287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,881.553,882.067,--for this case than others?
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,882.067,891.282,"And Justice Souter, that's driven largely by what data are available and what do we know about how these methods have been applied in the past to value this particular property."
2007.06-1287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,891.282,896.044,"But at the end of the day, it's a determination which is based upon facts."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,900.965,902.466,There is also an element of judgment.
2007.06-1287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,902.466,920.224,"Would it make sense then for a reviewing court to review the basis upon which the methodology was chosen, and if in fact there is a reasonable basis for choosing methodology A rather than methodology B, accept it and defer it to that extent?"
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,920.224,923.333,"In a different world, that would make perfect sense."
2007.06-1287,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.999,931.997,--I'm not sure what his question is.
2007.06-1287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,935.574,942.897,I'm talking about reviewing the judgment of the State authority in choosing one method rather than another.
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,942.897,943.119,Right.
2007.06-1287,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,959.204,976.211,"But we don't... we don't know, there is no way of telling whether there is a variation, or there isn't a variation under the congressional formula, unless we first have a formula for determining what the value... what the true value of the railroad property is."
2007.06-1287,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,996.655,997.513,"No, I don't think so."
2007.06-1287,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1011.181,1012.445,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1022.707,1037.14,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: Congress did not, in the 4-R Act, establish a right to obtain in Federal court administrative review of State valuations."
2007.06-1287,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1092.727,1104.877,"What if you take my variation on it, and that is, we don't defer it to the State's choice in the abstract, i.e. if we... if there are 10 methods, as long as it's one of the 10 it's okay?"
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1121.494,1133.052,"Well, I think that it would, to a large extent, undermine the right and protection that Congress intended."
2007.06-1287,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1144.22,1147.078,Your point is well taken.
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1175.584,1202.603,"Well, I think that to call the weighing of the three evidences of value that might be generated by cost income, sales methods, a choice of methodology to which the Federal court is required to defer is a misnomer, because it really is an exercise of judgment with respect to the facts of the case and the reliability of the data available."
2007.06-1287,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1202.603,1214.583,"But doesn't the judgment get exercised in determining what facts are good reasons for selecting this methodology, or this variant of methodology, for this particular case?"
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1214.583,1235.247,"I think Your Honor is correct, that the... because you're pointing out that really, the choice among methodologies is more a question of what are the facts on the ground, what is the reliable, available data that could be used in generating these different evidences of value."
2007.06-1287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.048,1276.838,"Even if you don't agree with Justice Souter's test for the district court review of the State, might you agree with it as applied to the court of appeals review of the district court's job?"
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1276.838,1284.022,I do believe that the court of appeals review is reviewing a determination of fact by the district court.
2007.06-1287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1290.054,1292.457,"Well, are you going to answer my question, yes or no?"
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1292.457,1303.5,"--I do believe... yes, that the review of the appellate court of the district court's finding is different than the review of the district court's review of--"
2007.06-1287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1303.5,1304.596,I didn't ask whether it was different.
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1319.386,1327.365,"--Well, again, I don't think that it's fair to assume that the district court would have used a single methodology."
2007.06-1287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.864,1330.472,"Well, a combination of methodologies."
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1336.673,1338.736,"--Well, I--"
2007.06-1287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.736,1341.688,Is it reasonable?
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1349.154,1362.553,"--Well, it would be, as Justice Souter suggested, a question of whether those methodologies... whether the evidence in the case indicated that those methodologies were reliable indications of value."
2007.06-1287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.553,1363.677,--were reasonable?
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1365.693,1368.52,It would have to be reasonable for the court to have relied on them--
2007.06-1287,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.52,1377.517,"Is it clearly erroneous if it may not be the very best, but it's ballpark and there is disagreement as to what the very best would be?"
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1377.517,1384.184,"--I do believe that's true, and that is in the nature of the appellate court's review of the factual finding by the district court."
2007.06-1287,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.184,1384.531,May I ask this question?
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1407.144,1408.755,It would be permissible.
2007.06-1287,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1410.658,1413.832,There's something not quite right about that.
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1430.323,1431.384,That's right.
2007.06-1287,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1439.725,1443.928,Were all of the values that were arrived at in this case within the ballpark?
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1443.928,1448.597,"Well, I... whether they are in the ballpark is not the test."
2007.06-1287,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1460.514,1463.451,Were all the valuations used here reliable indications of true market value?
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1463.451,1470.589,"Well, they were... Respondent argues that they were all reasonable methodologies."
2007.06-1287,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1482.132,1482.725,"Well, there is no way to tell."
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1486.956,1488.597,I don't think that that--
2007.06-1287,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1488.597,1499.388,"And so the district court has to engage in purely fictional enterprise, and say yes, all the methodologies give you a range of 6 to 12 billion, but I think the answer is 8.2 billion."
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1499.388,1512.306,"--Well, Your Honor, I do believe that there are bases upon which one can distinguish the reliability of the stock and debt method in this case, and the income that the two parties used--"
2007.06-1287,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1512.306,1525.974,"Would you disagree if had you 10 totally disinterested experts, not paid by either side, and they engaged in this, that they would not all come to the same number, that there would be a range and probably a fairly significant range?"
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1525.974,1527.627,--There would be a range.
2007.06-1287,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1532.221,1535.844,Could the district court appoint a special master to help her?
2007.06-1287,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1535.844,1549.54,"--Well, the district... as in the Tyler Regional Planning case, the Court indicated that district courts frequently have to undertake complicated valuation questions, and they rely on the testimony of experts."
2007.06-1287,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.273,1636.646,"Thank you, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1641.458,1644.956,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.81,1688.919,"It seems to be what it says though, isn't it?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1688.919,1691.98,"Your Honor, I don't think that's what it plainly says."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.98,1693.119,What's the language?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1694.855,1697.37,"Well, it requires the comparison of--"
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.37,1701.351,"No, it doesn't require... what it say the district court is supposed to find?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1701.351,1706.117,"--Well, it has to find the assessed value of the railroad, the true market value of the railroads--"
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.117,1709.131,It's supposed to find the true market value of the railroads.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1715.706,1724.685,"--Well, I think in large part, the railroad's argument is it places on the one word ""true"" and the term ""true market value"" a weight that it cannot bear."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.573,1751.019,It's a very strange way of saying the district judge is to... is to ask whether the State has used one of a number of reasonable methods of determining the market value.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1759.61,1768.933,"Your Honor, I think if Congress had said the district court is to find fair market value or the market value it would seem... it would seem less strange."
2007.06-1287,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1782.71,1787.254,Why would your position be any stronger if it used fair market value?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1787.254,1790.253,"Well, Your Honor I think in the same way that CSX--"
2007.06-1287,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1790.253,1791.52,Or any weaker?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1791.52,1803.81,"--Well, Your Honor, the way that the railroad says you have to look for the one value that's true, I would say that if the statute said ""fair market value"" the question is there could be many market values that are fair."
2007.06-1287,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1803.81,1806.091,"What do you mean, we have false ""fair market value""?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1807.355,1809.106,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1814.682,1827.489,"Isn't the point not that anyone is denying that there can be a range, that there... everybody agrees that there is not here, simply because there is not one methodology, there is not an exact science which is operating?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1854.352,1862.272,"I would say that's true, Your Honor, but I would say that the statute does not plainly lead to that result."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1862.272,1867.284,How could it say it more plainly than using the criterion of truth?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1867.284,1868.831,"Well, again, Your Honor--"
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1868.831,1872.86,"Truth... whatever truth means, it doesn't mean deferring to a party in interest."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1874.673,1882.561,"--Well, I don't believe, Your Honor, that it is possible to say with any type of absolute certainty or precision that one--"
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1882.561,1883.934,We all accept that.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1895.991,1898.491,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think that it does."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1913.687,1918.998,"So Congress in effect was engaging in Pontius Pilate's exercise, what is truth?"
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.998,1921.56,"I was expecting you to say, that what is truth?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1922.45,1946.642,"Your Honor, I would say that the statute does not plainly require that if a State has determined the market value of the railroad by correctly applying a reasonable valuation method, that the statute an ambiguously allows the taxpayer to come in and challenge that... not just the application of that method but the... but the methodology itself."
2007.06-1287,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1946.642,1968.525,"And if you limit it to the application and not the methodology, then Congress's overriding goal was there was a problem with overevaluation of the railroad's property, and Congress was responding to that problem of overevaluating the property."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,1985.703,2005.088,"Your Honor, I think what CSX would like in this case is to turn the Federal district court, the judge into a board of equalization who has to... who has to consider every... each and every objection to each and every decision that the State that is made in valuing its property."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2005.088,2016.24,But what you are saying is that the... that the court is simply being turned into a grade school math teacher who looks to see whether the sums are added up correctly.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2018.552,2019.707,"Well, no, Your Honor."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2049.88,2061.346,"In other words, there was... there was a contest about the judgment used by the State in selecting one point of datum in its calculation, right?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2061.346,2064.033,That among other--
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2064.033,2064.485,All right.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2082.275,2095.817,"--Well, we think it is... the difference, Your Honor, is, while we believe that a State should have... should have the right to choose among the various reasonable types of valuation methods that can be used in a case like this--"
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2095.817,2097.206,I know that's why you think.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2109.766,2119.387,"--Well, because it's one thing to say that the State can choose the valuation formula; it's another thing that the State is able to dictate how you fill in the variables."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2124.384,2132.847,"Each one, as I understand it, is a question of judgment about what is appropriate on the facts of this case, or these kinds of cases."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2132.847,2138.845,"The trouble is you can't find a... it is a line, but it's not a line you can derive from true market value."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2145.657,2176.767,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe what you have to find in the statute, because this is a limited exception to the rule that Federal courts will not interfere with the State's administration of its own tax system, is... I think you need to find something in the statute which plainly allows the Federal courts to get into the minutia of not just the way in which the discounted cash flow formula has been applied or not the way in which a stock-and-debt formula has been applied, but its choice at the... at the very beginning to use those methodologies."
2007.06-1287,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.767,2185.529,"The reason that they do that is because none of these methods comes even close to working out what the company is really worth because, if we had, we wouldn't be here."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2210.58,2227.543,"Well, I guess... Your Honor, I think it's specifically because there is that range of value, that if Congress had intended to... that the district courts would examine each and every decision made by the States deciding it's going to use this method--"
2007.06-1287,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2227.543,2228.935,They're not going to do that.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2277.445,2290.47,"--Well, I think... I think the result of that, Your Honor, is... is you're going to have a Federal court setting a Federal standard of valuation for Georgia."
2007.06-1287,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.47,2302.452,"What they're going to do is they're simply going to let people present the evidence as you've heard, which will have 15 valuation methods if they want, all serving each as checks on the other."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2307.401,2313.585,"Well, Your Honor, that's what... that's what CSX is... is arguing here today, but that's not what they argued in the district court."
2007.06-1287,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2314.463,2329.191,"I thought... I thought you conceded that that was what it would be, because you said that the Federal court would be turned into a board of equalization, and a board of equalization is not making grand law for setting precedent."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2329.191,2343.635,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, what CSX asked in this case is that... they have taken the position, and I believe they still take it for this Court, that a stock-and-debt method will never give a reliable estimate of the value of the railroad."
2007.06-1287,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2347.948,2360.707,I think what they want is to be able to attack the methodology and not be limited to the application of whatever methodology the State prefers.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2360.707,2379.733,"That's correct, Your Honor, but the point I'm that trying to make is that what they... what they want to see come out of this case is the State of Georgia... not simply that the State of Georgia couldn't use the stock-and-debt methodology for this tax year; they want a ruling that basically says it can't use it for any year."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.733,2384.794,"No, I don't think they're not going to get that from this Court, any more than they could get it from the Court of Appeals."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2411.453,2415.749,"But... but Your Honor, that is what they tried to get from the district court in this case."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2415.749,2418.889,"Maybe they did, but they're not going to get it here--"
2007.06-1287,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.887,2422.777,May I ask this question about your position?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2443.457,2444.454,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1287,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2444.454,2446.86,"Well, that's what... I'm sorry."
2007.06-1287,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.86,2448.124,I just wanted to be sure.
2007.06-1287,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2448.124,2462.946,"I thought that would be part of your reply to Justice Breyer, that you had five different methodologies here and you chose the lowest one; and the question really is how many more methodologies do you have to look at if you're going to choose the lowest one in each case."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2462.946,2467.43,"Well, and that is what we did in this case, Your Honor."
2007.06-1287,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2467.43,2474.925,"If it had been... I'm sorry... if it had been Dickerson's methodology at the last step to choose the highest value, would that be reasonable?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2474.925,2478.923,"Again, Your Honor, I think... I think a State could do that."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.369,2508.883,"This State appraiser as I understand it had never done an appraisal before of... of this magnitude, right?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2508.883,2510.162,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2540.257,2560.298,"I'm looking for the footnote, but I... I was, I was impressed by what seemed to me the... the vast difference in... in qualifications and experience of the... of the State appraiser and of the expert who was brought in by the railroads at the trial."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2574.12,2574.619,--No.
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.377,2596.173,Did you have a response... did you have a response to that footnote?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2596.941,2597.924,--Yes.
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.704,2599.157,--I'm sorry.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2599.859,2600.72,We have our own footnote.
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2600.72,2605.091,"A little footnote battle here, right?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2605.091,2607.06,"That is footnote 3, Your Honor."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.06,2607.778,Of yours?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2607.778,2608.794,Of our brief.
2007.06-1287,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2608.794,2626.865,"You know, if this comes down as it probably will in every case, to a battle of competing experts, are you aware of any other area where we say that a district court cannot look at the methodology used by an expert in determining whether or not to give credence to the expert's opinion?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2626.865,2628.628,"No, I'm not, Your Honor."
2007.06-1287,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2628.628,2631.955,So why should we create a special rule here for the State?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2631.955,2657.351,"Well, this is a... this is a special statute and again I think what CSX is asking for this... for this Court to do is create a special rule for it which gives it, unique among taxpayers, as far as we are aware, the right to come into Federal court and challenge each and every decision that the State has made in valuing property for property taxes and have the Federal court redetermine that value."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2657.351,2673.753,"Well, if... I take it to determine how far you could go with that, I take it though in your view if the State's appraiser had never done an appraisal before in his life, if he were plucked off the street by the State and said, you know,"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2680.671,2690.447,"Well, the district court could certainly thoroughly examine the way in which the... the reasonable valuation methodologies that the State selected were applied."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2690.447,2691.449,Exactly.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2697.4,2702.021,"Well... well, Your Honor, we think the methodology has to at least be reasonable."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2702.021,2705.582,"Well, it's... it's one of the recognized methodologies."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2705.582,2707.675,I think if the State has used--
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2707.675,2709.613,It happens to be the one that gives the highest number.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2726.292,2728.354,--I'd say that's correct.
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.117,2735.162,And that's what you have here.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2749.408,2750.453,--The--
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.453,2758.778,"But the whole issue here is that that method of valuation, however expert he is at it, is not proper here."
2007.06-1287,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2762.826,2765.104,I thought both sides agreed that the unit--
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2765.104,2769.821,"Was one of the ones, yes; but that's not the only one."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2771.322,2775.788,--Both sides agree that the unit rule is appropriate in this case.
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.846,2794.233,And it's different methodologies under the unit rule.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2797.766,2798.733,--Than the railroad did.
2007.06-1287,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2799.638,2803.764,--I guess the term methodology is confusing because you could think it means unit rule--
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2803.764,2804.263,Right.
2007.06-1287,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.263,2810.072,"--or you could think how under the unit rule, what is the--"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2810.072,2811.149,"That's right, Your Honor."
2007.06-1287,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2880.67,2892.164,"What if what if the State elected to use reproduction cost as its valuation method, which I guess everybody agrees vastly overstates the value of the railroad?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2892.164,2899.425,"Well I think the problem, Your Honor, with reproduction cost is... is how to... is how to accurately account for obsolescence."
2007.06-1287,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2901.66,2906.874,"So if there are problems with a particular methodology, the methodology can be challenged?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2906.874,2921.213,"--It's possible, Your Honor, that a reproduction cost methodology might... might so inadequately deal with the issue of obsolescence that you just have to say that's not a reasonable methodology, as applied to railroads."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2921.213,2923.15,How could you say it on your theory?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2923.15,2924.102,Pardon me?
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2924.102,2926.976,How could you say it consistently with your position here?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2926.976,2935.441,"Well, I think, Your Honor, the court is allowed to examine whether you have a... whether the State has used a reasonable methodology."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2935.441,2947.062,Then why doesn't the court have an opportunity or the right to examine whether any particular methodology is reasonable as applied to this taxpayer and this kind of property at this time?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2947.062,2953.481,"Well, I think that goes to the question of whether you have properly applied a reasonable valuation method, and there is--"
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2953.481,2970.398,"I thought... I thought you were saying that the reproduction method had such severe problems associated with it that it simply would not be a fair methodology to use and at least a reviewing court, a district court could... could draw that conclusion."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,2972.132,2985.203,"--Well, I think it depends, Your Honor, on if you have a reproduction cost method that you have applied to property that... property that has only just recently been purchased, then I don't think you're going to have a problem with it at all, even--"
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2985.203,3000.571,"We are talking about the railroads like CSX, and I thought your answer was that a... a district court could conclude that as applied in a case like this, that there are so many problems that it simply would not be a reasonable valuation method."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3000.571,3002.619,--I... I think that is possible.
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3002.619,3003.258,All right.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3005.696,3007.664,"Well again, Your Honor, I think--"
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3007.664,3014.145,"If you can do that, why can't it do what... what your brother is saying it should do in this case?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3014.145,3025.403,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that in... in... in... again, I don't think that is the argument they have made in this case."
2007.06-1287,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3025.403,3028.277,"Well, let's assume I'm making that argument now in my question."
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3032.372,3039.616,"Well again, I think that goes to whether the application is going to be... is going to be reasonable in the particular situation."
2007.06-1287,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3039.616,3040.038,Right.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3059.016,3060.857,"Well, I--"
2007.06-1287,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3060.857,3067.011,--keeping in mind all the methodologies here range from 8... 6 billion to 12 billion.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3067.011,3076.369,"--And I... I think, if you looked at the mid-point of the ranges that each... each of the appraisers had, you would have a variation, maybe, of about 20 percent either way."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3091.207,3095.672,"--Mr. Calvert, can you tell me how this thing works, or how it may work in the future?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3113.15,3131.033,"What happens, Your Honor, is that the railroad returns are filed with the State; and there is a period of time during which the State examines those returns, takes the evaluation methodologies that it has selected, applies it to the data that it has for those particular companies, comes up with numbers."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3141.999,3142.545,Okay.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3150.355,3151.494,"--Typically, Your Honor."
2007.06-1287,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3151.494,3152.118,Okay.
2007.06-1287,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3152.118,3159.351,I take it this question about the unit rule... I take it Georgia is figuring out what the entire value of the railroad is throughout the country.
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3164.724,3165.769,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2007.06-1287,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3165.769,3173.499,"Let's say, do Tennessee and Mississippi have to also apply the unit rule to value the property of this particular railroad?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3173.499,3178.045,I think... I think the majority of States that value railroad property use the unit rule.
2007.06-1287,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3178.045,3182.183,Is it admissible evidence to find out what other... figures other States have come up with?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3186.932,3188.04,I--
2007.06-1287,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.04,3189.588,--if you all use the unit rule?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3189.588,3197.866,"--We are, Your Honor, though if a State is using a different methodology to determine the unit rule, I think you would probably expect--"
2007.06-1287,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3197.866,3205.315,"What if the evidence shows that 49 States have come up with a valuation of $5 billion, and you use a method that comes up with $8 billion?"
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3207.487,3209.705,"--I think it probably would be, Your Honor."
2007.06-1287,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3209.705,3213.749,And does the record contain any such evidence in this case?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3215.781,3225.573,"I think the evidence in this case was that the State of Georgia's unit value, at least within the southeast States, was... was the largest number."
2007.06-1287,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3225.573,3226.84,Was the highest?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3226.84,3227.776,That's correct.
2007.06-1287,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3227.776,3237.365,Doesn't that raise some suspicion about maybe they have a different approach than is commonly applied seeking precisely the same answer to precisely the same question?
2007.06-1287,2,44220,warren_r_calvert,,3237.365,3254.062,"Well, Your Honor, I think our... our response is that we believe that in 2002 what the State did was not only to make some changes in its valuation methodologies, but it also made a fairly significant change in the income numbers that the State was using to apply its discounted cash flow analysis."
2007.06-1287,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3449.186,3450.59,"Thank you, Mr. Calvert."
2007.06-1287,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3452.902,3455.121,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1287,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3519.03,3522.5,I mean I assume that's in the normal context of the adversary process.
2007.06-1287,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3527.62,3528.373,No.
2007.06-1287,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3528.373,3531.887,It can decide which of the presentations is closer to true market value.
2007.06-1287,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3531.887,3532.573,Absolutely.
2007.06-1287,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3604.542,3606.289,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips, the case is submitted."
