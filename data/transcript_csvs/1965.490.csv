1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,24.263,28.472,"For the petitioner Your Honor, Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard."
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,250.7,256.11,Is there any question about whether this form was a human being or not?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,256.11,258.158,I think the inference is that it was a human being.
1965.490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,269.661,276.51,Is there an inference that there was more than one person if he was grappling with the -- this form as you call it and was struck from behind?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,279.158,281.566,Very strong inference that there was more than one person Your Honors.
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,309.44,311.888,That was a man was it?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,311.888,320.273,"There is no question this time, but -- that this was a man at one time described as having had bushy hair, a bushy-headed man."
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,359.96,363.075,Did they ever find the t-shirt?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,363.075,364.187,A t-shirt was found.
1965.490,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,436.864,441.079,Who would toss this accusation and who asked him to take the lie detector?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,441.079,449.719,"Deputy Sheriff Carl Rossbach I believe was among the first who told him that he was a suspect and said, “Will you take a lie detector test?”"
1965.490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,607.735,612.748,The City of Cleveland didn't have a juris -- how did they have jurisdiction?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,612.748,624.709,I believe they were called in by the town of Bay Village to take over the investigation on the ground that Bay Village didn't feel itself competent to handle the immense problems of technology and of the difficulties involved Your Honor.
1965.490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,624.709,627.998,So this is a request by the Bay Village police was it?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,627.998,634.843,It appears to have eventually formulated into a request by the town counsel of Bay Village.
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,634.843,638.793,Is this little village in the same county as Cleveland?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,638.793,644.517,It is Your Honor in Cuyahoga County located in Cleveland.
1965.490,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,645.242,646.033,Mr. Bailey --
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,646.033,646.332,Yes Your Honor.
1965.490,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,646.332,657.842,-- when you referred to the view of the editor that the fix was in I thought you said but I don't want to look it up now but is that in the record?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,657.842,659.516,He did not use those precise words.
1965.490,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,670.668,672.463,Is that -- is that in the record?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,672.463,674.115,"Yes Your Honor that is, that is in --"
1965.490,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,674.115,677.473,In terms of a editorial or testimony?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,677.473,690.845,"No Your Honor, the editor of this newspaper has written a book called an autobiography entitled The Years Were Good, chapter 26 in its entirety is devoted to the Sheppard case and it appears in our petition for certiorari at approximately page RS 180."
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,696.101,700.266,[Inaudible]
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,700.266,704.217,"It is Your Honor, the petition for certiorari."
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,705.672,708.971,[Inaudible]
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,708.971,710.524,"Well, it's page RS 180."
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,713.18,714.622,[Inaudible]
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,714.622,717.23,"Yes Your Honor, The Years Were Good, S180."
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,717.23,718.023,180?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,718.023,721.267,Almost at the end of the petition.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,721.267,731.974,[Inaudible]
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,731.974,745.322,I should like to point out at this juncture that the police immediately claimed that their inability to interrogate Dr. Sheppard was the Bugaboo in the case and that he would not come down to police headquarters.
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,811.562,823.818,Is there any objection to that particular editorial which calls upon him to have an inquest following a murder?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,823.818,828.936,"If it had occurred an isolation Your Honor, I would think it would afford no ground or relief or complaint."
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,844.694,849.265,"Mr. Bailey, I gather that's the editorial Quit Stalling, Bring him in, is that it?"
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,849.265,849.856,No Your Honor.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,873.577,882.45,"Incidentally, was -- among the motions after trial itself, addressed to excessive publicity."
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,888.651,897.809,"All we know about the trial record Your Honor is that Mr. Corrigan, the defense counsel offered many newspapers and other documents to the trial judge in support of this change of venue and that they were excluded."
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,897.809,899.669,You know whether these are among --
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,899.669,901.547,I do not.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,901.547,906.075,"But I gather all of these exhibits or exhibits which were introduced at the habeas hearing, was it?"
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,906.075,907.331,They were Your Honor.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,913.268,922.318,Was it fair to say then that the record on the habeas hearing is quite a different one on the record at the trial itself adjust to the excessive --
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,922.318,923.252,I think no Your Honor.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,930.182,934.329,Do you have any idea what was before us in the petition for certiorari in the way the record is put.
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,934.329,937.311,"Yes Your Honor, this same editorial was before he was in that petition."
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,944.132,948.883,"No, what I'm speaking of is the direct review petitioned back in ‘56."
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,948.883,950.141,(Voice Overlap) ‘52.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,950.141,957.122,So most of the material it is now here a habeas hearing was also before us in ‘56.
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,957.122,959.381,The words of the article.
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,965.08,971.647,Could all of it been -- have been presented at the petition -- original petition for certiorari?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,971.647,976.7,Much of what you now consider Your Honors was before you then in that original (Voice Overlap) -- yes.
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,976.7,980.068,My question was could all of it have been presented?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,980.068,981.157,"Yes it certainly, it could Your Honor."
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,982.508,985.337,"If it wasn't, just wasn't done."
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,985.337,989.299,I think that Mr. Corrigan included most of that upon which I now rely --
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,989.299,990.097,I see.
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,990.097,991.171,-- as a matter of --
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,991.171,1000.324,Can you think of any significant difference between what he relied on in 1956 when he came here in which he rely on now?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1000.324,1011.75,"It appears that at the time he filed his petition, Mr. Seltzer's book stating his role in this case and the risk that he took deliberately was not in print so that was not available."
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1029.807,1035.896,"Well, are there any issues raised here that were not raised in the petition in 1956?"
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1035.896,1036.318,Oh yes.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1039.532,1040.95,They are what?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1040.95,1047.779,One is the bias of a trial judge which was not known to any of counsel for petitioner until the habeas petition was almost a year old.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1047.779,1049.564,Now is evidence taken on that issue --
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1049.564,1050.162,It was Your Honor.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1050.162,1050.914,-- in the habeas.
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1050.914,1051.425,It was.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1051.425,1052.781,"Now, he's now dead is he?"
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1052.781,1054.178,The trial judge is now deceased.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1054.178,1056.081,And he was at the time of that hearing?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1056.081,1057.014,He was Your Honor.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1057.014,1058.148,What's the other one?
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1058.148,1060.375,Did he die before the petition was filed?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1060.375,1062.444,He did Your Honor.
1965.490,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1078.737,1088.802,"But may I ask, is it fair to say that there were at least no records made on either of those issues on the application for direct review in 1956?"
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1088.802,1090.666,That is correct Your Honor.
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1092.029,1108.187,Did I understand you to say Mr. Bailey that you -- it's your position that the inquest was unconstitutional because it was for the purpose of compelling Dr. Sheppard to testify against himself?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1108.187,1116.202,"The extent that it appears to have been for that purpose, I think it -- to have been an improper proceeding especially in view of the fact the defense counsel was ejected from it forcibly."
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1135.771,1145.761,Was the counsel ejected from the inquest room because he was a lawyer and they're representing a defendant or because of conduct that was complained of by the Coroner.
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1145.761,1155.623,"It was conduct Your Honor, certainly, he was objecting to the methods of the Coroner."
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1195.665,1198.758,What was his conclusion about that at the inquest?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1209.151,1212.087,I don't find in the record Your Honor any conclusion.
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1212.087,1214.128,That he completed it?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1214.128,1216.038,"Yes, he adjourned it voluntarily."
1965.490,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1219.229,1223.112,Did he continue -- continue for further hearing?
1965.490,0,23618,f_lee_bailey,,1223.112,1234.034,"No, I think he terminated it but not in any final sense to the extent that I think the idea was to extent he might have reopened it if some new evidence had appeared."
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1878.091,1882.148,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.490,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1969.488,1971.293,"Well let's see then, I want to get this."
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1995.711,2005.698,I think that is correct that the impact caused by the material which appeared in the press before and during the trial must have -- should have been controlled in order to guarantee a fair trial.
1965.490,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2005.698,2008.675,Well is that -- is that the argument?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2008.675,2025.275,What I merely mean to suggest Mr. Justice Brennan that there is nothing about what we propose which would in anyway inhibit the freedom of the press and I wish to make that point in advance because of the hue and cry which has come up to shackle the press which is not our argument.
1965.490,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2053.029,2058.9,It's easier to say I take it that there is none in this record the kind of evidence that there was in Irvin and Dowd namely --
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2058.9,2059.181,I think --
1965.490,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2059.181,2065.538,– The jurors conceding of their prejudgment of the trial before the trial began.
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2065.538,2075.815,I think that an examination of the voir dire will indicate that there is not -- the intense kind of material as appeared in the record in Irvin against Dowd.
1965.490,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2075.815,2077.067,More particularly --
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2077.067,2077.76,Yes sir.
1965.490,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2077.76,2085.157,-- there's no evidence here that the jurors reacted as there -- as there was in Irvin and Dowd affirmative evidence of how they reacted.
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2085.157,2091.518,I think the transcript does not indicate that the individual themselves so said.
1965.490,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2119.601,2135.005,"But your argument I gather is that the -- on the record here, at least the publicity at that kind of potential for prejudice that either the motion for continuance, the motion for change of venue, what else?"
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2135.005,2137.788,For mistrial or new trial should have been granted.
1965.490,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2137.788,2140.223,Anything about sequestering the jury?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2140.223,2142.709,There was no request to sequester the jury.
1965.490,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2153.107,2158.634,Are there any other controls that you suggest in the context of this record that has been applied?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2158.634,2175.183,I think that at the time it became clear that a Walter Winchell radio program describing some very damaging material attacking the character and credibility of the defendant appeared.
1965.490,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2197.424,2200.103,To be carried during the trial [Inaudible]
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2200.103,2205.182,"These two items that I have just referred to Mr. Justice Clark, occurred during the trial."
1965.490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.182,2213.855,Was there an opportunity to examine the jury on this matter in the motion or during your motion -- proceedings on the motion for new trial?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2213.855,2217.427,I believe that there was --
1965.490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.427,2220.843,Was there any inquiry made by defendant's counsel and --
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2220.843,2226.367,I think that there was no such inquiry made.
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2226.367,2232.123,That was because of the choice of counsel or the ruling of the court.
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2232.123,2234.19,You mean after the trial was over?
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2234.19,2246.42,On a motion for a new trial that is -- as to whether the jurors would be questioned about whether they have these things or what affected the verdict.
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2246.42,2248.057,I do not know the answer to that.
1965.490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.057,2253.862,But you -- you just said that there was an opportunity to question the jury on a motion for new trial.
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2255.824,2262.448,I think that there were three people on the subpoena but they did not testify and I do not know the reason.
1965.490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.448,2267.477,Well the juror -- the jurors could have been subpoenaed and they could have been questioned.
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2267.477,2269.006,After -- after the trial was over.
1965.490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.006,2270.434,"Yes, isn't that true?"
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2270.434,2271.151,I think that's true.
1965.490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.151,2274.657,And you say three were in fact subpoenaed but did not testify.
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2274.657,2274.879,Yes.
1965.490,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2276.01,2278.357,"Who subpoenaed them here, defendant?"
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2278.357,2279.854,I think so.
1965.490,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2279.854,2281.466,Why would they not be determined?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2281.466,2283.421,I don't know.
1965.490,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2283.421,2296.639,"I wonder why the counsel hasn't, if this was so important as it wants to appear at the time of the trial, why wouldn't the experienced counsel ask to sequester the jury?"
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2296.639,2302.843,I think that Mr. Bailey has indicated that up until this time it had not been the custom to sequester juries.
1965.490,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2329.058,2335.375,"Well is that a real problem in the criminal case of lengthy time, the jurors might be compelled to stand out."
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2335.375,2337.874,I think it is an extensive problem.
1965.490,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2337.874,2344.204,It's a problem for the defendant if the -- at the state as to what the adverse effect it might have on the jury to hold it.
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2344.204,2347.978,That in itself it might be prejudicial Your Honor.
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2414.302,2432.284,"Well Mr. Berkman, aren't you going to detail to us, pardon me, what the Court should have done in this case to keep and -- what it didn't do to keep this publicity from the jury."
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2435.262,2436.086,Yes --
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2436.086,2445.009,"If the jury never heard of this, if they never read any of those items that didn't come to their attention, you wouldn't be here, would you?"
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2445.009,2446.129,That's quite true.
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2446.129,2456.661,Now -- now what -- what should the judge have done which he didn't do that makes this an unfair trial.
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2456.661,2472.253,"At the outset, a motion was filed by the defense counsel for either a continuance until the publicity would have an opportunity to die down or for a change of venue to a remote county in Ohio where perhaps the pressures engendered by the newspaper publicity in a prosecution feeding --"
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2472.253,2475.013,What county in Ohio would have been remote on that?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2475.013,2492.217,"Well I admit that in the circumstances of this case, this would have been a problem, but it seem to us that since the defendant who is actually taking the risk and was on trial and made the request for a continuance, the thing that confronted the judge was whether or not the individual could get a fair trial in this particular county."
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2510.191,2512.962,Do you think that's a constitutional question?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2512.962,2516.283,The question of whether or not -- whether or not a change of (Voice Overlap) environment.
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2516.283,2520.251,"Well, he has the right to say where he'll be tried?"
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2520.251,2535.883,"It would seem to me that in a situation where there's massive publicity throughout the nation as in this case, the way in which a court may attempt to escape its constitutional responsibility to provide a fair trial is to say that there isn't a county in which the case might have been tried."
1965.490,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2553.073,2556.041,Do you have any statutes in the records to that?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2556.041,2558.236,I beg your pardon?
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2578.84,2600.292,"I suppose in those circumstances, we'd have to say today where we have so many news media, the television, the radio, newspapers that no trial could be had in a big city if the defendant wanted to go to some place else."
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2600.292,2601.42,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1965.490,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2656.952,2658.787,Are you going into that evidence (Voice Overlap)
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2658.787,2661.113,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2661.113,2667.422,But you are going to -- you are going to tell us first what the judge didn't do to make this an unfair trial actually.
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2667.422,2672.02,"Well, we suggest that the judge should have granted a continuance."
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2672.02,2673.083,That we have or --
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2673.083,2674.585,Or a change of venue.
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2674.585,2675.593,"Change of venue, yes."
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2676.315,2691.963,"We think also that after the material appeared in this trial, the Walter Winchell report, the Robert Considine and this type of material, the Court should have granted a mistrial on the basis of this material alone."
1965.490,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2693.458,2694.811,Was the motion made (Voice Overlap)
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2694.811,2695.566,Oh yes sir.
1965.490,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2696.395,2697.401,At that time?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2697.401,2697.984,Yes.
1965.490,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2702.784,2704.44,On that basis?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2704.44,2705.165,MYes sir.
1965.490,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2707.151,2717.909,"Wasn't the motion based on the Winchell broadcast not only for a mistrial but alternatively for instructions to the jury and the instructions were denied, is that right?"
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2717.909,2719.98,"Yes sir, yes."
1965.490,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2729.733,2732.96,Would that be a legislative or judicial function?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2732.96,2738.632,I think that this is clearly a judicial function to the extent that --
1965.490,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2738.632,2740.981,"The rules, establishment of rules – ed with a group."
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2740.981,2741.737,"Well, I --"
1965.490,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2741.737,2744.927,"– at the time of the trial, you would say it's not a legislative function?"
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2744.927,2772.748,I would say that in this particular instance after this Court has dealt in Rideau and in Irvin and some of these other cases with the consequences of free speech upon a trial situation that the refinement of the rules and the articulating of them beyond the particular facts of the -- of those cases is clearly in line with the continuance of a project which I think this Court has already undertaken.
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2783.253,2784.122,Before you get to that may I --
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2784.122,2784.397,Yes sir.
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2784.397,2792.062,-- may I ask if that is all you complain about so far as the action the judge is concerned?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2792.062,2810.019,"I think that the Court -- in the District Court in this federal habeas corpus proceeding has outlined approximately seven items which this Court may, must, might have done in order to assist in protecting this jury against the consequences of the material."
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2814.359,2816.708,But you don't argue it?
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2816.708,2817.373,I beg your pardon?
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2817.373,2820.299,"But you don't argue it, they're not as important to argue?"
1965.490,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2820.299,2824.789,"I think they are Your Honor and if I had time, I would be happy to do it."
1965.490,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2840.229,2843.491,Attorney General Saxbe.
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,2843.491,2847.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.490,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2911.914,2924.853,I hope we don't have to determine whether that was right or wrong in this case.[Laughter]
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,2924.853,2943.145,"No sir, the reason I bring this up is because this case is back here for a second time and it's back here not on any different arguments, not on any points that were not raised in 1956, but if you please on a different set of facts."
1965.490,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2947.745,2950.311,Did you say this is here on a different set of facts?
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,2950.311,2953.965,According to the defendant's petition and the defendant's brief.
1965.490,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2953.965,2955.619,"Well, I don't get that from the answer to (Voice Overlap)"
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,2955.619,2958.217,I will call it to your attention.
1965.490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.189,2991.98,"Mr. Attorney General, all of this in the record of the habeas hearing, isn't it?"
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,2991.98,3004.488,"In the record of the habeas hearings Your Honor there was appended to the defendant's brief, a chapter from a book by Mr. Seltzer."
1965.490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.488,3004.923,Yes.
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3004.923,3007.018,It is no place in the record.
1965.490,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3009.81,3011.099,You mean in the habeas proceeding?
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3011.099,3012.722,In the habeas proceedings.
1965.490,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3012.722,3014.687,It's not -- it's not an exhibit in the habeas proceeding?
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3014.687,3021.631,It's not an exhibit in the habeas proceedings and it's not in an agreed part of the facts which was entered.
1965.490,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3021.631,3024.861,Was this tried when the habeas proceeding in agreed state of fact?
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3024.861,3026.524,"It was an agreed statement of facts, yes."
1965.490,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3026.524,3028.722,No witnesses -- no witnesses called?
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3028.722,3051.295,"The only witnesses that were called is two persons that were involved in the prejudice of the judge which the district judge directed that the statements should be taken, unsworn statements and both consider the judge by it and the prejudice the man had been dead several years, obviously an extra illegal affair which had never has entered into it."
1965.490,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3051.295,3056.005,These were alleged statements by the trial judge deceased at the time of the habeas proceeding.
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3056.005,3056.784,Yes.
1965.490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3074.477,3076.817,Well does the state -- did the state accept those statements without (Voice Overlap)
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3076.817,3078.1,The state does not accept those statements.

1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3081.988,3083.652,We objected extraneously.
1965.490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3090.558,3091.939,Were the witnesses called?
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3091.939,3093.267,Witnesses were not called.
1965.490,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3098.184,3100.06,Was this over the objection of the state?
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3100.06,3101.052,Yes sir.
1965.490,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3101.052,3102.801,They were not affidavits.
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3102.801,3106.403,One was an affidavit and the other one is in the nature of a deposition.
1965.490,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3106.403,3110.472,Which was the affidavit?
1965.490,2,46071,william_b_saxbe,,3110.472,3116.335,The affidavit or the testimony of Dorothy Kilgallen was taken in New York.
1965.490,3,29525,john_t_corrigan,,5465.87,5471.299,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,6997.665,7000.13,May it please the Court.
1965.490,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7018.415,7024.819,Well who did try on behalf of the District Attorney who appeared in the habeas proceeding in the District Court?
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7024.819,7033.617,"On the first day of our conference with Judge Carl Weinman in January 1963, Mr. Goodthrough Bowerman appeared for the County of Cuyahoga."
1965.490,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7063.593,7066.525,Is this the attorney or the county?
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7066.525,7069.973,County attorney (Voice Overlap) --
1965.490,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7069.973,7071.673,He is the assistant to Mr. Corrigan.
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7071.673,7074.74,"Assistant to Mr. Corrigan, very much participated."
1965.490,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7081.696,7084.028,She does not appear in Dayton you say?
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7084.028,7086.024,"That's right, after she was admitted."
1965.490,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7086.024,7087.069,But have the right to do it.
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7087.069,7089.557,She had the right to and she certainly knew about it.
1965.490,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7108.668,7112.153,And he -- and he is since deceased also?
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7112.153,7113.381,"He is deceased, yes."
1965.490,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7148.104,7150.424,May I interrupt only long enough to ask Mr. Bailey on it.
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7150.424,7150.688,Yes.
1965.490,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7150.688,7153.172,We're going to have those volumes or not?
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7153.172,7158.561,Mr. Carl Royce informed me that nine copies of these three volumes had been sent to Your Honors.
1965.490,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7162.733,7163.7,What page?
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7163.7,7167.1,On page 380 (a).
1965.490,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7256.488,7261.265,Is the affidavit under oath (Voice Overlap)what affidavit?
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7261.265,7264.511,He said the evidence of which he was advised.
1965.490,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7264.511,7265.75,Yes.
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7265.75,7269.042,With respect to his pleasure is to hold a hearing or take depositions.
1965.490,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7273.956,7276.95,That is he could produce Miss Kilgallen before him.
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7276.95,7277.408,We could do that.
1965.490,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7277.408,7278.79,He could take her deposition.
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7278.79,7279.454,We could do that.
1965.490,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7279.454,7282.007,If you agreed you could accept their affidavit --
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7282.007,7282.54,That is correct.
1965.490,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7282.54,7285.403,Or any other mutually satisfactory arrangement?
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7285.403,7288.383,And his order to that effect as of May 6 is clear.
1965.490,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7288.383,7294.657,And now what are you going to tell us that you and the Attorney General then agreed on taking the statement the way you did take it?
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7294.657,7307.694,"I don't think I have to recite anything not in the record Your Honor because on May 9th, 1964, I flew, Mr. Kessler and another Assistant Attorney General to New York and we went to Miss Kilgallen's house."
1965.490,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7314.234,7315.159,Where is that?
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7315.159,7317.046,Page 388 (a).
1965.490,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7442.952,7445.121,May I ask you this question?
1965.490,4,23618,f_lee_bailey,,7467.093,7467.897,That's correct Your Honor.
