2012.11-10189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.254,"We will hear next this morning in Case 11-10189, Trevino v. Thaler."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,8.054,10.472,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-10189,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,73.964,83.754,Suppose the State's position were not as you accurately have stated the Texas Court of Criminal Appeal.
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,112.506,121.795,Texas systemically channels ineffective assistance claims to collateral -- to State habeas.
2012.11-10189,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,121.795,135.62,"And if it didn't, if it just said, you can bring it up on direct, but we realize these limitations, because the transcript won't be ready, so you can wait and bring it up on habeas."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,155.533,165.891,"It's not just them saying it in words, but it's also saying it in the legislation and in the rules that the State of Texas has adopted."
2012.11-10189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,191.958,193.708,"The district court, the trial court."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,193.708,194.208,That's correct.
2012.11-10189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,205.883,212.805,Has the Texas -- Texas appellate courts ever sent a -- a claim back for an evidentiary hearing?
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,212.805,234.385,"After 75 days, the district court loses jurisdiction, and I realize there are some jurisdictions around the country that have that opportunity, but Texas has a finality where there is no provision to expand the record after that 75-day period."
2012.11-10189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,234.385,237.17,"So far as you know, the court -- the appellate court's never done that?"
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,237.17,237.72,That's correct.
2012.11-10189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,237.72,238.387,Okay.
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,245.426,249.562,"Well, there's two -- actually, Texas has a dual track system."
2012.11-10189,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,300.595,305.399,"Counsel, I don't know that you've answered Justice Ginsburg's question."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,367.055,381.899,"That's correct, because the -- the scheme that Texas has developed systemically channels the habeas claim, the IAC claim, the ineffective assistance claim, into habeas."
2012.11-10189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,387.202,393.189,How -- how do you want us to formulate the rule if we write the opinion in your favor?
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,420.69,432.931,"Well, it wouldn't really affect 50 States because some States provide a mechanism for an abatement to go back on direct appeal and -- and expand the record."
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,455.447,457.397,"Well, I have the same questions that my colleagues have asked."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,478.628,485.382,When it makes it impracticable in the vast majority of cases to raise the claim on direct appeal.
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,485.382,489.951,Impracticable in the vast majority of cases.
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,499.892,501.326,"Well, not necessarily--"
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,501.326,501.911,No?
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,501.911,514.901,"--Justice Alito, because there's -- some States require that their cases are directed back to -- to direct appeal and there's a mechanism to expand the record."
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,530.595,531.347,"Well, I understand that."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,554.81,561.632,--If the -- let me make sure I understand.
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,561.632,563.818,You have to raise it on direct appeal or it's lost.
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,573.924,574.44,No.
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,585.415,589.984,So you have the same system where you get a new attorney but you have to comply with the time limits--
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,589.984,591.151,--And that--
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,591.151,599.841,"--and then you say, well, I can't do all of this social background research that Wiggins requires within the time limits, so that's impracticable."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,601.241,602.276,"--No, because that's--"
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,602.276,603.109,That's not okay either.
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,603.109,625.892,"--because that State is -- in the Texas scheme, in the Texas scheme, the -- Texas gives us another attorney in this dual track, this system, and it's understood that that attorney is the habeas attorney, and he doesn't -- he doesn't have that time limitation that the direct appeal attorney has, that's -- that 75-day limitation."
2012.11-10189,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,625.892,635.097,"But is your point that he has to have one full and fair opportunity to make the Wiggins claim, and it doesn't matter whether it's direct or collateral?"
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,648.005,655.076,But the bottom line in -- in our situation in Texas is that we have a scheme.
2012.11-10189,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,663.182,672.871,What are the rules other than the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals having said in several decisions the preferred route is collateral review?
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,672.871,686.797,"Well, first of all, the Rule -- the Rules of Appellate Procedure 21.8 talk about the limitations of -- the number of days that you have to expand the record in a motion for new trial."
2012.11-10189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,724.438,736.596,"I'm -- I'm not sure exactly what Justice Ginsburg's formulation was, but I don't understand why you didn't say, oh, yes, that's right, there has to be one full fair opportunity to raise the issue, and that's what we are arguing here."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,736.596,740.714,"--I'm sorry if I missed that, but that's exactly the point."
2012.11-10189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,741.614,747.118,"Then the next -- then my question is, does this apply just to capital cases?"
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,747.118,747.868,--No.
2012.11-10189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,747.868,749.337,Could we in a -- oh.
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,751.256,751.689,Not necessarily.
2012.11-10189,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,820.433,852.387,"Counsel, you -- you started to answer this question, but it is something raised by many of the amici opposing your position, which is that by adopting your position we're essentially having to examine the 49 plus, because we have territories that have collateral and direct review as well, plus systems to see which apply -- to which Martinez applies and to which Martinez doesn't apply."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,868.747,869.433,Right.
2012.11-10189,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,870.549,873.301,And why should we not fear that outcome?
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,873.301,874.251,--Okay.
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,901.135,919.448,"So the reason why -- the reason why there was a movement to channel ineffective assistance of counsel claims to collateral review is that it is often, maybe in the great majority of cases, impracticable to adjudicate them on direct appeal."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,923.133,926.102,"Well, it wouldn't, Justice Alito, for this reason."
2012.11-10189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,951.585,955.622,"Well, your friend says, page 18 of his brief, that -- that you do."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,969.448,972.064,Yes.
2012.11-10189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,972.064,972.733,Okay.
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,972.733,991.878,"And the reason I say that is, in order to obtain a record, one, you need to, when you file your motion for new trial, you have to specifically set out the factual basis for the claim; and two, the affidavit has to identify the evidence that any further investigation would have revealed."
2012.11-10189,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1001.6,1009.773,"So if everything -- if everything in Texas's system were the same, but you had a year, would that flip Texas into a different category?"
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,1009.773,1011.958,If the--
2012.11-10189,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1011.958,1015.927,"Is the problem, is what makes this impracticable just the amount of time?"
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,1015.927,1036.674,"--Yes, because the time -- the time, especially in a Wiggins claim, is prohibitive in order to be able to prepare and not just the time there, but the time that is imposed by the Rules of -- of Appellate Procedure."
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1051.1,1052.102,"Well, let me try this one more time."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,1062.308,1062.758,Yes.
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1062.758,1063.491,All right.
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,1082.871,1083.221,Yes.
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1083.221,1083.821,Okay.
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,1099.214,1100.949,"Well, but it's a--"
2012.11-10189,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1100.949,1102.285,"And if you don't do that, you've lost it."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,1102.285,1107.353,"--Well, there's a problem with declaring yourself ineffective."
2012.11-10189,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1130.468,1155.42,"Well, if that is the system in Kansas and Michigan, then why, why is it outside Martinez, if the point is you can't effectively present the ineffective assistance counsel when you've got the same counsel who was alleged to have been ineffective and is not going to condemn himself?"
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,1155.42,1162.073,"Well, that, as far as their State, you know, other States are concerned, you know, those are problems within those States."
2012.11-10189,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1192.526,1199.113,Explain why the time that you have on direct appeal isn't adequate.
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,1210.337,1215.041,"Well, it -- it takes a while."
2012.11-10189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1265.241,1290.372,"Surely, the trial court in Texas, when it gets a new trial motion within 30 days and the new counsel on appeal says, what, I have reason to believe -- well, we can see that there wasn't an adequate investigation of mitigating circumstances or whatever made below, and I would like the time to conduct, you know, the psychological evaluation or to contact these witnesses, is the trial court going to say no?"
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,1290.372,1295.526,That's correct because the 30 days is -- is a limit; it's a bar.
2012.11-10189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1327.131,1340.722,"And because of the rather sharp disagreements in the briefs on what the actual facts are here, I looked at the brief filed by the State bar of Texas in support of neither party."
2012.11-10189,0,46550,warren_wolf,,1361.969,1383.218,"Well, it helps our case because it recognizes the dual track system and it recognizes that the extra record under Section 12.22 of the guide -- of the Texas guidelines that were formulated that the State bar was -- one of their committees on indigent defense helped develop."
2012.11-10189,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1395.459,1396.242,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1403.715,1407.184,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-10189,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1443.673,1465.622,"Why is it a second bite when the Texas Supreme Court, court of criminal appeals, has said again and again, as a general rule, defendants should not raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal, should raise it on collateral review?"
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1465.622,1483.767,"Justice Ginsburg, the very next sentence of that opinion, Mata v. State, States that the lack of a clear record usually will prevent the appellant from meeting the first part of the Strickland test as the reasonableness of counsel's choices and motivations during trial can be proven deficient only through facts that don't normally appear in the appellate record."
2012.11-10189,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1511.267,1516.086,I don't -- does the statement
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1522.658,1523.408,"--Oh, yes, ma'am."
2012.11-10189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1552.327,1563.719,"But then -- but the comment is that the record has to be done within a very short period of time, and the trial record isn't even available for -- of the transcript for some 7 months."
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1563.719,1576.877,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, and that is why Texas has a procedure for abating and remanding appeals that is materially identical to the one that Kansas provides and the Petitioner concedes is sufficient to satisfy this Court's inquiry in Martinez."
2012.11-10189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1596.373,1602.01,"So the new counsel on direct waits for 7 months, gets the transcript."
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1617.704,1618.354,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-10189,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1620.056,1623.858,"That has never happened in the State of Texas in a capital case, I take it?"
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1623.858,1628.744,"--I'm not aware of a capital case, but it has been done in many, many noncapital cases."
2012.11-10189,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1642.369,1667.286,And the Fifth Circuit was wrong when it ruled in favor of Texas but said in the Ibarra case the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has made it clear that State habeas petitions -- and the State habeas petition is the preferred vehicle for developing ineffective assistance claims?
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1668.936,1680.044,"I believe it just needs to be taken in the context of, is the preferred vehicle if you have not developed the record to bring a claim -- to bring a claim appropriately on direct appeal."
2012.11-10189,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1680.044,1681.127,"Counsel, could you just please--"
2012.11-10189,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1681.127,1681.629,Please--
2012.11-10189,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1681.629,1684.681,Justice Sotomayor.
2012.11-10189,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1684.681,1687.7,--Let me understand what you are suggesting.
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1720.854,1730.976,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, many, many prisoners in Texas in capital and noncapital contexts alike have done that within the 30 days, but I want to emphasize--"
2012.11-10189,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1730.976,1738.916,How many were given an indefinite stay until they got the trial record to set forth the affidavits?
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1738.916,1743.717,"--Well, if it's done within the first 30 days, you don't need a stay, indefinite or otherwise."
2012.11-10189,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1744.885,1758.227,"So what do you do with the 75-day rule, which I think is absolute, which says if the court hasn't ruled on the new trial within 75 days the matter ends?"
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1758.227,1761.679,--I think the easiest way to think about it is there are basically three stages.
2012.11-10189,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1770.368,1773.07,Some of them have the information and some don't.
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1773.07,1773.653,That's correct.
2012.11-10189,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1773.653,1774.322,All right.
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1774.789,1776.572,So that's the first box.
2012.11-10189,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1777.524,1782.359,"--The guys who do it, it's because they have the information and so they've exhausted their claim."
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1784.96,1787.146,So to the second box.
2012.11-10189,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1804.524,1806.208,That assumes you get the transcript.
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1806.208,1809.828,"Well, we are still prior to the transcript because this is still--"
2012.11-10189,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1809.828,1812.112,"No, the 75 days has passed."
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1812.112,1825.187,"--And then after that, there is no briefing that has been done in the appellate court at this point, because the appellate briefing schedule and the transcript production are tied to one another, so it would never be a case where you're actually litigating a direct appeal without the transcript."
2012.11-10189,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1837.262,1839.097,Even beyond the 75 days?
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1839.097,1839.781,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-10189,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1859.678,1862.544,"So he can do this -- I didn't understand this, I'm sorry."
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1906.273,1906.992,Your--

2012.11-10189,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1931.757,1932.54,Is that yes or no?
2012.11-10189,1,16667,andrew_s_oldham,,1932.54,1934.659,"--Yes, although it's called a new trial motion."

2012.11-10189,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.127,1940.16,Okay.
