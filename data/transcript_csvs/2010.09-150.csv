2010.09-150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.793,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-150, Michigan v. Bryant."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,7.464,10.681,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,68.035,71.798,"Well, it can't all be the formality of the context."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,86.133,89.772,Which is where the ongoing emergency test from Davis comes into play.
2010.09-150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,102.656,103.483,How do we--
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,103.483,104.843,"Forget about formality, in other words."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,108.168,110.84,"--Well, under Davis, you said -- that was how you tested the formality."
2010.09-150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,121.162,122.114,--How do we tell that?
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,169.485,174.855,"Well, I think that what you have to do is look at the -- I mean, obviously, things can have dual purposes and often will."
2010.09-150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,182.038,183.711,But whose primary purpose is it?
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,213.433,220.678,"--I think here, in this line in Davis, you said the primary purpose is the questioning is what you look at in Davis."
2010.09-150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,222.289,223.334,"Well, wait a minute."
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.986,234.86,That is -- that is what it says.
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,234.86,235.454,What--
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.454,239.576,"It's the -- it's the -- it's the purpose of the declarant, not of the questioner."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,239.576,252.756,"--But the formality indicators that the Court delineated in Davis did not include whether the answers to the questions were for the purpose of establishing past events, but whether the primary purpose of the questions were for those ends."
2010.09-150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,260.098,262.926,"Well, in Davis, the issue is: Why was the declarant talking?"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,289.567,290.663,Yes.
2010.09-150,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,309.56,322.678,"In a situation like this, do you think it's meaningful to ask what the primary purpose of the victim was when he responded to the police and said who shot him?"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,349.995,350.324,Yes.
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.082,367.548,What possible response to an ongoing emergency could he have had in mind?
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,371.689,372.438,--He did ask--
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.438,375.687,"He was bleeding to death and he could have said, you know, I'm bleeding to death."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,389.853,394.786,"--The police, upon responding to the scene, don't know that this emergency is limited--"
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,394.786,395.707,But he does.
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,395.707,395.878,--to that person.
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.878,396.689,But he does.
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,396.689,399.298,Which is why you have to look at the entire context.
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,399.298,403.67,He knows -- he knows that his -- that the person that shot him is nowhere near there.
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,419.493,424.399,And yet that subjective mindset doesn't affect the formality.
2010.09-150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.504,431.364,Suppose he had survived.
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,448.185,452.682,--He would have to be unavailable for it to come in.
2010.09-150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,452.682,454.152,"But why, if it's nontestimonial?"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,454.152,461.335,"Well, under -- as the way the current jurisprudence is, he would have to be unavailable."
2010.09-150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,465.161,468.254,If you said -- you said it's -- you are typing it nontestimonial.
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,488.947,492.886,"No, I don't think it would change the nature of what happened at the time."
2010.09-150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.382,508.597,"But then -- then your answer is that if we typed it as nontestimonial in my trial scenario, it would be nontestimonial, it comes in."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,508.597,513.924,"--As long as it was not somehow barred by the rules of hearsay, which I believe it would be."
2010.09-150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,513.924,519.111,I'm confused on what -- what Davis focuses our inquiry on.
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,553.407,554.518,That's correct.
2010.09-150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,562.871,563.967,"Yes, I mean--"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,563.967,564.95,--there wouldn't be an issue.
2010.09-150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,564.95,576.648,"--But what the footnote -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but what the footnote says is in the final analysis, it's the declarant's statements, not the interrogator's question, that the Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,579.833,587.27,I think what happens is the interrogator's statements are not what are going to be determined to be testimonial or nontestimonial.
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.203,602.669,One way to evaluate those statements is what they are made in response to.
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,623.083,623.801,Correct.
2010.09-150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,624.394,625.548,"Well, then, how does that apply?"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,642.101,647.643,"--Right, which is why when I think you look for the purpose of the questioning here, it's to respond to an ongoing emergency."
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.36,651.952,"Well, if it was an emergency, he wouldn't have asked, ""What happened""?"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,654.292,655.949,--I don't--
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.949,661.885,"To ask what happened is to ask the declarant to describe past events, which is testimonial."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,661.885,665.461,--I don't think that you can make that kind of bright-line rule.
2010.09-150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,676.332,687.672,"And you -- you do not know if the man is running amok and threatening to shoot other people or if -- if he is drunk, if he is on a rampage, if it's a college campus, then it's -- it's -- it's a sniper."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,688.389,689.076,--Right.
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.528,701.211,"If you were worried about that, do you run immediately over to the person lying on the ground or do you examine the gas station first, rather than expose yourself to the -- to the shooter that you think is still in the gas station?"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,713.752,716.361,"--Well, to be fair, this was before Crawford was answered."
2010.09-150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,725.572,735.629,"Well, I'm not sure that policemen should read Crawford before they perform their -- their peacekeeping duties."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,753.137,754.155,--Correct.
2010.09-150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,756.058,759.84,"And, of course, Crawford rejects reliability as a criteria."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,759.84,760.823,--Yes.
2010.09-150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,783.535,790.342,"But what does that have to do -- we are back to the reliability test, really, because they didn't do anything wrong."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,820.642,821.515,No.
2010.09-150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,821.515,841.664,"Well, you are, because you were trying to pigeonhole yourself into an ongoing emergency that suggests that in those situations, whatever the person is saying is okay, because it was done to assess an emergency situation and not done for purposes of catching somebody, primary purpose of catching somebody."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,841.664,851.312,"Which is what this Court said in Davis, and said that that was not related to reliability but to formality there, and that that was not a formal thing, such as a magisterial examination."
2010.09-150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,863.916,888.892,"So are you saying that the rule would be that whenever the perpetrator may be in the vicinity, then the police are pursuing an urgent emergency situation rather than trying to find out what had -- the nature of the crime?"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,888.892,894.764,"We are not saying that any time there is a perpetrator at large, there is automatically an ongoing emergency until that person is caught."
2010.09-150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,904.15,907.992,"For all crimes, or only for shooting crimes or knifing crimes?"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,912.036,918.224,"--I think, obviously, violent crimes raise ongoing emergencies, emergencies to which -- more than others."
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,922.003,939.261,"So at least whenever the police come upon somebody who has been the victim of a violent crime, whatever interrogation they conduct could plausibly be to -- to make sure that the person is not still nearby, and that testimony will always be admissible?"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,939.261,943.882,"It is preliminary questions designed to assess the risk to themselves, the public, and--"
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.882,944.287,"No, no, no."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,967.104,970.836,"--I think if the context shows that's the primary purpose, then yes, that will often be the case."
2010.09-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,970.836,971.273,What do you mean?
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,989.28,992.154,"Well, here, for instance, it was admitted as an excited utterance."
2010.09-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.154,994.046,"Well, of course there are exceptions."
2010.09-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.124,1030.402,"Only when he's excited, right?"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,1047.068,1048.191,That's correct.
2010.09-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1048.959,1049.318,It would not apply?
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,1054.594,1055.659,--Your -- I--
2010.09-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1055.659,1058.205,"I thought there were, in my copy of the Federal Rules of Evidence."
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,1058.205,1058.657,--Yes.
2010.09-150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1063.575,1080.474,"In the -- if you had the benefit of hindsight and this trial occurred before Davis, and so the prosecutor went on excited utterance, would you have instead tried to make a case that this was a dying declaration?"
2010.09-150,0,34924,lori_b_palmer,,1080.474,1081.504,Absolutely.
2010.09-150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1086.188,1106.0,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1107.95,1110.497,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.562,1153.699,Do you distinguish between collecting evidence for a future prosecution and collecting evidence in order to pursue and arrest the felon?
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1170.158,1175.751,"I think that there are often multiple reasons, particularly in the wake of a violent event like a shooting, why--"
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.751,1178.905,But you say it has to be for the purpose of a future prosecution.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1186.997,1205.364,"--I think that what would qualify under the Davis test is if police need to apprehend the person, not for purposes of bringing the person into the criminal justice system, but rather to neutralize an ongoing threat that they present to the community at large, as is often the case when somebody has just proven themselves both capable and--"
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.364,1208.176,When does that not exist in the case of a violent crime?
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1209.894,1210.58,--I think it makes a significant difference--
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.58,1212.378,There is a violent criminal out there.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1212.378,1227.965,"--Justice Scalia, I think it makes a significant difference whether we are talking about a -- an act of violence like a shooting, somebody who has used a weapon that is capable of inflicting deadly harm on multiple victims in a short period of time, or someone who has used their fists, like the alleged perpetrators--"
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.965,1228.386,Okay.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1243.1,1246.769,"--I don't think that we would draw the rules that broadly, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1246.769,1248.721,I thought that's how you just described it.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1248.721,1257.406,"Well, I think that in this situation, we have police arriving on the scene to discover a man who has been recently shot; as it turns, fatally."
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.406,1257.952,Yes.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1257.952,1259.859,They need to find out in that situation--
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.859,1260.421,Who did it.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1260.421,1265.369,--They need to find out who did it so that they make sure that person isn't continuing to threaten other people on the scene.
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.369,1266.043,That's always the case.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1273.851,1274.837,"Well, I think--"
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.837,1280.523,"And you may as well take Crawford and throw it out, in -- in the majority of serious cases, if that's going to be your rule."
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1280.523,1283.803,"--I don't think that that's the case at all, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.806,1315.458,The crime was ongoing in -- in Davis when -- when the woman was on the phone with the operator.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1323.707,1329.454,"--It is true that that is a factual distinction between this case and Davis, but we don't think that it's one that makes a dispositive--"
2010.09-150,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1329.454,1333.389,Did the police know that that was the case when they began the questioning?
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1339.418,1340.463,"--No, they certainly did not know that, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-150,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1340.463,1341.477,That he was not taking hostages?
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1341.477,1343.462,That's correct.
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1354.986,1357.735,Will they ever know that?
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1357.735,1358.768,--I--
2010.09-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.768,1366.87,"I mean, is that -- is that likely not always to be the case when -- when you come upon a person who has been the -- they victim of a violent crime?"
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1374.666,1389.363,"--Well, I think it's important to emphasize that what we are arguing for is not a rule that would say as long as there is a violent perpetrator at large, as long as he is at large, any questions that police ask of -- of potential people who have information about the crime would necessarily be non-testimonial."
2010.09-150,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1405.702,1406.872,"Well, how do you know that?"
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1423.02,1428.156,"--I think it's actually not the case, Justice Ginsburg, that they would have asked the very same questions."
2010.09-150,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1449.958,1450.645,Let's say--
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1450.645,1451.632,They weren't asking the type of questions--
2010.09-150,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1451.632,1461.423,--Let's say that we -- let's say that we agree with you that there was an emergency and the police were asking questions in order to mitigate the emergency.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1495.23,1507.288,--We think that the principle that this Court announced in Davis and we are asking this Court to apply again today reflects two principles that underlie the Confrontation Clause as this Court interpreted it in Crawford.
2010.09-150,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1561.375,1567.637,One of the officers zeroed in on the victim.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1603.868,1608.177,"To take your first question first, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1679.651,1683.289,Then you are saying that the focus is on the police officers.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1702.125,1710.135,--I think that the test that the Court set out in Davis is one that focuses on the purpose of the interrogation because of the limited context in which that--
2010.09-150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1710.135,1710.244,Okay.
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1716.241,1720.816,--In the end it's the Declarant's statement that the Confrontation Clause requires us to examine.
2010.09-150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1720.816,1721.612,"--Right, right."
2010.09-150,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1721.612,1742.855,"We read footnote 1 to be an acknowledgement that answers given in response to police interrogation do not constitute the universe of possible testimonial statements, that testimony can indeed be volunteered as was Lord Cobham's letter, for example, in Sir Walter Raleigh's treason case, but in the end Davis, I think, quite properly focuses on the primary purpose of the interrogation."
2010.09-150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1742.855,1750.2,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,1751.058,1753.168,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2010.09-150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1780.92,1782.936,I didn't hear the end.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,1784.496,1786.964,"And apprehending, arresting."
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1786.964,1792.053,If -- what keeps that out?
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,1821.916,1824.041,"Well, certainly."
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1824.041,1826.509,Under the Federal Constitution?
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,1826.509,1827.616,The Federal Constitution--
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.616,1832.647,"I think your answer, counsel, is that we decided that in Crawford from which Justice Breyer dissented."
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1832.647,1835.911,Suppose I think he did it.
2010.09-150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1835.911,1838.719,Perhaps there is another answer that I would like to hear.
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1838.719,1842.689,I would like to hear your answer because I don't think we decided it in Crawford.
2010.09-150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1842.689,1844.518,"Now is a good time to try to jump in, I think."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,1849.185,1891.323,"--The reason, Your Honor, that the Confrontation Clause is the fundamental, part of the fundamental law of the country, and what this Court, I believe, decided in Crawford and then applied to situations, similar situation in Davis and Hammon, is that where you have a statement from a witness to a police officer as part of the questioning and that statement is the functional equivalent of testimony that witness would have given had he or she appeared at trial and been subject to cross-examination, then the admission of that statement at trial even under hearsay exception without cross-examination effectively allows."
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1891.323,1902.71,"Does it mean, does it mean that the individual is thinking this may be used -- there is a certain formality of the situation, it may be used at trial or it may just happen to turn out?"
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,1958.797,1974.009,"Because I think what this Court said in Crawford and Davis is that is the primary test, that is what our Constitution requires to allow the reliability, the believability, the trustworthiness of that evidence to be evaluated by a jury."
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.041,1976.18,Is it all hearsay?
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,1994.983,2003.945,--It would be wiped out if the statement at issue qualifies as testimonial under the test this Court announced in Crawford and Davis.
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.945,2005.462,"That's what we said in Crawford, isn't it?"
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2005.462,2010.726,Of course what I'm looking for now is whether there is any sense to that?
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2022.221,2030.792,"Well, I would have to say the constitutional justification of that is the reason why the right of constitution isn't in the Constitution."
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.868,2047.693,That's the value of just what I'm looking for.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2081.15,2083.619,I certainly don't think Crawford and Davis bars all.
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.619,2089.285,"What, in your view, is the correct line and why, most importantly why?"
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2089.285,2104.89,"I believe this Court in Crawford and Davis correctly established that line, in a situation like this where it is the response of a citizen to questions from a police officer, that you look primarily, as footnote 1 indicates, to the content of that statement."
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2104.89,2112.573,"But we established that this was a dying declaration and was made in contemplation of death, would it be barred by Crawford?"
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2112.573,2122.712,"Well, this Court certainly has suggested that in Giles, that a dying declaration might be an exception to Crawford as an exception that existed at the time of the framing."
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2127.193,2135.534,"I understand that, but assume for the sake of argument that it would be consistent with Crawford if it were a dying declaration, which the Court has suggested."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2151.853,2153.354,Yes.
2010.09-150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2182.873,2191.199,I thought -- I thought the rationale for dying declaration admissions was that they are inherent reliable -- inherently reliable.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2196.133,2197.475,I think that's correct.
2010.09-150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2197.475,2201.584,"On your death bed before you are going to meet the maker, you were not going to lie, I think that was the test."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2204.189,2204.828,That's true.
2010.09-150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2219.382,2233.985,"Now, suppose that there is a universe of instances that says we can identify as questions in order to alleviate and stop an emergency to prevent a crime from becoming aggravated and continuous."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2236.032,2236.437,--Yes.
2010.09-150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2236.437,2245.824,Is -- is there an argument that responses made for that purpose are more reliable?
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2252.839,2253.494,I don't believe so.
2010.09-150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2257.569,2266.909,"So the -- so the -- well -- and, of course, Davis is certainly does not rest on reliability -- Crawford rather doesn't rest on reliability."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2266.909,2267.943,--No.
2010.09-150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2267.943,2272.251,But isn't that really the only way to explain the 911 exception?
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2272.251,2273.814,"No, no."
2010.09-150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2276.591,2280.591,Isn't there a reliability component that underlies this whether we like it or not?
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2280.591,2293.851,"--I don't think that the fact that someone calls 911 and makes a report, whether they are talking about an ongoing situation or reporting of a past event, makes that somehow inherently more reliable than if they had used another medium."
2010.09-150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2308.906,2312.981,But isn't -- isn't the reason we accept that is because it's reliable.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2319.743,2323.962,"I don't -- no, I don't think that's the basis on which this Court held it was nontestimonial."
2010.09-150,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2331.051,2333.079,Let's go back to this case.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2333.079,2333.563,--Yes.
2010.09-150,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2333.563,2348.478,"Excited utterance was -- the prosecutor thought that was his best shot, and he -- and he prevailed, except that the -- Davis intervened."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2401.265,2418.525,"Well, in -- in this case, when -- when -- when the initial attempted admission of this evidence, at the preliminary exam, when it met a hearsay objection, the prosecutor at that point argued that it was admissible under Michigan evidence rules as either an excited utterance and/or a dying declaration."
2010.09-150,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2418.525,2420.416,Maybe she argue dying declaration.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2420.416,2425.208,"Well, they argued dying declaration, the judge sustained the objection and said he has not established the foundation for either one of those."
2010.09-150,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2441.469,2444.686,And that -- that -- that was in the pre-Davis world.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2451.09,2452.248,I don't know.
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.934,2461.275,"Mr. Van Hoek, what is the basis for your concession that a dying declaration is an exception from the Confrontation Clause?"
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2466.758,2471.223,"--I'm not -- if I -- if I meant -- if you took what I said as a concession, what I said is that this--"
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2471.223,2472.58,You conceded it.
2010.09-150,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2477.174,2482.887,"My question was based on its an open question, because we have said maybe dying declaration."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2482.887,2483.671,--And I--
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.671,2495.369,I -- I thought it was an open question only -- only where the -- the defendant has effected the death of the person who has made the dying declaration.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2502.66,2506.927,"--If I -- if you took my answer to the prior question to say that I conceded that, I'm not saying that."
2010.09-150,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2514.844,2518.217,And it wasn't -- and it wasn't in Giles.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2519.107,2519.341,"--No, Giles is not--"
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.171,2558.087,"If it hasn't been reached and if it is not an established exception to the Confrontation Clause, there is no basis for saying, therefore, the Confrontation Clause pertains only to reliability."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2578.642,2579.827,I agree.
2010.09-150,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2581.328,2585.372,"--Whether you agree or not, we said it was an open question."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2585.372,2586.199,"--Yes, yes."
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2586.199,2587.025,Can there be--
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2587.025,2587.914,And it has not been decided.
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2587.914,2612.871,"--Can there be a situation in which the primary purpose for a statement or for the question that elicits the statement is to respond to an ongoing emergency rather than to gather evidence for subsequent use in a legal proceeding when the statement relates to something that has occurred, perhaps just a few seconds before, but it relates to something that has occurred as opposed to something that is occurring at that very moment?"
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2612.871,2621.991,"I think there are situations where -- where the police are coming in and asking questions, is there a threat here?"
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2631.877,2635.176,"But I understand, but we need to know where to draw the line."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2645.795,2653.058,"I think the line would be drawn if those were the only statements, he's hitting me with a baseball bat, versus he -- he just hit me with a baseball bat and he just left."
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2657.602,2660.132,I really would like a clear answer to this.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2671.488,2693.071,"--I think that in the absence of any statement by the witness alleging that there is any current ongoing imminent danger, if the witness only gives a statement that relates to past completed events, then it's not a showing of -- of an ongoing emergency."
2010.09-150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2693.071,2696.304,So what do you do -- what do you do with the statement
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2702.364,2707.722,"That statement standing alone I would say that that is past, purely past."
2010.09-150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2707.722,2713.095,"Even though the guy in the gas station is still there with a gun, the police are within range?"
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2713.095,2715.575,Are we referring to a specific person?
2010.09-150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2715.575,2715.778,Yes.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2728.522,2739.704,"Well, I -- I -- I would -- I don't -- I don't think that -- that the -- the -- the discussion of verbs tense and past tense, I don't think that is the -- is the -- is the determining factor."
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2742.158,2744.482,The guy in the gas station is present.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2757.76,2758.4,--Yes.
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2776.455,2778.08,"Well, suppose they get a 9-1-1 call."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2796.884,2799.945,I would say that's our case and I would say that was testimonial.
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2799.945,2808.365,"Well, the police under those circumstances don't know whether John Jones is going on a shooting spree; this is just the first of numerous victims."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2819.45,2829.948,"Well, I would -- in that situation, nothing about the Davis rule and nothing about the Confrontation Clause precludes the police from taking that information and asking those further questions."
2010.09-150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2829.948,2835.102,But you -- you -- you were you the one that drew the line between a past event and ongoing event.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2840.285,2853.438,"But if the statement is made to the police that a sniper has said he's -- he is on the verge of shooting other people, because he just shot someone, I would say that's certainly a declaration of an emergency and certainly would be non-testimonial under the -- under the test of Davis."
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2853.438,2863.542,"Is there any -- I'll try to -- I think you're just -- you don't like my -- where I'm coming from, and so you might not have an answer to this."
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.768,2964.391,Do it.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2964.843,2967.936,I -- there is nothing -- there is nothing but the emergency rule.
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2977.65,2978.523,They're not.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,2979.553,2980.379,--Well they are investigating.
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3017.999,3025.357,"Yes, just -- but in the past that situation you are describing arose only where there was a hearsay exception."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3037.086,3037.71,Well--
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3037.71,3041.633,"And there be some others, excited utterances may be another."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3046.099,3050.61,--But the line this Court drew in Crawford and Davis--
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.61,3051.612,I know they did.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3068.357,3069.074,--I don't believe--
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3069.074,3071.278,Confederates is the one I come back to.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3071.278,3077.115,"--Those examples you just gave, are not statements made during police questioning."
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3077.82,3078.975,"Okay, okay."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3079.396,3084.067,--What -- the difference that made in Davis is that the -- the definition of testimonial is not across the board.
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.067,3089.207,"I guess it depends on what you mean, by in the past, as Justice Breyer put it."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3095.937,3096.265,Roberts.
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.265,3097.872,"--Roberts, I'm sorry."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3097.872,3098.5,Roberts.
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3098.5,3098.905,Roberts.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3124.739,3126.877,Yes.
2010.09-150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3150.305,3157.956,"Many -- I mean, like many cases there is language that can take us far afield from the subject matter before us."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3193.878,3204.497,"Well, I'd have to go back to my answer that the Confrontation Clause is the primary law of the country, not State hearsay objection rules."
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3229.689,3236.434,"Well, I'm still trying to understand your conception of the scope of the ongoing emergency doctrine."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3251.35,3251.49,Yes.
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3251.958,3254.864,And in a case of doubt they can't do it.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3262.155,3276.104,"My position is that where the witness has not provided any information to the police indicating that there is an immediate threat, either volunteered to the police or in response to questions from the police, saying is there a threat?"
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3278.319,3280.538,"Well, they can always do it."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3282.242,3282.975,"--No, not at all."
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3282.975,3284.317,They can always ask the questions.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3291.768,3302.652,"Yes, and if the answers, no matter what questions they asked, if the answers all are a narrative of past events, then that qualifies as testimonial because it is the -- the equivalent."
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3302.652,3305.883,"I thought you just said that wasn't the test, past versus present."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3313.55,3314.221,No.
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3322.387,3324.372,The witness has to say there is an emergency?
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3324.372,3330.353,"--Not in those words but -- but in comparison to what -- Mrs. Davis said, which is that he's beating me up."
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3330.353,3335.633,"There is a report of shooting at a school, and the police go and they find two students lying on the ground."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3344.91,3346.848,No.
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3346.848,3347.768,No.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3354.093,3362.201,"Well, it would be -- it would be -- a statement from the -- from the witness at that point of the police officer asking him, is John Jones here?"
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3371.025,3372.917,That is a very specific information.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3372.917,3379.818,"Because the -- or the Petitioner's position here is that the situation itself, standing alone--"
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3379.818,3389.595,"What if there are three students who have been shot, four students who have been shot, but nobody says, well, I think he's still in the building, he may have an interest in shooting some more students?"
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3389.595,3393.564,"--Well, certainly if the police have come on the scene and multiple students have been shot."
2010.09-150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3404.073,3405.06,Would they ask his name?
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3413.008,3415.725,Of course that's the emergency.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3428.781,3430.45,And they can ask all those questions.
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3436.354,3441.773,I'm totally puzzled now as to when you think there is an ongoing emergency and when there isn't.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3441.773,3455.317,"I think there is an ongoing emergency that a statement that is non-testimonial relating to an ongoing emergency, when there is some indication from the statement made by the witness that such -- that there is some immediacy."
2010.09-150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3455.317,3457.688,You made by the Declarant.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3459.797,3462.25,"No, I don't think just from the circumstances."
2010.09-150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3462.25,3463.405,"Oh, sure it can."
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3477.864,3478.461,I don't agree.
2010.09-150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3492.734,3498.857,It's quite different from saying this happened to some guy driving by or something like that.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3512.055,3523.848,"--Well, again, I think that if all it is that the principal shot someone before, that basically is--"
2010.09-150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3523.848,3532.361,You don't think there is a danger implicated by coming onto the lawn of a school and a student is there and says the principal shot me inside.
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3540.074,3544.274,"--Well, if they ask those questions and the principal is still inside and there is an indication."
2010.09-150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3544.274,3545.199,"Oh, no, no."
2010.09-150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3552.569,3558.612,Did he shoot you because he had a grudge against you or did he just shoot you blindly and he says he shot me?
2010.09-150,2,37961,peter_jon_van_hoek,,3558.612,3562.628,I'm not taking the position that they have to go through a whole list of questions before they can do anything.
2010.09-150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3571.953,3573.451,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-150,3,34924,lori_b_palmer,,3576.655,3600.848,"I would just like to reiterate that the underlying principle as this Court has said repeatedly in Crawford and in Davis is formality, and that's what the purpose of any inquiry should be in looking at the scene whether there is an emergency or not or Declarant's view or not, it all comes down to formality akin to a magisterial examination."
2010.09-150,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3604.158,3605.531,Let's go to formality.
2010.09-150,3,34924,lori_b_palmer,,3617.245,3617.573,Right.
2010.09-150,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3617.573,3618.041,Correct?
2010.09-150,3,34924,lori_b_palmer,,3653.523,3654.197,Well--
2010.09-150,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3654.197,3657.071,"That's really the difference between the two of you, I think."
2010.09-150,3,34924,lori_b_palmer,,3657.071,3672.377,"--Even if, even if you take that view that it's the Declarant's purpose or objective view that controls, I think here it's difficult to see how Covington's purpose could have been to provide evidence any more than the 9-1-1 call in Davis."
2010.09-150,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3692.525,3694.99,I don't understand what you are saying.
2010.09-150,3,34924,lori_b_palmer,,3703.359,3703.909,I don't agree with that.
2010.09-150,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3703.909,3706.39,He is intending to accuse somebody.
2010.09-150,3,34924,lori_b_palmer,,3706.39,3710.468,I think here he is intending to seek help because he has been mortally wounded.
2010.09-150,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3712.559,3713.389,"Thank you, counsel."
