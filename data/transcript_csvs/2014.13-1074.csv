2014.13-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.67,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 13-1074, United States v. Wong."
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,8.17,11.456,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,27.5,29.25,Is the -- is the word “ jurisdiction ” used?
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,29.25,41.926,"--The word “ jurisdiction ” was not used in -- in that language, Your Honor, but the Court had interpreted that language in the Tucker Act context in six cases beginning with the -- the Court's decision in Kendall in 1883."
2014.13-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,48.164,48.497,That's the Court.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,88.539,93.193,"--Your Honor, I think two points on that."
2014.13-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,110.904,112.672,Jurisdictional in the narrow sense.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,112.672,119.176,In -- in the sense that -- that -- that if -- that it went to the Court's ability to hear the case--
2014.13-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,119.176,120.06,"Yes, that's what I--"
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,120.06,123.295,--and the jurisdictional consequences were attached to those -- to those words.
2014.13-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,156.016,157.035,But not the Tort Claims Act.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,172.061,185.452,"--But I think what the Court has said, both in the cases addressing jurisdiction and in the cases -- in the Irwin line of cases addressing the available of -- the availability of equitable tolling is that the Court is not going to look for magic words in the statute."
2014.13-1074,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,197.776,204.18,"But, Mr. Martinez, wouldn't that argument suggest that Irwin was really only good as to new statutes?"
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,206.715,208.215,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2014.13-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,258.731,260.264,What was different about 1972?
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,287.864,292.816,"Well, I think the -- the key thing -- the -- the issue in this case is, obviously, the FT -- is, of course, the FTCA."
2014.13-1074,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,312.897,337.112,"But, you see, I would -- I guess I would have thought that really anything pre-Irwin, the government could stand up and make a very, very similar argument, which is, you know, in this world we actually thought that a statute of limitations with respect to a suit against a government was jurisdictional, did not include equitable tolling, that there were really no decisions the other way, that Congress thought of that as the background rule."
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,348.403,353.04,"Well, we're not asking for that presumption, and we don't think that the Court needs to apply that presumption."
2014.13-1074,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,374.719,378.671,"So if there's ambiguity, what breaks the tie?"
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,401.621,403.121,With res--
2014.13-1074,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,403.121,404.706,What -- how -- how do we break the tie?
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,404.706,414.694,"--Well, I think if there were in fact a tie, I think the -- Irwin does -- does put essentially the slight thumb on the scale in favor of no equitable tolling."
2014.13-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.694,465.144,--That was in the text of the recodification?
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,465.144,465.429,--Yes.
2014.13-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.033,473.717,"Does legislative history support that, too?"
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,473.717,474.669,--It does.
2014.13-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,541.544,549.983,"Tucker Act doesn't have to the same extent, in the same manner and to the same extent as with respect to a private party."
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,552.669,555.104,It -- it's true that the Tucker Act doesn't have that language.
2014.13-1074,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,594.412,601.268,"I take it that your argument would apply not only to 2401(b), but also to 2401(a)?"
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,601.268,607.839,"We -- the government's position is that 2401(a) is -- is also jurisdictional, not subject to tolling."
2014.13-1074,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,613.809,615.275,But it's the same language.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,628.319,635.073,"--Your Honor, I don't want to resist your -- your point too much, but I do want to point thought that 2401(a)'s history is slightly different."
2014.13-1074,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,664.175,668.394,"I meant, I have to think that this is just all over the U.S. Code, this kind of language."
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,673.781,679.602,"I think that the “ shall be barred ” or “ forever barred ”, that language does appear in a couple of places."
2014.13-1074,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,750.031,759.387,"It sounds to me like, the way you're going about this inquiry, we're going to have to take a case on every statute of limitations in -- in the U.S. Code."
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,776.498,781.902,"I -- I don't think that -- I don't think it's correct that you would have to take a case on every statute of limitations, Your Honor."
2014.13-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,798.529,800.881,"Irwin said this was just a presumption, right?"
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,800.881,801.347,And that's exact--
2014.13-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.347,808.053,And it said the presumption could be overcome and it made clear that this is a question of what was the congressional intent.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,813.79,815.74,"--We -- I couldn't agree more, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1074,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,830.733,846.762,"Well, if you have looked at the -- the statutes that could be interpreted one way or the other, are there any that you have concluded are not jurisdictional other than those that we have already held are not jurisdictional?"
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,846.762,854.282,"Your Honor, I confess that I haven't gone through the -- the code with an effort to try to figure out where ones that are not jurisdictional."
2014.13-1074,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,875.864,876.281,Sure.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,915.256,918.541,"--With respect, Justice Kagan, that's -- that's not our argument."
2014.13-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,941.804,945.191,I thought Soriano was -- was a Tucker Act case.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,945.191,956.83,"It did, Your Honor, but -- but the Court expressly addressed -- it said that -- essentially, that the same rule that would apply in Tucker Act cases would also apply to -- to statutes waiving sovereign immunity for tort actions."
2014.13-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,959.399,968.388,"But if the sovereign immunity is what drives it, then the presumption would be overcome in every case against the government because government--"
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,968.388,997.907,"--I think -- I think at a minimum, it would -- I think what we have in this statute that was not present in Irwin is the fact that this Court had expressly mentioned, you know, tort actions; and then not only did the Court mention it, but then Congress reenacted the statute in 1966, not just against the backdrop of this Court's statement in Soriano, but also against the backdrop of the uniform view of the lower courts, including a number of courts of appeals, that it all said that this statute was jurisdictional, not subject to waiver, not subject to tolling."
2014.13-1074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1045.338,1052.81,Is there another -- is there another reason -- I think both briefs are good briefs and you each have good arguments.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1138.332,1144.069,"--Your Honor, as -- as you suggested, our primary argument here is that -- that we should win because the law is on our side."
2014.13-1074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1144.069,1145.135,That there's nothing else?
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1148.785,1150.454,In addition to the law being on our side--
2014.13-1074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1150.454,1150.754,Yes.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1150.754,1162.079,--let me try to give a little bit of context for why -- why Congress and why the United States Department of Justice and the Executive Branch has consistently opposed equitable tolling in these circumstances.
2014.13-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1219.098,1226.085,"--But, Mr. Martinez, what you said, it's as though the choice were statute of limitations or nothing."
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1263.194,1273.733,"--Your Honor, I think that's true, that's how the equitable tolling doctrine has been conceived and if Congress were rewriting the statute today, it may well decide -- it could well decide that that would be a better approach."
2014.13-1074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1338.692,1342.994,"If you want to -- I think it is quite funny, what I said."
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1403.049,1403.516,I think--
2014.13-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.516,1408.437,A living Federal Tort Claims Act is what we're talking about here.
2014.13-1074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1408.937,1410.889,That's actually right.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1410.889,1423.362,"--Justice Breyer, I think that -- I think that, first of all, what this Court has always said, of course, is that -- that the goal of statutory construction in this context as in any other is to look at the text in light of its context and its historical treatment."
2014.13-1074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1429.266,1429.616,Yes.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1451.716,1455.5,"It's not hypothetical, because I think Congress did actually address this exact question."
2014.13-1074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1466.291,1467.308,They didn't -- they had the tolling.
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1474.981,1475.714,--That -- that's normally true.
2014.13-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1529.632,1544.808,"If we were to adopt the position that a statute can change in light of current circumstances, what would that Congress think about it today, would there be any reason to limit that to the Federal Tort Claims Act, that proposition?"
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1544.808,1546.76,"I think it would be hard to do and, Your Honor--"
2014.13-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.76,1552.414,"We're into judge Calebresi's manner of statutory interpretation, right?"
2014.13-1074,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1552.414,1553.397,--I think it would be hard to do.
2014.13-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1569.526,1570.193,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1574.511,1576.797,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1606.466,1610.936,But -- but not with respect to governmental statutes.
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1613.555,1617.04,"Yes, the presumption is -- it's the same presumption."
2014.13-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1731.299,1734.149,What did the re -- what did the recodification do?
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1734.149,1744.539,"--It moved things to -- to different parts of 28 U.S.C., but it -- those sections were separate all along."
2014.13-1074,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1766.888,1768.438,So did we err in McNeil?
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1768.438,1769.138,Sorry?
2014.13-1074,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1769.138,1770.94,Did we err in McNeil?
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1770.94,1777.261,You did not but -- but McNeil does not hold that the exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional.
2014.13-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1835.532,1839.751,"Mr. Schnapper, what do you do with what I take to be the government's main argument?"
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1865.818,1870.122,We think there are a number of problems with that argument.
2014.13-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.178,1910.347,It isn't just that phrase.
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1926.726,1927.142,--But--
2014.13-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1927.142,1933.546,"--That was the obvious purpose of it, so they -- they repeat the language of the Tucker Act and say it applies to torts."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1938.95,1941.136,"--Well, we -- we think not, Your Honor."
2014.13-1074,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2036.78,2053.64,"I take it from what you have both argued so far, that there is nothing direct in terms of a report or a hearing or a statement on the floor that shows that anyone in Congress, staff or member, ever thought about this problem."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2055.075,2056.125,That's our -- that's our argument--
2014.13-1074,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.125,2078.94,"So what we're doing then is we are, however we do it, creating a number -- not creating but following a number of legal rules, court developed, which seek to determine what the, quote, intent of Congress was on the basis of other things, not necessarily what they said or what they -- that's the situation?"
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2078.94,2080.123,--I -- I think that's right.
2014.13-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.825,2169.7,"Well, it seems to me that is incompatible with what I thought your position was, that it depends upon congressional intent."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2184.041,2186.31,"--Your Honor, our view--"
2014.13-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.31,2191.88,Are you -- are you going to be bound by -- by what the Congress at the time believed it was enacting or not?
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2191.88,2204.788,--We agree with Justice Breyer that this -- that this -- it's not a question of -- of any indication of actual intent.
2014.13-1074,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2300.332,2307.172,This is -- this is spinning out into degrees of abstraction that I hadn't anticipated.
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2347.547,2354.05,I think the Court's answer -- the cases in this Court give a slightly different answer to that question.
2014.13-1074,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2374.328,2375.546,So it's not what Congress intended.
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2392.508,2396.043,"--Well, I think my answer is not limited to this clear statement rule."
2014.13-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2406.599,2424.394,"Mr. Schnapper, I think we're getting off the track that Justice Breyer put us on, and I think you agreed with him, that there's no evidence that Congress ever thought anything about what was going to happen in a case like Ms. Wong."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2441.506,2443.124,--Yes.
2014.13-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2453.997,2458.048,"Well, but that language -- that language comes from decisions of this Court, exactly."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2479.026,2487.149,"But those rulings, we contend, had nothing to do with the particular language of the Tucker Act."
2014.13-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.149,2488.032,"Well, that may well be, but--"
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2488.032,2491.103,No matter what -- how the statute of limitations had been phrased--
2014.13-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.103,2496.321,"--Look, there are a lot of statutes, perhaps most statutes, that are not explicit."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2571.655,2574.507,"--Nor should it be, Your Honor."
2014.13-1074,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2574.507,2587.68,"Didn't -- I mean, the -- sorry, but I get -- I mean, what about many statutes existed saying -- inferring a certain use of the word about men sitting on juries."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2613.232,2615.917,"Well, I'm happy to agree with all that."
2014.13-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.719,2621.57,"You think man means women, right?"
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2624.022,2626.155,--I don't think we have to address all that here.
2014.13-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2629.257,2647.969,"Mr. Schnapper -- Mr. Schnapper, I think that I heard a disagreement between you and Justice Scalia on how close the words were, and you said, yes, there are some phrases in common, but there are big differences, too, in the wording of the Tort Claims Act."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2661.729,2662.261,That's true.
2014.13-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2699.835,2704.821,"Well, but that's a -- a principle that obviously doesn't cut across the board."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2716.879,2717.196,"--No, no."
2014.13-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2720.048,2720.365,"--No, no."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2720.365,2721.183,--the Federal Torts Claims Act.
2014.13-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2721.183,2721.667,"No, no."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2752.802,2752.968,I do.
2014.13-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2785.687,2786.47,And you think in every other--
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2786.47,2788.289,"--If Congress wanted a different result, they spelled that out."
2014.13-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2788.289,2793.176,"--And you think in every other respect, the procedure under the Federal action is the same as under the State action?"
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2793.176,2797.395,Presumptively--
2014.13-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2797.395,2799.911,"And it goes -- it goes to liability, right?"
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2803.382,2804.432,"--Well, it says in -- in like manner."
2014.13-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2804.915,2805.765,They're not procedures.
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2807.767,2812.421,"--Yes, but a -- a statute of limitations is a bar to liability."
2014.13-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.141,2843.357,"You know, I don't find the -- the existence of -- of those exceptions, and there are a lot of exceptions, so persuasive, because unlike the Tucker Act, the Tort Claims Act refers to State law, so you have to make exceptions unless you're going to suck in everything about State law, procedures and everything else."
2014.13-1074,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2865.037,2879.78,"Isn't your point, however, that this is a new regime, that it's not the Tucker Act, that it's something created -- they may have borrowed from the Tucker Act some phrases and a couple of things, but they created a new statute."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2888.653,2889.505,--I -- I think that's right.
2014.13-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2909.399,2918.855,"The government answered -- you're saying the difference is the district court has all kinds of equitable authority, claims court didn't."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2941.887,2947.289,--I think that argument relates to the argument that's been made by the Plaintiffs in June.
2014.13-1074,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3212.175,3220.13,Are there any Federal statutes that permit equitable tolling--
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,3220.13,3222.665,"--Equitable tolling, yes, yes."
2014.13-1074,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3222.665,3223.348,--and how are they worded?
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,3226.3,3227.133,"Oh, no."
2014.13-1074,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3237.006,3240.208,"But based on the language of the statute, there are carveouts."
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,3242.826,3243.393,The carveouts are statutory.
2014.13-1074,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3246.212,3253.117,"--But have the statutes recognized, A, there are carveouts, and B, there is something like equitable tolling?"
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,3253.117,3254.283,--I don't know that.
2014.13-1074,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3259.704,3260.171,I understand.
2014.13-1074,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,3260.171,3261.937,--traditional exercise of that discretion.
2014.13-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3287.571,3288.738,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3290.956,3316.172,"Mr. Martinez, I hate to cut into your time, but it's important to me to understand why you think that if we rule for you, we will not be saying that every statute which allows suit against the Federal government and which uses the words “ shall be forever barred ” will not have to come out this way."
2014.13-1074,2,56052,roman_martinez,,3320.31,3326.213,"I think in this case it's not just that phrase, it's the broader phrase that was lifted verbatim from the Tucker Act."
2014.13-1074,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3338.271,3339.421,"I'm sorry, which language are you talking about?"
2014.13-1074,2,56052,roman_martinez,,3339.421,3340.706,"--I'm talking about the phrase,"
2014.13-1074,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3346.441,3350.993,"I mean, “ shall be forever barred ” seems, to me, to be the most important part of that language."
2014.13-1074,2,56052,roman_martinez,,3350.993,3352.611,--I think that is the most important part.
2014.13-1074,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3361.284,3363.334,"2401 just says,"
2014.13-1074,2,56052,roman_martinez,,3379.678,3389.118,"Justice Sotomayor, I think the language that I'm referring to is the one that was in the original 1946 FTCA, which tracked verbatim the language from the Tucker Act."
2014.13-1074,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3402.128,3403.011,Has the Tucker Act been amended?
2014.13-1074,2,56052,roman_martinez,,3405.48,3407.513,--The Tucker Act provision has been amended slightly.
2014.13-1074,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3416.535,3421.921,"Is there anything else you would say to Justice Scalia is it's just ""shall be forever barred"" plus a few more words?"
2014.13-1074,2,56052,roman_martinez,,3422.604,3427.489,"Justice Kagan, I think it's the same points that I made in response to your questions earlier."
2014.13-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3448.571,3476.571,"As far as Kontrick is concerned, that line of cases I thought came out with Bowles, Bowles v. Russell, and John R. Sand that we're not going to undeclare something jurisdictional that we, the Court, but when it's -- we're dealing with a statute that this Court has never said that about, then we don't carry over that ancient regime."
2014.13-1074,2,56052,roman_martinez,,3476.571,3492.181,"Justice Ginsburg, I think in -- in footnote 8 of the Kontrick opinion, this Court referred to 2401(b) and it said that it confined review of district courts and was of a similar order to U.S.C. 2107, which was the provision that was later at issue in Bowles."
2014.13-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3508.406,3510.142,I better take another look at Kontrick.
2014.13-1074,2,56052,roman_martinez,,3510.142,3513.927,"And Bowles, with respect, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3513.927,3515.279,"In Bowles, I was in dissent."
2014.13-1074,2,56052,roman_martinez,,3515.279,3522.8,"I -- I seem to remember that, Justice Ginsburg, but I think the Court's opinion in Bowles expressly addressed the meaning of that Kontrick footnote."
2014.13-1074,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3542.746,3543.679,"Thank you, counsel."
