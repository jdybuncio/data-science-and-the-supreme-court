1973.73-187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.329,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-187, Kewanee Oil Company against Bicron Corporation."
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,60.35,64.791,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,176.673,184.265,"Mr. Griswold, I -- excuse me for interrupting you, but I think you said that the Court of Appeals decided this case by a divided vote?"
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,184.265,185.326,Yes Mr. Justice.
1973.73-187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,185.326,189.303,"I missed that, is there a dissenting opinion?"
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,189.303,193.233,"Well, I’m sorry, I -- apparently I am wrong."
1973.73-187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,197.405,198.251,I think it was unanimous.
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,198.251,198.686,It was unanimous.
1973.73-187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,198.686,200.926,Yes.
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,202.051,202.457,Well --
1973.73-187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,202.457,204.457,Analogously wrong since he --
1973.73-187,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,204.457,207.838,"Well, that just means that you think they were unanimously wrong?"
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,207.838,209.755,I now say they were unanimously wrong.
1973.73-187,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.755,212.558,Right.[Laughter]
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,212.558,221.465,Harshaw was a pioneer in this field and has been actively developing it for 25 years.
1973.73-187,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,330.952,332.631,There is no patent involved here?
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,332.631,334.594,There is no patent involved here.
1973.73-187,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,908.515,913.717,"General Griswold, there were some of us who dissented in Goldstein last term."
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,917.112,917.506,No!
1973.73-187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,953.766,959.636,"Your position would be the same if we’d never decided Goldstein, or if we decided the other way, I take it?"
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,959.636,961.984,"Yes, our position would be exactly the same."
1973.73-187,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.199,1728.466,You mean -- Mr. Griswold that applications for patent are by statute secret?
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1728.466,1732.545,They are kept secret with certain exceptions which are specified in the statute with a very narrow --
1973.73-187,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1732.545,1742.749,And you said the -- it can be narrow when the applica -- if the application is denied that it is never made public?
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1742.749,1749.584,Then it is not made public and the applicant continues to have whatever rights he may have under the law of trade secrets.
1973.73-187,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1749.584,1752.259,Do you have a reference to that code by any chance?
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1752.259,1754.046,"Yes, it is cited in our brief."
1973.73-187,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.566,1757.679,"Alright, if it’s in your brief, that’s fine."
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1757.679,1758.402,-- find it.
1973.73-187,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.402,1758.899,Thank you.
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1760.454,1769.616,"Finally, I would call the Court’s attention to the fact that trade secrets play a major role in the economy of the United States, both domestic and foreign."
1973.73-187,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.784,1787.751,Thank you.
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1787.751,1793.769,And it is cited in a footnote on page 35 of our brief.
1973.73-187,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1799.105,1802.598,"Yes, I wanted to be sure about you reference to Coca Cola."
1973.73-187,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1809.241,1811.148,That’s my understanding.
1973.73-187,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1877.013,1878.561,Thank you Mr. Girswold.
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,1887.034,1893.365,"May it please the Court, pardon me, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2094.714,2098.809,"Well, is that because it lasts longer than 17 years in part?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2098.809,2100.774,"Yes, that is --"
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2100.774,2105.389,"Of course Coca Cola has managed to keep its secret for more than 17 years, haven’t they?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2105.389,2115.084,"Well, Your Honor, yes I was coming to that, but the thing is we don’t think that Coca Cola is -- that’s a trade secret that’s outside of the scope of what we’re dealing with now."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.39,2149.848,"(Voice Overlap) Are you suggesting that if a man applies for a patent and it’s rejected as not patentable, say no invention, no -- that that would be subject to a -- that under your argument it would be a valid -- could validly subject to a trade secret?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2149.848,2150.166,I would --
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2150.166,2150.22,(Voice Overlap)
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2150.22,2170.339,"I would -- may I suggest -- I would say that under the decisions of this Court in Sears, Compco and Lear that if a man applies for a patent and its held not patentable and it's been in public use for more than a year, he could not get an injunction to prohibit somebody else even if there is a -- what is argued is that --"
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.339,2184.649,"(Voice Overlap) that be a -- do you think the -- this is -- you spin out from as an intent of Congress to prohibit that, would you cut by the virtue of patent laws?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2189.668,2192.093,"I would say it’s a conflict, yes."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.093,2201.979,And they -- and so you say Congress could’ve intended the states trade secret law to stand along with the patent law?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2201.979,2203.671,"I want to be careful, Your Honor."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.995,2229.903,"Well, why do you suppose Congress provides for secrecy of patent application?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2229.903,2244.348,"Well, the circumstances in which patent applications are filed, the number of patent applications, there’s no license activity whatsoever."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.852,2256.528,Well there is a specific provision in the code that says “patent applications will be kept secret if and unless that the applicant permits the publication?”
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2256.528,2260.103,"Correct, yes and actually the word they used is not secret, it’s confidential."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.103,2261.832,Yes.
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2261.832,2262.956,That’s correct.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.956,2278.316,And is that -- do you agree that -- that the Patent Office interprets the statute to require or permit the confidentiality if the application for patent is denied?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2278.316,2288.625,"Well, I think your -- with all due respect Your Honor, your -- your -- I -- the Patent Office as I understand it would never disclose a patent application."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2288.625,2288.725,Oh!
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2290.16,2291.028,Why sure.
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2291.028,2291.575,No.
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2291.575,2292.052,And it’s that --
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2292.052,2298.433,"Then what’s the difference between patent, what Justice White’s asking you?"
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.433,2321.697,"The question is, what is this -- that it is Congress -- if Congress -- it seems to me that Congress in the patent laws has recognized that there is a role for secrecy or confidentiality with respect to certain processes or design, or patentable material or un-patentable material?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2327.493,2333.035,"Well, Your Honor, I think you’re attaching much -- too much important to that -- importance to that provision."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2333.756,2335.561,"I gather you -- you say, you have to get around that the --"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2335.561,2336.004,Alright.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.004,2337.072,You just can’t say --
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2337.072,2338.499,"Alright, may I please --"
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.499,2339.761,-- it’s important.
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2339.761,2341.621,They’ve cited a number of other statutes.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.039,2391.011,"Well, I know, but let me go back to the question that I asked you that you didn’t answer."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2404.541,2406.134,Yes.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.134,2411.828,"And they will not reveal it to anyone without the consent of the applicant, I take it?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2411.828,2413.363,"That’s the practice, yes."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.363,2421.488,And would you suggest that that’s fully consistent with the act of Congress?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2421.488,2424.53,"Certainly yes, I see no problem with it."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2424.53,2428.727,"And what’s the purpose of that, to protect the secrecy of confidentiality?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2428.727,2438.87,I think the real purpose is to let a man with an invention deal with the Patent Office in confidence in knowing that he has an invention and he thinks it’s a --
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2438.87,2444.151,"But when these dealings are over, which they are substantially at the denial of the application."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2444.151,2444.656,Yes.
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2444.656,2452.198,Then what is the rationale for continuing the confidentiality of that information?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2452.198,2454.126,"Well, I think it’s the same rationale."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2455.469,2456.138,It’s a secret.
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2457.824,2468.37,"Well, they -- it isn’t saying it will keep the dis -- it -- what they say is, “We’ll not disclose what you’ve disclosed to us.”"
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2471.115,2473.297,What’s the purpose of it?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2473.297,2477.022,I think the purpose is to make people feel free to deal with the U.S. Patent Office.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.022,2477.172,Oh!
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2488.65,2489.971,You mean by an individual against the --
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.971,2493.205,"Yes, or by the applicant."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2493.205,2493.988,I suppose they would.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.508,2505.952,"Well, I know but if there would, you never would say that the same owner in the interest of protecting confidentiality couldn’t sue somebody who had a contract with to maintain that secret?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2505.952,2507.582,"No, I’m not saying that Your Honor."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.582,2509.085,Your saying he couldn’t get an injunction against --?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2509.085,2510.657,Correct.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.657,2513.329,But he could get an injunction against the Commission?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2513.329,2514.304,No he couldn’t.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.645,2516.851,Well --
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2516.851,2538.442,"Suppose three members of the Patent Office, technical staff who had dealt with the patent application, resigned from the Patent Office and set up a company after the patent application was denied, and then begun producing the very substance that was involved in the confidential file."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2550.536,2566.837,"I think the relief of -- in the court of equity should be, in that situation against disclosure of the trade secret because there they're assuming it’s not disclosed in the product that they’re selling."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2574.054,2577.188,"Well, there’s no patent, how do you get any royalty?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2577.188,2580.518,"Well, they have the same concept with respect to trade secrets Your Honor."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2580.518,2584.054,"But, then they could be -- they could not be enjoined but they could collect royalty?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2584.054,2584.499,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2599.49,2600.751,The fiduciary information?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2600.751,2614.411,"Yes, I say that they should be enjoined against any further disclosure of their -- of the secrets, assuming it’s not disclosed when they use it."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2633.077,2646.176,"Well, then are you suggesting that the remedy here is to get some kind of a -- an equity decree fixing a royalty for the use of this material, this invention?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2646.176,2649.27,"Well, I’m not sure what case you’re talking about Your Honor that --"
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2649.27,2649.706,"Now, on your case."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2649.706,2651.12,-- the case right in front of you?
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2651.12,2651.933,"Your case, you said --"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2651.933,2665.013,"Well, there’s been no use of the invention in this case. Our people haven’t used these secrets at all and I say that there -- that the -- and there is no real threat of disclosure."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2668.434,2681.246,"But if -- then this was followed by use and production, then you have indicated, I take it that a court of equity might fashion some kind of a decree for royalties, or damages?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2681.246,2711.888,"Well, I’d say if our people use it in production and abuse a confidence, then there should be damage relief, but there should not be any injunctive relief because when they give injunctive relief, you’re enjoining somebody from doing something where the Kewanee people rejected the idea of federal patent protection."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2722.684,2730.464,"Well, isn’t that why some industries now deliberately refrain from seeking patents where they might get them?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2750.256,2755.812,"Well, Your Honor, by the nature of the amici brief that seems to be the case, yes."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.375,2770.883,"But it does give only, the trade secret system gives relief only against those who have subject to the trade secret restriction?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2774.778,2776.387,No.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.563,2818.808,"If any of that competitors came by this information independently through their own staff, it certainly wouldn’t be subject to any litigation under the trade secret law?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2818.808,2823.952,No question about it.
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2893.409,2895.239,How does that help you here?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2897.74,2918.877,"Well I think it helps me on the idea that if a person submits an idea to the Patent Office, and the Patent Office says that it’s not patentable subject matter, then that -- he should not be enjoined from doing that under any circumstances."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2918.877,2923.44,"But it wasn’t a secret -- in that case, it wasn’t a secret though was it?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2923.44,2933.108,"Well, it was disclosed in secrecy to the corporation, and it was in a factory, I think it certainly was secret, yes."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2933.108,2935.313,But publicly used?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2935.313,2940.148,"Well it would be publicly used in accordance with the patent laws, yes Your Honor."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2940.148,2941.882,"Yes, but there was no patent here."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2941.882,2942.371,That’s correct.
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2963.732,2967.651,"In that case, was there any contract between them not to disclose?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2967.651,2968.677,I don’t know Your Honor.
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2968.677,2972.517,"That would be quite important, wouldn’t it?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,2972.517,2975.647,There probably be an implied contract to that effect.
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3059.35,3061.22,I think we’ll pick up there right after lunch.
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3061.22,3062.429,Okay.
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3073.548,3088.077,"Mr. McCoy, we’ve taken perhaps a little inordinate amount of your time and you have a -- you have a complex case before us, so we’ll enlarge you five minutes and add something to the Solicitor General, the former Solicitor General as well."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3090.013,3090.235,Thank you.

1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3094.163,3095.885,Thank you.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.604,3134.661,Can you tell me what an abandoned patent application is?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3134.661,3135.444,Pardon?
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.444,3139.014,What is an abandoned patent application?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3139.014,3139.343,"Well, you file --"
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3139.343,3142.611,Does that included one that’s been denied and you don’t press it?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3142.611,3145.641,"Yes, it would -- but it would include other kinds too."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.676,3164.803,"I notice the regulations speak of pending applications and abandoned ones, but it doesn’t speak specifically of denied ones."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3167.846,3169.131,Yes.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3169.131,3173.731,Thank you.

1973.73-187,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3296.353,3297.765,(Voice Overlap) by a contract --
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3297.765,3298.193,Pardon me?
1973.73-187,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3298.193,3303.146,And that you can’t protect yourself by a contract.
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3303.146,3308.395,"You can protect yourself by a contract Your Honor, with -- like these service agreements."
1973.73-187,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3308.395,3327.789,"(Voice Overlap) But I gather, your argument is that the contract made with these respondents not to disclose what they learned while employed with the petitioner, that’s irrelevant to the case entirely, the argument that you’re pointing?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3327.789,3329.322,"Well, I can’t say its irrelevant, but I --"
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.322,3331.975,"Well, you say that it's specifically enforceable."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3331.975,3333.709,I say they’re not enforceable.
1973.73-187,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3333.709,3334.297,Well that’s --
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3334.297,3336.467,As far as an injunction is concerned.
1973.73-187,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3339.695,3340.977,How about damages?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3340.977,3350.792,"I say you can get damages and the cases that discuss, there is a dissent in a Second Circuit case."

1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3385.582,3389.826,It's 209 F2d 493.
1973.73-187,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3389.826,3393.699,"Mr. McCoy, you’ve used the public domain twice now."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3400.794,3402.041,Yes.
1973.73-187,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3402.041,3412.106,"Well, I take it that Coca Cola is in public use, I suppose that Coke people would question whether it’s in the public domain and I take it that the Solicitor General would take the same position here?"

1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3423.175,3427.634,My answer would be there would be a public use.
1973.73-187,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3427.634,3430.498,I take it then you would say it is not on the public domain?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3430.498,3432.447,"I’d say it is in the public domain, too."
1973.73-187,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3432.447,3433.464,It is?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3433.464,3438.015,"By the definition of this Court in Sears, Compco & Lear."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.015,3441.289,"Well then, how can you say you could get damages?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3450.015,3450.669,The contract forbids --
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3450.669,3455.345,-- damages because the law forbids you to break your contract.
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3456.363,3457.428,Yes.
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3457.428,3463.795,"And so it’s a wrongful use, but you say equity could not enjoin the use?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3463.795,3466.2,"It should not, correct."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3466.2,3471.662,Although the same court could give damages on -- based on the fact that it’s a wrongful use?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3471.662,3482.387,"Correct, and if I may go back Your Honor, the Sixth Circuit has had really three cases before it on trade secrets."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3544.763,3554.26,"Well, you have another element in this case and that’s violation of a fiduciary relationship alleged, and apparently to some extent found that --"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3554.26,3560.625,"Well, Your Honor, with all due [Attempt to Laughter] respect further language of the Court of Appeals came from about that."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3567.494,3569.19,What did the District Court find on that?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3569.19,3573.074,The District Court found there had been no use or disclosure of the trade secrets.
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3598.262,3600.184,They didn’t even use any of the secrets?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3600.184,3601.712,They didn’t break a contract.
1973.73-187,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3601.712,3602.829,When they left and did not make use of it?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3602.829,3603.77,No!
1973.73-187,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3607.508,3608.649,Did they have a contract not to disclose when they left?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3608.649,3610.521,"Yes, they did."
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3612.015,3614.999,How did they come up with a 17 inch thing?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3614.999,3615.414,Pardon?
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3615.414,3620.541,How did they come up with the 17 inch when it -- only one other person had?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3620.541,3625.024,They came up with it from the -- first the -- there’s nothing --
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3625.024,3627.417,Didn’t they use the secrets they’ve got?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3627.417,3628.623,No they didn’t.
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3628.623,3630.448,(Inaudible)
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3630.448,3633.982,They are expired patents.
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3643.134,3651.482,"They used semantics and all, what did -- did they use anything that they’ve learned at the other company, anything?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3651.805,3659.239,"I’d have to answer, certainly they used what they learned at the other company, but it doesn’t mean that they were trade secrets."
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3660.88,3665.553,But did they use any trade methods that the other company had?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3665.553,3667.154,"Not that were secrets Your Honor, no."
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3667.337,3672.265,"I didn’t’ say secret, did they use any methods that the other one had?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3674.463,3677.893,"Well, they couldn’t have helped, but apply the knowledge they learned at Harshaw."
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3677.893,3679.904,"Well, thank you for bringing that much."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3679.904,3683.35,"Right, certainly but all I say Your Honor --"
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3683.35,3686.895,"And in doing that, didn’t they violate the terms of the contract?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3686.895,3687.406,No!
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3688.753,3689.986,Why not?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3689.986,3693.902,Because the contract says they can’t disclose confidential or secret information.
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3701.265,3703.828,Who else made a 17 inch one?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3703.828,3704.186,"Well, there are actually --"
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3704.186,3709.601,"It isn’t so public, I mean, how did the other companies didn’t do it?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3709.601,3727.298,"Your Honor, at page 1410 of the transcript in the District Court, the Harshaw men finally admitted in response to questions of the judge that, and this is in our -- it's cited in our brief too, that there is no magic in the trade secrets in 17 inches."
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3729.572,3734.386,"The District Court found to be contrary, didn’t he?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3738.424,3739.908,Yes.
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3739.908,3740.416,Didn’t he?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3740.416,3740.511,I guess he did.
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3740.511,3741.466,He found that.
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3741.466,3742.252,Yes he did.
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3742.252,3744.508,And you still say they weren’t trade secrets.
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3744.508,3746.048,"Correct, we say none of them were trade secrets."
1973.73-187,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3746.048,3748.93,"Well, you just say that District Court was wrong in its finding?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3748.93,3750.751,Yes.
1973.73-187,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3750.751,3754.366,"But the Court of Appeals is against you on that as well as the District Court, isn’t it?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3754.366,3755.442,"In what respect, Your Honor?"
1973.73-187,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3755.442,3762.144,"Well, I thought Court of Appeals upheld all the findings of the District Court except for the patent argument."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3762.144,3763.304,That’s correct.
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3763.304,3765.371,"Just the remedy, is all they disagreed on?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3765.371,3768.318,Correct.
1973.73-187,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3768.318,3774.221,"Mr. McCoy, as I understand your position now, it is that there had been no violation of the contract?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3774.221,3775.542,Correct.
1973.73-187,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3775.542,3782.693,And I thought you said earlier that there could be a suit for damages but I suppose you mean if there had been a violation?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3782.693,3786.566,"No, Your Honor, I was speaking generically as to the relief."
1973.73-187,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3812.842,3820.011,At page 67 of the findings of fact in article 48 in the appendix.
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3844.307,3845.479,"Yes, sir that is."
1973.73-187,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3845.479,3848.287,And you say there was no contract?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3852.327,3856.632,"Well, it's -- there is -- yes."
1973.73-187,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3856.632,3858.302,Did Hamner sign that?
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3858.302,3861.428,"Well, he signed it with a different company, but --"
1973.73-187,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3861.428,3868.07,"Well this says, they executed it on or about March 11, of ’64, an agreement was provided, wasn’t’ that an agreement with the --"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3868.07,3882.976,"Well, it was the -- it was not with Kewanee, it was with a wholly owned subsidiary with Kewanee and the reason that Hamner left Kewanee is because they had a contract with them to keep him employed until 1974, and they dissolved the company to avoid the contract."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3885.111,3886.801,"That’s another lawsuit though, is it?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3886.801,3888.778,"Yes sir, it is Your Honor."
1973.73-187,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3888.778,3892.092,"Mr. McCoy, may I ask you one more question."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3910.581,3912.965,"My position on that Your Honor, is no."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3954.969,3969.362,"Well, the Sears and Compco Mr. McCoy, the object was something you could see as to its configuration, just as you could this thermal drinking cup."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3980.13,3980.619,No.
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3980.619,3987.155,"So some distinction between Sears and Compco cases and this situation, in that respect."
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,3987.155,3990.998,"Well, legally Your Honor, no, I don’t think so."
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4006.112,4023.215,"When you can’t keep a secret or something that you actually issue to the whole world as you do with a book if you publish it without a copyright, or the lamp stand in these other cases, can you?"
1973.73-187,1,45638,william_c_mccoy_jr,,4035.555,4052.957,"Well, no Your Honor, but the concept of the lamp case was that there was a design patent involved there, I believe and the Illinois, I mean the courts in Illinois said, “That’s an invalid patent.”"
1973.73-187,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4124.368,4125.778,Thank you Mr. McCoy.
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4127.176,4129.567,Yes Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.73-187,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4129.567,4134.09,"Will you state that for me, what -- whether there was a contract or not?"
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4134.09,4136.113,"Well, there were six contracts, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-187,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4148.084,4151.76,"The contract had a succession clause in it, did it not?"
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4151.76,4152.474,It had a what?
1973.73-187,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4152.474,4154.238,Succession clause?
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4154.238,4163.515,"It applied with respect to successors, yes and Hamner was in the employee of Harshaw for awhile before he left."
1973.73-187,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4163.515,4170.716,"Now, what about the Benefree (ph) trade secret agreement, was that only with Benefree (ph) or was there other trade secret agreements like that?"
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4172.813,4175.361,There were contracts with all six.
1973.73-187,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4208.557,4219.401,"And I take it, the District Court found that there was an imminent danger of disclosure of trade secret that they were forbidden -- that the defendants were forbidden to foreclose?"
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4219.401,4221.369,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-187,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4260.783,4266.144,And they found that the -- that that disclosure in use would be violative of contract to the --
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4266.144,4271.618,Would violate the contract and the fiduciary relationship.
1973.73-187,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4376.926,4381.032,"How about the denied patent applications, are they published?"
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4381.032,4382.453,What applications?
1973.73-187,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4382.453,4386.141,"What about applications that don’t succeed, that they are --"
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4386.141,4388.287,"They are not published, they are kept in secret."
1973.73-187,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4388.287,4390.662,Where do you find that in the statute where the (Voice Overlap) --
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4390.662,4396.009,"That is discussed in footnote 35, in footnote 11 on --"
1973.73-187,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4396.009,4400.207,(Voice Overlap) it talks about abandoned ones.
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4400.207,4424.278,"Well, that’s a -- there’s a good deal of this patent language that I’m not -- I think it is my understanding that patents which are abandoned that you are free to terminate your patent application at anytime you want to, and that the material remain secret."
1973.73-187,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4424.278,4424.601,Yes.
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4424.601,4429.907,The only thing that the Patent Office publishes is patents which are granted.
1973.73-187,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4429.907,4432.802,Or where it’s waived?
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4432.802,4433.561,Or where?
1973.73-187,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4433.561,4435.38,Or where it’s waived under another --
1973.73-187,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4435.38,4437.158,"Or if it’s waived, yes."
1973.73-187,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4442.607,4443.37,Thank you gentlemen.
