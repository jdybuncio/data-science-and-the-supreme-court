2013.12-1493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.187,"We'll hear argument next in Case 12-1493, Abramski v. United States."
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,6.279,8.466,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1493,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,56.603,66.364,"What would happen if two people walk into the gun store, one person hands the money to the other and says, buy me that gun?"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,66.364,68.831,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,68.831,73.596,"Is that not actionable, according to your theory?"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,73.596,78.703,"Your Honor, the circumstance where there are two lawful gun owners, that is permissible."
2013.12-1493,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,90.621,94.547,What's -- what's truthful about saying you're the buyer--
2013.12-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,94.547,96.244,Please finish what you were saying.
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,98.322,99.149,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,127.403,127.604,I'm sorry.
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,142.989,143.786,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,154.408,155.844,"Well, in the gift -- in the gift situation."
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,161.124,161.623,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,161.623,164.73,The -- the dealer has to record the name of the buyer; right?
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,164.73,165.589,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,165.589,166.963,And the address of the buyer?
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,166.963,168.479,"Yes, sir."
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,168.479,170.26,And do an instant check on the buyer?
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,170.26,171.51,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,171.51,184.614,"Now, why would -- why would Congress have wanted those things with respect to the person who was just the straw purchaser and not the person -- the person who's actually going to acquire the weapon?"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,184.614,191.47,"The reason, Your Honor, is that this legislation, the way Congress designed it, is not focused on sort of the end point."
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,204.716,206.417,Why wouldn't they be concerned about the starting point?
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,266.533,276.233,"Your Honor, I think, to your first point about why, why starting points, the reason is because all that Congress wanted is to provide law enforcement with a way to trace the firearm."
2013.12-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.181,309.078,"I suppose that your answer to what sense it makes is that was the compromise, that there was strong opposition to any gun control law, and the condition was you get the buyer and you don't make the buyer promise not to give it to somebody else."
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,316.92,334.24,"Your Honor, that would -- that would violate other laws because Congress in the Firearm Owners Protection Act clarified that -- or amended the provision to provide that a private citizen who transfers a firearm to someone they know or have reasonable cause to believe is prohibited, that's a crime."
2013.12-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.24,338.083,"What about somebody, somebody who is qualified to own a firearm?"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,342.83,347.047,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think the government has conceded that if it's someone in your own State, there's--"
2013.12-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.047,348.906,Don't have to register it?
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,353.81,355.122,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.728,378.488,"So you're never going to know who the end user is once the gun is sold, whether you take the, you know, the straw buyer's name or the -- or the other person's name or both."
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,380.58,381.94,"Yes, sir."
2013.12-1493,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,384.814,387.641,Language matters in a statute.
2013.12-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.567,453.237,He made that up.
2013.12-1493,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,454.844,455.415,"--No, I didn't."
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,482.415,492.551,"--With respect, Your Honor, I think that the principle you described of a straw man or straw purchases in the context, historical context you described it, I don't believe is a criminal context."
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,526.538,535.598,You still have not explained what purpose is served by obtaining the name of the straw purchaser and doing an instant check on the straw purchaser.
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,559.119,560.853,"--With respect, Your Honor, I disagree."
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,586.077,589.716,"So they find the gun dealer and the gun dealer says, I sold it to Mr. Straw."
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,610.254,615.269,"--But, Your Honor, again Congress understood that that's how the statute worked because, for example--"
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,615.269,617.549,"Well, what you're saying is they did a meaningless thing."
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,621.469,622.094,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.689,659.86,And in some cases they can track it all the way.
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,676.868,677.524,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,689.832,696.314,Your position is that this is not a material misstatement; is that correct?
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,696.314,697.111,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,697.111,709.168,"Why isn't it material in light of the fact that it was a question that was on the government form that was promulgated, that was directed by regulations?"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,709.168,713.619,"The reason, Your Honor -- I think this is a critical concession by the government."
2013.12-1493,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,765.442,770.846,"Mr. Dietz, can we go back to the question that Justice Alito raised."
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,845.629,854.937,"The reason, Your Honor, is because Congress understood that private sales -- that there was an importance to private sales between citizens."
2013.12-1493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,928.766,940.277,"In -- in the situation that Justice Alito hypothesized of the person who's doing this several times a month and has the ad in the Yellow Pages, is that -- is that person subject to regulation as a dealer?"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,940.277,941.136,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,972.249,985.384,"But this -- this family member, the uncle, residing in Pennsylvania, he could not have purchased that gun in Virginia, isn't that right, because he's a nonresident?"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,985.384,987.493,"--With respect, Your Honor, I disagree."
2013.12-1493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1006.109,1017.074,"But wouldn't he -- wouldn't he have to comply with the 552(c), which says how somebody who doesn't show up in person can purchase a gun?"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1031.976,1039.987,"With respect, Your Honor, I don't think that's what Congress meant in Section 922(c), which is the provision that deals with absent buyers."
2013.12-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1119.454,1126.483,"What is the government's -- I guess I should ask the government, but does the government contend that there are two buyers now?"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1137.573,1152.503,"Your Honor, I don't know the government's position, but our position is that there's one buyer, and that's the person who's actually paying for the gun, filling out the forms, undergoing a background check, and leaving the gun -- leaving the gun store with the gun in their hand."
2013.12-1493,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1168.498,1171.277,--What -- what position are you taking here?
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1193.972,1195.049,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1206.809,1209.308,Even if their intent is to sell it to a prohibited person?
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1209.308,1210.839,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1228.723,1243.529,"If we disagree with you on the first point about the straw purchaser, would you -- would you lose on the grounds that Mr. Abramski's uncle could not have lawfully purchased the gun at that store because he wasn't a resident of the State?"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1243.529,1245.075,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1263.011,1266.02,But he couldn't have taken possession of it in -- in Pennsylvania.
2013.12-1493,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1266.02,1266.832,In Virginia.
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1266.832,1267.757,In Virginia.
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1267.757,1268.659,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1296.591,1300.356,But would it have been a lawful sale if the gun had been delivered to him on the spot?
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1300.356,1302.574,--To Mr. Abramski's uncle?
2013.12-1493,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1302.574,1302.979,Yes.
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1314.725,1315.1,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1334.295,1343.666,"In describing what happened here, you -- you -- you said that Abramski went in and then went to Pennsylvania and gave the gun to his uncle."
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1379.652,1381.807,--Your Honor--
2013.12-1493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1381.807,1383.291,"I mean, we can ask the government--"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1383.291,1383.744,--Yes.
2013.12-1493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1383.744,1386.336,"--as Justice Scalia indicates, but under -- as you understand their case."
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1386.336,1387.477,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1412.42,1419.183,"Could -- could you address the other -- the other point here, which is the one I have more trouble with, to tell you the truth, Count 2?"
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1419.183,1419.651,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.435,1497.37,Can you lie in -- in answering questions that the government has no technical right to answer?
2013.12-1493,0,39056,richard_d_dietz,,1523.859,1531.98,"Your Honor, I think the key in this case is that Congress included a materiality element for almost every false statement that would occur in this context."
2013.12-1493,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1560.605,1561.624,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1569.308,1571.964,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.071,1619.46,"As to the first, are there two buyers in your view?"
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1619.46,1623.349,"I think, in a sense, you could understand there to be two buyers."
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.536,1634.907,"Well, what does -- what does the person who's buying for somebody else -- he has to provide both names or just the name of the real buyer?"
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1634.907,1646.98,"Justice Scalia, if you -- if you hypothesize the situation in which two roommates wanted to buy a firearm together -- firearms are expensive; they can't each afford their own, but they want one for personal protection."
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.082,1667.441,"And both of them had to take possession, right?"
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1667.441,1670.158,"In that, right."
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.158,1672.158,But that's not the case here.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1677.031,1681.248,In the straw purchaser cases the person takes possession in an ephemeral sense.
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1689.338,1690.447,Where in this -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.447,1694.539,So there are two buyers and both of them have to be on the form.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1694.539,1697.117,"If there are two buyers, the two people, the roommates, are buying, they would each need to--"
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.117,1702.927,I can understand you saying the real buyer is the person who put up the money.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1702.927,1709.144,"--Well, of course the form tells you who the real buyer is, and it's a substance over form inquiry."
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1714.845,1720.889,Where in the Act does -- is the basis for the requirement on the form?
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1726.886,1732.743,That is ATF's reasonable interpretation of the statute and I was just going to get to that.
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.743,1733.587,Its current one.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1734.101,1738.084,"That's the current one, and it's been consistent for the last 20 years, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1750.299,1751.205,(A)(6)?
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1751.205,1756.158,"--922(a)(6), which is the count 1 of the conviction."
2013.12-1493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1829.157,1830.126,That's awfully broad.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1894.71,1895.834,"Right, Justice Breyer."
2013.12-1493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1910.439,1915.302,"But you also quote ""material"", the need for it to be material to the lawful ness of the sale."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1915.302,1915.654,Correct.
2013.12-1493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.654,1917.639,You seem to concede that in the brief.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1923.419,1926.542,So this is where we get back to the fact that there are two different issues in this case.
2013.12-1493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1933.041,1942.817,"If he was -- if he then -- if he is the actual purchaser, then he falls within the term of a person to whom the firearm was sold or delivered."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1944.567,1946.066,--And his name wasn't put on the farm.
2013.12-1493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1946.066,1947.206,"Oh, there's no question about that."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1947.206,1947.642,Right.
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.502,1995.061,"Why is that -- why is that any more horrible than the notion that as soon as I buy it I walk out of the store and I meet this guy in the parking lot, he says: Hey, that's a nifty looking gun there."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2003.776,2005.495,"You could, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.495,2016.46,"So the notion that the gun would somehow get into the hands of somebody who, you know, who wasn't registered or who couldn't buy it himself, that's going to happen any way."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2020.458,2025.564,"Justice Scalia, Congress was obviously balancing a number of interests when it enacted these provisions."
2013.12-1493,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2053.616,2062.22,"Mr. Palmore, when the Agency changed its view in 1994, there was no change in the statutory text, was there?"
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2062.22,2062.908,"There was not, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-1493,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2062.908,2084.929,"And at that time, the interpretation was that you committed the offense if you sold -- if the person, the true buyer, was an unlawful -- a person to whom firearms could not be sold."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2111.873,2114.466,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-1493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.005,2138.58,"Yeah, but still -- look, what I thought was a very good argument on your side is exactly what I said."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2165.227,2184.046,"Justice Breyer, I think that -- that the other provisions that Petitioner is referring to is 922(d), which makes it unlawful for anyone, licensed or unlicensed, to transfer a firearm to someone in a prohibited category if the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the person is in a prohibited category."
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2247.151,2253.494,I think it's very -- it's very problematic to talk about the overriding purpose when you're dealing with a very sensitive compromise.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2262.364,2268.081,"You're right, Your Honor, just as there's nothing in the mail or wire fraud statute that talks about Ponzi schemes."
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2269.673,2279.279,"Well, but there wasn't -- there wasn't a strong lobby in Congress saying we're the group that supports Ponzi schemes, so maybe it makes more sense to have a broad construction of that provision."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2295.929,2300.333,"--Your Honor, I think we do have a textual argument, which I referred to before."
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2305.957,2312.735,"Well, you agree that in Justice Alito's example, that person is regulated as a gun dealer, right?"
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2312.735,2315.984,"--At a certain point, a person is--"
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2315.984,2316.93,The Yellow Pages.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2316.93,2317.37,--Right.
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2317.37,2317.705,They're putting an ad--
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2317.705,2320.094,"If they're operating as a seller of firearms, they would have to register."
2013.12-1493,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2320.094,2321.877,"Well, I meant my hypothetical."
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.199,2342.229,"You wouldn't think of prosecuting him, would you?"
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2343.54,2352.265,"I mean, at a certain point, if the -- if the conduct is so pervasive and regular, if he's acting as a dealer, then you might be able to get him on that separate provision."
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.739,2363.122,Before you got on--
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2363.122,2363.347,--Yeah.
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.347,2366.096,--I wanted to get back to the Al Capone hypothetical.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2390.571,2397.74,"And my point, Justice Scalia, is that in a straw-purchase context, you're not necessarily going to know you're dealing with Al Capone or someone of his record."
2013.12-1493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2403.097,2405.378,"Well, Mr. Palmore, is that right?"
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2438.754,2440.425,"I think that's right, Justice Kagan."
2013.12-1493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2445.924,2448.119,I think he said that just right in here.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2448.119,2448.135,"Right, he did."
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2566.637,2567.932,"--Now, this -- this -- now you're talking about the second question."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2567.932,2568.712,Correct.
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2568.712,2582.27,"And the provision that makes the -- the information that's required, makes it material -- correct me if I'm wrong -- is 922(b)(5), right?"
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2583.348,2584.066,That's one of the provisions.
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2584.066,2584.622,--Okay.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2605.178,2605.659,Right.
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2618.595,2618.601,Yes.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2619.648,2628.474,"--If you assume I'm right on issue 1, then I think that the materiality on issue 2 follows directly from -- from this provision that you quote in 922(b)(5)."
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2628.474,2643.61,"Because then 922(b)(5) says, but the fact that it's -- has to be the actual person who ends up with the gun."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2643.61,2643.929,Yes.
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2656.008,2657.491,"Well, 922--"
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2657.491,2660.134,"--(t), which says that you can't--"
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2660.134,2662.978,--Where -- where is that?
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2662.978,2664.008,--This is on page 13.
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2664.008,2664.93,Is that on the appendix to your brief?
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2664.93,2666.136,"No, I apologize, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2685.766,2693.919,"If you're right on Question 1, 922(t) just makes this a slam dunk on Question 2."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2722.148,2724.608,"I think that's right, Justice Kagan."
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.952,2731.339,I can't look at all these things because they are not in your brief.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2744.382,2745.445,--You're right.
2013.12-1493,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2773.903,2779.384,"Well, it's not just the structure -- it's not just the overriding purpose."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2802.937,2808.639,"I -- I agree, because those requirements would be pointless if they could be satisfied."
2013.12-1493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2808.639,2823.507,"But it's going to be the same problem, which is the straw because the transferee, in context, probably refers to the person to whom the dealer transferred the weapon; namely, the buyer."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2874.143,2877.844,"Well, Justice Breyer, a couple of points about this."
2013.12-1493,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2898.679,2899.773,Then what about the donee?
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2899.773,2905.067,The ATF has never interpreted this provision to -- to prohibit gifts.
2013.12-1493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2924.716,2927.512,You don't think that crime bosses--
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2927.512,2928.196,I'm sorry.
2013.12-1493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2928.196,2936.774,"--You don't think crime bosses look at their underlings, pay them a lot of money for whatever they're doing and just say, go get me a gun and give it to me?"
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2936.774,2942.583,"Well, I think that that -- I would suggest that that wouldn't be a gift under that scenario, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-1493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2942.583,2943.208,Why?
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2943.208,2949.862,"That person is working for the crime boss and as part of his duties to go obtain a gun, then he's buying that gun on behalf of the crime boss."
2013.12-1493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2949.862,2952.596,Could you answer Justice Kennedy's question?
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2972.869,2978.412,I think the question -- there could be a factual question in some of these cases.
2013.12-1493,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2994.532,2995.484,I'm not sure what you mean.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2997.203,2997.404,--Right.
2013.12-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3008.823,3009.776,This is a criminal statute.
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3021.116,3025.505,"--Justice Scalia, and Huddleston is helpful in this regard, too."
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3063.724,3065.505,"Well, he's not told that in the statute."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3069.924,3071.954,"--That's right, Your -- Chief Justice Roberts."
2013.12-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3102.426,3108.362,"As to whether or not there was a sale, suppose the facts in this case, it was a Glock, I think--"
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3108.362,3109.018,--Yes.
2013.12-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3109.018,3117.983,"--was -- was delivered, and suddenly the -- Abramski finds that it's a valuable collector's item."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3134.335,3137.1,"I think it's not clear, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3139.099,3142.379,"Well, if it isn't -- if it isn't, then there wasn't -- then there -- there was a subsequent sale."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3142.379,3143.535,--Right.
2013.12-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3145.846,3146.971,"Well, I'm asking about that."
2013.12-1493,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3146.971,3148.268,Right.
2013.12-1493,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3261.815,3262.971,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1493,2,39056,richard_d_dietz,,3264.673,3278.027,"Justice Ginsburg, you asked counsel whether this was a case where there were two interpretations of the statute."
2013.12-1493,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3450.519,3468.965,"Well, if we agreed with you on the -- on the second argument, would the government have to prove that the person to whom the straw purchaser transferred the gun was ineligible or would it be a defense if it was shown that the person was eligible?"
2013.12-1493,2,39056,richard_d_dietz,,3468.965,3471.527,"I think the government would have the burden there, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3497.609,3503.498,But the other purpose that they said this provision has is to get gun dealers to run checks.
2013.12-1493,2,39056,richard_d_dietz,,3506.309,3507.747,"That's right, Your Honor."
2013.12-1493,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3510.746,3511.041,Yes.
2013.12-1493,2,39056,richard_d_dietz,,3520.318,3521.443,--Thank you.
2013.12-1493,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3521.443,3522.271,"Thank you, counsel."
