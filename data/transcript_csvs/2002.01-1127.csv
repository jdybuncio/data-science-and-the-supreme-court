2002.01-1127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,20.312,"We'll hear argument next in Number 01-1127, Bill Lockyer v. Leandro Andrade."
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,22.707,26.339,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,90.12,100.605,"Is this the case in which the Ninth Circuit first decided for itself the constitutional question, and then decided whether the State court had reasonably applied it?"
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,100.605,101.887,"--Yes, that is correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,230.227,243.063,"May I just ask on that point, do you think there was not even the need to look at the second or third elements of the test because there is not even a basis for saying this sentence was grossly disproportionate?"
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,243.063,245.375,"--Yes, Justice Stevens, I agree with that."
2002.01-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,246.573,253.427,"In other words, the case could be decided on the ground that there's... an inference of gross disproportionality should not be drawn in this case?"
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,253.427,277.863,"--That's correct, Your Honor, I do agree with that, and on the Eighth Amendment, the pure Eighth Amendment question, that there was no inference of gross disproportionality here, and therefore the second and third prongs were not required, but the State court did, in fact, apply a second and third prong analysis, and that leads into the only portion of the Ninth Circuit's opinion that really addresses the reasonableness of the State court's decision."
2002.01-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.245,309.648,"Would you just refresh my recollection on the facts of this case, because the prior argument, the argument was made that violence was the critical matter in the prior conviction."
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,313.257,315.964,"--The record does not indicate whether there were or not, Your Honor."
2002.01-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,354.974,362.404,Do you agree with your colleague in the prior case that violence is a critical element in the priors or not?
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,362.404,363.313,"--No, I do not, Your Honor."
2002.01-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,363.313,363.602,Okay.
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,363.602,375.036,"Not to be overly inconsistent between our mutual arguments, but I think this Court has held that the presence or absence of violence does not necessarily dictate the proportionality analysis."
2002.01-1127,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,385.233,411.034,"I agree on the merits that we can't convert this Court into a sentencing commission, but it's also true, I guess, that there must be some way of deciding when a State has gone too far, and I don't know any way that's other than highly subjective, except to look at data that would show what happened in the past, but if you take that, how do you give the State the right to become harsher in the future?"
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,427.752,429.117,I don't think that--
2002.01-1127,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,429.117,430.064,--in a harsh direction?
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,430.064,438.898,"--I don't think that the fact that it's going to change dramatically is determinative or dispositive, but I do think, Justice Breyer, that there are a couple of responses to that question."
2002.01-1127,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,495.823,502.427,"It has to be the latter, but still there has to be a way of deciding when they go too far."
2002.01-1127,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.436,526.37,"And that's what I'm looking for, and I look to... you know, what I've said before as a way of isolating the problem, and then... and I think here you might say that on the merits of your case, it'll... you'd be hard-pressed to find many examples outside of the three strikes laws where there were such sentences given for such things."
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,526.37,527.03,--I--
2002.01-1127,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,527.03,528.433,I think so.
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,531.117,536.857,"--I understand your question, Justice Breyer, to basically go to what is grossly disproportionate."
2002.01-1127,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,536.857,537.433,That's right.
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,537.433,550.686,"And the Court, this Court has not defined that term, or given us any clear guidelines, but we do know that by the very nature, grossly disproportionate implies an extreme situation, and--"
2002.01-1127,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,550.686,567.898,"Suppose we were to find... and there's argument in this about the briefs both ways, but suppose we were to conclude that this has likely been a most effective scheme, that it's reduced the crime rate in the State of California."
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,588.868,605.298,"--Not really, because I suppose... I mean, in an extreme example, Justice Kennedy, we could lock up everybody for extremely long periods of time, and it could still go past that point of proportion, of gross disproportionality."
2002.01-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,612.524,615.618,"Well, what's your limiting principle here?"
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,615.618,616.156,--The limiting--
2002.01-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,616.156,616.983,Is there one?
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,616.983,639.896,"--The limiting principle we offer is, or we urge upon the Court is the one that's been mentioned in a... or has been used as related to an example mentioned in a couple of the Court's opinions, when they refer to lifetime for parking, and the reasonable mean... understanding of that example is often cited as a life sentence for a first-time parking--"
2002.01-1127,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,639.896,639.896,But that--
2002.01-1127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,639.896,642.68,"--Excuse me, what is your limiting principle?"
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,643.694,653.354,"--The limiting principle would be that those are, that sentences are grossly disproportionate when they are not reasonably susceptible to debate amongst reasonable minds."
2002.01-1127,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,653.354,654.468,But--
2002.01-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,654.468,655.666,--You seem to be--
2002.01-1127,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,655.666,659.093,"--in this particular case it's 50 years for stealing some tapes, right?"
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,659.093,663.279,"No, Your Honor, I... Justice Stevens, I disagree with that."
2002.01-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,668.359,669.223,But they're consecutive.
2002.01-1127,0,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,669.223,670.421,They are consecutive.
2002.01-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,670.421,671.535,"Well, why isn't that 50?"
2002.01-1127,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1598.21,1604.443,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1623.64,1625.498,A century of decisions?
2002.01-1127,2,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,3407.161,3408.276,Thank you.
2002.01-1127,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3569.598,3571.167,But that's under the three strikes regime?
2002.01-1127,2,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,3571.167,3571.827,"Correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-1127,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3574.223,3577.939,So that doesn't tell us much about the constitutionality of the three strikes regime.
2002.01-1127,2,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,3577.939,3578.36,--No.
2002.01-1127,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3586.162,3588.929,"But we have the SG's footnote, which does have a few."
2002.01-1127,2,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,3588.929,3589.672,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1127,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3589.672,3590.87,But not this serious.
2002.01-1127,2,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,3592.728,3597.186,"Well, I don't think... I would not characterize it as trivial, but I understand--"
2002.01-1127,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3597.186,3600.324,Not this... I'm looking for the right word.
2002.01-1127,2,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,3601.356,3612.13,"--I think that under the California scheme it's clear presumptively that theft is a felony offense, and we simply grant... and California simply grants the first-time offender an opportunity to reform."
2002.01-1127,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3643.875,3645.195,"Thank you, Mr. Danzig."
2002.01-1127,2,20784,douglas_p_danzig,,3645.195,3645.817,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2002.01-1127,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3645.817,3646.847,The case is submitted.
