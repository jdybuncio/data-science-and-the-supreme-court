1990.89-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.837,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-1217, Jones Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,35.994,39.597,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.372,215.245,Why do you say it had to be a political or ideological activity?
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,215.245,224.291,"It could not be part of the political bargaining process in Arizona, because bargaining was prohibited by the State of Arizona for educational employees."
1990.89-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.291,233.747,"Well, so, you define any political and ideological as meaning any activity that does not accrue to the benefit of the bargaining unit?"
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,233.747,247.736,"No, Your Honor, political and ideological is any public advocacy or dealing with Government outside the bargaining process, petitioning of government speech and association."
1990.89-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,247.736,249.96,"Well, I thought this was just a study out in Arizona?"
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,249.96,258.113,"It was a study of school finance, and school finance in Arizona was accomplished only through legislation, not through bargaining."
1990.89-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,258.113,268.242,"Well, I would think your argument would be, not that that was political or ideological, but since it didn't benefit the members of the bargaining unit it was no good."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,270.001,271.443,"Our argument, Your Honor, is that it's both."
1990.89-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,278.91,289.836,"--But if, if one sets out to do a neutral study that just doesn't have much to do with what the person is at, I would not think that's political or ideological."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,295.582,308.101,"Your Honor, I think it related to the question of taxes and educational appropriations in the State of Arizona as well as being outside the bargaining unit in this case."
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,308.101,310.823,"May I, may I just ask you a little more about this millage point?"
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,330.297,330.787,"Impermissible, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,330.787,331.508,Because it's--
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,331.508,333.671,It's outside the bargaining process.
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,343.208,351.005,"--So, so you really don't rely particularly on the fact that the millage happened to be for grammar schools and so forth rather than colleges?"
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,351.005,354.238,"Well, Your Honor, I'm saying that there's a bright-line test--"
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,354.238,354.368,"I mean, your argument... let me put this way."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,362.785,364.506,"--Your Honor, I think there's a bright-line test."
1990.89-1217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.931,476.127,"Well, Mr. LaJeunesse, I'm not sure that Abood drew a so-called bright-line test for public sector employees."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,558.746,563.83,Germane... the definition of germane under both law and--
1990.89-1217,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.83,565.031,But anyway it has to be germane--
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,565.031,567.362,"--Germane is closely related, Justice White."
1990.89-1217,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.362,573.126,--It has to be germane to the services under the particular bargaining contract.
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,573.126,574.168,That's correct.
1990.89-1217,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,574.168,575.297,And the particular unit.
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,575.297,576.338,"Germane and closely related, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,606.578,608.269,If there were--
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,608.269,609.221,The contingencies--
1990.89-1217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,609.221,609.691,--would it make a difference?
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,609.691,646.777,"--If... if you had a legally enforceable contract spelling out the bargaining services that had to be provided and when they had to be provided, and you had the allocation necessary to separate... and this is the second distinction between the service contract and affiliation... if you had the necessary recordkeeping to separate out the nonbargaining functions of the union, then the answer might be that the costs would be chargeable."
1990.89-1217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,673.597,705.31,"Going back to lobbying for a minute, I suppose in the public sector if the union is out lobbying to try to get increased health benefits, for example, for public employees including those in the bargaining unit or a tax increase to fund payment of teachers' salaries Statewide that would affect those in the bargaining unit as well."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,708.532,708.77,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,709.06,709.761,And why not?
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,709.761,724.142,"--I... because, number one, we're dealing with an activity which the state has excluded from the special bargaining process and has left in the normal political processes."
1990.89-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,882.965,896.844,"Mr.... Mr. LaJeunesse, what if there were pending in the Michigan legislature a bill that would have directed the 10-percent reduction in the appropriation for all colleges like Ferris State College?"
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,909.562,912.604,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe so because it's outside the process."
1990.89-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,938.073,940.784,Could... could the... the union--
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,942.494,944.467,"A program to register and vote, Your Honor?"
1990.89-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,944.467,944.837,Uh-huh.
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,944.837,946.409,I think that clearly would be nonchargeable.
1990.89-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,948.172,949.992,You think it's what?
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,949.992,958.029,"Not constitutionally chargeable to the objecting employee... program to register and vote, as I understood the Court's question."
1990.89-1217,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,958.029,971.428,"Could, could a union publish in its own publication the voting record of, say, the school board or state legislators with respect to issues that affect the bargaining unit?"
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,971.428,973.808,"Justice Kennedy, they could publish it."
1990.89-1217,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,975.06,976.88,"Well, I mean with the fees of the dissenters?"
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,976.88,979.863,"--But I do not believe they could use the dissenters' dues for that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.493,1015.147,"Mr. LaJeunesse, one category of charges that you say were improper really is quite different from the others in that you concede that they're... that they're not part of the legislative process and you can see that they do narrowly affect the particular bargaining in the bargaining unit."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1024.743,1025.942,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.803,1027.294,"Now, why are they not chargeable?"
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1030.026,1035.689,--I don't think the activity has to be illegal for it to be not chargeable.
1990.89-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1055.741,1063.458,"Well, it... it has no governmental interest... I mean, it... by parity of reasoning you can say it has no governmental interest in paying higher wages to public employees."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1063.458,1066.329,"--I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1066.329,1068.321,"So then nothing is chargeable, because--"
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1068.321,1068.601,"No, what--"
1990.89-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1068.601,1071.092,--you don't want these bargaining units to be successful.
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1073.603,1081.27,"--The governmental interest, Your Honor, is in reimbursing the employee... the union for its cost of performing its statutory functions."
1990.89-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.129,1104.346,--But one of its statutory functions is conducting... conducting negotiations with all of the maneuvering and feinting and what not that negotiations entail.
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1114.003,1114.794,But that's not--
1990.89-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1114.794,1117.787,So what about this phony preparation for a strike which would never occur?
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1121.82,1138.662,"--Your Honor, I don't think it's part of the negotiating process any more than it would be if the Ferris Faculty Association had gone out and hired the Mafia to threaten Ferris State College that they would break the legs of the members of the Board of Control--"
1990.89-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1138.662,1139.443,Now you're making a different argument.
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1142.017,1143.206,"--Well, I'm saying--"
1990.89-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.206,1144.328,Or illegal to threaten an illegal strike.
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1144.328,1166.093,"--The Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court have held in the Male case, which we cite in the briefs, that it was against the public policy of Michigan to require the nonmembers to contribute to a fund, a strike fund, which would in the future be used to fund strikes."
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.358,1227.012,"May I... may I... this... your asking us to look at the testimony and so forth, brings to mind this question."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1263.752,1264.361,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.912,1294.283,But nobody is being compelled to make a speech.
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1305.492,1307.794,But this Court held in Abood--
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.794,1308.184,Yeah.
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1308.184,1318.832,--and in Elrod that requiring those financial contributions which are then used to speak on issues as to which the employee is in opposition is tantamount to coerce belief.
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1325.998,1333.562,So you say it's a pure question... each of these issues is a pure question of law in your view?
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1333.562,1333.702,That's correct.
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.988,1348.792,"Well, again, on this strike business, I mean, a lot of the money was in a pot there that they said might... might finance a strike and might finance negotiation."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1351.315,1353.276,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't believe it was."
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.072,1366.936,But they did have union meetings at the strike headquarters?
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1366.936,1368.636,To discuss going out on strike.
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.636,1371.297,"Well, and their bargaining position."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1371.297,1380.434,It was... the only purpose of having a separate strike headquarters instead of their normal meeting place was to threaten the college with what would be an illegal act had it occurred.
1990.89-1217,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1380.434,1390.041,"Was there any finding one way or the other on whether they discussed informational picketing, which I take it is not unlawful, I would assume."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1390.041,1394.636,"Your Honor, there was... there were expenditures on informational picketing."
1990.89-1217,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1394.636,1396.956,Was this part of the union hall meeting?
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1396.956,1401.949,"Those expenditures... we don't have the minutes of the meeting in the record, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1456.304,1461.96,"Well, suppose there's informational picketing at the headquarters of the school board, is that... in front of the building."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1478.08,1481.162,"I think not if they're picketing publicly, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1492.351,1493.433,Can I ask you--
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1493.433,1497.724,It was not... it was advertising not just picketing at the school board meeting.
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1497.724,1499.256,--Could I ask you one other hypothetical?
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1507.193,1509.734,"Your Honor, that's not this case--"
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1509.734,1510.215,I know it isn't--
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1510.215,1511.887,--I don't know the specifics of it--
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.887,1513.377,--but our salaries are fixed by statute and I can... if not--
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1513.377,1515.019,--and I think the specifics of it might make a difference.
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.172,1518.353,--Why would it make a difference?
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1518.353,1526.481,--were merely involved in the technical process of providing testimony at a State legislative hearing--
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.481,1527.54,"No, they do everything you object to."
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1527.54,1528.191,--that might be one thing.
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.549,1542.402,"Yes, that's exactly what I'm... that's my--"
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1542.402,1546.403,"--buying advertising, that is core First Amendment activity and it can't be charged--"
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.403,1546.704,--And you--
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1546.704,1547.365,--to the dissenter.
1990.89-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.365,1549.545,--Even in... even in my hypothetical?
1990.89-1217,0,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,1549.545,1550.727,"Even in your hypothetical, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.479,1557.002,"Very well, Mr. LaJeunesse."
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1558.504,1561.557,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.538,1656.981,They don't say as of no benefit.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1660.634,1663.005,"--They're wrong... they're wrong in that as well, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1707.53,1708.368,Is that in the contract?
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1708.368,1709.72,--Which contract?
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.72,1711.49,Is that in the contract of association between--
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1711.49,1715.444,"It's in the essence of affiliation, Your Honor, in three respects."
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.256,1762.079,--You don't assert it's a legal obligation.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1763.581,1765.522,That's... it's even questionable on legal.
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.346,1849.097,You certainly make the union movement sound like a very business-like operation.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1864.29,1864.761,Your Honor--
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.761,1866.784,This is strictly a business operation?
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1866.784,1868.384,--It hurts me... it hurts me to say that--
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.574,1868.764,Yes.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1868.764,1871.275,--that is not the sole basis for affiliation.
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.632,1877.24,Of course it is.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1877.24,1880.312,--But unionism is a competitive area.
1990.89-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1911.236,1912.615,"Mr. Chanin, can I interrupt for a second?"
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1924.603,1926.266,"--Well, the 97--"
1990.89-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1926.266,1926.586,Isn't that right?
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1926.586,1927.277,--Yes.
1990.89-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.277,1931.01,And we're fighting about a little squib at the tiny end of the thing.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1931.01,1936.223,"Let me just clarify the factual finding of the court and then respond directly to your question, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.034,1952.655,You didn't meet your burden of proof.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1952.655,1953.146,We didn't meet the burden.
1990.89-1217,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2068.996,2090.072,"Mr. Chanin, in the Ellis case this Court held, with most Justices joining the opinion as I recall, that objectors could not be charged for the costs of general litigation unless the local bargaining unit was directly involved."
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2098.987,2101.208,"No, Your Honor, not at all."
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2130.427,2137.043,"Well, it was construed to RLA ever since Hanson very much in the light of the constitutional provisions, have we not?"
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2137.043,2137.614,"--Yes, you have, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2203.121,2212.338,But I'm really in doubt whether that rationale can be squared with Ellis on the so-called statutory ground.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2216.331,2218.373,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think so."
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2641.034,2650.181,"So, it... what is your answer to the, to the hypothetical questions that Mr. LaJeunesse asked?"
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2665.044,2665.574,No.
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2665.574,2667.297,--that they will be negotiating with.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2675.071,2677.963,"It's germane, but the answer is still no."
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.059,2704.072,"All right, now what do you mean by electoral politics?"
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2704.072,2704.342,I mean--
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2704.342,2707.755,My next question was going to be what about a nonpublic union.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2724.257,2726.737,--Are you talking in the public sector or the private sector?
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2726.737,2729.7,"As I said, it's a private sector union, not a public sector union."
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2729.7,2733.493,I think the question in the private sector is a more difficult one.
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.186,2739.548,It's not electoral politics.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2739.935,2742.078,"Well, but the test is--"
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2742.078,2742.508,--supporting a particular statute.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2771.001,2771.522,--There are reasons.
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.522,2773.134,"Okay, well, what are they?"
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2773.134,2777.596,"The reason it's been treated differently is because when I vote for a candidate, I don't vote on a single issue."
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2788.074,2795.139,"Why is that different, Mr. Chanin, from say a proposition on a ballot or a millage, a millage vote?"
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2801.013,2804.436,"Your Honor, it is not a manner of less or more free expression."
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2807.488,2809.101,The test is it's germane.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2813.041,2826.211,"The... in this case, Your Honor, we have not taken the position that we can simply go out and become involved in any type of activity that may somehow improve the economic posture of the employer."
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2834.685,2836.627,"Yeah, well, let's get to some of the precise questions we have here."
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2836.627,2836.777,Okay.
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2836.777,2839.428,How about the lobbying on the millage elections?
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2839.428,2841.431,"Yes, Your Honor, let me tell you why."
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2907.835,2915.469,"Well, yeah, but it's apparently stipulated that millage has no direct effect on what happens to the budget of the Ferris College."
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2915.469,2925.026,"Well, that's true, Your Honor, but we do not attempt... if I... you have to interplay here our parent organization availability theory with what the local does."
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2940.319,2942.62,"Well, they're germane to the parent union."
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2942.62,2942.911,--That's right.
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2943.971,2948.164,"Well, does the parent union do collective bargaining or does it just support local unions which do collective--"
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2948.164,2950.565,It supports the local unions that do it.
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2950.565,2954.929,--So the Michigan Education Association doesn't itself do any collective bargaining?
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2954.929,2955.41,"No, it does not."
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2956.101,2972.23,"Well, I didn't realize that you're arguing that just as you sort of buy insurance for the expert negotiating skills needed and litigation skills, so also you buy assurance... insurance for millage elections--"
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2972.23,2972.61,--No.
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.61,2977.502,"--that since the... this millage doesn't relate to me, but it does relate to another union."
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2979.875,2980.315,No.
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2980.315,2981.357,That is not the argument?
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2981.357,2981.567,No.
1990.89-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.869,2983.308,All right.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2983.308,2983.818,--if I may.
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3142.146,3143.008,Mr.... you're--
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3143.008,3145.008,"Let me just take the millage if I may because you mentioned that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3192.069,3195.371,--The millage... the millage doesn't produce any funding for Ferris.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3195.371,3198.574,--It produces funding for public education generally.
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3198.574,3199.913,That's what you're arguing?
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3199.913,3200.875,"Yes, I am."
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3214.114,3214.564,Because some--
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3218.078,3228.166,"--Your Honor, just because the fact of the matter is, because I paid health insurance last year and did not have a major illness, I do not consider that premium to be wasted."
1990.89-1217,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3228.166,3229.087,So the further away--
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3229.087,3230.008,"Unfortunately, my time will come."
1990.89-1217,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3230.008,3237.684,"--Counsel, the further away the bargaining units gets from the employee, the less the First Amendment protection the employee has."
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3237.684,3237.884,"No, no."
1990.89-1217,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3237.884,3239.636,It seems to me it should be the other way around.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3239.636,3252.093,"No, the First Amendment justifies our charging the parent organization expenditures because those... that expenditure, that affiliation fee is germane in the most direct sense."
1990.89-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3253.195,3254.814,"Yes, but Mr. Chanin--"
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3254.814,3257.136,--to provide something to help me when I need it in collective bargaining.
1990.89-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.136,3270.126,"--What you're really arguing is who has the burden of proof, because you're saying that everything is presumptively support function except those things you can identify as unrelated, and the stuff in the gray area just generally is supporting affiliation."
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3270.126,3270.496,Well--
1990.89-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3270.496,3272.867,In the district court that was the... the burden was just the opposite.
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3272.867,3274.647,"--No, the burden of proof is ours."
1990.89-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.647,3284.004,"Yeah, but you say you carry it when you've shown... when you've excluded A, B, and C, which are admittedly impermissible, everything else is presumptively necessary to show that the organization is available."
1990.89-1217,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,3284.004,3288.718,"No, we lost it in the district court, because we had an activity of the parent organization."
1990.89-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3302.788,3304.549,"Thank you, Mr. Chanin."
1990.89-1217,2,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3306.459,3307.571,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3347.335,3349.759,"Well, certainly he suggested that it was by custom if not by law."
1990.89-1217,2,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3356.444,3359.847,"That doesn't make it analogous to insurance or a service contract, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.975,3377.01,So you object to charging any part of the affiliation fee to the nonmembers?
1990.89-1217,2,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3377.01,3377.919,"No, Your Honor, we do not."
1990.89-1217,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.925,3386.266,"Well, you mean so it's--"
1990.89-1217,2,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3386.266,3388.476,--that a portion of the administrative--
1990.89-1217,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3388.476,3389.318,--so it's piece by piece.
1990.89-1217,2,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3392.3,3393.001,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1217,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3400.638,3420.593,"Do you, do you think the First Amendment draws that distinction between whether you have a contractual right to get that... you can pay out the money and charge the nonunion members if you have contractual right to get the assistance for it, but by reason of the First Amendment you can't pay it out if it's only very likely that de facto you're going to get the assistance."
1990.89-1217,2,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3421.642,3437.893,"I'm saying, Your Honor, that the First Amendment requires a proven, compelling governmental interest to infringe on the nonmember's right not to associate with this union and in any way support any of its activities."
1990.89-1217,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3467.733,3473.309,But in this case isn't the actual thing we're fighting about is how much of this publication that they put out is useful to the local?
1990.89-1217,2,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3475.219,3477.823,That was the largest... one of the larger expenses.
1990.89-1217,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3480.034,3494.874,"Was that... were the... all the expenses in... for lobbying that were charged to the nonmembers was all that lobbying done by the... by the parent or by the affiliated union, Michigan or national?"
1990.89-1217,2,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3494.874,3499.896,There was one payment by the local to send members--
1990.89-1217,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.896,3500.367,But most of it--
1990.89-1217,2,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3500.367,3502.168,--to a conference held by the State.
1990.89-1217,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3502.168,3503.66,--But most of it was by the parent?
1990.89-1217,2,39740,raymond_j_lajeunesse_jr,,3503.66,3507.582,"Most... all... except for that one payment, it was all at the State or national level."
1990.89-1217,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3528.374,3529.726,"Thank you, Mr. LaJeunesse."
