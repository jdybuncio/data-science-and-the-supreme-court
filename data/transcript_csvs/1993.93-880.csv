1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.873,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-880, Judy Madsen v. Womens Health Care Center."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,9.871,12.918,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,81.702,84.623,"Why do you say it's viewpoint-based, Mr. Staver?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,84.623,92.04,"Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, the reason why it's viewpoint-based is, Judy Madsen is restrained once she enters the 300-foot buffer zone."
1993.93-880,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,133.554,143.191,"Well, what about the application of the 36-foot limit that just says you have to stay out of that?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,147.425,148.628,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, we do."
1993.93-880,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.628,149.159,Why?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,149.159,156.531,"The reason is, is that Judy Madsen cannot ever enter that zone, whereas other individuals expressing a contrary view can."
1993.93-880,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.531,177.882,"Well, but on your theory, every injunction, whether it's in the labor context or any other context, would be viewpoint-based, and I don't think we've ever thought that injunctions of that type became content-based just because they were focused on a named individual, or a group of individuals."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,177.882,180.412,"Justice O'Connor, it wouldn't be viewpoint-based on every injunction."
1993.93-880,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.424,201.638,"No, but similarly, on the 36-foot zone, I don't see what makes that content-based, or a restriction that says you can't make noise within that zone, or something of that sort."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,201.638,212.103,"--Your Honor, on... Justice O'Connor, on page 24 of the respondent's brief, they specifically address the types of images that would be impermissible under this injunction."
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.019,231.563,"I think you're really spreading this content-based and viewpoint thing all over the First Amendment area, rather than confining it."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,238.78,253.117,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we raise the vagueness challenge as well as a viewpoint-base challenge, and I believe in this particular case, looking at Justice... or Judge McGregor, who drafted this injunction, he clearly stated that it applies to a belief, not specifically activities or individuals."
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.286,268.766,Is any part of your challenge here based on the fact that the injunction enjoined only those who wanted to protest against abortion and not those for it?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,268.766,271.625,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, that's not the basis of the challenge."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.492,296.271,"That's the 300-foot zone, Mr. Staver, but what about the 36-foot zone, which is what Justice O'Connor was asking about."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,296.271,298.723,"Justice Scalia, the 36-foot zone would be the same way."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.833,303.082,"Well, she's not allowed within that zone at all."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,303.082,304.877,--She can't ever go within that zone.
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.877,310.89,"Okay, so that's... you can't say that that's content-based because she can only go in if the people agree with her."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,312.125,313.764,"No, she can't go in at all."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.764,315.123,So why is it content-based?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,315.123,320.105,Because of... the only reason she can't go in has nothing to do with her activities but solely because of her belief.
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.917,335.13,"In that extent, every injunction that... if you enjoin a labor union where there's been violence on the picket line you're only directing the injunction against somebody that has a particular point of view."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,339.489,341.144,"--I believe it is, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.144,342.425,"Okay, but why did you say no before?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,342.425,345.065,"No, well, in the sections (1) and (2)--"
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.065,348.344,"It seems to me you say yes, and that's why we have to be especially careful with injunctions."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,348.344,350.906,--Sections (3) through (9) would be the content-based.
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,357.201,364.667,May I ask you a question that seems to be the premise... one of the premises of your argument here about the 300-foot zone?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,415.21,424.128,"That's true in part, Justice Souter, but outside of the 36-foot zone, for example, Judy Madsen could not raise her voice to reach somebody within the zone because that could be heard."
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,427.44,430.377,But that is... and I see what you're getting at there.
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,451.071,452.336,"No, that's not true, Justice Souter."
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.333,461.427,Where are you reading?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,461.692,471.75,"--I'm reading right now on the Joint Appendix, page 63, which is also reproduced in the petition for writ of cert, but it's on the last page of the injunction, just before the signature blocks."
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,476.999,481.386,"Is... just so I don't flip back and forth, is the same thing in the petition appendix?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,481.386,481.871,Yes.
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,485.745,486.603,Okay.
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,486.603,497.209,"In that section, Justice Souter, it speaks about invited contact, and that invited contact portion applies outside of the 36-foot zone."
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,516.559,518.635,"Well, can you quote the text that you're relying on?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,518.635,518.87,--Yes.
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,518.87,521.589,What's the numbered paragraph in the injunction?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,521.589,526.884,"On the petition for writ of cert, Justice Souter, it is on page B-11."
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,526.884,527.602,B-11?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,527.602,533.273,"At the bottom, and it begins with, ordered and adjudged."
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,567.493,576.333,"Which implies that the respondent is saying something, and clearly implies that the respondent can be holding literature to distribute if somebody will take it, and that was the only point that I was trying to make."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,576.333,594.373,"--Justice Souter, the next sentence goes down and basically says such invited contact by a person protected hereby as it relates to conduct... contact at such person's residence is limited to conduct transmitted by the resident to a respondent at a distance from and at a time prior to the contact, so that--"
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,594.373,594.654,That's--
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,596.215,596.512,--That's--
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,596.512,613.505,"--at the residence zone than you do at the 300-foot zone around the clinic, but there's nothing in there that indicates to me... in fact, the indication is to the contrary... that you cannot speak so long as you're not heard inside, or that you can't hold a placard or a leaflet."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,613.505,617.582,"--Justice Souter, I believe that when Judy Madsen enters this 36-foot zone, she--"
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,617.582,618.598,"No, I'm talking about--"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,618.598,619.207,"--I'm sorry, the--"
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,619.207,619.629,--the 300-foot zone.
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,619.629,620.692,--I'm sorry... the 300-foot zone.
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,624.894,626.3,That's entirely correct.
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,643.386,644.48,That's exactly right.
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,645.87,646.932,"Well, they can't physically approach."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,646.932,652.086,--They can't... but they couldn't physically approach if they're simply there with literature within the 300-foot zone.
1993.93-880,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.086,657.037,"Mr. Staver, you've several times said, I believe, in connection with your responses."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,694.74,703.377,"Justice Ginsbug, let me answer both questions, and looking at the second one first, there is no conceded violation of the first injunction."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,743.361,748.578,"Judy Madsen wasn't around, was she, at the time the amended injunction was entered?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,748.578,750.592,"Yes, she was, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.966,764.071,I thought you said that she had come there... she had not been a party who had violated any prior injunction.
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,764.071,766.008,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.008,768.772,Had she been demonstrating after the first injunction was entered?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,768.772,770.491,"Not at the Aware Clinic, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.334,780.19,"Well then, how could she move for modification of the amended injunction if it was entered before she was even around the place?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,780.19,792.108,"--I don't believe that she really could, and I believe that it would have bee futile to do that, because Judge McGregor, a few days after this injunction was entered, made all of the statements that are before this court about how he interpreted this injunction."
1993.93-880,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,802.776,810.443,"Is your position, then, that this injunction may be valid as to some people, but it isn't as to the particular complainants in this case?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,810.443,813.864,"Justice Ginsburg, it's certainly not valid as it relates to the three petitioners."
1993.93-880,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,814.474,820.049,"That's the limit of your argument, just these three petitioners, and for the rest, the injunction would stand?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,831.107,839.308,"--No, Justice Ginsburg, it is not, because that would not give full relief to Judy Madsen, because she would be like Myrna Cheffer before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals."
1993.93-880,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,864.062,864.828,Let me--
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,864.828,865.031,--a prior restraint.
1993.93-880,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,865.031,880.697,"--just to be sure I understand your position, are you arguing that as a matter of fact the evidence doesn't show that she was in concert with those, or are you arguing as a matter of law that if she didn't have anything to do with the protests until after the injunction was entered, she could not ever be held in concert?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,880.697,883.945,"I believe, Justice Stevens, as a matter of fact and law."
1993.93-880,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.193,889.38,And is there a finding of fact to the contrary?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,889.38,891.364,--That she was in concert?
1993.93-880,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.364,891.614,Yes.
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,891.614,901.953,"There is a finding of fact in the 1992 generically lumping all of the people together, but in the 1993 injunction, Justice Stevens, there's no finding--"
1993.93-880,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.953,904.421,"Well, let me just take it one step at a time, because it's hard to... this is a complicated case."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,910.996,912.903,--Not in the 1993 injunction.
1993.93-880,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.605,914.668,So that's not before us.
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,923.007,923.211,--No.
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.955,942.921,"Well, Judy Madsen has never been found guilty of anything, has she?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,942.921,946.545,"She has in the 1993, but not guilty as terms of criminal, no."
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,946.545,950.075,She was cited for contempt?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,950.075,954.9,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, she was never cited for contempt, never arrested."
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,954.9,960.211,"Well then, what sanctions have been imposed on her by the trial court?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,960.211,963.96,The 1993 injunction is the sanction of not being able to speak.
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,963.96,966.911,"Well, but has she been held to have violated that?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,966.911,967.88,"No, she has not."
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,967.88,972.752,"So we're not talking, then, about any sanction that was imposed on her."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,977.267,978.875,"Exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.875,990.558,"Well, in Broadrick v. Oklahoma, I think we used some language about an in-concert statement there, saying that we would cross that bridge when we came to it, in effect."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,990.558,997.946,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think this Court has come to it, because we don't have to speculate as to how far the in-concert section goes."
1993.93-880,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1021.702,1057.609,"Mr. Staver, you said I believe in your brief that you were attacking this injunction on its face, and that's why the record didn't need to have in it any more than it already had, so when you speak of the internal operations of this, that seems to be inconsistent with your insistence that you didn't need to put very much in the record because you were attacking the injunction on its face, which seems to say that these restrictions never could be constitutional, no matter what the facts were."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1057.609,1073.446,"Justice Ginsburg, we've argued to the Florida supreme court and also to this court that it's as applied to Judy Madsen factually and on its face as well, and in fact the same evidence that's before this Court was before the court of Florida, and the same arguments were made, and we asked them to de novo review this case."
1993.93-880,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1105.698,1114.273,"Well, Mr. Staver, is everything you've said about petitioner Madsen equally true as to the other named petitioners?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1125.348,1126.425,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1993.93-880,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1128.175,1135.015,"Your comments have all been directed to petitioner Madsen, but I want to be clear about the other named petitioners as well."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1135.015,1135.343,--Yes.
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1189.445,1192.117,What was the proceeding at which this testimony was taken?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1192.117,1197.959,"--This was at a proceeding, Mr. Chief Justice, for a motion to contempt, and a motion to modify."
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.959,1200.287,At a motion to hold Martin in contempt?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1200.287,1205.315,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, a motion to hold all the defendants named in the 1992 injunction in contempt."
1993.93-880,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1205.315,1206.377,And Martin was one of them?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1206.377,1206.844,That's correct.
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.844,1210.406,"Mr. Staver, I must say, you have me thoroughly confused."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1226.901,1229.713,"What I mean by that, Justice Scalia, is that she is presently restrained."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1233.602,1234.852,"Well, you say she's restrained."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1246.098,1260.435,"As far as the in-concert provision, we don't know that for a fact, but we don't have to speculate about the broad breadth of this in concert, because we know that 2 days after this injunction all these others were arrested for simply penetrating the zone, who were not in concert."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.435,1263.512,"Well, that seems to me not an as-applied-to-Judy-Madsen point."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1266.573,1267.306,That's exactly right.
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.43,1272.602,"Your contention is you can't use the terms, in-concert?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1279.083,1280.755,"Justice Scalia, let me explain."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.978,1309.93,"You're saying that ""in concert"" cannot be used in an injunction?"
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1309.93,1314.444,"No, it certainly can, if it's used properly according to this Court's decision in Chase."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1335.529,1335.998,How do we know that?
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1335.998,1341.059,"We know it from the April 12 transcript, where the judge brought individuals who simply penetrated the zone."
1993.93-880,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1344.682,1347.352,We don't have those people in front of us.
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1359.238,1363.924,"--Justice O'Connor, even aside from the in-concert, that's not the basis of the argument."
1993.93-880,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1370.889,1372.921,But there are parts of this injunction that you say are okay.
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1389.773,1392.803,"--We would not challenge page 57, sections (1) and (2)."
1993.93-880,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1396.427,1398.754,Can you tell me where in the petitioner... the appendix--
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1398.754,1403.721,"That's Joint Appendix, Volume 1, page 57, in the Joint Appendix."
1993.93-880,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1409.717,1414.278,--So that's what you're saying... you are challenging this new injunction wholesale.
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1417.668,1421.775,"Well, no, we would also not challenge the jamming phone that is part of this injunction."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.431,1471.349,"I... it seems to me that section (4) is limited to that, as far as sound goes... other sounds within earshot of the patients inside the clinic."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1479.613,1486.203,"We wouldn't contend that that's unreasonable, but this particular section speaks about the time limitations that these restrictions apply."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.662,1511.474,So that's a vagueness challenge to (4).
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1511.474,1513.145,"That's a vagueness challenge, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-880,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.145,1520.627,"But you don't contest that they can prevent people from making so much noise that it annoys patients at the clinic, inside the clinic."
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1520.627,1521.111,No.
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1535.636,1537.166,So you don't have an objection--
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1537.166,1537.384,--broad restriction.
1993.93-880,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1537.384,1539.477,--So you don't have an objection to the injunction against using a bullhorn.
1993.93-880,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1539.477,1540.93,"No, we would not, Justice Souter."

1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1578.589,1581.711,"Your Honor, I think the testimony showed--"
1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.711,1583.727,Did they specifically stop cars from going in?
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1583.727,1590.052,"--Yes, sir, Your Honor, they did, by conducting a closely ordered and slow-moving parade--"
1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1590.052,1592.473,They did not part when cars came up?
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1592.473,1595.05,--They... they did not immediately part.
1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1598.548,1599.517,I watched the videotape.
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1601.61,1602.515,"--They did, Your Honor."
1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.03,1642.859,Is that unlawful?
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1642.859,1645.576,"Your Honor, it is in context--"
1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1645.576,1646.139,--into the car?
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1646.139,1648.841,--It is in context of a health care facility.
1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.914,1665.85,The testimony is that... well.
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1665.85,1666.178,"Yes, sir."
1993.93-880,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1687.889,1713.142,"Mr. D'Alemberte, there was a case that didn't come to this Court but that was once very much in the news, and it was the Skokie case, where the argument was made that the people that would be subjected to this demonstration, because of their peculiar condition, would be certainly psychologically upset and even physically sick."
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1721.811,1722.296,"No, Your Honor."

1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1749.206,1751.144,"--One... the doctor... Dr. Snydle, yes, sir."
1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.144,1751.439,Right.
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1751.439,1751.892,--and--
1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.892,1755.986,"Right, and what opposing testimony would you have expected to be introduced?"
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1755.986,1763.842,"--Well, Your Honor, what I would expect is that Dr. Snydle might be cross-examined in a way to make that testimony unbelievable."
1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.478,1785.411,"So no... any speech can be prohibited if it affects people's vital signs, encourages them to be upset and may place their health at risk, is that... is that--"
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1785.411,1793.549,"Well, Your Honor, in context of people who are coming to a health care facility... and we need to think of this as a hospital."

1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.334,1825.178,What does stalking mean?
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1827.068,1829.614,"--Following closely, I think, Your Honor."

1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.298,1842.891,You've heard other people--
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1851.154,1852.497,"--Exactly, Your Honor, but not the kind of debate--"
1993.93-880,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.497,1854.731,You can't be stalked by people who want to say nasty things to you.
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1854.731,1856.746,"--Precisely, but not the kind of debate we have in a hospital zone."
1993.93-880,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.632,1866.568,How about a building of doctor's offices?

1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1928.827,1929.497,"--No, sir--"
1993.93-880,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.497,1932.356,--that it was necessary to have this injunction?
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1932.356,1933.309,"--No, sir."

1993.93-880,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1964.249,1967.263,--I did not see this in the videotape.
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,1979.679,2008.778,"Well, Your Honor, the videotape was not taken on the day in which the greatest number of people were there, but if you will look at that videotape, and while you look at it think not just about the... what we see there, but think about what's being seen from inside that car as the patient is coming to the clinic, perhaps apprehensive, as of all of us would be, in going through any kind of medical procedure, and think about what happens when somebody approaches your car, somebody does indeed swarm around the car."

1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,2091.65,2093.228,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor, indeed."
1993.93-880,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.353,2107.021,"All right, and if we have that, address, if you would, for a few minutes in your argument what standard we employ to test the validity of an injunction like this."
1993.93-880,1,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,2107.021,2107.333,--Yes.

1993.93-880,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2833.528,2843.603,Do you think there are any special dangers that attend the use of injunctions to prohibit this conduct that do not attend the enactment of a criminal statute?

1993.93-880,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2880.509,2885.633,"That is true, but I think it's also the case that an injunction has more flexibility."
1993.93-880,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2891.645,2893.036,But isn't that just the point?
1993.93-880,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2893.036,2893.317,--with respect to the particular problem.
1993.93-880,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2893.317,2904.391,"It has flexibility because it can be applied to some parties and not to others, and isn't that... I use the word ""danger""... a significant concern where free speech is at issue?"
1993.93-880,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2904.391,2922.945,"It's certainly a matter of concern, but I think that unless the Court is going to prohibit courts from issuing injunctions under circumstances like these, there has to be some ability of the courts to address problems like those presented in this particular case."
1993.93-880,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2922.945,2942.938,"Yes, there has to be an ability, but doesn't that ability have to be accompanied by a special solicitude for free speech rights because certain persons are being singled out, which is not the case of a statute, and I don't see anything in your argument where you've acknowledged that."
1993.93-880,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2942.938,2963.319,"Well, first of all, Justice Kennedy, I think it is possible for even statutes to deal with particular problems that may fall more heavily on one group than another, but once again, what the court would do is try to determine whether the legislative body that enacted the statute or ordinance was responding to an actual evil."
1993.93-880,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2990.136,2992.76,"Mr. Days, we're not dealing with an abstract question now."
1993.93-880,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3014.346,3016.298,I'm not suggesting a lighter brand.
1993.93-880,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3047.957,3048.707,Excuse me.
1993.93-880,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3048.707,3049.129,--Yes.
1993.93-880,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3049.129,3053.69,The... what should I say?
1993.93-880,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3085.333,3088.144,"Well, certainly the restriction--"
1993.93-880,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.144,3090.377,Or do you think the speech itself is unlawful?
1993.93-880,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3090.377,3093.11,"--No, the speech of course is not unlawful."
1993.93-880,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3118.132,3118.912,What do you mean by intimidated or harassed?
1993.93-880,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3120.975,3122.254,"No, I'm not talking about that."
1993.93-880,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3122.254,3123.41,Calling them names?
1993.93-880,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3123.41,3124.426,I'm not talking about that.
1993.93-880,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3154.179,3157.366,"Well, just as calling names is designed to hurt."
1993.93-880,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3167.316,3168.767,It does not make it unlawful.
1993.93-880,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3250.282,3254.608,"An injunction, de facto, is content-based."
1993.93-880,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3361.44,3368.531,"Are you arguing that if she had been the president of Operation Rescue and said, I believe in everything they're doing and I want to help them as much as I can, there'd be a different result?"
1993.93-880,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3368.531,3372.499,"--If she were, Justice Stevens, condoning and orchestrating this?"
1993.93-880,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3372.499,3372.794,Yes.
1993.93-880,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3372.794,3374.982,She was not a target of the contempt in any respect.
1993.93-880,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3374.982,3381.822,"But I'm asking you, if she were, if she said, I agree with everything they do, I want to help them as much as I can, would she then lose her... the rights you're describing?"
1993.93-880,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3381.822,3382.806,"No, Justice Stevens."
1993.93-880,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3382.806,3388.476,Then I don't really understand what difference it makes if you've got Judy Madsen rather than the president of the organization.
1993.93-880,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3388.476,3397.035,"I believe on page 920 of this Court's decision in Claiborne Hardware, it says that to restrain those illegal activities for individuals, not simply because they're members of a group."
1993.93-880,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3400.822,3403.255,"Thank you, Mr. Staver, the case is submitted."
