1975.74-5822,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.489,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 74-5822, Hampton against the United States."
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,15.208,16.573,Thank you.
1975.74-5822,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,278.196,282.288,"Mr. Lang, you are basing your entire case on due process, I take it?"
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,282.288,283.489,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-5822,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,283.489,286.545,Not on any entrapment defense as such?
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,286.545,287.96,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-5822,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,329.022,336.293,I understand that no specific entrapment instruction was requested of Judge Meredith?
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,336.293,338.667,This was Judge Nangle.
1975.74-5822,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,378.953,384.328,Do you think the record would have supported the instruction on predisposition?
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,384.328,389.475,"On the question of knowledge, yes the record could have supported that Your Honor."
1975.74-5822,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,411.235,429.672,"Mr. Lang, the theory, which you are advancing to us, would it make any difference whether for the purposes of your case, whether the government had provided the money to buy or the contraband to sell?"
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,429.672,438.037,"Your Honor, we are limiting the standard that we are asking this Court to adapt specifically to cases in which the government supplies contraband."
1975.74-5822,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,438.037,440.875,Is there any difference in principle?
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,440.875,441.545,Yes.
1975.74-5822,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,441.545,458.952,"Would that not be the next step providing the marked money to buy, which does much of obtent (ph) in the transaction in the government’s role as providing the contraband to sell?"
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,458.952,467.036,"No, Your Honor and I will answer that by approaching it this way, I like to approach it by stating it this way."
1975.74-5822,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,504.547,519.513,"When they supply the money, is there not just as realistic notion that he is familiar with the ways of the drug traffic and that he is going to use the money?"
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,519.513,519.634,Well.
1975.74-5822,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,519.634,524.255,The way that he agreed to use it that is to buy some narcotics?
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,524.255,525.077,"Well, no Your Honor."
1975.74-5822,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,588.329,591.428,How about his testimony which held predisposition?
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,591.428,596.887,"Well, I am saying Your Honor, certainly at some point when a crime is committed, there is always predisposition."
1975.74-5822,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,688.195,694.957,"Well, the Russell case was can not be your hypothetical case of the time bomb in the furnishing by the government of the clock?"
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,694.957,696.927,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-5822,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,736.077,736.885,Mr. Lang?
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,736.885,737.939,"Yes, Your honor?"
1975.74-5822,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,737.939,759.797,"Assume a case in which the evidence is undisputed that the defendant had been engaged in selling heroin, say, for months or years, but the particular batch of heroin that he was being prosecuted for having sold, had been supplied by government agent."
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,761.819,774.881,"My position in that case would not be different Your Honor, because the defendant is on charge for the sale -- we are not charging the man or holding him responsible for his past conduct."
1975.74-5822,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,796.669,808.516,"Are you advocating a per se rule regardless of all other facts and circumstances if, and only if, the contraband that is involved in the particular prosecution was supplied by the government?"
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,808.516,811.378,That is right Your Honor; that is a very narrow standard.
1975.74-5822,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,884.734,889.059,"Your hypothetical, however, is quite a long way off in the case that we have here."
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,894.527,896.778,"Well, Your Honor I am saying that that is."
1975.74-5822,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,921.18,926.285,"Well, in your hypothetic, although the defendant would surely have a defense of the rest available to him."
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,926.285,932.127,He would have the rest but he should also have the defense of government conduct.
1975.74-5822,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,970.042,984.655,"I am assuming that the government gives a known pusher, contraband heroin, and a known pusher showed it to your man, would you still have the same effect?"
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,984.655,985.132,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-5822,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,988.496,996.35,"Well, suppose the government just leaves a package of heroin on the doorstep and the pusher picks it up."
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,1003.618,1007.102,"Yes, Your Honor, they will be."
1975.74-5822,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1017.129,1025.29,"The government was the manufacturing crime, because I said this was a known pusher?"
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,1025.29,1033.06,"Well, I understand it was a known pusher but then why -- the question comes up is why is it necessary for the government to supply him with the heroin if he is a known pusher."
1975.74-5822,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.354,1064.38,"Well, I suppose one reason why the government might not want to wait is that if they do not know its source and cannot apprehend him in other ways, that might be a year or two afterward that they were able to convict him?"
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,1064.38,1068.471,"Well, that is the possibility Your Honor, I will not argue that."
1975.74-5822,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1127.449,1138.848,"Under no conceivable tort theory that I have ever heard of, would your men in this case, be freed on the ground of superseding cause?"
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,1138.848,1152.273,"Well, I am saying that I am only making the analogy insofar abd saying that what we are talking about is the fact that we have several causes which contribute to the consummated act."
1975.74-5822,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1200.914,1210.164,"Is your proposed instruction framed under the Bueno, actual instruction under the Bueno in the Fifth Circuit?"
1975.74-5822,0,21134,david_a_lang,,1210.164,1213.194,"Yes, it was I believe Your Honor."
1975.74-5822,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1326.885,1333.389,Very well.
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1335.929,1338.998,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1489.019,1495.246,"But none of these things are really important or material to the basic question in this case, is it Mr. Jones?"
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1503.922,1512.575,That is correct and I would like to read that instruction just for the benefit of the Court so we will know exactly what we are talking about here.
1975.74-5822,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.326,1592.451,Indeed there was no dispute about the fact.
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1592.451,1593.005,Pardon?
1975.74-5822,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1593.005,1596.209,There was no dispute that the informant did furnish it?
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1596.209,1597.561,"Oh no, that was disputed."
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1605.969,1607.79,It was a fact in dispute in this --
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1607.79,1610.223,I was only responding to Mr. Justice Marshall’s question.
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1610.223,1617.191,"But you originally spend a good deal a few minutes talking about the dispute and in fact, that has nothing to be with the basic issue in this case."
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1617.191,1617.996,That is correct.
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1747.05,1749.604,"That has been the rule of the Circuit, has it not?"
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1749.604,1752.071,That has been the rule in the Fifth Circuit.
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1752.071,1759.194,I am just reading Judge Ronnie’s (ph) opinion for unanimous Court in Bueno case in 1971.
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1759.194,1760.787,That was the rule in the Fifth Circuit.
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1762.3,1762.637,And --
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1762.637,1765.241,It also may now be the rule in the Third Circuit.
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1765.241,1767.017,And in some of the State Courts?
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1767.017,1770.726,It is clearly not the rule in the Seventh Circuit or the Eighth Circuit.
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1770.726,1773.847,"Now it is totally not in the Eighth, as this case."
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1773.847,1785.041,It is not in the Seventh either where the McGrath decision applied Russell and the context in a similar context to preclude an absolute defense.
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2176.549,2180.014,"Well that is a distinction the criminal law makes to, is it not?"
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2180.014,2181.983,That is the distinction that criminal law makes --
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2181.983,2183.541,As per the criminal law it would have not been a criminal offense?
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2183.541,2192.533,"Our submission here however, Mr. Justice Stewart is that it is a distinction which in this context has no constitutional force."
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2192.533,2196.575,The whole point is that what is criminal is selling the contraband.
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2200.106,2211.053,"Well, once again, the distinction between contraband and an alarm clock or the distinction from contraband and phenol 2-propenone is that one is illegal and the other legal."
1975.74-5822,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2493.268,2503.733,"Mr. Jones, you would have no opposition to instruction that you said contain considerably whole matter etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2503.733,2504.013,Well --
1975.74-5822,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.013,2505.494,Which you mentioned some time ago.
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2505.494,2506.678,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.74-5822,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2523.478,2527.709,But if it was broad enough you would not have any objection?
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2527.709,2533.23,"Well, we might then get in broiled in a discussion of the proper consequences of entrapment defense; that is correct."
1975.74-5822,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2533.23,2545.129,I was thinking about one in New York where they have the Sullivan Law for possession of a weapon and a undercover police officer solely got weapon and then arrested.
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2545.129,2546.012,There might be circumstances --
1975.74-5822,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2546.012,2550.402,I mean those are some kinds of things that would be a little --
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2550.402,2553.762,-- unsavory.
1975.74-5822,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2683.646,2694.312,"Mr. Jones, in the argot of the trade is there an established difference between an undercover agent for the government and an informer?"
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2694.312,2716.414,"I am not an expert in the argot of the trade, but as I have been using the terms here I have been thinking of a government agent as an employee of the government and an informant as a person who may, from time to time, cooperate with the government, sometimes for pay sometimes not."
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2748.343,2752.667,"Well, he could be subject to control if he was being paid by the government."
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2753.896,2753.974,He could have been --
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2753.974,2761.312,Told to confine his duty to supply contraband to people and then turn them in for the sale of that contraband.
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2761.312,2761.813,Of course we do not –-
1975.74-5822,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2761.813,2777.211,We do not have control over his situation and certainly instructions could be framed to exonerate the government from any rule as propose by the petitioner in the event that there was not a deliberate conscious act on the part of the government or its agent.
1975.74-5822,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2782.731,2783.351,That is correct.
1975.74-5822,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2806.025,2807.327,"Mr. Lang, do you have anything?"
1975.74-5822,2,21134,david_a_lang,,2807.327,2809.395,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1975.74-5822,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2830.402,2831.374,And he gets paid on a piece of --
1975.74-5822,2,21134,david_a_lang,,2831.374,2833.626,And he gets paid per deal.
1975.74-5822,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2833.626,2834.135,Per deal?
1975.74-5822,2,21134,david_a_lang,,2834.135,2834.898,Right.
1975.74-5822,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2921.109,2922.01,Alright.
1975.74-5822,2,21134,david_a_lang,,2922.01,2932.961,"Now, another thing that was mentioned here had to do with the question of indispensable means versus contraband."
1975.74-5822,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3041.381,3042.548,Thank you gentlemen.
