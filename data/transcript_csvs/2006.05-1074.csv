2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.404,We'll hear argument next in Ledbetter versus Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,7.737,10.622,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,57.253,64.256,But are you saying that the rule for paycheck decisions is different than the rule for other sorts of decisions?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,64.256,65.441,--It... it is.
2006.05-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,98.714,106.435,"That seems to me to work the other way around, just like the case we've just heard argued in the last hour."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,134.003,134.703,--Yes.
2006.05-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.833,167.408,I don't really see a vast difference between a promotion and being elevated to a higher pay grade.
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,183.269,190.639,"Because, I think the difference is that when somebody is denied a promotion for discriminatory reasons the paychecks themselves are not discriminatory."
2006.05-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,193.975,208.068,"Mr. Russell, I thought that your argument was that yes, you know that you haven't got the promotion, you know you haven't got the transfer, but the spread in the pay is an incremental thing."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,223.145,244.574,"Yes, and that practical distinction I think does support Congress's decision under the Equal Pay Act as well as under Title VII to choose a paycheck accrual rule because it's frequently that even if an employee knows she has been subject to disparate pay, it's frequently very difficult for her to have a good faith belief that that pay is intentionally discriminatory without more information."
2006.05-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.311,302.763,"How does, how does time solve that difficulty?"
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,302.763,310.285,It's only after... one would expect in a merit system that there would be some level of variation in the area and that would work out over time.
2006.05-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,360.468,363.087,What happened to the Equal Pay Act claim?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,371.574,372.376,It did.
2006.05-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,387.535,390.987,Why didn't you ask for the equal pay claim?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,414.27,418.388,We should have objected to the failure to reinstate the Equal Pay Act claim.
2006.05-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.542,431.481,"Because in the Title VII case assuming you're right, that you get across the same threshold, you're faced with the same defense."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,431.964,432.364,Yes.
2006.05-1074,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,453.827,461.164,"Do you have to show that at the time when a particular paycheck in question is issued, there was an intent to discriminate?"
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,461.164,461.964,No.
2006.05-1074,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,468.67,479.409,"What if the situation is that when the particular paycheck is cut, the company, the employer, whoever it is, has no intent whatsoever to discriminate?"
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,485.363,493.702,--It still constitutes a violation because they are executing a present disparity that is because of sex within the meaning of the statute.
2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,493.702,521.304,"So if 15 years earlier a discriminatory decision was made to give a pay raise of 4 percent rather than 5 percent, and that over the 15 years became the basis with other raises, you think you can challenge the discrimination 15 years later and say well, this was discriminatory because 15 years ago I didn't get a raise and that, carried forward, had a ripple effect into the current 180-day period."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,521.304,521.621,Yes.
2006.05-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,526.007,548.122,"Would that be true if there were a change in ownership of the company, so the discrimination originally occurred under owner A, then the company is purchased by owner B, completely unrelated, and the, the disparity is used for bonuses, etcetera?"
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,548.122,555.026,That would depend on the general rules for attributing a liability from a successful--
2006.05-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,555.026,563.215,"Well, under the, under the answer that you gave to the Chief Justice and the rule you propose, what of the case of differing ownership?"
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,563.215,570.202,--I would think that they are still responsible in the same way that they are responsible for other actions that the prior company took.
2006.05-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.202,589.949,"But that, but that would not be the result if the reason for the disparity between 4 percent and 5 percent was not a, a denial of a pay increase to a higher pay level, but rather denial of a promotion to another job."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,589.949,590.349,That's correct.
2006.05-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.349,596.936,"If that were the case, then it washes out and you have to challenge it right away."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,596.936,597.569,That is correct.
2006.05-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,598.305,600.455,Does that make any sense?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,600.455,613.179,"--Well, I think that it does for the reason that I said before, that that kind of consequence is a secondary effect of the prior unlawful employment practice, but under Evans, which that kind of problem goes to--"
2006.05-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.179,619.083,"Well, you could call it a secondary effect but the only reason you want to get promoted to another job is to get more money."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,621.619,644.984,"--Well even if the Court didn't think that this is a completely satisfactory analytical line to draw, as I said before there are good practical reasons for drawing it, and every reason to think that Congress did draw it, because Congress enacted this statute against the background legal principle that pay, that the pay aspects of the employment relationship arise out of recurring transactions and give rise to recurring causes of action."
2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,673.451,679.538,"Well, Congress could have specifically provided for the Equal Pay Act rule under Title VII, but it didn't do that."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,679.538,684.275,"--No, it didn't have the same elements, but there's no reason to think that the difference in the elements--"
2006.05-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,684.275,692.215,"It didn't have the same defenses because the Bennett amendment makes the defenses under the Equal Pay Act applicable under Title VII, right?"
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,692.215,692.681,--That's right.
2006.05-1074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,698.785,715.044,"Suppose you go back to the 15 year old action which led to disparity that continues up to today, and suppose at the beginning or in July of 2006 the woman discovers it and brings her claim and suppose she wins."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,724.602,729.071,There is a provision of Title VII that limits back pay to at most 2 years.
2006.05-1074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.071,744.398,"And in that case would it mean that in this case where it happened 15 years ago and she won, but she didn't bring her act until August of 2006, that she could only then collect the extra money for the preceding 2 years?"
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,744.398,745.432,That's correct.
2006.05-1074,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.432,750.051,So it isn't going to open up tremendous liability for 15 or 20 years ago.
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,750.051,754.705,"That's absolutely right, and in fact there's no reason to think that such claims are particularly common."
2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,771.481,777.904,"I suppose all they'd have to do is allege that sometime over the past... I mean, it doesn't have to be 15 years."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,791.211,800.15,"They can certainly make that allegation, but the employer is left open to avail itself of the equitable defenses and they'll have a very easy time of showing that there's been undue delay."
2006.05-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,800.15,800.85,Where does it say--
2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,800.85,802.269,Why is that if they just discovered it?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,809.39,810.292,In that case--
2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,810.292,812.994,But then they have to go back and litigate what happened 30 years ago.
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,812.994,816.529,--I do acknowledge that a traditional laches defense would be more difficult than those--
2006.05-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,816.529,850.417,"--I thought your answer before was that this is not... if she's going to bring a case I got a 2 percent raise, he got a 3 percent raise, her chances are very slim, but if this builds up year by year to the point where see is saying, I'm being denied equal pay, it's a requirement of the anti-discrimination law that I get equal pay, so today I'm not getting equal pay, I thought... I mean, the chance that she could win when she gets a salary review and she gets a little less than the other person are nil."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,850.417,858.189,"--Yes, and it's only after that same kind of decision has been repeated over a number of years that you actually have a case that you can bring to the EEOC."
2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,860.558,861.358,That's not your theory.
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,865.76,867.211,"That's true, but the practical--"
2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,867.211,878.602,"You've got a memo that says we're going to pay, 20 years ago, we're going to pay males this much and we're going to pay females this much, and she says that obviously affected my pay over the ensuing 15, 20 years."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,878.602,891.744,"--That's true, but the paycheck accrual rule also serves the function of the much more common case in which somebody doesn't derive notice of the potential discrimination until the discrimination has been repeated over time."
2006.05-1074,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,891.744,916.894,But isn't your position that an employer violates Title VII unless the employer periodically reviews the entire pay record of every employee to make sure that there has never been an uncomplained of act of discrimination at any point in the past that would have a continuing present effect on the amount of money that the employee is paid?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,916.894,917.511,No.
2006.05-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,948.247,950.048,How do they know that?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,989.09,1003.85,Because this Court made clear as recently Faragher that when an employer delegates pay-setting authority to a supervisor the discrimination undertaken by that supervisor is imputed to the employer as a matter of agency law principles.
2006.05-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1003.85,1022.828,"Oh, yeah, but that assumed a present discrimination, and it seems to me the problem that we've got is the problem of connecting a past discrimination with what may in fact be an apparently neutral act 15 or 20 years later."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1022.828,1033.702,"Well, I don't think that the proof that the act is discriminatory is any more difficult or any more difficult in concept when it happened several years ago than when it happened 180 days ago."
2006.05-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1048.545,1055.199,Does he have to know that the present decision to continue the pay structure is discriminatory?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1055.199,1055.816,No.
2006.05-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.721,1086.052,"The... as I remember the facts of this case, wasn't it in 1995 that she got a substantial raise and the reason, according to her supervisor, was that he noticed that her pay was below the minimum of the appropriate range for her job?"
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1086.052,1086.67,That's true.
2006.05-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.193,1101.112,I didn't understand one of your answers.
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1125.879,1126.612,There would.
2006.05-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.612,1127.831,I thought you said the other.
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1128.681,1130.564,I apologize if I was unclear about that.
2006.05-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1144.607,1166.622,"Well, the question is whether or not there was a discriminatory act and if the employer, let's say it's an employer that has just purchased a business, thinks that it's a neutral criterion to base wages or bonuses or increase on a prior pay scale and he doesn't know about the prior discrimination, why isn't that a defense?"
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1166.622,1167.272,--It may be a defense.
2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1185.084,1189.786,And it's not enough presumably for somebody to come in and even up everybody?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1210.032,1212.334,"That's true, that they have an incentive to do so."
2006.05-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1227.911,1229.946,"Well, what is your burden to prove?"
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1250.276,1251.326,"No, that's not our position."
2006.05-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.494,1267.904,"So you too then have to go, unless you can find a present policy to discriminate on sex, you too in your proof have to go back whatever it may be, you know, the 15 or 20 years?"
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1267.904,1274.075,"--Yes, and the longer that an employee waits the longer it is for her to sustain her burden of proof on that score."
2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1274.775,1276.343,Why is that true?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1283.413,1295.055,"--But if the employer can show in fact that there is a disadvantage, that there is prejudice, it can ask the court to limit the scope of the claim or eliminate it entirely under an equitable defense such as laches."
2006.05-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1320.27,1324.74,What do you say of the explanation that was given in Bazemore?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1342.252,1343.402,I don't think it's inconsistent.
2006.05-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1356.211,1376.709,"Well, the policy... I thought the assumption was that the policy was in fact a policy which, which was sort of currently honored and intended to be honored by the company, whereas the case that we're concerned about is the case in which there was a discriminatory act, you know, 5, 10, 15 years ago."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1391.719,1395.254,"--No, I don't think that's an accurate description of what was going on in Bazemore."
2006.05-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1398.372,1402.758,"Well, do you take... I'm sorry, I can't think of the name of the case."
2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1406.46,1408.01,Lorance?
2006.05-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1408.01,1409.245,I guess.
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1420.284,1420.47,--No.
2006.05-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1453.191,1465.081,"But that assumes that the company in effect says, we have a pay structure and our pay structure as it is now treats people differently depending on sex, race, or whatever."
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1472.152,1473.352,I don't think that it is.
2006.05-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1509.61,1511.11,--Let me ask this question.
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1536.761,1542.165,The plaintiff would be required to show that that de novo decision was intentionally discriminatory.
2006.05-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.165,1544.617,You couldn't rely on the past history in that situation?
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1544.617,1545.134,That's right.
2006.05-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1545.134,1550.068,Because I think that's sort of what Justice... Judge Jofla thought was going on here.
2006.05-1074,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1550.068,1564.245,I don't think that he... he couldn't have thought that because the facts are absolutely clear and Goodyear acknowledges in this Court that the pay system that they had in place simply made an annual decision whether to make a marginal increase into the raise and took the prior salary as given.
2006.05-1074,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1596.566,1597.768,Thank you counsel.
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1600.62,1603.822,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1074,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.338,1657.624,"Mr. Nager, can I test your theory with a hypothetical question?"
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1680.239,1689.595,"The answer to that, I think, is no, if I understand your hypothetical, if the employer was not intending to classify on the basis of gender."
2006.05-1074,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.595,1704.855,"If present intent was merely to do what we have always done, you have to go back 20 years to find out that what we have always done is the result of a policy decision made 20 years ago that we can hire women at a less expense than men so we will continue to pay the same rate."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1708.14,1719.364,I think the answer is it clearly would be untimely insofar as the allegation is that there is discrimination today merely because there was discrimination yesterday.
2006.05-1074,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1733.457,1749.3,"If the employer had a policy of paying women, all women, 20 percent less than men, and it continued that policy, surely it would know in the present day when it issued those paychecks that it was paying women less than men."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1752.585,1769.213,"Justice Alito, that's why I qualified my answer to Justice Stevens, because I think that the question his hypothetical raises, like your question, goes to the sufficiency of evidence necessary to prove intent during the charge filing period."
2006.05-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.69,1846.296,"Mr. Nager, why did it make any sense to treat this area any different from the Equal Pay Act."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1846.296,1851.665,--Because they are two different statutes and the elements of the plaintiff's claims are fundamentally different.
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1890.992,1894.027,Why is it different if the one further statement was made.
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1916.54,1921.778,"--Well, knowledge is a necessary condition, but it's not a sufficient condition, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1940.223,1943.627,Evans involved a factor that simply is not present here.
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1970.111,1981.233,"--Justice Ginsburg, Title VII allows proof of dissimilar treatment as evidence of present intentional discrimination, but it's not the elements of the claim."
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2043.557,2059.502,"If only the 180 day period counts, and she can complain only about discrimination in that period, then how do you account for her being able to go back not 180 days, but two years for her remedy?"
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2059.502,2066.739,The two-year rule is only a damages rule that applies only in Title VII cases.
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2075.145,2081.348,I thought it was the lid on the amount of compensation you could get in Title VII cases.
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2089.938,2090.388,--No.
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2128.896,2140.287,"Why is she claiming that in 1995, a supervisor recognized that my pay was way out of line."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2142.739,2143.206,He did.
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2150.845,2152.779,"Maybe she thought that, well, they are on the right track."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2157.165,2178.662,"And what the purpose of the charge filing requirement under Title VII, as this Court has repeatedly said, is to require that employee to come forward promptly within 180 days of the date that the alleged unlawful employment action is communicated to her, and bring that claim or lose it, that the purpose of Section 706 was to create repose."
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2178.662,2186.685,"The question that I asked Mr. Nager that I think is really important, and that is, where do you put these pay cases?"
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2218.656,2229.595,"Justice Ginsburg, the petitioner in this case has agreed with us that this is the kind of discrete employment action that triggers the 180-day period."
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2231.714,2233.416,Where is that agreement?
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2233.416,2234.433,It's in their brief.
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2259.483,2275.493,"I thought that the Morgan decision quotes Bazemore for saying, under Title VII, each week's paycheck that delivered less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong, actionable under Title VII."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2275.493,2280.146,And that's in the portion of the opinion that's dealing with discrete employment action.
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2288.919,2299.025,"Whatever portion it's in, it says each week's paycheck that delivered less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong, actionable--"
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2299.025,2318.337,"Because Justice Thomas' opinion was accurately describing the holding in Bazemore on the facts of Bazemore, because in Bazemore there was a claim, in contrast to this case, of ongoing intentional race discrimination in classifying employees on the basis of their race and paying the black employees less than the whites."
2006.05-1074,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.329,2345.756,"Justice Brennan's opinion sounds to me, part one, as if he is saying what the mistake was that the company made here is that they didn't really eradicate the effects of the past bad act, and they were trying to eradicate it."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2345.756,2349.374,"Well, actually, the United States' allegations in the case were trying--"
2006.05-1074,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.374,2355.212,That's another part of the case that's part two and part three about the evidence that came in.
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2359.848,2360.731,--That's part one.
2006.05-1074,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.731,2361.115,Yes.
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2468.551,2473.189,"Well, it was a compound question, but I'll try to answer each of its parts."
2006.05-1074,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2528.191,2534.595,But there is a slight difference in that you're focused on whether discrimination occurred within the 180-day period.
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2546.903,2547.487,No.
2006.05-1074,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2548.939,2551.641,I thought your answer to Justice Alito made that point.
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2551.641,2566.4,"--Well, what I said to Justice Alito was, if the employer knew that it previously had a policy and if it knew and intended that its present pay would be done for gender-related reasons or racially-related reasons, it would constitute--"
2006.05-1074,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.4,2572.202,But the question of whether just knowing that that's a source of the policy would be a gender-related reason.
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2572.202,2575.756,"--Well, the question is whether there was a present policy."
2006.05-1074,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.308,2586.778,"Well, in my hypothetical there was a policy established 20 years ago, a 20 percent differential, never been changed."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2591.766,2604.09,"And if the employer is presently applying, and knowingly and intentionally doing so, a 20 percent differential for male and female employees for no reason other than the gender of the employees, that's a present violation."
2006.05-1074,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2604.09,2607.275,"Well, what his reason is, this is always the way we did it."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2608.31,2616.214,"Well, if what he's saying is, the way we have always done it is engage in gender discrimination, then doing it in the present time period would state a present claim."
2006.05-1074,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2616.214,2627.722,"But suppose he has no intent to discriminate as a present matter, but he also knows that his decision is necessarily based on a policy that was discriminatory some years ago."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2629.724,2639.413,"I think if I understood the question, Justice Kennedy, I think no present claim, because the only thing you said that he knew is that they previously engaged in discriminatory actions."
2006.05-1074,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2639.413,2646.702,"He knows it, but his present decision is necessarily based on some prior decision that was discriminatory."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2646.702,2649.054,That in and of itself is not sufficient.
2006.05-1074,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2657.291,2666.849,How is that... how is that consistent with the statement in Bazemore that the employer has a duty to eradicate past discrimination?
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2666.849,2676.038,"--Well, the duty was to eradicate the alleged ongoing facially discriminatory pay practices that preceded the enactment of Title--"
2006.05-1074,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2714.247,2719.984,Is that so even if they know it was in fact originally an unlawful act?
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2719.984,2720.551,Yes.
2006.05-1074,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2720.551,2732.041,You draw a line between present purposeful discrimination and present knowledge of past discrimination which is knowingly carried forward.
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2732.041,2732.741,That's correct.
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2737.862,2753.038,"--How do you describe dealing with a case like Manhart where they were complaining about a pension plan that had been instituted, oh, way longer than 180 days, years and years before?"
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2753.038,2755.74,That plan was facially discriminatory.
2006.05-1074,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2810.974,2820.682,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2821.716,2823.801,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2848.766,2851.035,"This would be a good Equal Pay Act case, wouldn't it?"
2006.05-1074,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2851.035,2868.68,"If it met the requirements of the Equal Pay Act, which is that it has to be the same knowledge, skills and responsibilities and effort for the job, then every time that you have a failure to deliver equal pay for equal work there is a violation of the act."
2006.05-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2880.638,2894.98,"Why doesn't it become intentional, at least after 1995, when the supervisor recognizes that he's got an employee that is out of the appropriate range for her job, whether she does it badly or well?"
2006.05-1074,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2894.98,2906.122,"Justice Ginsburg, if an employee brought a claim within 180 days of the decision made then, that is to not, to not equalize the pay further--"
2006.05-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2906.122,2908.438,Why would she bring it then?
2006.05-1074,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2910.574,2920.815,"--Well, because I think what you're suggesting is they didn't give her a big enough raise, because there was still intentional discrimination from prior years that were not, that were unchallenged."
2006.05-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2920.815,2929.487,"Didn't she have every reason to expect, well, they finally noticed it, so next year I'm going to get that same size raise, but that it doesn't happen the next year?"
2006.05-1074,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2929.487,2937.741,"And if it doesn't happen that next year, then that employee has 180 days to challenge that pay decision on the ground that it's intentionally discriminatory."
2006.05-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2947.615,2951.317,She is not talking about a decision made 15 or 14 in this case.
2006.05-1074,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2955.453,2960.19,"--Well, I think in some, in some cases that, pay cases, it will build up over time."
2006.05-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2987.257,2991.478,But you could if the person making the decision was aware of the discriminatory policy.
2006.05-1074,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2991.478,3000.75,Knowledge of prior unlawful acts is relevant evidence in deciding whether it's present day intentional discrimination.
2006.05-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3024.199,3026.165,But you're changing the hypothetical.
2006.05-1074,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3029.151,3034.571,"I understand that, and I'm saying the same rule applies in a pay case that applies in a promotion case."
2006.05-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3034.571,3049.748,"You're saying, I think contrary to your colleague if I remember correctly, that even if the employer knew of the 20 percent differential policy established 20 years ago, it could still carry it into effect today."
2006.05-1074,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3049.748,3062.99,"What I'm saying with respect to a policy is if you have an ongoing policy that is still being applied in the limitations period, and that your current policy is to pay less to women than to men, then of course you can sue."
2006.05-1074,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3062.99,3067.026,Let's say it's the same person who made the decision.
2006.05-1074,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3087.94,3090.825,That's a neutral discrete act that was made at the time.
2006.05-1074,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3092.343,3096.211,Even though he knows that it carries forward the illegal discrimination?
2006.05-1074,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3096.211,3109.555,"Even when the employer... you can have an inference from knowledge of past illegal conduct that your present intent is to carry forward that differential based on the person's sex, but it is not an automatic inference."
2006.05-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3118.791,3119.125,But you're talking about--
2006.05-1074,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3119.125,3122.427,"--and I didn't correct those either, and that's a neutral policy."
2006.05-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3122.427,3124.745,--But that's a defense.
2006.05-1074,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3135.92,3139.121,"But under Title VII, poor performance isn't a defense."
2006.05-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3144.025,3148.394,"I thought at least in this area, the defenses were the same as under the Equal Pay Act."
2006.05-1074,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3148.394,3160.035,"Well, there are... there is an additional layer of defense, but still the employee has to prove an additional element in a Title VII claim, not just the absence of equal pay for equal work, it has to--"
2006.05-1074,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3160.035,3165.022,"Mr. Gornstein, why should we listen to the Solicitor General rather than the EEOC?"
2006.05-1074,4,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3170.593,3184.935,"--The EEOC has taken a different position but that decision that the EEOC has taken has been based on its reading of this Court's decision in Bazemore, and this Court does not give deference to the EEOC under Skidmore or under any other standard."
2006.05-1074,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3184.935,3187.637,So why don't we at least hear from the EEOC?
2006.05-1074,4,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3199.279,3201.579,That has occasionally happened in the past.
2006.05-1074,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3210.185,3217.491,"If the EEOC is upheld in the Court of Appeals and review is sought here, will the Government confess error?"
2006.05-1074,4,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3217.491,3218.574,"--I'm sorry, Justice Souter?"
2006.05-1074,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3218.574,3227.846,"If the EEOC decision is upheld by one of the Courts of Appeals and there is an attempt to bring the case here on cert, will the Government confess error?"
2006.05-1074,4,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3227.846,3236.035,"If the Court rules in the Government's favor in this case, then that case would have to be vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light of this Court's decision today."
2006.05-1074,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3236.885,3240.07,"Well, I'm asking a simpler question."
2006.05-1074,4,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3265.887,3281.564,"--Justice Souter, I would like to answer that question today but of course if the Court doesn't resolve the question today that's been decided today, but issues a new decision, anything we would have to do would have to look at that new decision and make a judgment about what the law is at that time."
2006.05-1074,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3283.866,3285.135,I think I got your point.
2006.05-1074,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3285.135,3289.503,Touche.
2006.05-1074,4,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3289.503,3310.416,"--To go on, there are three decisions of this Court that control the result here, Evans, Ricks and Lorance, each of which says that the employee cannot circumvent the limitations period by challenging conduct within the limitations period on the grounds that it is the result of a prior act of intentional discrimination that was not timely challenged."
2006.05-1074,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3382.714,3385.25,What would you do on the other side of this?
2006.05-1074,4,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3405.212,3416.77,Well in some... if she's denied a pay raise and she's aware that other people are getting substantial pay raises... I don't think it's that much different than somebody else getting the promotion and me not getting that promotion.
2006.05-1074,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3416.77,3417.636,"Well, she knows this."
2006.05-1074,4,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3426.577,3429.695,"Well, to the extent that you want to address equitable tolling."
2006.05-1074,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3442.853,3444.17,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-1074,5,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3449.174,3458.863,I think the fundamental disagreement in this case comes down to what is the unlawful employment practice Congress was referring to when it prohibited discrimination with respect to compensation.
2006.05-1074,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3535.597,3540.501,Do you agree that their action is just based on Bazemore or their reading of Bazemore?
2006.05-1074,5,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3540.501,3541.501,"No, that's incorrect."
2006.05-1074,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3602.991,3606.026,How could cost justify a dual pay scale?
2006.05-1074,5,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3606.026,3607.645,--It could... the Extension Service--
2006.05-1074,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3607.645,3610.847,"You'd have to have another factor in the decision, which was that you didn't want to change pay."
2006.05-1074,5,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3613.299,3615.032,--It would be a nondiscriminatory reason.

2006.05-1074,5,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3634.709,3642.199,"They would say, we don't want to equalize pay because it costs too much, and that's not a discriminatory reason for maintaining the prior disparity."

2006.05-1074,5,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3647.503,3648.169,--Which is what happened here.
2006.05-1074,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3658.625,3661.144,You can equalize pay by lowering others.
2006.05-1074,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3671.534,3672.951,Not under the Equal Pay Act.
2006.05-1074,5,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3675.986,3676.753,That's true.
2006.05-1074,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3676.753,3679.974,"Under Title VII you can equalize either way, right?"
2006.05-1074,5,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3679.974,3686.044,"It would, but if they chose not to equalize at all because they don't want to spend the money the money that would be a nondiscriminatory reason."
2006.05-1074,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3686.044,3688.694,You'd certainly have a very happy work force if you equalized one way.
2006.05-1074,5,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3688.694,3689.31,Thank you.
2006.05-1074,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3689.31,3689.777,"Thank you, counsel."
