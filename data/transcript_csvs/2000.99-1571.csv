2000.99-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.093,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-1571, Traffix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.--"
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,10.208,12.32,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,87.834,91.429,"Mr. Roberts, how do we determine what the patent covers?"
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,111.598,121.663,"Well, in this case, of course, it's easy to determine that the patent covers this particular sign stand because MDI labeled that sign stand as patent-protected."
2000.99-1571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,121.663,122.268,The whole thing?
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,122.268,124.244,"The whole sign stand, yes."
2000.99-1571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.244,127.313,"Legs, spring, and all?"
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,127.313,132.05,"And all, but in its trade literature, for example, it focused on the dual-spring design."
2000.99-1571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.154,162.166,"So under your view of the case, if the legs that the patentee had had a very special color, like the John Deere green or something, that could be copied after the patent ran?"
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,162.73,163.159,--Well--
2000.99-1571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,163.159,170.991,--in the pictures the legs were orange in your client's stand and aluminum in the other.
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,170.991,181.704,"--Well, incidental ornamentation that is not part of what the patent protects does not give rise to the right to copy."
2000.99-1571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,200.141,209.057,"In any event, they're different in this... if I'm looking at the right diagrams the... your client has a different... has the orange color."
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,209.057,212.566,"Well, it depends on which stand is involved."
2000.99-1571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,241.975,261.709,"But Mr. Roberts, didn't the court of appeals say, at least as I understood it to say, okay, the dual springs Traffix could have, but you have to devise some kind of other stand, curved legs, or a double stand."
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,262.688,267.211,It said we... it said we basically had to design around their stand.
2000.99-1571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.928,349.019,--Does it depend in part on how we define functionality under the trade dress inquiry?
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,349.019,356.899,"We think there is a freestanding right to copy from an expired patent, that it doesn't depend upon what functionality is."
2000.99-1571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,356.899,365.273,And you think that there can never be a trade dress protection in some aspect of an expired patented item?
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,365.273,374.708,"If the item was simply incidental ornamentation... one of their amici used the example, if you're patenting a chair and the drawing shows a purple bow."
2000.99-1571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,381.03,386.103,So there could be a trade dress in an expired patented item.
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,386.103,390.488,"In the item itself, yes, but not in the subject of the patent."
2000.99-1571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,390.488,396.237,"And I suppose that depends on how we define functionality, in a sense."
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,396.237,408.791,"Functionality I think leads to the same place that we come to from looking at patent law, if you define functionality as it has traditionally been defined, as turning on usefulness."
2000.99-1571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,424.52,427.11,Justice O'Connor's question suggests this to me.
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,435.366,437.693,"Exactly, and functionality--"
2000.99-1571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,437.693,442.709,"But why isn't functionality sufficient protection, particularly in this case?"
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,442.709,464.86,"--Functionality is sufficient if functionality means useful, but if functionality means, as the lower court said in this case, something for which there is a competitive need, or for which there are not available alternatives, and there's a multi-factor balancing test to determine so-called legal functionality--"
2000.99-1571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,464.86,469.262,"Well, I guess the court, the Sixth Circuit pulled that out of Qualitex' opinion."
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,469.262,470.226,"--Well, we--"
2000.99-1571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,470.226,471.428,The competitive need.
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,471.428,479.26,"--I don't think Qualitex opined on the exact definition of functionality in this case, or it was misread by the lower court."
2000.99-1571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,490.464,494.291,"So as far as you're concerned, if it's useful, then it's functional?"
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,494.291,511.296,"--Period, without regard to competitive need, available alternatives... MDI's position is, look, you can make a sign that stands up to the wind that's just as good as our sign stand, so don't make it the way we made it, but the patent, the expired patent gives us the right to copy--"
2000.99-1571,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,511.296,521.282,"Well, it gives you... this... I think my question is related to Justice O'Connor's, and this is a problem that I have in understanding, and maybe you can help me."
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,534.599,538.187,--I think Justice Brandeis' opinion in Kellogg answers that.
2000.99-1571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,592.353,629.566,"If we were dealing, Mr. Roberts, with just the patent law, that would be one thing and, as I understand it, although it's confusing, the word useful is a patent term of art and functionality is a trade dress term of art, but you're trying now to equate these two terms in answer to questions that you've had as one and the same, but they have different purposes, as I understand it, in the patent law, the idea of useful, trade dress, the idea of functionality."
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,646.904,650.181,--Yes.
2000.99-1571,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,716.33,746.504,"Do you agree that at least one basis on which we could decide this case would simply be on the basis of how expensive a concept of configuration trade dress we want, because if we take your position, configuration trade dress is going to be, at least in formally patented matters, a pretty narrow concept, and if we're going to have coherence within the concept of configuration trade dress, we're going to have to make it equally narrow."
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,765.344,772.888,I think it is the expansion of the concept of configuration trade dress that has given rise to this issue and the problem.
2000.99-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.55,852.589,"Of course, Mr. Roberts, you rely heavily on the patent in this case, and that's the question presented."
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,863.179,867.069,"Certainly, yes, and--"
2000.99-1571,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.069,873.65,The fact of the patent really is just evidentiary support for the ultimate conclusion that this is a functional feature.
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,873.65,877.03,"--Well, it gives rise to an important distinction."
2000.99-1571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,918.32,936.474,"The difficulty, I guess is, would you make the test absolute, because if you make it absolute, you know, you're going to get into huge litigation about whether this thing in the patent was or it was not an essential element, and then somebody will say, oh yeah, I guess I did include it as one of the specifications in the patent, but it really wasn't that important."
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,955.239,960.007,"Well, you know, a little bit of a loophole suddenly expands, particularly when you have a multi--"
2000.99-1571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,960.007,966.994,"But it goes both ways, because if you allow no loophole you're going to get the same kind of arguments about whether it was or was not an essential part of a patent."
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,966.994,969.097,"--Well, of course, in this case it's easy."
2000.99-1571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,970.077,973.042,"In this case it may be easy, but the question is, what about the rule?"
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,973.042,978.273,--and producers all the time compete all the time in the confines of patents.
2000.99-1571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1010.507,1028.159,"Wasn't the exact same sign... I thought one of the points that was made was that in the patent infringement case, that sign didn't look as much like the Market Display signs--"
2000.99-1571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1028.159,1028.396,--Yes.
2000.99-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.509,1050.962,"--Very well, Mr. Roberts."
2000.99-1571,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1052.914,1066.729,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1289.67,1297.144,"Mr. Wallace, may I ask if you would answer the question that Justice Stevens posed to Mr. Roberts in the same way?"
2000.99-1571,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1318.996,1322.121,--That is absolutely correct.
2000.99-1571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1340.849,1350.602,So your position is the utilitarian feature of the patent is a conclusive presumption in a trade dress suit where functionality would otherwise be at issue?
2000.99-1571,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1350.602,1357.781,"With regard to the scope of protection, that others cannot be excluded from using something utilitarian."
2000.99-1571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.867,1661.037,"Mr. Wallace, I'm not sure what your proposal is, that we use the simple test for what, for useful features--"
2000.99-1571,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1661.037,1661.562,That--
2000.99-1571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.562,1667.257,"--whether or not they are patented, and the more complex test for... for what?"
2000.99-1571,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1667.257,1682.787,"--Both... either test can show that something is functional, whichever one suits the needs of the particular factual situation."
2000.99-1571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.787,1683.98,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,1686.371,1698.071,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1749.039,1760.811,"It's a touchstone of patent law that an expired patent can be copied, so we really do have to make the two doctrines mesh well."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,1760.811,1761.575,--Yes.
2000.99-1571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1761.575,1788.407,"And the concern we have is with this expanded competitive need test that some of the lower courts have begun employing, and I am quite interested to know how you think the two doctrines can fit neatly together, because in an ideal world a trade dress could not cover something that was covered by a patent that's now expired."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,1788.407,1798.791,"Well, Justice O'Connor, the mediating factor between the two is the functionality test, in my opinion."
2000.99-1571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1803.04,1808.064,And it's possible that some of the courts have lowered the bar too much on the functionality inquiry.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,1811.254,1826.335,"--Well, in the Qualitex case, the Qualitex gave a specific definition of functionality, and remember now, in 1998-1999, Congress made some amendments to the trademark act, or Lanham Act, and in this they specifically mentioned functionality several times."
2000.99-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.908,1864.452,"Is there evidence, Mr. Artz, that Congress affirmatively approved the Tenth Circuit case?"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,1864.452,1866.739,"No, they did not."
2000.99-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.847,1889.041,"Well, I... you... I thought part of your argument was that the Tenth Circuit had decided this case in 1995 and it was quote, before, close quote, Congress at the time it made the amendments."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,1891.838,1899.311,"Well, what I'm saying is, in 1995 that Vornado case was there, and in 1998 Congress amended the trademark act."
2000.99-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.018,1909.83,"But you're not... you're arguing, I hope, something more than post hoc ergo propter hoc."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,1909.83,1910.638,--Yes.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1911.96,1915.622,"Would you go back to Justice O'Connor, which I thought was the key question, and I didn't--"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,1915.622,1915.982,Yes.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.982,1916.543,--hear the answer.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,1972.733,1973.609,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1973.609,1993.806,"Two pages later, in case that wasn't clear, the case quotes Restatement Third about aesthetic functionality and says, in respect to aesthetic functionality, i.e., color, quote, the ultimate test is whether the recognition of trademark rights would significantly hinder competition, all right."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,1993.806,1994.194,Yes.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1994.194,1995.509,But nothing in the case--
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,1995.509,1996.321,No.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1996.321,2000.251,--purports to change any earlier test in respect to anything else--
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2000.251,2001.143,"Well, that's--"
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2001.143,2011.723,"--or even change anything there, so as I read the case that seemed to be its reading, which would say in this case, which isn't about aesthetic functionality, we apply what is the traditional test."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2011.723,2020.109,"--Well, every case which has actually looked at functionality actually has come up with the result that the Sixth Circuit did, the Seventh Circuit did--"
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.109,2028.62,"Maybe, but I thought the place you look for a test is in the Supreme Court opinions, and in the Supreme Court opinions, Qualitex quotes the traditional test."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2029.577,2030.468,--That's correct.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2030.468,2039.172,"It said, in general terms a product feature is functional if it is essential to the use or purpose of this article, or it affects the cost or quality of the article."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2047.053,2058.978,"Well, the Supreme Court goes on in the Qualitex case and says, that is... that is, if exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a significant nonreputational related disadvantage."
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.978,2059.804,"Well, that was my question."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2069.672,2070.348,I think that--
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2070.348,2077.199,"--namely, aesthetic functionality, which is an aspect of quality I think people could argue about."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2077.199,2079.478,"--I think that is the test, Your Honor, whether or not--"
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.478,2081.645,The test in the case of aesthetic functionality?
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2081.645,2081.985,--Yes.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2081.985,2082.335,Fine.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2084.304,2085.012,"I believe it is, yes."
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.012,2085.576,Aesthetic?
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2086.483,2090.367,"It involves how things look, the appearance, visual--"
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.367,2092.565,Everything in design involves how things look.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2092.565,2092.931,--Okay.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2092.931,2093.806,"I mean, that's--"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2093.806,2097.164,"Well, it's aesthetic in that sense, but it's not... it doesn't involve color, no, it does not."
2000.99-1571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2101.965,2141.743,"--It involves size and shape, and this discussion about Qualitex and aesthetic functionality doesn't get into what effect the patents, if any, has on functionality, and in your view does the patent... your having had a patent, building up goodwill, free, over 20 years, nobody can compete with that, so if you've got secondary meaning it's because you have been able to keep everybody off."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2161.643,2175.315,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that the case, Midwest case by the Federal Circuit, the Thomas & Betts case of the Seventh Circuit, our case, Sixth Circuit, and the Sunbeam case, Fifth Circuit, all apply the proper test."
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.227,2237.246,"They may be separate and distinct, but they bear upon one another, and there seems to be something horribly unfair about allowing someone who has acquired a secondary meaning in the trade dress only because of the patent... let's say the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2300.468,2301.91,"--No, I don't think it's unfair at all, Your Honor."
2000.99-1571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2352.682,2353.996,There's a problem--
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2353.996,2355.8,"--Well, it's the second that we're arguing about, I think."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2367.905,2376.623,"I think functionality, Your Honor, legal functionality is really a misnomer, like I believe in the Wal-Mart case the secondary meaning was looked at as being a misnomer."
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.052,2397.456,Aesthetic functionality isn't conceivably in this case.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2428.395,2434.224,"Well, I think the functionality test that's been developed in Qualitex applies to any type of trade dress--"
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2434.224,2435.132,"Ah, wait."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2471.862,2478.657,--I think the test that's set forth in Qualitex that Your Honor says is for just aesthetic functionality applies in every functionality test.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2479.445,2486.329,"So then the pages written at 169 and 170, and trying to explain just what we're driving at are sort of beside the point."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2486.329,2486.798,Yes.
2000.99-1571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2510.425,2525.021,"Can we apply that test, because I'm having a little trouble connecting to the real world and the device before us and these multi-factor tests and even what you've just been saying."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2547.727,2549.122,"Yes, it can, Your Honor."
2000.99-1571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2549.122,2556.802,If you could describe to me what it can copy and what it must change I would have a more secure handle on what your case is.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2556.802,2560.373,"Our trade dress, Your Honor, it's really a combination of five features."
2000.99-1571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2593.858,2598.108,But there aren't that many things to adjust.
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2621.286,2624.275,And the law requires the shape of the sign.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2632.065,2632.429,You have--
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2632.429,2635.467,--And your friend over there says that they changed the legs.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2636.406,2636.724,--Now--
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.724,2645.107,"Somebody who sees their legs say, gee, it has the... what do you call them... step-down legs, or whatever it is, so the one thing it seemed to me that they could have changed, they did change."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2645.107,2648.153,"--No, they kept the same visual appearance and image, Your Honor."
2000.99-1571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2671.302,2674.331,Because that one in your right hand probably works better.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2674.331,2676.076,I think so.
2000.99-1571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2676.736,2680.461,"Yes, and that's why they wanted to copy it, and not something that worked less well."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2680.461,2683.857,"Well, the thing here is a competitive necessity test."
2000.99-1571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2712.425,2720.982,"You know, I have to confess that I'm... I find it a little difficult to imagine that most motorists are looking at what... the legs of the sign instead of the message on the sign."
2000.99-1571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2733.038,2734.871,I've been looking in the last week.
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.885,2741.894,I gather you don't care about the motorists.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2744.683,2745.711,"That's it, yes."
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.711,2745.996,Right?
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2745.996,2748.181,"It does... confusion as to the purchaser, who the relevant purchasers--"
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2748.181,2749.159,You couldn't care less about the motorists.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2750.687,2753.701,Could I ask you a question about the patent part?
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2836.133,2836.569,--Okay.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.569,2837.102,All right.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2845.339,2847.235,"No, it should not be the test."
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2847.235,2847.799,Because?
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2847.799,2873.779,"Because I think what you say in the patent could be relevant, and the patent obviously is going to be put into every trade dress case, and that is one of the reasons I think that trade dress tests, that their absolute test is unworkable, because in every trademark case now what you're going to have is, a defendant's going to run out and scour the 5 million expired patents, find one which has a claim which may read on this trade dress, accused trade dress and say, a-ha, it's dedicated to the public on this other, somebody else's patent."
2000.99-1571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2875.078,2889.442,"It would seem to me that would be, even under your rule, a... well, maybe not under your, but under the Government's rule, quite an appropriate thing to do, to show that there is functionality that the patent office has recognized."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2889.442,2896.389,"--Well, again I don't want you to confuse legal functionality with something that's useful in purpose, because legal functionality is different."
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2921.149,2922.016,Mr. Artz--
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2922.016,2922.445,Yes.
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2922.445,2928.929,"--I hadn't realized it, you are not complaining about their use of the double spring feature."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2931.449,2931.778,No.
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2931.778,2934.577,--used the double springs if they had put them separate--
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2934.577,2934.694,Yes.
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2934.694,2935.921,--separately and apart.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2935.921,2937.324,"--possibly, in a bit different visual image and appearance, Your Honor."
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.324,2944.534,And the double springs next to each other was not part of your original patent application--
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2944.534,2944.683,"No, it was not."
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2944.683,2946.197,--that they were originally apart.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2946.197,2946.842,That's right.
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.842,2954.163,"So the issue, really, is simply the functionality of putting the springs close together."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2962.138,2964.888,"Actually, technically it would make it less stable."
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2967.247,2973.85,"Okay, but if it made it more stable, then you would acknowledge that they could copy even that feature, the unpatented feature?"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,2973.85,2973.96,No.
2000.99-1571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3002.53,3004.474,"Well, the public isn't buying it."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3009.073,3011.4,"--That's the relevant public for this purpose, Your Honor, yes."
2000.99-1571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3011.4,3013.489,"Yeah, it's the highway department purchasers."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3013.489,3013.598,That's correct.
2000.99-1571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3013.598,3020.681,"And doesn't the State typically regulate the shape of the sign, as Justice Scalia asked you?"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3020.681,3021.125,Yes.
2000.99-1571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3021.125,3025.04,"I mean, diamond shape indicates a certain kind of warning, does it not?"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3025.04,3025.421,Correct.
2000.99-1571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3025.421,3028.721,"So they can use that shape and color, presumably."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3029.812,3031.19,"Yes, I agree, Your Honor."
2000.99-1571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3031.19,3033.336,"So what are we arguing about, the legs?"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3033.336,3037.123,"The... yes, legs, the shape, the base, and the springs, and then the upright."
2000.99-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.317,3045.309,"Well, what is the base, after you get through with the legs, and the upright, and the springs?"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3045.309,3045.642,Uh-huh.
2000.99-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3045.642,3052.638,"I mean, could you... you indicate, what are we arguing about, the legs and the base."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3052.638,3057.533,There's no... I don't think there's any doubt that these have a different visual appearance.
2000.99-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3062.118,3066.67,"So when you say base, that really is another way of saying the legs?"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3066.67,3068.511,"No, it's what the legs are attached to."
2000.99-1571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3073.406,3084.436,"But obviously you're holding up one that's a rectangle, so it makes sense to have the posts on either side, as opposed to the diamond shape, where it makes sense to have it in the middle."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3087.944,3091.168,"Well, this, under the doctrine of equivalents, this was held to be an infringement."
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.863,3114.564,"Well, you're willing to fight out the... I gather you're willing to fight out the functionality battle as to whether putting the two springs right next to each other instead of apart is a functional matter."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3119.244,3123.511,"Well, I... whether it's useful, has a purpose, I mean, if that's functionality--"
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.511,3127.138,Whether it's functional within the meaning of the trade dress restriction.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3127.138,3131.827,"--Well then the answer, I agree... I think is no, because is there a competitive necessity to have them together?"
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.583,3138.771,"Okay, but you would agree that that inquiry would be addressed to the spacing of the springs."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3138.771,3141.082,Only--
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3141.082,3171.952,"Even if we think that the use of double springs is automatically no basis for giving you trade dress protection, since you had patented the double springs, you hadn't patented whether they were close together or far apart and so whether putting them close together, as your opponent did, is a violation of trade dress protection would depend upon whether putting them close together is functional within the meaning of trade dress law, right?"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3171.952,3180.684,"--It's whether or not their whole visual appearance, of a combination of five features, is functional in the competitive necessity test."
2000.99-1571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3182.134,3195.765,"I thought you a minute ago acknowledged that if the two springs were closer together it would be less wind-resistant than otherwise, which seems to me demonstrates it has some functional significance whether they're close or not."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3202.44,3203.85,--Not the legal functionality test--
2000.99-1571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3203.85,3206.457,"Not under all these tests, but why shouldn't it be enough?"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3216.003,3229.738,"--Well, the problem you have, Your Honor, is that tests... either the Government's test or Traffix' test is going to be unworkable, because you could have company A that makes this product, or comes up with this idea, company B. Company A gets a patent on it, goes 17 years."
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3247.488,3268.481,"I don't... I thought as a factual matter that there are five features in your patent, including the legs, all the other things of appearance, but the district court found that there are a lot of other competitors that have every one of those features, so it's not unique but for the spaced-apart coil springs, so that all were... is that true?"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3268.481,3269.492,That's true.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3269.492,3283.41,"All right, so all we're talking about... and then I thought also as a factual matter that somebody before the patent expired used those two spaced-apart springs in that narrow configuration that your finger's on right now."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3283.41,3283.862,Uh-huh.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3283.862,3294.437,"And you sued them, and it was found in your claim, in your view, those spaced-apart that much, not wide apart, violated your patent, and you won."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3294.437,3296.717,"Well, the patent covered some other things other than that."
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3303.046,3311.205,"But they didn't get out of it... they didn't get out of your patent, because the springs were close together rather than being far apart."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3311.205,3313.086,"--Well, that's the doctrine of equivalents, and--"
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3313.086,3313.57,Yeah.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3313.57,3316.671,"--one language of the claim which calls for spaced-apart springs, and then we--"
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3316.671,3317.06,That's right.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3317.06,3321.901,--It was equivalent from a patent standpoint whether two springs together were the equivalent of two springs spaced apart.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3321.901,3322.259,"That's right, so I--"
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3322.259,3322.823,That was that issue.
2000.99-1571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3322.823,3323.22,--Yeah.
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3323.22,3337.035,"That's only one of several issues in that patent case, and the fact that the others happened to use this coil spring, they used the other parts, that shows you that you can change one or two parts of this particular trade dress and comes up... have something that looks completely different."
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3362.082,3372.308,"But it seems to me if the different spacing is the functional... is a functional equivalent for patent law, then it seems to me that the spacing of the spring is part of your patent protection."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3372.308,3373.423,--All right.
2000.99-1571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3373.423,3384.141,"As well as the nature of the springs, and so the square stand is no different for purposes of the issue in this case than the diamond-shaped stand."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3384.141,3393.584,"As long as you don't confuse the patent law with the trade dress law, Your Honor, two separate and distinct, but from a patent law standpoint you're right, but not from the trade dress standpoint."
2000.99-1571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3494.432,3495.499,"Thank you, Mr. Artz."
2000.99-1571,1,28765,john_a_artz,,3495.499,3496.502,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
