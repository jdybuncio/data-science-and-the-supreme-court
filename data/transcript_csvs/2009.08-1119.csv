2009.08-1119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.122,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1119, Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz v. United States and United States v. Milavetz."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,11.891,14.424,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,28.833,38.708,"If it were confined to unlawful activity and narrowly drawn, do you concede that such a statute would be constitutional?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,38.708,43.427,"Perhaps, Justice Kennedy, but the real challenge is to actually do that narrowing--"
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,43.427,44.593,"You say ""perhaps""."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,65.423,71.141,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy, if it were narrowly drawn to apply to criminal activity or fraudulent activity, yes."
2009.08-1119,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.243,120.172,But there's already in the statute an -- a required attestation from the lawyer who signs a bankruptcy petition that the petition does not constitute an abuse.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,123.022,124.674,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1119,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.674,127.326,"And the words are something like ""does not constitute an abuse""."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,139.634,141.217,"Two reasons, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,161.63,174.371,"Well, again in the hypothetical context, could Congress enforce by a statute what it requires in the attestation clause?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,174.371,181.394,"No, Justice Kennedy, because the abuse standard is too nebulous to satisfy, I think, scrutiny under the First Amendment."
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,181.394,186.365,So you think the attestation clause cannot be the basis for sanctioning an attorney?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,186.365,188.531,It can be the basis for sanctioning an attorney--
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,188.531,190.399,"I mean, how can that be if it's too vague."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,190.399,216.217,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that the gateway to the bankruptcy procedures or basically provisions, like section 707 or in the Chapter 11 context, basically are equitable inquiry that looks into the totality of the circumstances, whether what the lawyer has done or what the debtor has done -- and really it looks to what the debtor has done -- would be such that it would deny access to bankruptcy relief."
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,223.538,231.309,"The attestation clause is designed to ensure that the attorney has performed in an ethical and proper way, I take it."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,231.309,232.343,In a sense.
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,232.343,233.678,Isn't that one of its purposes?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,233.678,248.688,I think it goes more towards the attorney checking the information that the debtor has basically provided in the petition and elsewhere to make sure that the information that's provided is accurate and that the bankruptcy petition is not being proposed in essence for an abusive purpose.
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,248.688,255.592,"I won't take up too much more of your argument, but it just seems to me odd that you can enforce an attestation clause, but not a statute that does the same thing."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,265.365,282.326,"Except, I think, Your Honor, that whereas for the purposes of getting into bankruptcy or staying in bankruptcy is one standard that courts apply basically on an equitable basis, that analysis -- what Congress did there, it didn't have in mind First Amendment concerns."
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,290.265,293.217,"Well, Congress often forgets about the First Amendment, but lawyers don't."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,293.217,296.586,"That's true, Your Honor, and that's the heart of the problem here."
2009.08-1119,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,304.24,306.923,What are the words in 707(b)?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,314.111,316.213,"--That is true, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,329.021,329.271,But isn't there another problem?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,337.191,342.995,"--Yes, Justice Stevens, but this statute is not reasonable susceptible to the government's interpretation."
2009.08-1119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,342.995,346.031,That is an entirely different argument from the fact that Congress didn't think of this problem.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,346.031,348.316,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-1119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,374.883,375.383,What do you think that means?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,378.935,386.422,--I think it means what the Court said it meant in the Pender case interpreting section 60(d) of the former Bankruptcy Act of 1898.
2009.08-1119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,395.546,405.402,"Well, let's say someone goes to the lawyer and they discuss the person's debt situation and the decision is made that a bankruptcy petition is going to be filed at some future date."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,410.989,412.822,"--Not necessarily, Justice Alito."
2009.08-1119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,412.822,413.322,"Then, why not?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,418.207,419.992,"Well, I think that would--"
2009.08-1119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,419.992,426.813,"Doesn't it mean -- ""in contemplation of bankruptcy"" means because of the expectation of filing a bankruptcy petition later?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,426.813,434.568,--I think that that would assume that the filing of the bankruptcy petition looms entirely in the consciousness of the debtor when the debtor does everything.
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,453.53,453.696,Wait.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,466.254,472.242,"--I do see a causal connection, but there is no element of doing something improper in the language ""in contemplation of""."
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.242,473.108,"Well, that's true."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,480.328,481.447,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.433,488.033,That's a different question.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,488.033,489.0,That doesn't exist.
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,533.129,539.449,Is there a -- is there a difference between unethical and illegal advice?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,539.449,540.568,--I think--
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,540.568,545.037,As an attorney can you under -- give unethical advice?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,545.037,547.055,"--Yes, I think so, Justice Sotomayor--"
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,547.055,550.34,Under the State rules you can give unethical advice as a lawyer?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,550.34,551.673,"--You cannot, no."
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,553.375,560.462,"So if you are not permitted to do so, what in the First Amendment would otherwise give you that right?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,575.655,577.572,It wouldn't protect your right to give unethical advice.
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,583.225,589.462,We are assuming that it's not read with a limitation with respect to abusive conduct.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,589.462,589.962,Correct.
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,590.745,602.27,"Assuming that is read into the statute or is viewed as part of ""in contemplation of bankruptcy"", what in the First Amendment would make that be?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,602.27,606.322,--The First Amendment would not protect unethical advice.
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,615.677,616.295,Which doesn't explain why.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,616.295,619.564,"--Because ""abusive"", it's like ""seditious utterances""."
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,624.683,626.985,You don't understand what it means as a lawyer?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,626.985,629.337,I have some ideas about what means.
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,645.447,646.715,"What if you leave ""abusive"" out."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,657.772,658.356,--I'll give you--
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,658.356,666.295,It just prohibits giving advice in contemplation of bankruptcy that somebody incur more debt.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,667.711,669.913,"--Well, I'll give you -- I'll give you a perfect example."
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,686.34,689.058,But that's not in contemplation of bankruptcy.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,689.058,696.147,"It would be, Justice Scalia, if the debtor comes to you in financial distress, is thinking about filing for bankruptcy, and wants the advice in that context."
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.147,710.99,"If the only reason the lawyer gives the advice is because he knows that this -- that this debtor is planning to file bankruptcy, he says, if you are going to file bankruptcy, you better sell the house and move to an apartment, then it's no good."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,717.644,721.946,Because it's perfectly legitimate advice about perfectly lawful activity--
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.946,722.696,So it's a stupid law.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,722.696,733.385,"--Well, what happens is that basically it interferes with the lawyer's ability through speech to communicate full and candid advice to the client."
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.385,733.635,Exactly.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,735.254,736.82,And ultimately under--
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.82,740.74,"Now, where is the prohibition of stupid laws in the Constitution?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,741.324,752.215,"--Justice Scalia, I think the problem here is that this stupid law does not pass either strict scrutiny and it is substantially overbroad."
2009.08-1119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,752.215,783.151,"How much of your case depends upon the difficulty of defining what -- if you accept the idea that ""in contemplation of"" means abusive or fraudulent, how much of your case depends upon the proposition that it's just hard to tell, that it's -- it's a multifactored inquiry and that the lawyer sort of has to stop and think at every turn: Well, could this be construed as recommending abuse, or is this just construed as telling clients what they can and can't do?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,796.122,799.342,"It doesn't turn on that, but that demonstrates the chilling effect."
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,844.038,858.696,"Well, if we assume a proper limited construction -- I know you disagree with that, but if we assume that we can limit the statute properly so that it applies just to unethical conduct, then you can't give that advice to anybody, and the fact that assisted persons is a subclass of that is irrelevant."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,858.696,866.718,"--That would be true, Justice Kennedy, if in fact we could tease out from the abusive conduct, if people could actually understand what ""abusive"" meant."
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.036,876.592,"Yes, but that doesn't go to your other point that there's a problem in determining the class of persons."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,883.929,889.9,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, but that assumes that we can do the narrowing construction, I think as Your Honor points out."
2009.08-1119,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,896.904,905.175,"You want to -- I mean, your first point is -- and we never get to that question because lawyers shouldn't be under this act at all."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,909.563,910.613,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.941,934.812,It's only lawyers who are protected against vague criminal statutes?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,942.065,943.531,"--Certainly not, Justice Scalia, which is why--"
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.531,949.219,So then -- so then there is no reason in particular to take lawyers out of it just to make it constitutional.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,949.219,954.023,"--Well, our argument there, Justice Scalia, is that the statute does not unambiguously embrace attorneys."
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.533,968.066,That's fine.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,982.542,986.677,"That is also true, Justice Scalia, because we do make a substantial overbreadth argument."
2009.08-1119,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,988.196,991.064,"Now, but when you say it isn't referred to, it seems to me to be referred to."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1016.977,1018.41,"A lawyer does, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-1119,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1018.41,1018.71,All right.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1022.196,1035.371,"The problem, Justice Breyer, is that I think when Your Honor was quoting from section 101(4A), Your Honor took out a whole lot of information that goes between the word ""bankruptcy assistance"" and ""legal representation""."
2009.08-1119,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1035.371,1037.307,Yes; they include other people besides lawyers.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1037.307,1041.009,"Not only that, but I think that that language is inherently ambiguous."
2009.08-1119,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1042.392,1043.142,I don't know.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1048.76,1051.212,That would seem to be with respect to lawyers.
2009.08-1119,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1051.212,1051.646,It would seem to be a lawyer.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1051.646,1054.098,"But it's precluded -- it's preceded by language,"
2009.08-1119,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1062.704,1063.02,Yeah.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1063.805,1071.225,"Well, not just other people, but what it looks like, is it looks like what Congress was getting at was people who provide things like what attorneys provide."
2009.08-1119,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1082.6,1093.472,"How is it any different from including lawyers within the category ""debt collectors"", which lawyers objected to in this Court unsuccessfully?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1093.472,1094.741,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1119,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.91,1163.885,"I thought that in the legislative history there were examples of lawyers overreaching, that the conduct that Congress was aiming at was engaged in by lawyers, as well as others."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1163.885,1167.854,"--There are some references in the legislative history to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1175.272,1178.71,I have heard of referring to legislative history when the statute is ambiguous.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1182.678,1183.478,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1213.964,1220.35,"Before you go on on 528, could you clarify for me: What is your challenge to 528?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1223.302,1223.985,"--528, Justice Sotomayor?"
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1223.985,1224.552,--528.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1224.552,1225.404,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1225.404,1228.106,Is it a normal facial invalidity?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1235.11,1237.812,Does Your Honor mean 526 or 528?
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1237.812,1238.712,--528.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1238.712,1239.195,528.
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1242.181,1242.616,Yes.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1242.616,1246.235,We are challenging that on as-applied it violates the Constitution--
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1246.235,1250.853,Can you tell me how you have an as-applied challenge when I don't even know what ad is at issue?

2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1268.898,1269.548,--Yes.
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1269.548,1277.068,"--by you that I could look at and say, you know, I'm looking at it and it's not misleading."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1278.586,1280.07,The ads are not in the record.
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1295.246,1301.785,I -- I truly have never heard of an as-applied challenge when we don't know what it is being applied to.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1309.189,1313.426,--With respect to the advertisements with the commercial speech?
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1313.426,1314.442,"Yes, the 528."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1314.442,1318.644,"No, it's not a -- it's not a facial challenge; it's an as-applied challenge."
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1329.952,1331.638,Did the government bring this lawsuit below?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1331.638,1333.854,--We brought this lawsuit as a declaratory judgment action.
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1333.854,1339.875,"So what, were they supposed to scour your advertisements to find the violation?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1340.41,1345.712,"No, unless there was an allegation that in some way Petitioners' advertisements were misleading."
2009.08-1119,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1410.904,1411.871,Could I ask you something?
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1423.979,1429.366,"--The problem, Justice Sotomayor, is that that statement inherently is misleading."
2009.08-1119,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1440.772,1461.035,"They don't want to be -- lawyers don't want to be called debt collectors either, and in this, the Fair Debt Collection Act, it says that -- that communication must say the communication is from a debt collector, except that formal pleadings are not -- you don't have to identify."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1474.593,1478.83,"Yes, but the debt collection statute doesn't require that in advertising."
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1497.023,1508.063,"Well, A, I suppose you don't have to advertise; or B, if you do, you can say in your bread hypo: Under the Federal law we have bread, but our bread is -- I don't know -- gluten-free or whatever."
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1508.613,1509.98,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1119,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1509.98,1513.634,--You can always add -- add in order to make it non-misleading.
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1513.634,1528.727,"But that would require a statement in our advertising that is actually -- to make it fundamentally dissimilar to the statement that's being actually imposed on us, we have to say -- we have to put in the advertising something like ""This product contains wheat""."
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.565,1537.398,"This is a proposal for a commercial transaction, right?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1555.625,1564.398,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, but this statute is odd because it requires counterfactual information, it's not narrowly drawn to address the problem the government identifies."
2009.08-1119,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.398,1565.048,I don't know--
2009.08-1119,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1565.048,1577.556,"If a law firm -- if a law firm provides representation for debtors in bankruptcy, what is misleading about requiring them to say: We help people file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code?"
2009.08-1119,0,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1577.556,1581.11,Because the scope of 528(b)(2)(B) is so broad.
2009.08-1119,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1620.049,1621.083,"Thank you, Mr. Brunstad."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1628.839,1631.106,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-1119,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1656.555,1665.161,"What about the provision that says the directors, employees, are not included?"
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1665.161,1676.135,"As I understand Petitioners' argument about that provision, it is that Congress would surely have made an exception for partners as well had it intended to include attorneys."
2009.08-1119,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1701.434,1702.1,What about an associate?
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1702.1,1714.074,"--I think, Justice Ginsburg, an associate is an employee, so if the associate in a law firm provides -- doesn't provide the bankruptcy assistance herself, then she is not a debt relief agency."
2009.08-1119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1768.209,1781.469,"What he -- what I think his argument is, as I understand it, is if you look at the definition of ""bankruptcy assistance"", you will see there are seven different things that a person could do and fall within that definition."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1833.069,1836.286,"Well, I -- I am happy to respond to it in further detail."
2009.08-1119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1846.828,1847.311,Why?
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1869.241,1871.443,"--That's right, Justice Breyer, and I think--"
2009.08-1119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1871.443,1874.645,"I have relatives who aren't, and you can bring one of them."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1874.645,1879.847,"--But appearing -- appearing in a case or proceeding under this title, Your Honor, means entering an appearance in court."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1960.396,1968.452,"So, if -- if -- if lawyers are debt relief agencies, I am curious how your limiting construction works."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1993.769,1995.969,--Well--
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1995.969,1999.756,Has that person violated -- has that lawyer violated the statute?
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1999.756,2001.706,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2007.491,2010.143,"Well, the person has asked, can I charge the trip to Tahiti?"
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2022.452,2028.439,"But the lawyer in your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, has not advised the client to take the trip; it has not advised the client to do that."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2028.439,2039.378,"He has communicated to the client that if he takes the trip, one, he will have a good time in Tahiti; and two, he will be using assets that would otherwise end up in the hands of the debtors."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2039.378,2058.792,"I suppose that, you know, there might be a fact question about whether a particular wink and nod communication between an attorney and client were in fact advice to engage in the transaction, that's prohibited under the Bankruptcy Code, the fraudulent or abusive transaction."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2058.792,2067.378,"What if -- what if the lawyer said: I can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy, but here's the Solicitor General's brief, read that."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2081.702,2097.461,"Well, if -- if that debtor reads our brief, that debtor will also see that there are serious consequences for the debtor himself, which is precisely why Congress passed this statute providing for relief for the debtor against the attorney who provides this unethical or abusive advice."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2109.185,2112.803,"Well, that's one of the things I'm concerned about your limiting construction, ""intending to defraud the debtor""."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2126.811,2133.298,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the Culver case, a -- a disciplinary case that we referred to in our brief, is a good illustration of this."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2142.07,2151.861,"So if -- so if the lawyer said that, I can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy, but I can tell you that fraud turns on the debtor's intent?"
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2151.861,2158.948,"--Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I don't think that that would be advice to incur the additional debt."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2180.445,2187.534,"No, but the whole point is that the attorney could be providing advice that would steer the debtor away from doing anything wrong."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2215.183,2231.044,"--I think, Your Honor, subject to some kind of situations of willful blindness, that the attorney in that situation would not be read by any factfinder to have advised a -- to have advised her client to incur additional debt in contemplation of bankruptcy."
2009.08-1119,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2234.413,2239.132,"Well, let's take some of the examples that were in the amicus brief."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2298.753,2303.222,I think the lawyer under a number of circumstances could say incur the debt.
2009.08-1119,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2304.657,2306.64,"Well, take this circumstance."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2316.965,2323.719,"--Well, if I may, Justice Ginsburg, the hypothetical doesn't state how she's going to borrow the money."
2009.08-1119,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.344,2343.344,Suppose she doesn't have a home equity loan.
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2344.796,2358.187,"--Well, the two -- the two scenarios that our view -- that in our view are covered by the statute are taking on debt in an attempt to abuse the bankruptcy system or to defraud the creditor."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2397.163,2407.685,"You can come up with your own hypotheticals that are a lot easier from your point of view, and Justice Ginsburg has been suggesting some that are much more difficult because they depend on particular facts."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2422.545,2427.182,"I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, and I'm certainly not attempting to fight Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical."
2009.08-1119,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2440.757,2454.082,Isn't something in contemplation of bankruptcy done only -- isn't something done in contemplation of bankruptcy only if it is done because of the anticipation of filing a bankruptcy petition?
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2470.358,2481.4,"I think that that's right, Justice Alito, that in that hypothetical there is no -- the mere -- the mere fact that the bankruptcy may be looming, even in the hypothetical, is not the animating cause."
2009.08-1119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2482.083,2493.457,"If indeed ""in contemplation of bankruptcy"" means, as -- as you argue, that it has to be for the purpose of abusing the Bankruptcy Code -- right?"
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2501.646,2502.546,--Well--
2009.08-1119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2502.546,2509.133,"So even without this statute, the lawyer would have to worry about -- about whether he's doing something that is unlawful."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2509.133,2515.554,"--The two prongs of -- of our reading of the statute, that's right, Justice Scalia, are to abuse the Bankruptcy Code or to -- or to defraud creditors."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2516.739,2517.489,But the point is you don't know.
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2542.973,2559.416,"--But precisely because, Mr. Chief Justice, the definition of fraud turns on the defendant or the fraudulent actor's intent, that's true under present law, under Rule 1.2(d) which prohibits all attorneys from counseling their clients to commit fraudulent acts."
2009.08-1119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2559.416,2563.202,"The lawyer runs that risk anyway, whether this statute applies or not."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2568.939,2570.707,Or an abuse of the Bankruptcy Code.
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2593.673,2600.743,This is a regulation of the attorney-client relationship to pursue an unrelated substantive objective.
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2615.169,2617.454,"--I don't think it's unrelated, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2624.842,2630.846,"Well, the objective is criminal; that doesn't mean it is not being indirectly enforced by interfering with the attorney-client relationship."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2630.846,2632.131,"--Well, it is certainly--"
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2632.131,2633.514,--or affecting the attorney-client relationship.
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2633.514,2637.266,"--It is certainly true, Mr. Chief Justice, that the attorney is the sophisticated player here."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2643.67,2649.058,"Yes, it's a good way to enforce it, to tell people you can't get legal advice about it."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2661.817,2666.102,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, seeking punitive damages is not illegal--"
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2666.102,2669.071,"Oh, if it's done with the purpose of fraud, it is."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2682.897,2691.086,"--Well, I think that the restriction that you're positing is that advice ever to seek punitive damages is -- is going to be--"
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2691.086,2691.336,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2696.554,2698.49,"--Well, no."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2729.276,2730.025,"No, no, no."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2756.757,2761.161,"--Well, here, I don't think -- I don't think it's an extraneous objective."
2009.08-1119,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2809.209,2827.437,"One thing that lawyers who render services for money want -- is to be sure that they will get paid, and one part of this provision, this 526(a)(4), talks about incurring debt to pay an attorney for representing the debtor."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2833.324,2839.495,"Well, I would like to note, if I may, Justice Ginsburg, that we don't think that that is properly part of this challenge."
2009.08-1119,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2907.687,2908.603,That's -- that's the clear case.
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2934.938,2944.961,"I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor, precisely because the attorney -- the attorney still hasn't issued the advice to incur more debt."
2009.08-1119,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2968.576,2969.492,Just one.
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2975.646,2998.761,"--To incur more debt to pay an attorney, I think -- I think that is the import of the statute, and that's because Congress recognized that there is an incentive for attorneys to put pressure on their clients to -- to favor the attorney as creditor, to, essentially, treat the attorney as a creditor in a better position than other creditors."
2009.08-1119,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2998.761,3000.945,Perhaps I am being -- not quite understanding you.
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3010.753,3022.042,"Well, in some of the examples that have come up in the briefing in this case -- you know, a refinancing transaction, for example -- you know, or a sale -- sale of the house and replacing it with a rental."
2009.08-1119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3023.827,3026.929,I don't how this works exactly.
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3040.804,3043.773,It's true that the court can authorize--
2009.08-1119,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3043.773,3045.791,"Well, so why is there some incentive here?"
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3049.659,3058.515,"--Precisely because, Justice Breyer, different standards apply to the -- to payments made to the attorney before the bankruptcy commences and payments made to the attorney after the bankruptcy commences."
2009.08-1119,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3133.013,3137.55,"But isn't it misleading for an attorney to say, I'm a -- I'm a debt relief agency?"
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3141.919,3142.636,Well--
2009.08-1119,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3142.636,3147.323,"A perspective client looks at that, and they say, well, I don't want a debt relief agency, I want a lawyer."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3147.323,3148.356,--Well--
2009.08-1119,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3148.356,3148.858,That's misleading.
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3148.858,3150.625,"--Four points on that, Justice Alito."
2009.08-1119,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3274.053,3280.759,How about a law firm that represents the biggest companies in the world?
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3314.48,3320.3,"Well, first, Justice Sotomayor, if, for example, they do it pro bono, then it wouldn't -- then it wouldn't trigger the definition at all."
2009.08-1119,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3324.936,3332.356,"So they have to -- for this one brother-in-law, they have to amend -- they're now violated the statute ex post facto somehow?"
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3332.356,3333.522,"--Not ex post facto, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-1119,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3350.698,3359.903,"If they're -- if they're, as the hypothetical suggests, representing only big companies, they're probably not advertising to the general public anyway."
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3359.903,3361.739,--That -- that may well be.
2009.08-1119,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3383.217,3392.239,"You said that one of the aspects of this that makes it horrible is that they are not limited to saying,"
2009.08-1119,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3415.419,3420.204,"--That is true, Justice Ginsburg, and there is of course the safe harbor."
2009.08-1119,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3438.016,3439.035,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3442.57,3443.67,Thank you.
2009.08-1119,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3535.559,3547.802,"What the attorney says is, Here's what we will do; when we file for bankruptcy, I will ask the Court to approve my own fees as something that is continuing after bankruptcy."
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3547.802,3548.335,Exactly.
2009.08-1119,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3548.335,3549.435,"And he says, This is what they will be."
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3550.301,3551.287,Because you can't--
2009.08-1119,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3551.287,3555.655,"--since that's what he has to do, of making him tell his client that that's what he has to do?"
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3555.655,3559.541,--Because you can't advise the client in advance to incur that debt.
2009.08-1119,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3559.541,3560.726,"No, you -- you can't?"
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3569.664,3571.181,"Well, that has to happen anyway under section--"
2009.08-1119,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3571.181,3572.2,Of course.
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3578.204,3583.758,"--Because there, in that situation, you would be advising the client to incur the debt."
2009.08-1119,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3587.376,3592.012,I don't read the hypothetical that you have given as coming within the statute.
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3602.22,3603.386,"Well, except debt--"
2009.08-1119,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3603.386,3605.838,Making himself an additional creditor.
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3606.521,3607.104,--But debt is--
2009.08-1119,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3607.104,3613.691,What it talks about is inducing the client to -- to borrow money from somebody else to pay the attorney.
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3616.627,3618.745,"--I think it includes both, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1119,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3622.364,3623.464,That's right.
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3623.464,3628.934,"And you couldn't -- and you also, I think, advise a client to basically borrow money from you, the attorney."
2009.08-1119,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3631.553,3635.505,"Why -- why would you worry about the attorney, you know, hurting himself?"
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3635.505,3637.088,Because the statute--
2009.08-1119,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3637.088,3638.188,It makes no sense.
2009.08-1119,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3638.188,3640.973,"--It's at least unclear, Justice Scalia, and that is the heart of the problem."
2009.08-1119,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3641.825,3643.992,"Thank you, Counsel."
