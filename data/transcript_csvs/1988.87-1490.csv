1988.87-1490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.237,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1490, John Mallard versus the United States District Court."
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,12.308,15.51,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,66.942,65.642,That's you.
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,68.06,68.544,--Yes--
1988.87-1490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,68.544,68.96,Yes.
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,68.96,69.494,--your Honor.
1988.87-1490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.327,196.693,I thought that--
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,209.301,211.52,"Yes, your Honor, that is correct."
1988.87-1490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.52,215.139,"And, in any event, the District Court found you were competent?"
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,215.139,216.074,Yes.
1988.87-1490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.346,229.214,"So, don't we take it as though you are in fact competent to do this work?"
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,229.214,230.333,"--Yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,230.333,230.75,Yes.
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,230.75,234.635,"As an objective matter, the District Court has so found."
1988.87-1490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.814,286.753,Does the court have authority to appoint someone to represent this indigent litigant?
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,286.753,297.793,"Your honor, the way I read 1915(d) the answer is... is yes, that the court has authority to request an attorney to become involved in the case."
1988.87-1490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.895,301.028,"Well, what if everyone in the district says no?"
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,305.799,316.522,"--Your honor, I believe that that is actually... probably the only point that I am aware of that is a possible grounds of merit on the Respondent's side."
1988.87-1490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,362.218,366.622,"Well, yeah, I think in my day it would have been unthinkable to tell the judge you wouldn't do it."
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,369.657,381.382,"Well, your Honor, I believe it's not quite that new, although I think my circumstances are more unusual in that I had a lot of discomfort with undertaking those responsibilities."
1988.87-1490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.391,401.343,"Well, you really haven't answered Justice O'Connor's question completely."
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,414.151,421.471,"Your Honor, I regret if there is any ambiguity in my response, but I think it's based upon the usage of the word appoint."
1988.87-1490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.58,441.484,But how about the authority to appoint someone like you who declined the request?
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,446.705,452.692,"--Your Honor, I do not believe that that authority exists or was granted by Congress under 1915(d)."
1988.87-1490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,452.692,454.728,"And this is a civil action, right?"
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,454.728,456.028,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.028,458.18,What if it were a criminal action?
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,458.18,463.499,"If it were a criminal action, I believe the court does possess the authority."
1988.87-1490,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,474.121,478.157,On the criminal side does it rest on the inherent power of the court?
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,480.509,482.044,"--Well, partially, your Honor."
1988.87-1490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,556.859,557.242,"Mr. Mallard,--"
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,557.242,557.725,--in accepting.
1988.87-1490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,557.725,559.861,--may I just be sure I understood something you said earlier.
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,566.816,567.749,"Thank you, your Honor."
1988.87-1490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,572.518,572.903,Well--
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,572.903,576.005,--to the extent there would be a constitutional right involved possibly--
1988.87-1490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,576.005,576.372,"--Well, the--"
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,576.372,577.072,--under the First Amendment.
1988.87-1490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.072,577.872,--defendant has a constitutional right.
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,589.48,603.09,"Well, I raise my constitutional objections only for the purpose that to the extent this Court found the plain meaning of 1915(d) to be unclear or ambiguous and upon looking--"
1988.87-1490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.09,606.692,You're merely arguing we should avoid the constitutional question by construing the statute in your favor?
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,607.224,607.675,--Yes.
1988.87-1490,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,607.675,611.095,--and you really don't think you have a constitutional claim on its own bottom?
1988.87-1490,0,31645,john_e_mallard,,611.095,619.951,"I think that there would be serious constitutional claims if the statute were construed in the manner that the Respondent suggests, that the word ""request"" should mean require."
1988.87-1490,1,24891,gordon_e_allen,,1347.291,1348.558,"That's correct, your honor."
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3054.255,3054.639,Yes.
1988.87-1490,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3065.097,3066.03,"Mr. Mallard, may I interrupt you?"
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3066.03,3066.563,--of this--
1988.87-1490,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.563,3068.182,"May I interrupt you, please?"
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3076.455,3076.905,--Nothing.
1988.87-1490,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3076.905,3077.305,--certiorari procedures?
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3077.305,3078.105,Nothing.
1988.87-1490,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3078.105,3081.157,Do you think you were competent to represent yourself in this case?
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3084.609,3085.094,Your honor--
1988.87-1490,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.094,3091.397,You had exactly the same experience for this assignment as you had for the one down there that you declined.
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3091.397,3094.749,"--Your honor, I believe the skills are substantially different."
1988.87-1490,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.92,3104.122,"You don't have... don't need any skills up here, but you need a lot of skills down there?"
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3104.788,3107.157,--Skills are required in both areas.
1988.87-1490,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.15,3124.5,Much harder--
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3124.5,3125.0,--confront witnesses--
1988.87-1490,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3125.0,3125.5,--to take a deposition?
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3126.536,3130.72,--witnesses and be able to elicit testimony before a Jury.
1988.87-1490,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3215.326,3216.943,Who was appointed under the English statute?
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3221.33,3243.561,"Your Honor, I cannot recall the distinction made, but some of the legal scholars who have worked in the area have suggested that the two types of lawyers, that the one was like a court employee or closer to the court, and that it was that class of attorneys who had to accept a court request."
1988.87-1490,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3243.561,3251.0,"The point is, if it was barristers, there would be no problem about a lawyer feeling himself... inexpert in the conduct of trials."
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3251.0,3252.951,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1490,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3280.519,3284.054,"You just don't like the statute, do you?"
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3284.054,3284.571,"--No, your Honor."
1988.87-1490,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3299.163,3299.647,You agree--
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3299.647,3300.099,--capable of providing.
1988.87-1490,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3300.099,3302.199,--with the statute that it gives you your freedom.
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3302.199,3303.634,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1490,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3303.634,3306.936,And your freedom is to tell the court no.
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3306.936,3308.955,"Yes, that's the way I read 1915(d)."
1988.87-1490,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3308.955,3309.888,And that's all?
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3309.888,3310.455,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1490,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3310.455,3311.321,That's all you want?
1988.87-1490,2,31645,john_e_mallard,,3311.321,3313.657,Yes.
1988.87-1490,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3317.442,3318.225,"Very well, Mr. Mallard."
