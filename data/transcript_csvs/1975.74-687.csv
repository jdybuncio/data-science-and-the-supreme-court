1975.74-687,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.914,"We will hear arguments next in 74-687, United States against Moore."
1975.74-687,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,39.659,42.922,Mr. Chief Justice may I please the Court.
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,1408.431,1413.381,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1545.01,1547.573,(Inaudible)
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,1547.573,1559.501,"Well, yes sir, it does because it has a bearing on it in my view because the second factor that I think is important is the matter of fairness to all creditors."
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1583.125,1593.809,Would not your theses put a burden on the government to make a careful inquiry into the potential solvency of everyone of its contractors --
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,1593.809,1594.197,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1597.436,1612.194,"(Voice Overlap) on their own, but -- and that means that it has got to affect their priorities, the government is going to probably disfavor the great many contractors who need the business, are they not?"
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,1612.194,1651.101,"That was one of the disputes that arose in this particular case, Your Honor, not this trial, but at the trial of the Navy’s claim because the company argued that there was a misunderstanding between the government and the company at that time and that the company was not really financially able to perform this contract and the government was required to make a determination that it was and there was just some confusion in that and the company thought it was, but a wrong standard was applied and it should never been awarded this contract in the first place."
1975.74-687,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1826.184,1828.602,There was a little difference in Massachusetts case.
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,1831.104,1831.979,"I beg your pardon, Sir."
1975.74-687,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1831.979,1835.12,In the Massachusetts case they were disputing the liability?
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,1835.12,1836.023,That is correct.
1975.74-687,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1836.023,1838.137,In this case there is no dispute here?
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,1838.137,1844.635,"Well, there is no dispute as to the liability, only to the whether it was a debt that time."
1975.74-687,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1844.635,1846.0,But not (Inaudible)?
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,1846.0,1849.073,"Yes sir, not mail."
1975.74-687,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1860.594,1863.705,Only one judge on the Fifth Circuit followed that theory?
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,1863.705,1866.117,Yes sir.
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1948.308,1955.434,Do you think that statement was necessary to the holding in that case or was it just a side observation by way of the dictum?
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,1955.434,1970.241,"Well, when I first got involved in this, I thought it was just dicta but then as I become more closely acquainted with the case, I think that that was an integral part of the holding or at least an integral part of an alternative reasoning because the --"
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1970.241,1981.069,"Does not the taking of this part of the holding mandate, now does not it refer to the maturity and obligation in the conjunctive?"
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,1985.551,2005.719,"Well, I think that the focus of the inquiry that was indicated in Massachusetts was that you look at the time that the events, at the time of the insolvency and if you have to look to subsequent events, contingent advances as cause them in that language, then it was not, it would not be at debt due in the Common Law."
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2005.719,2017.335,"The contingency that the Court was referring to in that language you rely on, has both elements, maturity and obligation, does it not?"
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,2017.335,2018.999,"That is correct, yes sir."
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2018.999,2019.842,There is not.
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,2021.929,2022.266,"Well, there is no --"
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2022.266,2024.557,There is no doubt about the obligation?
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,2024.572,2026.09,That is correct.
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2176.748,2181.548,Would you have settle though as to (Inaudible) of the tax payers testing the --
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,2181.548,2192.543,Yes sir because the events that have generated the tax have happened at the time of the particular insolvency.
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2196.058,2204.784,(Voice Overlap) the events which is precipitated the liability here all happened before the insolvency?
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,2204.784,2205.413,Yes sir.
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2205.413,2208.274,It is just the amount that is not actually determined.
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,2210.084,2214.906,"Well the tax case, at the time of the insolvency, you have got all the facts you need."
1975.74-687,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2236.808,2248.881,"Well, does that exclude all contractual type claims supposing that there is a promise to deliver the Government a thousand bricks and that promise is breached, so that you have a clear breach."
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,2274.188,2279.231,"Well, I do not think that it would be a debt due because you still have to look to the subsequent event."
1975.74-687,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2279.231,2281.441,What is the subsequent event?
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,2281.441,2283.143,Proving up what the damages were.
1975.74-687,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2283.143,2301.697,"Well, then you say, even though the testimony of the proof talked about events that had occurred prior to the breach, the mere fact that the proceeding took place after the breach is enough to take it out of the debt classification?"
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,2301.697,2303.859,"No, sir."
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2456.57,2458.508,How can we speculate about that?
1975.74-687,1,42827,thomas_osa_harris,,2465.905,2477.143,"In the instant case there is some evidence in the record that at least there in respect to the Navy’s contract, the contract was re-let to the second bid."
1975.74-687,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2754.946,2758.521,Do you have anything further Mrs. Shapiro?
1975.74-687,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2758.521,2759.785,"Two points, sir."
1975.74-687,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2864.058,2865.788,"Thank you, Mrs. Shapiro."
