1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.817,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-6732, Chaffin against Stynchcombe."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,33.519,36.672,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,187.193,190.177,To give that instruction that you requested --
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,190.177,190.463,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,190.463,196.168,"-- as part of the trial before they had reached a verdict, it might have been quite a hazardous business."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,204.315,205.441,"Well, now let me say this, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,205.441,210.541,"In any event, you covered that by making the motion again later?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,210.541,212.19,"Let me clear that a little bit, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,248.797,250.465,What is the charge he gave that the dismiss the --
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,250.465,253.553,He just -- the standard sentence of life or death.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,253.553,255.136,"That mean -- now, he charges the jury."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,259.684,260.3,Drop to death.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,260.3,260.692,I see.
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,260.692,262.223,"In fact, he charged death."
1972.71-6732,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,291.539,296.01,"Well, didn’t the Greene case intervened and solved that problem?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,296.01,303.981,"Well, there’s been the Greene case, but that deals with now -- with conviction with the crime itself, we're talking about punishment."
1972.71-6732,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,429.545,441.856,And you think we should cut loose from the limitations imposed in Pearce that the rule was aimed that at averting the possibility of vindictiveness?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,441.856,444.687,"We have -- I think we have a more subtle vindictiveness, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,445.809,455.723,"What you are saying, we should just simply say that the chances of a higher penalty deters the right to appeal?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,455.723,456.266,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,456.266,457.798,And that’s the end of it?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,457.798,459.579,"Well, it’s like playing Russian roulette with the man’s freedom."
1972.71-6732,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,459.579,460.938,"Well, you say your answer is yes?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,460.938,462.16,Yes.
1972.71-6732,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,463.204,465.094,"In Pearce, isn’t it?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,465.094,468.129,"Well, I -- no -- the way of a different problem in Pearce."
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,474.22,477.499,"No, but the rule as stated in Pearce was certainly not the one that is yours?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,477.499,481.539,"That’s correct, but there are words in Pearce that I could certainly use."
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,481.539,482.796,That wasn't our holding in Pearce --
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,482.796,483.609,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,484.822,488.293,"In almost any case that you can use for some other case, can’t you?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,488.293,489.044,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,522.4,540.505,"Isn’t there another aspect of Russian roulette as you put it that if this argument, an approach, your approach should prevail, you put a premium on every trial judge to give the maximum sentence on every case so that this can’t happen?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,540.505,542.285,"That’s a possibility, Your Honor, there is no question about that."
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,542.285,549.388,"Isn't it more than a possibility, isn’t it a real probability over which some public defenders are somewhat concerned?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,549.388,556.955,"Yes Your Honor, but I would hope judges in their fairness and honesty, compassion will set a sentence that’s in line with the crime."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.56,567.825,"Well, on that basis its an argument for permitting the sentence to be increased later."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,570.616,570.982,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.982,581.814,"It's supposed to max the penalty of the crime you say and so the questions should be, not whether its higher or lower than the first time, but whether on its own basis is alright?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,581.814,586.977,"But you raise the proposition that what is the state's interested in increased penalty though, what is the policy, why should the state introduce this punishment?"
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.977,590.714,"You just stated it, you just stated it."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,590.714,592.379,"I said, they have very little if any compelling reason --"
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.379,597.364,"No, you just stated that the sentencing should be rational."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,597.364,597.469,Yes.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.469,599.466,It should be based on facts of the case.
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,599.466,600.308,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.308,606.816,So your question should consider the sentence at the second trial on its own two feet without regarding to the person.
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,606.816,616.151,"Well, but of course then you place -- the man is going to appeal his first conviction, is he not, and then he won't appeal it because he is afraid of an increase sentence, if he in particularly got a low sentence the first time."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.151,621.55,"And by the way Jackson just set aside the sentence, not the conviction."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,621.55,625.246,"That’s correct, or in this is to reduce the sentence, I am not asking you to set aside the conviction."
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,625.246,630.063,Are you going to try to bring this case within the principle stated in Pearce?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,630.063,639.937,"Well, there are words in Pearce that are very helpful to this case about the right to extra due process, the right to appeal, that you shouldn’t be worried about getting an increased sentence."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.421,643.153,Did the jury know anything about the first trial?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,643.153,644.351,"No, they did not."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.372,647.529,Is there any possibility of vindictiveness?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,647.529,649.174,"No, there is none, obviously none."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.174,650.067,Why not?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,650.067,651.497,Because the jury did not know the first sentence.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.497,658.516,I know but -- in Georgia does it make any difference how the prosecutor goes for it?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,662.583,665.765,"In the sentence increase at the trial, he argues for a greater sentence to the jury."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.178,669.079,"Does that have ever any effect, do you suppose?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,669.079,670.169,"I’m sure, it does occasionally."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.083,675.369,"And the judge knows about it, doesn’t he?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,675.369,676.332,Yes.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.556,680.99,"Well, how about the prosecutor, was he same?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,680.99,682.074,I think the prosecutor is different.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.465,683.665,"But in the file, it is the same."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,685.282,685.86,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,685.86,686.591,Except the jury.
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,686.591,687.343,Except the jury.
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,688.404,693.29,Did I understand you to say that this man was tried before the bifurcated --
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,693.29,694.038,Before.
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,694.038,694.516,-- trial.
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,696.222,697.161,All at once.
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,697.161,704.38,So that prosecutor is considerably more inhibited in a single trial than he is in a bifurcated trial when they come to the sentence.
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,704.38,706.926,That’s correct and bifurcated to present more evidences as to sentence.
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,710.227,712.714,Did the prosecution go for the death in the first trial?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,712.714,713.943,"No, they didn’t."
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,722.058,728.686,I would think you might argue that Pearce on its face would apply to a situation like this?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,728.686,729.785,There was no question.
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,809.594,817.718,"I don’t find in the appendix, the closing argument of the prosecutor to the jury in this case, was it recorded?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,817.718,818.753,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,820.121,821.252,They did the full transcript of it?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,821.252,824.065,"No, there was no record made in this case and let me explain why."
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,832.365,837.566,"Is there a transcript of the state court trial, extend anywhere."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,839.267,840.217,"Yes, on both trials."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.729,843.608,You have the final arguments recorded in Georgia?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,843.608,844.746,They normally are.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.152,849.583,They may have been transcribed?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,849.583,849.923,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.027,858.197,"Who would you ask to find that out, you?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,858.197,863.511,"Well, I could check with the clerk of the both Superior Court and send the records up if the Court wanted them or get them send up?"
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,863.511,866.806,Or you are colleague on the other side may?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,866.806,868.684,They were recorded in the court both transfers.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.527,872.932,You don't know whether the closing argument?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,872.932,873.68,I do not.
1972.71-6732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,874.279,882.458,"Is it possible that closing argument might have been transcribed, but are rather taken down by the reporter, but not transcribed because neither party designated it?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,882.458,883.733,"Possibly, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,902.098,903.932,You don't remember whether he did the first time?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,903.932,906.04,"No, I didn’t try the first case."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.656,914.916,How about the first trial?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,918.043,920.401,"Of the trial, but I don’t know of the final argument, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,920.401,924.078,"The same, so in comparison you (Inaudible) to have both trials?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,924.078,925.299,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,943.267,944.86,(Inaudible) go for it.
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,944.86,946.154,The death penalty in the second trial.
1972.71-6732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,946.154,947.523,As he asked the jury to impose?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,947.523,948.329,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,956.423,964.446,"The state frequently asks for more than it thinks it can get or perhaps more, doesn’t it, on a penalty phase?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,964.446,966.377,"Yes, Your Honor, very definitely."
1972.71-6732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,969.736,979.922,"Well, supposing the prosecuting attorney thought that the 15-year sentence awarded at the end of first trial was a very just and proper one, and he wanted to get just that again."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,988.627,989.868,"Yes, absolutely correct."
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,989.868,993.546,Isn’t that the essence of the adversary system?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,993.546,995.398,"Here’s my answer to that, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.431,1018.317,"But is this a -- you mean 43 of the 50, that’s the counting them after Pearce?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1018.317,1022.672,"No, no, only seven states, the jury sets the sentence."
1972.71-6732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1051.529,1053.439,You said there are only seven states where --
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1053.439,1054.133,The jury sets it.
1972.71-6732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1054.133,1054.925,-- the jury sets the sentence?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1054.925,1057.922,That’s correct and they are all against me.
1972.71-6732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1057.922,1058.511,On this issue?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1058.511,1058.887,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1058.887,1060.766,And they have all decided this issue?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1060.766,1061.033,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.338,1096.139,Unless you are wrong inside?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1096.139,1096.784,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1096.784,1097.806,"It doesn’t help you here, does it?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1097.806,1099.353,"No, it doesn’t, it sure doesn’t."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.734,1183.532,"You can’t, of course, you can’t claim that -- that the evil you want to cure was felt by your plan."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1187.735,1189.312,"Well, if he had to go over again I’m sure he would want to."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.312,1193.298,Are you talking about safeguarding the right of somebody else?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1193.298,1194.136,"Well, I’m asking this Court--"
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.136,1196.597,The way you put it.
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1206.747,1213.477,"No, you can correct this -- Mr. Chaffin -- you can reduce the sentence to 15 years or I think under Georgia procedures, if you did they keep the sentence."
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.477,1216.593,"But only not to help him, but to help somebody else?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1216.593,1217.789,We’ll certainly to help him.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.789,1224.885,"Oh, yes but the only the reason you’re doing it is to make sure that somebody else’s rights to appeal weren't deterred because yours weren’t."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1230.975,1231.838,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.704,1247.823,"So that the way you put it, you’re going to have to make the argument that he was punished for it and you didn’t make that argument in your brief?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1247.823,1249.501,I am making it now --
1972.71-6732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1249.501,1250.257,Now after --
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1250.257,1254.503,-- and I clearly state in my brief that he was punished and he did get an increased sentence.
1972.71-6732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.503,1260.324,You say this punishment connotes some sort of intentional vindictiveness when you used the word?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1260.324,1266.937,"Well, I think it’s a scheme by the state certainly to go for, in this case death penalty maybe what if they didn't get this one for life."
1972.71-6732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1266.937,1267.472,Oh okay.
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1276.279,1277.774,"I didn’t get a chance, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1287.675,1289.186,"You mean, you haven’t a hearing?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1289.186,1290.449,"Did not have a hearing, that’s correct."
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1290.449,1292.343,"And if you did, what would you offer?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1292.343,1300.213,"I would offer the two trial transcripts to show that the trials were exactly the same not as the Fifth Circuit seems to say, there were exactly the same evidence."
1972.71-6732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1303.105,1305.886,What was that you alleged in your habeas corpus petition?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1305.886,1309.166,Based and relied on Pearce that he was punished for his right of appeal.
1972.71-6732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1309.166,1314.405,Did you allege that there were some sort of intentionally vindictive conduct on the part of the state?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1314.405,1316.296,"Well, I alleged vindictiveness by the state, yes."
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1321.365,1335.478,"You made the point a moment ago that if your client had to do it over again, he wouldn’t do it and you seem to rest something on that as something wrong in the system of justice."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1354.472,1364.985,"That -- that is -- plea negotiation, Your Honor is apparently been upheld by this Court I think in Alfred versus North Carolina, you upheld even the man seems innocent, you have the plea."
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1368.264,1387.94,"Well, but is there something wrong with that when he has made a conscious choice with advice of counsel or perhaps against the advice of this counsel to reject a guilty plea and five-year sentence and then he goes to trial and runs out and gets 15, something wrong with that?"
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1387.94,1389.729,It certainly bothers me because the man should exercised --
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.729,1396.457,It sure bothers the defendant when he has made that choice but I am talking about the principle now?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1396.457,1401.872,"I don’t accept that principle because it does punish for you saying, I am saying my rights to have a jury trial, is that right?"
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1421.711,1424.857,Well your approach would stop all plea negotiations entirely --
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1424.857,1427.784,That’s the problem that the other side of the coin.
1972.71-6732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1460.773,1474.822,"Mr. Zell, I'm looking at pages 4 and 5 of the appendix which is your petition for writ of habeas corpus."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1492.949,1505.363,"Well page 5, paragraph 7, that the entire retrial was void and illegal since the jury was qualified in death sentence and several juries were excluded and the state argued the death penalty and the trial judge charged on a law of capital punishment to the jury."
1972.71-6732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1506.073,1508.57,That’s the extent of the allegation of vindictiveness?
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1508.57,1509.832,I think it would be a reasonable--
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1509.832,1518.902,"What about in paragraph 5, the second Clause that they increased his sentence without any legitimate reason penalizing his petition for appealing his first conviction."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1518.902,1522.288,And I site Griffin and Douglas which is of course your case in avenues of appeal.
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1526.49,1535.999,"I notice you also, in paragraph two allege that at the first trial, the jury was qualified to a death penalty with the trial judge did charge on the law of capital punishment."
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1535.999,1536.656,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1541.654,1542.539,Issue perhaps they did.
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1542.539,1543.381,Yes Your Honor.
1972.71-6732,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1543.814,1544.337,Your times is up.
1972.71-6732,0,26354,glenn_zell,,1544.337,1548.49,That’s right.
1972.71-6732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1548.49,1551.963,"Very well, Mr. Zell."
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1553.531,1556.274,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.252,1637.308,What were the odds in Georgia that the jury would or do you know?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1645.744,1648.721,"Well, we don’t ask for it, it's on the statute books."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.721,1649.709,"Well, that’s what I mean --"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1649.709,1652.93,I mean he does know -- it's not up to us to decide.
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1652.93,1656.621,"The prosecuting attorney says something about it, doesn’t he?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1656.621,1657.675,"Well, he can yes."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.675,1660.427,"Well, he can but sometimes he doesn’t?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1660.427,1661.33,Sometimes he doesn’t.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1661.33,1667.485,"Does he say, “No, I don’t think for a moment that the death is appropriate in this case?”"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1667.485,1671.423,"Well, what I have said in myself many times when the death penalty was in exist --"
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.423,1673.112,"Well, you are not asking for it?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1673.112,1676.76,"I would say, “Well, we’ve waive the death penalty but we are not to waive anything else."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.76,1677.172,Yes.
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1681.088,1682.027,"Yes, that’s correct."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.027,1688.326,And what about -- in your experience does a jury ever give that prosecution that was --
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1688.326,1690.398,They never given it when I was trying the case.
1972.71-6732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1690.398,1690.965,Well tell me --
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1690.965,1692.318,Whether you ask for it or not?
1972.71-6732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1692.318,1692.934,Right.
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1692.934,1693.859,Yes.
1972.71-6732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1693.859,1699.849,"When you say, we are waiving the death penalty what’s the nature of the instruction that the trial judge sentenced this --"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1699.849,1702.009,"Well, just doesn’t charge on death."
1972.71-6732,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1702.009,1702.578,Well now here --
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.578,1703.513,He doesn’t?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1703.513,1703.942,No.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.942,1705.79,If you do not go for it if you don’t ask for it --
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1705.79,1707.158,"That’s in my experience, right."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.158,1707.931,What?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1707.931,1709.49,That’s been my experience.
1972.71-6732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1709.49,1727.844,Well then if assuming this allegations in paragraphs 2 and 5 --2 and 7 of this petition for habeas are true well then it would appear that the prosecutor must have asked for the death penalty since the trial judge charged him in the both trials on the death penalty?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1727.844,1729.454,"Well, it would appear from that."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.397,1738.892,"Well, the instructions are?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1738.892,1739.68,"The instruction, yes."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1739.68,1744.201,"Now, did the judge instruct for the death penalty in the first trial?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1744.201,1744.876,I don’t know.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.876,1745.731,"So, it is alleged here."
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1745.731,1746.94,Or the allegation he did?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1746.94,1747.468,"Right, Your Honor."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.468,1750.167,Or if he did then the prosecution must have asked for it?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1750.167,1750.975,Yes.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.975,1753.041,In both trials?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1753.041,1754.034,And not necessarily.
1972.71-6732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1757.287,1762.093,"Oh, you mean not addressed it at all (Voice Overlapping) closing, I see."
1972.71-6732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.093,1769.639,"If the prosecution doesn’t expressly waive, but doesn’t expressly argue, then does the trial judge charge on him?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1769.639,1772.461,They will normally charge him anyway.
1972.71-6732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1772.461,1775.65,And he did charge life imprisonment?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1775.65,1779.259,"For robbery he was charged with death, life or up one to twenty."
1972.71-6732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.259,1781.915,That’s what – I am talking about the second charge?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1781.915,1785.999,"He charged death, he also charged life and he charged 120 on both trials."
1972.71-6732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1785.999,1796.475,What would be your objection to him saying that in this particular case the heavier sentence you can give is 15 years?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1796.475,1801.01,"Well, I think the problem with that is then the jury says well, that’s the top."
1972.71-6732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1811.184,1818.271,"Well, if Pearce means what the petitioner here says that is a top?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1818.271,1820.633,"Well if there’s vindictiveness, that’s way I read Pearce."
1972.71-6732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1820.633,1827.533,"Yes, it wasn’t on me so that, he could then say 15 as the most you can get?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1827.533,1829.763,He could say that --
1972.71-6732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1829.763,1839.112,"Tell me Mr. Hicks, may a trial judge when the jury brings in life as in this case, say well no I'll cut that back to 30 years or 15 or something?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1839.112,1844.262,"No, he can’t do it on the life or death charge but he could on a less sentence."
1972.71-6732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1844.262,1850.965,"That is if they brought in 20 years by the jury he could cut it down to 10, but he can’t cut on the life and death."
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1850.965,1852.255,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1853.704,1856.234,Yes.
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1856.234,1865.329,You understand that the instructions of the trial judge to the jury in the second trial are available?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1865.329,1865.557,Yes.
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1865.557,1867.566,Have were -- have been transcribed and are available?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1867.566,1868.833,Yes.
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1868.833,1870.893,Would you have any objection to its submitting them to the Court?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1870.893,1871.398,No sir.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.119,1874.586,On both trials?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1874.586,1875.028,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1875.028,1884.726,Alright and did I further understand that the arguments to the jury at least by the prosecutor are non-available or couldn’t be made available?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1884.726,1886.694,They were not transcribed.
1972.71-6732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1890.978,1892.313,Would a jury can agree on that?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1892.313,1893.56,"Yes, that’d be good."
1972.71-6732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1893.56,1896.656,"Well, perhaps the other materials with the clerk?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1896.656,1897.126,Yes.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.126,1899.257,"But you were in the trial of the case, I take it?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1899.257,1901.859,"No, not that case --"
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.859,1910.903,"So, you don’t know what the prosecutor -- what the posture of the prosecution was in either trial with regard to the death penalty?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1910.903,1914.255,"Well, I do know of the record --"
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1914.255,1918.978,"Well, you do know that at least the prosecution didn’t waive it?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1918.978,1919.643,He didn’t waive --
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.643,1924.088,-- in the second trial or the judge wouldn’t have instructed on it?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1924.088,1924.788,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.788,1926.674,And he didn’t waive it in the first trial?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1926.674,1927.86,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1927.86,1930.46,"Well, you don’t know that?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1930.46,1933.575,If I know he instructed it because I have the instructions.
1972.71-6732,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1933.575,1937.213,But you don’t know whether if the prosecutor addressed the jury in either instance as to death?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1937.213,1937.774,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.388,1947.615,How about the first?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1947.615,1954.084,"Both, the facts in the case, it’s a horrible case, and he asked for it in both cases because of a horribleness of the case."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.084,1956.781,"I see, I see."
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1956.781,1964.711,"And then there was a proffered instruction in the second trial like counsel for the defense, was there not?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1969.884,1971.141,When he says I assume that’s true.
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1971.141,1975.132,"Well, would that be a matter of record also?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1975.132,1977.205,"I don’t remember reading it myself, so I can't say--"
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1977.205,1982.802,"If that is -- for the record, could you submit to that with fellow counsel?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1982.802,1984.975,Okay.
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1985.721,1987.998,Proper instruction and what the court said about it?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1987.998,1988.807,Yes sir.
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1988.807,1990.237,In the second trial?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1990.237,1990.63,Yes sir.
1972.71-6732,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1990.63,1993.21,Thanks.
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,1993.21,2008.94,The appellant here seems to be very concerned with the chilling effect of the possibility of a higher sentence on the appeal but I think he is over estimating this chilling effect.
1972.71-6732,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2141.422,2147.527,Or that do you agree with Mr. Zell that the records are practically identical?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2147.527,2150.315,"No, I don’t."
1972.71-6732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2225.11,2228.672,Do you know the explanation for that rather remarkable coincidence?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2228.672,2230.338,It is remarkable.
1972.71-6732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2308.366,2310.687,There’ll be reasonable grounds for surprise --
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2310.687,2311.155,Yes sir.
1972.71-6732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2311.155,2313.479,Under circumstances --[Attempt to Laughter]
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2313.479,2332.317,"So, for that reason, even if we are talking about the Pearce pure vindictiveness rule under the judge theory then, we think there’s reasonable grounds to see that there were some different evidence before this jury to give more time than the first time around."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2350.157,2357.483,On that basis you would say it wouldn't make a difference I suppose if the jury knew about for previous conviction and sentence or not?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2357.483,2361.315,"Well, if they knew it, it would perhaps make a difference."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.397,2367.103,"No one, I know of."
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2373.57,2374.161,That’s correct.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.161,2375.129,Was it here?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2375.129,2376.602,It was used here as a matter of fact.
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.602,2379.188,"So, they must have known then there was previous trial?"
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2379.188,2383.175,"Yes and they knew there was previous trial, but not of the previous conviction or what the previous sentence was."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.175,2395.217,"Well, how are the odds that really -- if there was a previous trial that was either a conviction -- the odds are that there was a conviction that was set aside or it wouldn’t be a second trial because of double jeopardy."
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2395.217,2397.059,I wouldn’t agree with that.
1972.71-6732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2399.78,2400.157,A mistrial --
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2400.157,2403.388,"Many more mistrials and reversals and retrials, I'll say that."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2403.388,2407.716,"So, the jury would be confused as to what is actually happening."
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2408.088,2409.736,"Perhaps they would be, yes."
1972.71-6732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.736,2414.648,At least you couldn't have referred to the jury (Inaudible) been convicted and move to set aside his trial?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2414.648,2416.052,"I don’t think you could, no sir."
1972.71-6732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2416.052,2422.792,Or if they knew that to -- would it be likely that they knew the precise sentence that had resulted?
1972.71-6732,1,39522,richard_e_hicks,,2422.792,2433.599,"It would -- that certainly would not be admissible in Georgia, to say what his prior sentence was and they just wouldn't know that unless it was highly publicized crime or something then they might know."
1972.71-6732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2464.553,2466.53,You have a few minutes left.
1972.71-6732,2,26354,glenn_zell,,2467.139,2474.991,Let me just say this up on my defense is a fairly pitch quite a bit from doctors and so the witness.
1972.71-6732,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2523.14,2530.022,"Anyway, I don’t remember from the record here was the defendant charged with kidnapping as well as assault and --"
1972.71-6732,2,26354,glenn_zell,,2530.022,2533.038,"They charged him with many, many other crimes in other counties."
1972.71-6732,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2541.028,2543.219,On this victim or other victim?
1972.71-6732,2,26354,glenn_zell,,2543.219,2550.019,"No, this victim and I think they were disposed of either by concurring sentence of few years or dismissed."
1972.71-6732,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2574.153,2584.723,"Mr. Zell, you came here at our request and by appointment of the Court and on behalf of the Court, I want to thank you for you assistance not only to your client but to your assistance to the Court."
1972.71-6732,2,26354,glenn_zell,,2584.723,2585.973,Thank you.
1972.71-6732,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2585.973,2586.588,Thank you gentlemen.
