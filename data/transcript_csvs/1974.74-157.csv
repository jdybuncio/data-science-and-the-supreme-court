1974.74-157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,25.49,"We'll hear arguments next in 74-157, United Housing Foundation against Forman and consolidated case, State of New York against Forman."
1974.74-157,0,41958,simon_h_rifkind,,25.49,28.564,Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.74-157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,28.564,44.804,Defer just a moment Mr. Rifkind.
1974.74-157,0,41958,simon_h_rifkind,,44.963,47.784,And may it please the Court.
1974.74-157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,771.345,776.414,What were the criteria for approval by the state authorities in addition to the income levels of the applicants?
1974.74-157,0,41958,simon_h_rifkind,,776.414,783.771,"There were benefits conferred upon the aged, upon veterans, upon the disabled and things of that kind."
1974.74-157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,785.782,787.178,By regulation or statute?
1974.74-157,0,41958,simon_h_rifkind,,787.178,793.67,By the practices of the regulatory agency and under its regulations.
1974.74-157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1345.613,1354.309,Very well.
1974.74-157,1,20671,daniel_m_cohen,,1355.37,1356.62,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1525.406,1534.107,"Mr. Cohen if we should decide that -- if we should be persuaded by Judge Rifkind's arguments, would we get to your point?"
1974.74-157,1,20671,daniel_m_cohen,,1534.107,1535.772,I don't think you need to.
1974.74-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1545.087,1549.841,"And really if Judge Rifkind is correct, there's no federal jurisdiction, is that correct?"
1974.74-157,1,20671,daniel_m_cohen,,1549.841,1551.183,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1551.183,1561.126,"And there being no federal jurisdiction, the Eleventh Amendment argument falls out of the case, because after all the Eleventh Amendment is a jurisdictional statute, is it not?"
1974.74-157,1,20671,daniel_m_cohen,,1561.126,1561.849,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1561.849,1562.84,Having to do with federal court is it?
1974.74-157,1,20671,daniel_m_cohen,,1562.84,1565.934,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1580.052,1590.854,"One part of the, well one count of the complaint though was posited not on Securities Act jurisdiction but on Section 1343, wasn't it, which was derived in from 1983?"
1974.74-157,1,20671,daniel_m_cohen,,1590.854,1599.94,"Yes, the one cause of action directed against the State Housing Finance Agency is so posited."
1974.74-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1847.657,1848.894,For the regulator it was --
1974.74-157,1,20671,daniel_m_cohen,,1848.894,1849.366,Pardon?
1974.74-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1849.366,1851.77,"It was a great financial backer as well, was it not?"
1974.74-157,1,20671,daniel_m_cohen,,1851.77,1859.47,It was a financial backer and it derived no financial benefit from its financial backing.
1974.74-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1884.273,1885.75,No monetary profit?
1974.74-157,1,20671,daniel_m_cohen,,1885.75,1887.04,No monetary profit.
1974.74-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1887.04,1887.993,Just social profit.
1974.74-157,1,20671,daniel_m_cohen,,1887.993,1891.689,"Social profit, yes Your Honor."
1974.74-157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1925.668,1928.771,Very well Mr. Cohen.
1974.74-157,2,34896,louis_nizer,,1929.815,1935.992,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2099.674,2104.203,"Well Mr. Nizer, in Tcherepnin that didn't accord just a later case than Joiner."
1974.74-157,2,34896,louis_nizer,,2108.568,2112.956,"Sure, and I will discuss that in full Your Honor, in a moment."
1974.74-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2125.254,2141.356,"Well the language I'm thinking of is this language on page 336 where they say “Finally, we are reminded that in searching for the meaning and scope of the word security in the Act, form should be disregarded for substance and the emphasis should be on economic reality.”"
1974.74-157,2,34896,louis_nizer,,2144.086,2154.674,"Yes, and I think that the economic reality is here as I shall soon develop clearly indicate that this is a stock transaction, on its face and on the economic realities."
1974.74-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2169.416,2171.745,That was the Supreme Court California decision.
1974.74-157,2,34896,louis_nizer,,2171.745,2171.888,That's right.
1974.74-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2171.888,2173.123,That's not from this Court.
1974.74-157,2,34896,louis_nizer,,2174.57,2179.852,"No I said that the Sobieski case, I was mistaken in referring it to this Court."
1974.74-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2189.051,2190.863,"Yes, interpreting of state law."
1974.74-157,2,34896,louis_nizer,,2190.863,2192.203,That's right.
1974.74-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2924.455,2932.527,They had be sued under 1983 as well as under the Securities law in view of cases like Monroe against Pape --
1974.74-157,2,34896,louis_nizer,,2932.527,2932.706,Yes.
1974.74-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2932.706,2934.064,-- and Bruno against Kenosha?
1974.74-157,2,34896,louis_nizer,,2934.064,2935.538,"Yes, I think it can be."
1974.74-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2935.538,2938.608,Why?
1974.74-157,2,34896,louis_nizer,,2938.608,2962.799,"An agency is a person and under the interpretation that the -- this Court has given to the Securities Act, a definition of person includes state, governmental agency of any kind."
1974.74-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2962.799,2973.533,Well I would've thought that 1983 cost of action would've turned on the definition of person in 1983 rather than in the Securities Act.
1974.74-157,2,34896,louis_nizer,,2973.533,2979.654,"Well, it's a person under a Civil Rights Act as a I suppose the other aspect of the question."
1974.74-157,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3569.779,3572.77,Mr. Gonson.
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3572.77,3577.236,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-157,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3631.708,3633.582,"You couldn't have one without the other, could you?"
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3633.582,3634.644,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-157,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3701.928,3706.802,"The stock has certain attributes, and I assume we're not talking about livestock."
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3708.544,3708.959,Yes sir.
1974.74-157,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3711.385,3718.891,And those attributes generally are the possibility of dividends if the corporation has profits.
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3744.482,3745.188,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-157,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3747.581,3750.064,Well your point was stock has certain attributes.
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3750.064,3750.275,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-157,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3750.275,3755.153,"Now which of those attributes does this stock, this so-called stock have?"
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3783.865,3785.528,Wait just a minute.
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3790.855,3797.285,Well the Mitchell-Lama Act provides that limited profit housing corporations may issue dividends.
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3797.285,3803.698,But does that -- does this corporation come under that provision of that Act?
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3803.698,3809.493,"It is my understanding, Your Honor that it does."
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3818.862,3825.862,Did either one of the courts below recognized the possibility of dividends under that Section or any other Section?
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3825.862,3827.485,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3883.113,3894.047,The Court of Appeals as I read their opinion stated that there were expectations on income in three ways.
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3900.739,3906.1,"Yes, the Court of Appeals I believe spoke of surplus income, Your Honor."
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3914.658,3919.993,Do you understand that those dividends would be paid in cash or --
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3919.993,3920.141,They presumably --
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3920.141,3922.767,-- do people own these shares?
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3922.767,3925.493,I believe that they could be paid under the New York law in cash.
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3930.031,3930.158,If the rental --
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3930.158,3931.962,But there was a surplus from operations rather than in cash.
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3931.962,3939.379,"But if the rental were to be used in that way, is it your opinion that that's income?"
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3939.379,3950.468,"It is our opinion, Your Honor that that is an economic benefit which when taken with other economic benefits constitute a sufficient inducement purchase a security."
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3950.468,3954.949,But we were talking about dividends and profits.
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3966.9,3968.361,"Possibly not, Your Honor."
1974.74-157,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3996.192,4006.235,Do I understand you to say that the only prospect the dividend is that to operate in cost go down?
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4006.235,4008.101,In -- I believe --
1974.74-157,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4008.101,4015.984,"Because if that's true, I doubt that anybody assumes that as of today, did it?"
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4018.971,4029.177,"Well, Your Honor you would come from a combination of what is collected as against what it cost to run the project."
1974.74-157,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4042.498,4046.607,Then we go to the River Bay or whatever it is the corporation?
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4046.607,4047.832,"Yes they do, Your Honor."
1974.74-157,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4097.31,4113.952,"Well I suppose you'd be here making a perhaps not the same, but a similar argument if some different pieces of paper were issued that weren't called stock but had the attributes that these pieces of paper had?"
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4113.952,4118.542,Your Honor we might be making a somewhat different argument if that were the case.
1974.74-157,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4118.542,4121.473,"Well, I said I mean at the same, but you'd be still be here, wouldn't you?"
1974.74-157,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4121.473,4121.805,Ultimate argument --
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4121.805,4122.046,We might still be here.
1974.74-157,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4122.046,4126.036,"-- how about whether if this was a security, you would still -- you could still be making, couldn't you?"
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4126.036,4128.06,"We might still be making that, yes Your Honor."
1974.74-157,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4128.656,4131.026,"-- making the investment contract, are you?"
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4131.026,4145.691,"Yes but I would like to emphasize once again Your Honor, if I may, that the issue here is not whether an interest which on its face does not purport to be a security, is nevertheless to be a security rather it's the contrary."
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4153.97,4166.219,"Mr. Gonson, do you not take into position are you that any piece of paper that is called a share of stock is necessarily per se a share under the Securities Act, are you?"
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4166.219,4166.993,"No, sir."
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4199.352,4201.826,"But in the end, you look to the economic realities."
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4203.286,4203.622,Yes.
1974.74-157,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4232.252,4236.887,Isn't it economic reality that you can't get the lease without the stock?
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4236.887,4243.248,"The economic realities, Your Honor is that the stock is a passkey to the apartment."
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4363.184,4363.592,Mr. Gonson?
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4363.592,4365.953,Thank you.
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4365.953,4381.677,In the section of your brief that argues that this type of housing would not be seriously interfered with if required to comply with the Securities Act.
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4407.204,4417.97,"Your Honor, in this very case the subscription agreement stated that it was offered only to residents of the State of New York."
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4417.97,4419.138,Correct.
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4419.138,4419.167,And --
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4419.167,4428.868,"But suppose, there'd been a single offeree who was not a resident of New York, what would've been the consequences?"
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4428.868,4433.828,There would have been of course some danger that the exemption might not have been available.
1974.74-157,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4464.893,4470.955,There's a difference between the people who buy and the people to whom a security is offered.
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4491.658,4493.11,That is correct Your Honor.
1974.74-157,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4508.605,4517.253,"I'm not sure what, if any significance there was or is, about the residency requirement."
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4528.976,4533.809,I would assume so if the residents were a bona fide one Your Honor.
1974.74-157,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4533.809,4538.928,"Well if they could elect welfare, then they could get in to this enterprise."
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4538.928,4541.463,I would assume so.
1974.74-157,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4541.502,4556.267,"But then frequently, the determination of whether or not that exemption is available will determine -- will turn on the trial of the issue of fact of the residents of a particular offeree?"
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4556.267,4557.973,I suppose that's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-157,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4563.009,4569.842,"Well that's why hardly anybody uses that intrastate offering thing, is because if you make one mistake, you're through."
1974.74-157,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4569.842,4570.793,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-157,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4606.537,4607.503,Very well.
1974.74-157,4,41958,simon_h_rifkind,,4611.223,4612.449,Thank you.
1974.74-157,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4865.023,4871.89,"The 1933 Act too that expressly confers the right of a purchaser to sue, isn't it?"
1974.74-157,4,41958,simon_h_rifkind,,4871.89,4876.233,That may well be.
1974.74-157,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4905.55,4912.654,"Dividend in the same sense that a dividend on a life insurance policy might be called a dividend, isn't it?"
1974.74-157,4,41958,simon_h_rifkind,,4912.654,4915.68,Even that might be more of a dividend than the actuality.
1974.74-157,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4919.993,4921.502,But the cost turned out to be lower than the --
1974.74-157,4,41958,simon_h_rifkind,,4921.502,4924.618,Cost turned out to be less.
1974.74-157,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5188.329,5191.574,"Well they just changed their minds, Judge."
1974.74-157,4,41958,simon_h_rifkind,,5191.574,5192.93,If they changed their mind --
