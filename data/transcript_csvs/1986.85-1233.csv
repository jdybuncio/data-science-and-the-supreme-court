1986.85-1233,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.67,"We will hear argument now in No. 85-1233, International Paper Company versus Ouellette."
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,12.641,25.631,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a class action brought by citizens of Vermont who own property on the Vermont side of Lake Champlain."
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.411,309.416,"You say when the state undertakes the job then it gives notice, and so on and so forth."
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,311.035,321.391,Undertakes the... a state under the Act may assume the role of the authority which regulates the discharger in the source state.
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,321.391,327.045,In making the law or just... or making its own law conforming to Federal standards?
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,327.045,331.949,Making its own standard provided it is equal to the Federal standard or more stringent.
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,331.949,333.299,But it is nevertheless a state law?
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,333.299,335.734,It is a state permitting procedure.
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,340.388,354.231,"But if someone sues and says a discharge is not conforming with the law, is it state law that he is--"
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,354.231,355.031,To the extent that--
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,355.031,355.631,--acting under or not?
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,355.631,361.416,"--Well, to the extent that there is a challenge permitted directly by the Act, that challenge can come from a citizen."
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,361.416,361.985,Yes.
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,361.985,369.522,And to that extent the challenge would be based upon source state law as we see it in this particular case.
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,369.522,373.141,And that is what this... that isn't what this case says?
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,373.141,381.68,"Well, there is a very fundamental issue here with respect to what law is applicable with respect to the claims made by the plaintiffs in this case."
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,427.728,429.494,But why is any state law applicable?
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,431.013,431.68,Congress--
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,431.68,433.23,Isn't that right?
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,433.23,439.3,"--within the basic framework of the Act, Your Honor, Congress has indicated that--"
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,439.3,440.6,New York can--
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,440.6,442.919,--we feel source state law is applicable.
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,444.186,447.038,"--Well, Congress says the source... the state may make the law for it."
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,447.038,452.441,"Well, it really talks in terms of regulation as distinguished from making the law, but--"
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.441,454.809,"Yes, but you just told me the state could set the standards, too."
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,454.809,457.678,"--It does, Your Honor, the technological standards."
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,458.278,468.117,And I suppose you say that Congress anticipated that the source state would set such standards if it undertook the job.
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,468.117,469.153,"I do, indeed, Your Honor."
1986.85-1233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,469.153,475.307,"Mr. Reardon, did you say there was some suits reserved for the state courts?"
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,475.307,477.509,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,478.642,479.625,Which are they?
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,479.625,494.951,"--Well, under the general framework of the statute, you may bring a suit within the source state either in the state or the Federal court if you are an injured party."
1986.85-1233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,498.403,499.319,Perhaps I misunderstood you.
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,503.355,503.807,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1233,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,503.807,504.29,I am sorry.
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,511.527,515.812,If it is citizens of the same state who are challenged--
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.812,531.672,"They aren't... say the suit is that here you have a permit under New York law and I claim that you are violating the New York standards, and that is a claim under New York law, isn't it?"
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,531.672,535.225,"--It is really a claim under the Act, Your Honor, because if you are proceeding--"
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,535.225,544.081,You mean you could go right into Federal court on a claim like that if you live in the same state as the discharger?
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,544.081,553.687,"--Well, my understanding is that the Act provides that you must proceed within the district in which the source is located."
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.447,574.433,That is... so it is not a Federal question in my example.
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,574.433,579.635,"It would not be a Federal jurisdiction-based issue at that point, Your Honor."
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.635,580.102,All right.
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,580.102,586.158,It would be a challenge to whether or not there has been compliance with the permit as administered by the state.
1986.85-1233,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,586.158,599.216,"And you take the position, Mr. Reardon, that even in a diversity suit that a Federal District Court could not entertain the action in the State of Vermont--"
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,599.216,601.501,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1233,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,601.501,602.551,--under this Act?
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,602.551,603.351,"Yes, we do."
1986.85-1233,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.351,608.219,xxx to have to apply New York law.
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,608.219,622.163,"Yes, Your Honor, we would say that under this particular provision it is our position that New York law would in fact apply rather than the law of Vermont."
1986.85-1233,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.163,627.632,Why do you say that it is a state law action?
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,631.168,632.734,"Well, there can be two suits, Your Honor."
1986.85-1233,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.998,664.722,"Right, and even though the level of discharge and the technological requirements are established by the state, if you violate that you are violating a Federal law, right, and the suit would be for violation of Federal law."
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,664.722,667.524,"That is true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1233,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.524,670.793,So that even if you had two citizens from the same state you could bring it in Federal court.
1986.85-1233,0,40329,roy_l_reardon,,670.793,672.411,On a Federal jurisdiction basis.
1986.85-1233,1,38079,peter_f_langrock,,1634.925,1652.803,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, what we have here is a private nuisance action brought by citizens of the state of Vermont against a New York corporation which was removed from Vermont courts to the Federal court based on diversity of jurisdiction."
1986.85-1233,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2542.496,2574.817,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at the outset I would like to clarify the difference between the kind of case we have before us and cases that are brought under what are called the citizens' suit provisions of the Federal Act."
1986.85-1233,3,40329,roy_l_reardon,,3434.024,3434.792,"Thank you, Your Honor."
