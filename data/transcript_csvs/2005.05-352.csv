2005.05-352,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.315,We'll hear argument first in United States v. Gonzalez Lopez.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,6.225,9.628,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,43.1,51.875,When did... when did we first hold that the State had to provide counsel if... if the defendant could not afford his own counsel?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,51.875,56.438,"I believe that Gideon was decided in 1963, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,56.438,60.601,And that's what we generally mean nowadays by the right... by... by the right to counsel.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,91.214,107.284,"Well, Justice Scalia, in fact, this Court has recognized that under the Sixth Amendment, as applied to the Federal Government, even before the Sixth Amendment was made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, that it did guarantee the right to appointed counsel if the defendant--"
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,107.284,109.154,When... when was our first holding to that effect?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,109.154,111.457,"--Johnson v. Zerbst, I believe, was in the '30's."
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,111.457,112.055,In the '30's.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,112.796,113.707,The... the fact--
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,113.707,128.437,"--that's hardly... that's hardly the original purpose and meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and... and you come here and say that its fundamental purpose is something that is only the purpose of the newly evolved Sixth Amendment and not of the original one."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,128.437,139.805,"--Justice Scalia, our position on what the purpose of the Assistance of Counsel Clause is... is drawn from what this Court has said that purpose is in the way that it's elaborated it."
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.208,164.471,I don't think that's the overarching goal of the original.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,185.315,198.232,"Well, I... I think that this Court has made clear that the core element of fairness is protecting the defendant's ability to have a lawyer there at all, and if the lawyer is not there, the essential fairness of the trial is in jeopardy."
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.293,201.825,But until the 1930's that element didn't exist.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,201.825,203.037,--There were--
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,203.037,206.597,"Until the 1930's, if you didn't have the money, you didn't have counsel."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,206.597,218.547,"--That's not entirely true, Justice Scalia, because there certainly were many jurisdictions, even at the time of the founding, that provided for the appointment of counsel if the defendant was not able to retain his own counsel."
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.547,218.586,"Well, excuse me."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,222.599,237.35,"What this Court has done I think, in the course of the 20th century jurisprudence that has examined the right to counsel, is establish a hierarchy of the critical rights that are necessary for a fair trial."
2005.05-352,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,239.253,246.885,"Well, but what if... just to take an example, let's suppose there are two possible defenses you could raise, entrapment and that you didn't do it."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,269.871,272.275,"--Well, within limits, I think that that's certainly true, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,288.334,296.48,"Well, that was my... even in the Chief Justice's hypothetical, I... I take it the client has a right to direct the attorney what defense to present, or am I wrong about it?"
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,296.48,298.411,"I think within limits, that's absolutely right, Justice Kennedy."
2005.05-352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,311.869,322.077,"But in this... in this case, Mr. Dreeben, we have a defendant ready, willing, and able to pay for an experienced lawyer in whom he has great trust."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,341.678,349.184,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think it's critical in this case that it... the court never forced a lawyer on respondent in this case."
2005.05-352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.184,350.244,But it was a junior counsel.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,366.596,378.603,And the respondent had months after that disqualification was made clear and the court of appeals denied mandamus to retain a different counsel if he chose to retain a different counsel.
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,394.152,396.856,So he was just disabled from... from his first choice.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,396.856,397.655,He was disabled--
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.655,399.748,The court told him you can't have the counsel you want.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,401.889,411.135,"--That's right, and that's why we are not disagreeing in this case that there's been an infringement of his constitutionally protected interest in having counsel of choice."
2005.05-352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,422.692,428.937,"How do you reconcile your position with the right to self representation, if somebody doesn't want a lawyer at all?"
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,433.449,437.643,--This Court has made clear that the right to self representation is unique.
2005.05-352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.643,439.914,Is even a greater right than the right to pick your own lawyer.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,439.914,444.128,It is a much greater right because it protects autonomy interests that are--
2005.05-352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,444.128,446.95,Why doesn't the choice of counsel protect autonomy too?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,446.95,448.4,"--It protects it, but in a much--"
2005.05-352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.4,448.63,You have a lawyer.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,453.885,460.747,"--There's a modest element of autonomy in the right of counsel of choice, but the right of self representation is complete autonomy."
2005.05-352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,495.341,509.26,What would the Government's position be if the disappointed client whose choice of counsel was rejected by the court applied for mandate review in the court of appeals?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,509.26,516.874,"Our position is that if there were a clear abuse of discretion, in accordance with the ordinary mandamus standards--"
2005.05-352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,516.874,518.436,"Well, we don't know... we don't know if that's the case."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,523.087,530.725,"--The Government's position is that he could seek a writ of mandamus, and if he qualified under the standards for mandamus, then he could obtain relief."
2005.05-352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,549.876,554.779,But the Government always acquiesces in the propriety of seeking mandate from the court of appeals?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,554.779,556.882,I don't think it's really up to the Government.
2005.05-352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,560.365,564.486,"Well, I mean, I suppose the Government can object that it's improper or that it's unnecessary or a waste of time."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,566.356,573.391,--The Government's position is that it would depend on whether the defendant could satisfy the high standards required for mandamus.
2005.05-352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,576.994,585.479,"Well, if... if the question is fairness, as you... as you propose, then it would seem to me that there would be no need for the extraordinary proceeding."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,585.479,592.465,"--The Government doesn't dispute that as in this... as this Court held in Wheat, there's a presumption in favor of counsel of choice."
2005.05-352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,601.581,608.765,Would you say that presumption is sufficient so that mandate should be entertained by a court of appeals anytime this question comes up?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,608.765,610.605,"--Not anytime, Justice Kennedy."
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.302,672.585,"Did Flanagan, the case that denied mandamus on this issue... did it assume any resolution of the question whether if... if you can't have counsel of your choice, in order to get your conviction reversed, you have to show... you have to show that the error was not harmless?"
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,672.585,676.479,"Justice Scalia, Flanagan held that there was no collateral order appeal."
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.562,679.721,"No, I understand, but--"
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,679.721,681.022,In rejecting--
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.022,689.34,"--but I would certainly think that it's relevant to the question of whether you allow immediate appeal, what the consequences of not allowing immediate appeal are."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,694.592,705.658,"--What this Court said in Flanagan is that if the defendant, at the end of the day... and if was the operative word... could obtain automatic reversal, then the defendant's interests could be vindicated at the end of trial."
2005.05-352,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,728.226,735.92,"Mr. Dreeben, did I understand your brief to suggest that the... I understand your main burden is to overturn the idea of automatic reversal."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,735.92,736.36,Correct.
2005.05-352,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,736.36,742.013,"But if there were a standard, is your standard of prejudice the same as under Strickland, or is it a different standard?"
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,742.013,746.926,"Our... our standard of prejudice, our preferred standard of prejudice, is the same as under Strickland."
2005.05-352,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,779.808,781.21,"Well, why would it be easier than in Strickland?"
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,825.287,827.619,"Justice Alito, I don't think that it is that difficult."
2005.05-352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.29,852.206,"Yes, but isn't it almost essential, in one of these inquiries, to... to invade the attorney client privilege over and over again to find out what they might have done with a different lawyer?"
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,852.206,856.188,This almost invariably occurs in every Strickland case.
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,866.615,868.906,--I don't... I don't want... I don't want a competent lawyer.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,902.958,910.853,"--No, but I think that... that Your Honor's question reveals that different lawyers will make different strategic judgments and assessing the impact of those on the trial--"
2005.05-352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,910.853,915.366,"Well, in... in hindsight, you've always made a mistake if your client is found guilty."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,937.692,945.486,"--Well, the... the remedy that... that this Court has chosen when counsel is not competent requires I think a... a systematic inquiry."
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,953.0,983.15,"The only issue in that case is competent performance, and it seems to me that the... the difficulty behind a number of our questions this morning is that you are trying to draw an analogy from... from counsel issues that don't involve an autonomy interest to a counsel issue that does involve an autonomy interest, maybe in theory not as greatly as self representation, but as... as everybody agrees, as you've said, it involves some autonomy interest."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1006.975,1010.148,"Well, I think it becomes considerably more than an ineffective assistance case."
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1024.458,1026.701,"No, but you say he's... he's not denied all choice."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1030.434,1037.369,"--He may very well be denied that choice, Justice Souter, if he tries to retain that lawyer and that lawyer has a conflict of interest."
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1037.369,1038.441,That's not the state's problem.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1058.163,1060.133,"Well, it isn't necessarily second best."
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1061.836,1063.727,It's second best to the guy who wants somebody else.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1063.727,1070.291,"--Well, if... if he retains somebody else and that person obtains a complete acquittal, that... that individual is, no doubt, going to be very satisfied."
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1071.751,1075.224,But what good is that as... as an answer to our question?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1087.242,1097.229,"--Justice Souter, I think what it illustrates is that the right to choose counsel is connected with the desirability, as Justice Scalia pointed out, of a favorable outcome."
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1098.228,1111.298,"It's... it's basically... in... in Justice Scalia's question, it is connected with what the... the client believes will be a favorable outcome by using the lawyer he wants."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1119.553,1121.135,--There's--
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1121.135,1126.939,"I mean, all... all I'm getting it, is that's a different... that is a very different criterion from what we apply in Strickland."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1126.939,1130.869,"--Yes, and I'm not suggesting that the Court apply the criteria in Strickland."
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1157.497,1158.669,Why... why take it away from the 10 percent?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1158.669,1161.201,I'm not suggesting that it be taken away.
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1162.83,1163.942,You're... because you're saying they don't have it.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1163.942,1184.535,"I'm saying that they have it, but in order for this Court to conclude that reversal of a trial that can be presumed fundamentally fair, because the defendant, in fact, went to trial with counsel who he had chosen, albeit as his second choice, should not occur with all of the societal impacts that that has, the potential for victims to have to go through a retrial."
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.535,1185.066,It's a fair trial.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1204.909,1208.031,And... and we're not disputing that that entitlement exists.
2005.05-352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1211.793,1224.032,"But, Mr. Dreeben, I think you're underestimating the importance of the autonomy interest because going through a criminal trial for a defendant is a very traumatic experience, not just what happens in the courtroom, but during the entire process."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1235.66,1240.482,"--I think the autonomy interest is deserving of protection, as this Court has held, but--"
2005.05-352,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1240.482,1243.374,Totally independently of the trial strategy--
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1243.374,1254.37,"--No, I... I don't agree that it's... that it really has a function in the Sixth Amendment that's independent of what the Sixth Amendment itself says, which is the assistance of counsel for his defense."
2005.05-352,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1293.436,1293.686,Well--
2005.05-352,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1293.686,1296.237,That's the right of assistance of counsel for his defense.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1296.597,1297.148,That's right.
2005.05-352,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1297.148,1299.269,Not for the fuller expression of his autonomy.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1299.269,1299.629,That is correct.
2005.05-352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1318.994,1320.643,"May I, Mr. Dreeben--"
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.643,1329.529,"I mean, you... you could say the... you could say the same thing, counsel, about his right to self representation, that he has the right to self representation for his defense or for his--"
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1329.529,1330.681,"--No, you could not say that, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1339.707,1349.344,"--Yes, but it is limited to the right of self representation for his defense, just as his choice of counsel is limited to his choice of counsel for his defense."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1349.344,1363.031,"--I don't think that's accurate, Justice Scalia, because what the Court made clear in its self representation cases is that there was an important historical tradition that was being protected, and it's being protected independent of the defendant's interest in a successful outcome."
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1377.071,1383.926,Why is there a less worthy historical tradition to be honored in a defendant's choice of his own counsel?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1383.926,1387.158,"I don't deny that there's a historical tradition, Justice Souter."
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1387.158,1387.699,But... but you--
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1387.699,1388.849,But it's a very qualified one.
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1388.849,1397.364,"--But you concede that if... if it's a historical tradition to speak in one's own voice, it gets... for practical purposes, it gets a kind of absolute respect."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1408.51,1424.392,There... the point that the Court relied on in concluding that automatic reversal was appropriate for denial of the right to self representation included the critical fact that this is not a right that proceeds in connection with the fairness of the trial.
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1426.432,1440.154,"Right, and the question is he... I mean, the... the whole point here isn't the... isn't the interest in autonomy a separate interest which should be recognized by some means other than merely looking to the fairness of the trial."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1440.154,1450.228,"--I think that it is a right that should be... an interest that should be recognized, and it is, of course, recognized in Wheat by saying that it's comprehended within the Sixth Amendment."
2005.05-352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1461.337,1462.677,--But compared to what?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1493.568,1501.893,"Justice Ginsburg, I think the Court has before it three options for some standard that would not consist of an automatic reversal standard."
2005.05-352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1519.124,1519.685,Does different outcome mean--
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1519.685,1521.105,More favorable--
2005.05-352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1521.105,1522.577,"--if the defendant is found guilty, he would have been acquitted?"
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1522.577,1523.038,--That's right.
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1530.851,1533.383,How do you think that would work with the Twinkie defense?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1533.383,1539.527,"I think, Justice Scalia, you'd have to actually look at the specific facts of the case and make a determination."
2005.05-352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1539.527,1548.132,I don't think any court would conceivably reverse the... the disqualification of counsel on the ground that he would have come up with that defense and win.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1548.132,1564.942,"And if that's because any court would conclude that that defense was not likely to prevail, then I would submit that the proper accommodation of the societal interest in respecting a final judgment and protecting the interest... the qualified interest in counsel of choice is properly resolved."
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1564.942,1565.392,Let me ask--
2005.05-352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1565.392,1569.456,You said you had... you said you had... your first preference would be--
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1569.456,1569.686,Correct.
2005.05-352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1569.686,1573.48,--different strategy and would have been acquitted with that strategy.
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1574.679,1595.704,"The second option would be the standard that the Seventh Circuit selected in Rodriguez v. Chandler, which requires a showing that the second choice lawyer was deficient in some important qualification or would... pursued a different strategic interest and a different strategic approach than first choice counsel, and that's it."
2005.05-352,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1654.311,1657.864,--But isn't the sacrifice sort of egregious here?
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1681.981,1698.21,"Justice Souter, I... I do want to reserve the remainder of my time, but the point is that a defendant who has his second choice opportunity of counsel is able to express his autonomy interests in a much more significant way than a defendant who is denied the right to self representation."
2005.05-352,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1698.21,1699.422,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2005.05-352,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1699.422,1700.393,I'd like to reserve my time.
2005.05-352,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1700.393,1702.976,Mr. Fisher.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1702.976,1711.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.05-352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1724.659,1726.361,"Well, it's not just disqualify."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1739.449,1752.278,"--Well, this Court already has a body of jurisprudence, beginning with Powell against Alabama, that decides when a judge acts within his discretion in denying a continuance, for example, to allow the defendant to get the retained counsel of his choice."
2005.05-352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1761.865,1765.796,"Well, you may leave the jurisprudence where you found it, but other attorneys might not."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1779.246,1780.937,--But--
2005.05-352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1780.937,1790.454,"And if... if you prevail here, it seems to me that counsel can come in and say, now, Judge, look at your calendar, and you can certainly wait for another 2 weeks, and the judge has to do it."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1790.454,1791.635,--We don't... we don't--
2005.05-352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1791.635,1793.005,And I don't know why he wouldn't.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1793.005,1795.066,"--We don't think that's the case, Justice Kennedy."
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1819.591,1829.95,"You would require... if... if a defendant is on his second choice and he's filed an affidavit saying, you know, the guy did a great job."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1842.228,1849.515,"--Well, it seems... you know, perhaps we could imagine a scenario, Mr. Chief Justice, where the defendant effectively waives his right, and if he came out and said so much to the court."
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1860.29,1873.711,"And... and if... if he were not able to afford a... afford an attorney and one were appointed for him and that lawyer were incompetent, that client would still have to show prejudice."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1876.592,1878.212,That's right.
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1895.983,1899.496,Does a... someone relying on appointed counsel have the same right?
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1905.881,1908.051,"--No, he doesn't, Your Honor."
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1908.983,1909.762,Why not?
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1909.762,1919.639,"--the defendant who has counsel of his... who's... who's appointed counsel does have a limited right to control certain fundamental decisions in his defense such as whether he testifies, whether he accepts a plea offer."
2005.05-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1925.403,1927.724,"Well, I think he can also reject an appointed counsel."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1931.727,1935.05,"--Certainly that happens, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.05,1935.53,"Yes, I know it happens."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1935.53,1946.269,"You know, there are... there are certain instances where a defendant may be so... have so little basis for doing so or may be... you know, may be asking too much of the court--"
2005.05-352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1946.269,1952.203,"But it seems to me that would happen if there's an autonomous, structural right of the kind you... you urge."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1952.203,1957.205,--The... the autonomy interest in this case is the defendant's right to control his defense.
2005.05-352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1963.669,1968.582,So I want to control the case by having a different appointed counsel.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1968.582,1981.992,"--Well, this Court... I mean, in numerous areas of this Court's jurisprudence, not just in criminal procedure, this Court recognizes that there... people have certain rights, but if they have the means to effectuate those rights, they're in a better position than people that don't."
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2010.33,2015.503,How many lawyers... you're talking about a very refined assertion of a constitutional right.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2039.432,2055.591,"--In some cases, that's true, Mr. Chief Justice, although I would hasten to... to tell you that even in the context of defendants who can retain counsel, very often, if their retained counsel is disqualified, they're forced, as in this case... they're simply out of money and have to go forward with local counsel."
2005.05-352,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2076.815,2086.592,"Well, can there not be a case where it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the... the judge's mistaken ruling on a disqualification motion didn't have any effect on the outcome?"
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2086.592,2088.893,I think only in the case of an acquittal.
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2093.467,2093.735,"Well, why not?"
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2093.735,2094.206,--to the Twinkie--
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2094.206,2096.168,"Well, why not in the case of an acquittal?"
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2110.958,2116.002,"--I think you'd have a constitutional violation, but it would, in fact, be harmless, and I don't think you'd have a 1983 action because--"
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2116.002,2121.585,It wouldn't be harmless under your theory because your theory is that this has given expression to your personal autonomy.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2129.79,2130.091,--Okay.
2005.05-352,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2134.976,2146.583,"Well, let's say the defendant wanted to be represented by a relative whose... whose specialty is real estate, and for some reason, that lawyer is wrongfully disqualified."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2160.952,2162.732,"Let me say two things to that, Justice Alito."
2005.05-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.913,2191.202,Or... or my Uncle Vinnie.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2194.084,2194.665,--Well--
2005.05-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.665,2197.436,--I don't know... I don't know whether he was a real estate lawyer or not.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2198.117,2220.301,"--Well, I'll try to do even better than Uncle Vinnie, and say in our brief we talk about a case, the Euel Lee case, which is a case where a black defendant wanted to go forward with his counsel of choice in... in the District of Maryland, and he was forced to go ahead with a more experienced, establishment type counsel and... and to his detriment."
2005.05-352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.153,2287.645,"Well, but... but this is all subject challenge as an abuse of discretion."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2287.645,2288.646,--That's right.
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2318.676,2321.217,"Counsel, I suppose this... this right applies on appeal as well."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2336.238,2343.161,"Well, it's not contested in this case that the... that the pro hac vice denial did violate the Sixth Amendment."
2005.05-352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2367.046,2370.759,Are you saying that this... trial is... is one thing.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2387.7,2388.752,"It might be, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2391.213,2393.734,Are you entitled to represent yourself on appeal?
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2393.734,2394.545,"--No, you're not."
2005.05-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2394.545,2395.166,So--
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2395.166,2400.42,"So there is a difference, of course, this Court has recognized in its Martinez case, that takes place."
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2441.469,2443.519,That... that happens all the time.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2453.675,2454.146,It--
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2454.146,2455.848,--before he'll get relief.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2455.848,2457.258,"--I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2487.158,2512.593,"Are you... are you relying at all on the effect that you want the Court's decision to have on trial judges and prosecutors, that is, a judge who knows if he disqualifies a lawyer who shouldn't be disqualified, that there will be an automatic new trial?"
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2524.871,2528.795,Let me answer it both on the facts and on the law.
2005.05-352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2593.016,2600.121,Are there cases in the records where it shows government overreaching or bad faith and so forth in trying to get rid of a counsel?
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2601.333,2609.138,"--I'm not aware of any case, Justice Kennedy, where an express finding of bad faith is placed on the record."
2005.05-352,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2695.184,2696.494,Would your... would your rule--
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2696.494,2697.556,--with all the problems of hindsight.
2005.05-352,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2697.556,2699.316,--Would your rule apply in the case of a guilty plea?
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2699.316,2713.694,"Well, I mean, our rule would... would apply in a guilty plea case, provided the defendant didn't waive it, didn't waive the... the argument of his guilty plea."
2005.05-352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2792.037,2796.321,"Mr. Fisher, remind me in bringing up the plea question."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2806.977,2808.98,"That is part of the record, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2832.134,2833.005,Some of the--
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2833.005,2834.345,But that's certainly one of his considerations.
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2834.345,2845.682,--Some of the concerns about the evidentiary presentation were addressed by the Seventh Circuit and the reason they adopted a... a lesser standard than the prejudice standard in... in Strickland.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2849.315,2850.757,"Well, for two reasons, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2920.762,2927.778,"What are the... what are the practicalities or impracticalities, as the case may be, of seeking immediate review from the court of appeals just by writ of mandate?"
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2927.778,2934.591,"--Oh, well, there's... there's two big problems with what the... with the United States' position on that point, Justice Kennedy."
2005.05-352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2972.976,2978.199,I think it would be easy for us to make a distinction between the right and the remedy.
2005.05-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2978.199,2983.134,--I'm... I'm not sure you're properly characterizing the... the Government's position.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3013.672,3024.13,"Justice Scalia, I think I'm fairly characterizing the Government's position when I say that as a constitutional matter, they say there's no Sixth Amendment violation until we see what happens at the trial."
2005.05-352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3024.13,3027.433,I thought they said there isn't if the question is remedied.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3027.433,3040.87,"I don't think that's the way that they're presenting their case, Justice Ginsburg, and this is important because what the Government is saying is the right itself is not violated until we have a breakdown in the adversarial process at trial."
2005.05-352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3040.87,3053.009,"Well, but in all events, we could structure the decision to make... to make sense, and if these instances happen, as you indicate in your brief, very rarely, it seems to me that the answer is mandate in a court of appeals."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3053.009,3076.766,"Well, you... if you conceived the right as one that you made clear there's a violation at the moment the trial court impermissibly denies counsel of choice, and then perhaps to say... and then you went on to say there's either an automatic reversal rule or even a Chapman standard, then you could say that there would be a right for mandamus on appeal."
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3081.037,3082.848,"Well, but then you wouldn't... I'm sorry to interrupt you."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3089.042,3090.164,--He may well be.
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3090.164,3092.575,"Take his chance and then if he... if he loses, he gets automatic reversal."
2005.05-352,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3094.125,3094.626,That's right.
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3094.626,3095.567,"Well, because--"
2005.05-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.567,3105.584,"Unless you compel him to seek mandamus on pain of losing the constitutional claim, your... every incentive is to go right ahead with the trial."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3105.584,3108.954,"--I think in the ordinary case, yes, but let me talk about... let me go back to the facts of this case."
2005.05-352,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.744,3130.96,"I don't think the mandamus solution works unless you compel mandamus, unless you say you lose... you lose the claim unless you bring mandamus."
2005.05-352,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3130.96,3131.281,Yes.
2005.05-352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3188.007,3188.656,"In the government, you're including the court in that."
