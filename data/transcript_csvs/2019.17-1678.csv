2019.17-1678,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.64,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1678, Hernandez versus Mesa. Mr. Vladeck."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,6.64,24.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When this case was first argued to this Court two years ago, counsel for Respondent and counsel for the United States were both asked whether Petitioners would have a Bivens remedy if Sergio Hernandez had been standing on U.S. soil when he was shot and killed by Respondent."
2019.17-1678,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,247.76,248.68,They argue --
2019.17-1678,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,248.68,250.84,If the --
2019.17-1678,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,250.84,251.64,Go ahead.
2019.17-1678,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,251.64,261.48,"If the officer in this case had been a state officer and everything else was the same, would the victim have a claim in federal court?"
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,261.48,265.48,"So, if the question is in federal court, Justice Alito, I think it would depend on diversity."
2019.17-1678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,302.44,318.12,"Suppose -- suppose there were no 1983, and a state officer had done exactly what the Bureau of Narcotics agents did in Bivens."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,321.6,322.56,"There would be, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.17-1678,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,393.88,397.6,Your -- your -- you reference the government's position in Bivens.
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,429.0,431.8,"I take the point, Mr. Chief Justice, and if I may offer two points in response."
2019.17-1678,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,495.96,502.92,"If Bivens were a statute, in effect, we would apply the presumption against extraterritorial application."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,510.76,512.32,"Well, I think we have two answers, Justice Kavanaugh."
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,582.96,586.08,What would distinguish --
2019.17-1678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,586.08,618.92,"But the -- the -- the victim, Hernandez, this Court has -- has said, I think, that a non-citizen who's injured abroad doesn't have any Fourth Amendment rights. So what is -- it seems like a rather arid discussion if, at the end of the day, there is no federal constitutional right that can be asserted by a non-citizen who is injured abroad."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,618.92,645.92,"So I think -- I think, Justice Ginsburg, that Verdugo certainly stands for the proposition that in that case there was no Fourth Amendment protection for a Mexican national whose home was searched by DEA agents operating in conjunction with the Mexican government. I think this Court itself suggested in Hernandez I, two years ago, that the Fourth Amendment question in the context of a cross-border shooting is more complicated, and it is the fact that that question is unsettled --"
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,645.92,646.2,"Well, what --"
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,646.2,646.92,-- that is -- sorry.
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,646.92,648.44,"-- what -- this is my question, too."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,670.48,671.24,"Not at all, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,672.2,675.36,"It can't -- it can't be that this is good for one shooting only, right?"
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,675.36,675.92,No.
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,679.36,680.44,I understand that.
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,680.44,696.6,"But -- but no, I mean, I think the -- the larger point is our position focuses on the law enforcement nature of the conduct at issue here. And so many of the hypotheticals that I suspect you are thinking of, Your Honor, that I'd be thinking of, for a context in which a U.S. government person in the United States could --"
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,696.6,704.04,Why would it be limited to law enforcement as opposed to other governmental functions that happen here but happen to injure persons abroad?
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,704.04,729.16,"Because I think it's in the law enforcement context that there is the strongest argument, the strongest appeal to the historical tradition we note in our briefs, where there is a straight line dating all the way back to the founding where it was law enforcement, where common law remedies against federal officers were so important. There aren't many examples, I could find none, of combat operations, for example, where state courts were imposing tort remedies against federal officers."
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,729.16,746.52,"So you'd have us -- you'd draw a line there, actively in this case and say that any -- any actions involving military operations, diplomatic operations, any other operations of government are not -- there -- there's no Bivens action there, it's only for law enforcement, whatever that means, operations?"
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,746.52,748.72,"So, I mean, I -- obviously, I wouldn't decide more than is necessary."
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,749.12,752.92,"Ah, ah, okay. That's what -- that's what I thought you'd say."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,752.92,754.28,"But -- but, Justice Gorsuch --"
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,754.28,754.76,All right.
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,764.8,765.12,I -- I -- I --
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,765.12,766.52,Where would you draw the line?
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,766.52,773.24,"I think -- I think based on this Court's jurisprudence, and based on Abbasi itself, I think the line could reasonably, plausibly, and --"
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,773.24,774.96,"No, no, not reasonably, plausibly."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,777.36,788.64,"Well, I think, frankly, there are decisions this Court has handed down in the Bivens context that I think don't necessarily -- aren't necessarily consistent with this full tradition. But it has still left open law enforcement conduct, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.17-1678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,802.4,802.52,Well --
2019.17-1678,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,802.52,802.84,They are --
2019.17-1678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,802.84,806.88,-- but I -- it's not just intentional torts.
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,811.76,813.2,"It absolutely is, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.17-1678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,814.4,829.6,"And accepting the facts of this case, the use of force is on U.S. land and it's unreasonable because the claim is that this young man was doing nothing but standing on the other side of the border."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,829.6,852.04,"And I think this might be a -- a -- sort of a more convincing answer, I hope, to Justice Gorsuch, which is I do believe that it is relevant to the claim and the strength of our claim in this case that the Respondent was, according to the plausible allegations in the plaintiff's complaint, violating not just the Constitution but his own departmental regulations, that we have not just a law enforcement officer, Justice Gorsuch, but a law enforcement officer acting ultra vires."
2019.17-1678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,852.04,877.72,"Are we supposed to decide this? I mean, I thought -- I wrote a dissent, I guess, but I thought this is special because it's American law enforcement, American soil, and he thought he might be shooting at an American, and the -- the border in this case is rather special, it's not just the line, it was the river, and it's administered by an international commission, dah-dah-dah, okay, I have about six wonderful reasons that persuaded only me."
2019.17-1678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,879.72,880.08,Or now -- now --
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,880.08,881.16,I believe you also persuaded --
2019.17-1678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,881.16,932.56,"-- I thought we're taking this case on the assumption that the Fourth Amendment does apply, and the only issue in front of us is not that but, rather, we assume that the Fourth Amendment applied, that it is a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment, and the question is Abbasi, whether there is a Bivens action for a clear rogue violation of the Fourth Amendment that takes place in the way this does. Is that sufficient, to use the Abbasi term that -- which I've now lost, but the Abbasi term that this is some kind of extension of the Fourth Amendment or that this is some kind of special situation? That, I thought, was the issue. And at some point, I -- I feel, I'll try to answer that question, but I'd like to hear what you say about that."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,932.56,935.04,"I -- I -- I agree completely, Justice Breyer."
2019.17-1678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,937.88,939.24,I don't care whether you agree or not.
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,945.32,945.92,Yes.
2019.17-1678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,945.92,954.44,"-- what is your argument that this is not an extension, that this is not special, that this is not an unusual thing?"
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,954.44,954.64,I understand.
2019.17-1678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,954.64,955.4,What's your argument?
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,955.4,979.92,"So our argument is, first, that this Court has long recognized that claims against individual law enforcement officers for excessive force are what the Fifth Circuit called classic Bivens claims. I believe there's an opinion by then Judge Kavanaugh referring to it as the core of Bivens to bring a claim that an individual law enforcement officer is acting ultra vires. So, Justice Breyer, I think there's at least an argument that this might not even be a new context."
2019.17-1678,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1042.8,1043.08,Counsel --
2019.17-1678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1043.08,1043.2,Tell me --
2019.17-1678,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1043.2,1082.68,"-- just to go with the first of the things you mentioned, the international relations, there has been diplomatic correspondence between the Mexican government and our government with respect to this -- this -- this incident. The Border Patrol has conducted an investigation, and it reached the determination that the action of the agent was not contrary to policy. And you would have the courts look into this by avail -- providing a Bivens remedy that could well come to the opposite conclusion. So that in terms of our relations with Mexico, we'd have one agency saying this was not inconsistent with policy."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1100.96,1104.96,"So I do -- I certainly agree that the -- that the country is supposed to speak with one voice, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.17-1678,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1133.04,1146.2,"They argue it's not merely the foreign policy implications that the Chief Justice identified but that border security is also national security in some respects and that that's a different context, slightly different than the foreign relations. Can you address that?"
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1146.2,1146.72,Absolutely.
2019.17-1678,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1194.88,1196.2,I thought you were challenging the --
2019.17-1678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1196.2,1196.76,Can you go back to --
2019.17-1678,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1196.76,1202.68,"-- I thought you were challenging the constitutionality of what was done, not whether it was consistent with border patrol policy."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1202.68,1204.04,"So, Justice Alito --"
2019.17-1678,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1204.04,1215.12,"Is that -- is that -- does that provide the basis for a federal claim? If it were -- if you put the Fourth Amendment aside, but the action was contrary to border -- border patrol policy, would that provide the basis for a federal claim?"
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1215.12,1216.44,"Not for a damages suit, of course, but --"
2019.17-1678,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1216.44,1217.0,Yes.
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1217.0,1266.76,"-- but it is our position, Justice Alito, that -- just to go back to my colloquy with Justice Gorsuch, again, the reason why we believe this is in the heartland of Bivens, notwithstanding the concerns that the Chief Justice has referred to and that Justice Kavanaugh alluded to, is because, here, we do not have a case where the claim is that a particular policy of the United States in the foreign relations or national security sphere was the source of the injury to the plaintiffs. Here, our argument is that the policy is actually coextensive with the Constitution, and so that if we are correct, which we have not yet, of course, had a chance to prove, but if we are correct that Respondent violated Petitioner's constitutional -- or Sergio Hernandez's constitutional rights, Justice Alito, there would also be a violation of policy. And so, to us, the questions blend together because it helps to drive home why this case is not like the nine cases this Court has had since Carlson --"
2019.17-1678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1266.76,1291.76,"Can -- can we -- can we go back to the question that I asked? If breaking into someone's home and searching and seizing, if that's not a Fourth Amendment violation because the person is a non-citizen and it happened abroad, you said a cross-border shooting is more complicated."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1294.44,1298.24,"So, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, I actually think it was this Court that said that in Hernandez I."
2019.17-1678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1340.44,1344.64,"Mr. Vladeck, there is one part of the Chief's question you didn't answer."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1380.6,1381.6,"Thank you, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.17-1678,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1422.64,1438.44,"But what if, Mr. Vladeck, you had -- you have this one incident and the executive branch had a very different view of what happened than a court did? A court said there was unconstitutional conduct here, the use of excessive force."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1473.16,1512.64,"Well, I think, Justice Kagan, there's a critical difference between what the preclusive effect of a civil judgment about the unconstitutional conduct by the officer would prove and whether the Mexican government would be able to satisfy the very different inquiry of whether there's sufficient evidence to sustain a criminal indictment and to warrant extradition under the terms of the U.S./Mexico extradition treaty. And I think that's the key point here, is that, on the government's logic, all it takes is the government showing up after an incident and saying, oh, there's some reason why we don't believe this was unlawful or there's some foreign relations implication to a judgment holding it's lawful."
2019.17-1678,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1515.68,1520.12,"Well, that's, I think, a fairly unfair characterization of what the government did in this case."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1537.2,1538.16,That -- that's fair that you ask --
2019.17-1678,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.16,1542.08,"But, even if not fully responsive, it has to be demonstrated it's simply a new context for the Bivens question."
2019.17-1678,0,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,1542.08,1608.0,"That -- that may well be, and I think our submission is simply that the question this Court has always suggested in the Bivens context is how to preserve its core deterrent purpose, and in a context in which the government's after-the-fact factual determination that an officer had acted appropriately under the circumstances were sufficient to be a policy choice, that does not actually give rise to the kind of deference this Court has historically accorded. Right? That's what we're worried about because it's not clear how that wouldn't potentially, if not in this case, swallow the category, right? That is to say, if Abbasi meant what it said when it said there are powerful reasons to retain Bivens in the law enforcement context, we think that's true, Mr. Chief Justice, even when the government has other -- other equities at stake. Because, again, the key for us is when a court is saying an individual officer has acted ultra vires, it is not the same thing as saying the government's policy is somehow inconsistent with the Constitution. It's not the same thing as saying we are second-guessing how the government has chosen to conduct border patrol policies."
2019.17-1678,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.72,1642.52,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. -- Mr. Ortega."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1642.52,1663.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Petitioners are asking this Court to create a cause of action, an implied cause of action, where none has existed since the formation of our republic, by extending Bivens in a new context, where Congress has not -- has declined to provide a remedy."
2019.17-1678,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1773.24,1809.16,"If we can go back to the -- this complaint, and at this stage, this very preliminary stage, we're supposed to accept the complaint's allegations as true, which is that, here, we have a rogue officer acting in violation of the agency's own instruction, using excessive force to kill a child at play, how does that call into question any foreign policy or national security policy?"
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1809.16,1823.0,"Well, it would create a chilling effect as to the border patrol agents in conducting their day-to-day activities, but not only a chilling effect, you would be -- the lower courts would be in chaos."
2019.17-1678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1823.6,1836.96,"Well, doesn't that happen if the shooting happened in our own land? Meaning a border patrol agent who sees a child at play and kills him two feet from the line is not chilled."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1854.52,1855.88,That's correct.
2019.17-1678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1855.88,1856.88,All right.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1861.36,1863.68,But -- but you can't view it in a vacuum.
2019.17-1678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1864.8,1873.36,"Well, the vacuum -- what -- this doesn't involve a Mexican defendant, Mexican law, or Mexican courts."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1891.08,1899.2,"Your Honor, are you -- are you suggesting that the decedent would be inside of the border of the United States?"
2019.17-1678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1899.2,1912.16,"No, I just said to you it involves a U.S. defendant, the border patrol agent, acting on U.S. soil, pulling the trigger on U.S. soil, and subjecting the U.S. border agent to a U.S. court."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1912.16,1913.56,But the --
2019.17-1678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1913.56,1915.4,We're not dragging the agent anywhere else.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1915.4,1921.44,"That's correct, but the agent would know when he took his actions that he was inside of the jurisdiction of the United States."
2019.17-1678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1921.44,1925.44,He always knows he's inside and subject to U.S. law.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1929.44,1930.32,That's correct.
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.32,1942.36,We assume -- we assume here that it is extended.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1982.12,1983.72,That's correct.
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1983.72,1990.88,"And if he is an American and on the other side, you agree he can bring a Bivens action?"
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1990.88,1991.96,"That would be correct, Your Honor."
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1991.96,1992.48,Okay.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2012.16,2013.56,"That would be correct, but --"
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2013.56,2015.76,"See, all right, now here is the standard."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2057.44,2059.36,It would become a matter of line drawing.
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.72,2060.88,"No, no, not line drawing."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2079.16,2082.12,It would be the extending of Bivens into a new country.
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2082.12,2090.96,"Why is it extending? I mean, after all, maybe in Hawaii there's never been a Bivens action brought before on the 14th island."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2093.28,2093.8,It's not.
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.72,2096.72,"Oh, I understand that."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2107.84,2113.0,But there's never been a Bivens action that involves a transnational shooting.
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2113.0,2130.56,"Ah, I got that point. All I am saying is, why is that different in terms of a problem caused than the fact that it was 7:02:59 on the fourth island of Hawaii? You got my point?"
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2130.56,2131.2,I do.
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.2,2131.64,Good.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2137.48,2138.72,It's -- it's -- (Laughter.)
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2138.72,2144.08,Don't ask my point. I want to know your answer.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2144.08,2149.64,I have to go back to -- to it being different in so much as it is transnational.
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2150.2,2151.48,"Well, you've said that."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2182.36,2186.04,"If there was a remedy to be fashioned, that would be for Congress to decide."
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2186.04,2190.2,"That's a conclusion. And my answer -- my question is, why?"
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2190.2,2209.08,"Because they'll be able to weigh the costs and benefits of the actual remedy itself, the limits of the remedy, the parameters of the remedy for the courts to be able to provide guidance to the lower courts. There would be very little guidance to the lower courts --"
2019.17-1678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2209.08,2211.44,I -- I don't understand your answer.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2233.36,2240.84,"But -- but then wouldn't the -- the determination would be on an ad hoc basis, creating instability in the lower courts."
2019.17-1678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2240.84,2264.28,"Why? What's the greater instability when you already admit that Bivens -- Bivens would apply if that child was standing two feet from the border? And it even would apply, according to you, if it was an American child standing two feet on the Mexican border."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2274.0,2278.4,"Well, the instability would rise because of the -- the actual areas where you're at."
2019.17-1678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2284.68,2302.2,"So why -- what you're basically saying is Bivens shouldn't apply ever against a border -- a rogue border patrol who just stands there shooting people both on the U.S. side, indiscriminately, takes a gun and just sweeps both sides of the border?"
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2302.2,2304.84,"Well, it would apply to those standing on the United States side certainly."
2019.17-1678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2304.84,2305.28,Well --
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.28,2309.28,Let -- let me ask because I'm putting all my -- this is actually bothering me.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2348.2,2348.6,Assuming --
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.6,2351.28,"That's where I -- that's -- at that point, I hesitate."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2356.16,2362.0,"Assuming Verdugo did not foreclose that, then there would not be a difference."
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2362.0,2371.84,"Well, if there's no difference, then that's the end of it, isn't it, because Kennedy says, look, he says, you've got to find -- he's not talking about the Fourth Amendment."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2394.36,2395.4,Consider the Fourth --
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2395.4,2396.28,Is that what we should do?
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2396.28,2408.44,"Well, the Fourth Amendment, I believe, is foreclosed by Verdugo in its language claiming that a U.S. agent, even acting on foreign soil, is not constrained by the Fourth Amendment."
2019.17-1678,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2408.44,2409.16,I thought your --
2019.17-1678,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2409.16,2411.32,I'm not sure --
2019.17-1678,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2411.32,2442.68,"I thought your point was the foreign policy implications are triggered when it's on the other side of the border, and that's why we give significance to the border, but I want to press on that because wouldn't there be foreign policy implications even if the victim were a Mexican -- Mexican national and killed even on the U.S. side of the border? Those kinds of incidents create lots of international and foreign policy implications as well. So why do foreign policy implications track the border so neatly in your view?"
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2442.68,2456.0,They track the border because the border is a paramilitary area that the border patrol patrols under the guidance of the executive.
2019.17-1678,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2456.0,2464.84,But do you agree there could be serious foreign policy implications even from a incident inside the United States with a victim who's a Mexican national?
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2464.84,2495.4,"Absolutely, just the way that there were in this case dealing with the extradition and the damage -- damages remedy asked for by the Mexican government and the U.S. government deciding -- or opposing their request for a damages remedy. So it's been 40 years and there's been no extension of Bivens beyond the trilogy that this Court has -- has outlined."
2019.17-1678,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2503.24,2512.64,"Should we think about the lack of alternative remedies? Mr. Vladeck mentioned that, there's just no remedy at all, which is unlike not all the Bivens cases but certainly some of them?"
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2512.64,2527.88,"But, when you look at the myriad of special factors, including the separation of powers, national security, foreign diplomacy, public policy, and the projected costs, I think that that creates quite a different -- a different picture of that."
2019.17-1678,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2599.36,2601.72,Why -- why chaos? I guess I'm not seeing that.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2607.48,2611.84,"Well, it would be line drawing, wouldn't it? The line drawing of the border, extension of the border."
2019.17-1678,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2611.84,2612.84,"Well, Justice Sotomayor gave you the line."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2614.72,2615.32,"Well, if he's on -- if they're in --"
2019.17-1678,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2615.32,2617.48,And then you just look --
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2617.48,2620.08,"-- the United States, there's no question --"
2019.17-1678,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2620.08,2623.56,-- and then you just look at the actions to see whether it was excessive force.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2630.16,2649.92,The lower courts have stood on this Court's presumption against the extension in order to provide stability and guidance to them in their decisions. Extending it again and extending it transnationally would create a myriad of problems.
2019.17-1678,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2649.92,2654.6,"Mr. Ortega, I think I'm a little bit confused."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2667.68,2670.96,Ten miles from the border inside of the United States?
2019.17-1678,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2670.96,2690.28,"Yeah, he's a border patrol officer, he's acting within the scope of his employment, it's very important, he's trying to find people who have crossed the border. He's engaged in, you know, usual law enforcement work. Can you bring a Bivens action against that officer?"
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2690.28,2693.56,The injury is occurring in the United States or outside of the United States?
2019.17-1678,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2693.56,2698.88,"You know -- yes, it's -- it's -- it's in the United States, but this is border patrol work."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2701.48,2707.84,"Well, you can bring the Bivens action if he was actually a rogue officer acting outside of policy, which does not present itself here."
2019.17-1678,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2707.84,2716.32,"Well, yeah -- I mean, if -- if -- if we are assuming that the officer used excessive force, you can bring the Bivens action, is that correct?"
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2716.32,2718.28,"If it fell outside the policy, correct."
2019.17-1678,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2719.0,2719.28,Okay.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2731.08,2733.56,"Inside of the -- the United States border, correct."
2019.17-1678,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2733.56,2734.2,Okay.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2745.12,2745.8,Correct.
2019.17-1678,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2745.8,2746.08,Okay.
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2754.92,2756.24,That's correct.
2019.17-1678,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2763.68,2764.96,"Yes, it is a real line."
2019.17-1678,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2770.24,2809.0,"But I guess, you know, usually, the -- the -- the analysis that we go through in a Bivens claim -- and I think that this is the analysis that the government wants us to go through -- is to ask about, are there special foreign affairs concerns? Are there special national security concerns? And the question is, why would there be special foreign affairs and national security concerns with respect to a shooting that occurs three inches on one side of the border versus three inches on the other side of the border or even a little bit away from the border but very much involving border security work?"
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2809.0,2812.44,"If it keeps going, extending into Mexico, then there would be no line."
2019.17-1678,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2824.4,2832.76,"Well, I think we're positing a defendant who is in the United States and who is committing his action in the United States."
2019.17-1678,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2836.24,2837.76,That's correct.
2019.17-1678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2857.08,2865.04,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall."
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2865.04,2873.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A foreign national was killed on foreign soil by a federal officer patrolling an international border."
2019.17-1678,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2949.8,2959.36,"Mr. Wall, the problem is that the allegation here is not about their meeting and talking about policies."
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3008.44,3011.28,"Justice Sotomayor, I'm happy to go through all the reports and the evidence."
2019.17-1678,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3035.56,3035.8,But that --
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3035.8,3036.16,-- the facts on the --
2019.17-1678,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3036.16,3036.36,-- that would mean --
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3036.36,3036.96,"-- ground are, but --"
2019.17-1678,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3036.96,3037.64,But that would have been --
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3037.64,3038.44,-- that's Congress.
2019.17-1678,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3038.44,3040.16,-- that would have been true in Bivens itself.
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3064.04,3068.92,"Yes, as you said in Abbasi, Bivens was a product of an era in which you freely and judiciously --"
2019.17-1678,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3068.92,3070.0,"No, it's not a product of an era."
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3070.0,3070.32,But that's to be --
2019.17-1678,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3070.32,3070.6,I -- I mean --
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3070.6,3072.36,"Justice Sotomayor, that's what the Court said in Abbasi."
2019.17-1678,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3072.76,3073.24,"No, no, no."
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3094.88,3098.12,"I -- Justice Sotomayor, if I may, they're very different."
2019.17-1678,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3135.44,3135.64,I would like --
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3135.64,3136.16,-- really long time.
2019.17-1678,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3136.16,3138.64,-- at some point to hear your three reasons.
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3152.64,3152.8,So --
2019.17-1678,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3152.8,3156.48,"After all, the Fourth Amendment suppresses evidence."
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3156.48,3156.92,So --
2019.17-1678,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3156.92,3166.88,"We're not going to change that, are we? And if the Fourth Amendment applies, suppressing evidence will still happen when there's a violation and, after all, that's arguable in Congress."
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3171.72,3174.16,So I'll try to get through a couple of things really quickly.
2019.17-1678,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3222.28,3222.56,Mr. Wall --
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3222.56,3225.96,"Because, when you're injured abroad, you don't work it out through damages lawsuits."
2019.17-1678,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3231.96,3238.88,"I mean, I think I need to -- somebody to explain to me a little bit the kind of foreign affairs concerns that you're worried about."
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3263.56,3278.68,"I guess the -- the problem is that the United States and Mexico actively discuss incidents at the border, both specific incidents and general policies, right, as they have for years. And, for instance, CBP revised its use of force --"
2019.17-1678,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3278.68,3282.48,And as they did in this case even while the Bivens suit was going forward.
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3291.4,3291.88,That's right.
2019.17-1678,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3298.32,3299.64,I'm looking for any case.
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3299.64,3299.88,Right.
2019.17-1678,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3330.76,3338.84,"I guess I'm -- I'm still looking for, you have -- in one state of the world, you don't have a Bivens claim, in Mr. Hernandez's position."
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3346.68,3359.24,"Justice Kagan, do you really think that the next time we go in to talk to Mexico and we take a position on something at the border they won't say, how is your representation credible? You told us last time that your officer didn't do anything wrong."
2019.17-1678,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3369.6,3369.92,"Yeah, why wouldn't --"
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3369.92,3370.48,-- under Chappell --
2019.17-1678,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3370.48,3377.88,"-- why wouldn't the United States then say, you know, we live in a country in which courts play an important role in determining whether conduct is lawful."
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3383.56,3404.36,"Of course, courts play a role, but the role under Abbasi is a limited one where, if there are special factors that counsel hesitation, the court says we leave it to Congress, even if you disagree with me on foreign relations, you still have clear signals from Congress in terms of the statutes it's passed and you have clear extraterritoriality. And we know from Chappell that you weigh the special factors in aggregate."
2019.17-1678,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3457.0,3458.32,"Did you say you disagree, Mr. Wall?"
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3458.32,3459.12,I do.
2019.17-1678,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3459.12,3462.76,"So the three inches inside the line, what would be the -- the case there?"
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3462.76,3465.32,"I think if you're talk -- I mean, so take the easiest hypothetical."
2019.17-1678,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3479.4,3482.0,And how about 10 miles from the border but doing border security work?
2019.17-1678,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3482.0,3484.44,I think maybe you've still got foreign relations and border security.
2019.17-1678,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3490.64,3494.76,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Vladeck, three minutes."
2019.17-1678,3,62842,stephen_i_vladeck,,3494.76,3518.2,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me just say briefly that I take Mr. Wall's answer to Justice Kagan's last question to mean that the government has now changed its position from Hernandez I, where the government argued that the inside the border hypothetical would be actionable under Bivens. That aside, I mean, I do want to go back to putting this case in the broader context because I think it's important to understand how we got here."
