2007.06-9130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.419,We'll hear argument next in case 06-9130 Ali versus Federal Bureau of Prisons.
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,8.09,28.114,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: The text of Section 2680(c) of the Federal Tort claims act establishes... provision underlying purpose confirm that Congress did not intend the provision to broadly bar all claims arising out of all the tensions of all property by all law enforcement officers."
2007.06-9130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,92.932,102.569,I suppose there is a difference between a sufficient laundry list in a residual phrase and example in a residual phrase.
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,119.031,130.338,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, if I could point out that if the Government had made the argument that you have to have a list, and I think under the Government's interpretation you had to have at least three items, two specific and one general."
2007.06-9130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,213.76,216.087,"Well, not just goods or merchandise."
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,222.583,239.125,"We believe it does, and we believe that when Congress added that language it was simply Congress's sensible recognition that customs and tax officers will detain or seize cash and real property which wouldn't be covered or wouldn't be subsumed under goods and merchandise."
2007.06-9130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,239.125,240.218,So
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,253.681,261.772,"Well, we actually don't think... or I guess I cannot necessarily agree with the first part of what you just said, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-9130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.893,396.062,"Counsel, what do you do about the later... the later statute that makes an exception to the exception?"
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,396.062,406.057,We don't believe that that changes... we don't believe that changes the meaning of the detention cause at all beyond the small change that Congress made.
2007.06-9130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.057,432.547,"I mean it clearly, the exception to the exception says that... that the exception is applicable to any claim based on injury or loss of goods or merchandise, if among other requirements, the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property."
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,437.67,438.498,"Well, Your Honor--"
2007.06-9130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,438.498,446.465,Why do you need that exception to the exception if the exception doesn't cover anything except customs and tax in the first place?
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,446.465,462.27,"--Well, we believe that the fact that Congress decided to not only preserve the detention clause, but also mimic its language in the exception to the exception, means that Congress intended to kind of bring forward the... of course... original meaning as of 1946 of that clause."
2007.06-9130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.08,513.842,They didn't... they didn't need that if indeed it covered all seizures by... by customs and tax officers and nobody else.
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,538.131,544.41,"--There may be more, I was giving you an example, but the one that I gave you, 21 U.S.C. 881, is the one most frequently used."
2007.06-9130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.834,578.615,What work does it do?
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,590.361,604.76,"Under our interpretation, if a customs or tax officer or another law enforcement officer acting in a custom or tax capacity detains property and injures it... and it doesn't matter under which forfeiture law they detain the property--"
2007.06-9130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.76,605.573,Right.
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,605.573,619.708,"--and the plaintiff is ultimately successful, I'm sorry, I guess... yes, the plaintiff is ultimately successful in defeating the Government's claim for forfeiture, then they can sue under the FTCA for the damage to their property."
2007.06-9130,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,619.708,647.415,"Mr. Andre, it may be that things would fall into place easier if you would give us an example or examples of instances in which any other law enforcement officer would be engaged in detaining property in... in the course of enforcing customs or excise laws."
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,659.395,659.895,Sure.
2007.06-9130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,725.352,729.336,"Did you say IRS officers, because they would be covered?"
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,732.21,733.365,--Right.
2007.06-9130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,760.26,763.447,You gave an example in your brief that didn't seem to fit.
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,776.88,778.707,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-9130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,791.155,796.903,"But they were doing it for their primary business, which was to detect narcotics."
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,796.903,797.184,That's right.
2007.06-9130,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,840.465,853.975,"Could we interpret the term ""law enforcement""... ""any other law enforcement officer"" to be limited to those law enforcement officers whose duties generally include the detention of goods?"
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,853.975,863.157,"Well, I don't think so, Justice Alito, because we weren't really prepared to debate what exactly ""detention"" means."
2007.06-9130,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,872.482,873.935,"Well, why doesn't it?"
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,896.988,897.847,--I agree.
2007.06-9130,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,926.288,933.082,"Well, you don't think that concept sheds light on what Congress had in mind when it referred to any other Federal law enforcement officer?"
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,933.082,937.065,"I... I don't, but I don't want to resist you too much either."
2007.06-9130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,994.777,1000.589,"But, I mean that's always true when you have an example and a more general phrase."
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1010.037,1035.277,"Well, there certainly are some cases that would appear to go both ways, although I think if you take a look at the cases cited by the government, those cases involve pretty... I realize we have an unclear, bizarre statute here as well, but those are pretty bizarre statutes the government is relying on where the Court has, and more often than not, it has also been as an alternative statement, you could even say possibly dicta, where the Court has said, oh, Congress can give examples."
2007.06-9130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1055.535,1058.783,"Yes, but S.D. Marine wouldn't have come out the other way."
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1058.783,1060.423,That's true.
2007.06-9130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1060.423,1062.796,Was that an obscure statute in S.D. Marine?
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1062.796,1064.139,I'm sorry.
2007.06-9130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1067.951,1074.511,"Doesn't the word, as your brother argues, doesn't ""any"" cut against you?"
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1084.57,1090.521,"Well, as kind of a practical matter, we don't think that when you have a statute like this, the word ""any"" really does a lot of work."
2007.06-9130,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1136.268,1145.733,"May I ask, following up on Justice Alito's question, has there ever been a debate in earlier stages in this litigation as to whether this was a detention?"
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1145.733,1146.655,"No, there was not."
2007.06-9130,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.655,1150.372,"Because if it were not a detention, then you'd win."
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1150.372,1151.605,Absolutely.
2007.06-9130,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1151.605,1156.276,I'm just wondering why you didn't make the argument somewhere along the line.
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1156.276,1158.776,"Well, my client was pro se in the Court of Appeals, and he didn't raise it there."
2007.06-9130,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.361,1188.138,"But it is clear... there are so many exceptions from exceptions from exceptions, that you get a little mixed up, but I am clear, am I not, that if it were not a detention, you would win?"
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1188.138,1190.981,Absolutely.
2007.06-9130,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.981,1191.45,Everybody agrees.
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1191.45,1197.01,"If there was not a detention or if the BOP guard was not an any other law enforcement, we would win under either two of those independent analyses."
2007.06-9130,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.01,1205.616,"And is it also not clear that under the government's... I guess I should ask them, but I got it right in front of me now... if you deleted the words"
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1217.361,1218.127,That's exactly right.
2007.06-9130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1295.346,1298.703,But the President doesn't rely on those when he signs the statute into law.
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1298.703,1299.344,--No.
2007.06-9130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1362.24,1365.223,Does that still exist after the Westfall Act?
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1365.223,1372.221,"Well, we believe it would if... well, actually that's a very good question."
2007.06-9130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.188,1379.717,"Because now, the... there wouldn't be... the United States would be substituted--"
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1379.717,1380.811,Right.
2007.06-9130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1380.811,1382.076,--for the agent's abuses.
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1382.076,1393.135,"Right, but then in that situation, once the United States substituted, they could seek dismissal because the Westfall Act doesn't override any exceptions to the FTCA."
2007.06-9130,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1443.442,1448.315,How do we know... how do we know that that's the only purpose of this exception?
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1448.315,1462.138,"Well, as I mentioned, this Court suggested in Kosak that that was the only only purpose, but then in Hatzlachh and in Gutierrez v. Martinez, this Court twice stated that that was the only purpose, and the Court did so for good reason."
2007.06-9130,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1473.243,1477.632,This is all based on Judge Holtzoff's testimony?
2007.06-9130,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1482.021,1487.94,"And it's also based on the testimony of Colonel O.R. McGuire, who is general counsel for the Comptroller General."
2007.06-9130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1520.302,1521.192,"Thank you, Mr. Andre."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1523.66,1538.233,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 2680(c) preserves the government's immunity against tort claims concerning the detention of property by any law enforcement officer."
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1561.677,1564.769,"Mr. Shanmugam, may I ask you... this goes to your ambiguity point."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1583.512,1589.336,"Yes, I think that's correct with one caveat, Justice Souter, and I don't mean to quibble, but I think that this is important."
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1604.847,1605.128,Right.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1605.128,1615.592,"--used that phrase, and he may then have decided to expand it to other law enforcement officers simply because he concluded that there was no basis for treating other law enforcement officers differently."
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1615.592,1616.202,But wouldn't--
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1616.202,1616.577,So--
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1616.577,1640.66,--But wouldn't the way to do that would have made it at least clearer that that's what Congress or what he had in mind and what Congress was getting at would have been to provide that the... that the exception referred to law enforcement officers including an officer or customs of excise?
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1666.416,1670.772,--I--
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1670.772,1678.425,"So, number one, it is less clear and it really raises the question: Weren't they trying to get simply at law enforcement officers who were doing the customs and excise function?"
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1689.157,1707.68,"--Justice Souter, it is certainly true that Congress could have written that statute that way and indeed could have omitted the customs or excise officers entirely, and that certainly would be a clearer statute in the sense that I don't think that Mr. Andre would be here if we had a statute that simply referred to any law enforcement officer."
2007.06-9130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.222,1755.707,It's also--
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1755.707,1756.051,So--
2007.06-9130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.051,1762.127,--It's also not entirely clear what... whether it's a tail or not.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1801.487,1821.806,"Assuming for present purposes, Justice Scalia, that the dog here is any officer of customs or excise, I think that the critical point is that the tail was indeed smaller than it would be today because customs and excise officers were among the most important federal law enforcement officers."
2007.06-9130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.806,1822.588,If you--
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1822.588,1822.916,--You know--
2007.06-9130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1822.916,1832.006,"--No, but... but a short time ago you said there was no basis for distinguishing between excise officers and all other law enforcement officers."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1843.47,1855.215,"--Well, we believe, first of all, that if one looks at this Court's decision in Kosak, the Court did not in any way suggest that the availability of alternative remedies was the sole purpose--"
2007.06-9130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1855.215,1862.57,"I'm not suggesting that, but that is a reason for drawing a distinction between all others and this particular claim."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1862.57,1877.018,"--Justice Stevens, it certainly was one of Congress's primary purposes in creating the exceptions generally, but we do believe that our interpretation of the statute serves that purpose, albeit to a lesser extent perhaps than it serves the other congressional purposes, but that was--"
2007.06-9130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1877.018,1879.112,It didn't serve that purpose before 2000.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1879.112,1892.433,"It did serve that purpose, Justice Stevens, because there was an alternative remedy, albeit one that was not federally funded and that was a common-law action against a law enforcement officer in his personal capacity for negligence."
2007.06-9130,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1892.433,1893.917,Why wasn't it federally funded?
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1896.87,1917.144,"There was a provision for indemnification for revenue officers and other officers essentially acting in a revenue capacity, I believe that the exact statutory language was ""collectors and other revenue officers""... and that indemnification provision, to be sure, would not have applied to garden variety law enforcement officers."
2007.06-9130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1948.147,1954.379,"Do you actually have any information about the early 1940s, about who was a Federal law enforcement officer?"
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1984.164,2000.048,"--It's very difficult to quantify, Justice Breyer, but I do think we have some sense historically of the state of play at various law enforcement agencies; and the FBI was in a relatively nascent stage in 1946."
2007.06-9130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2009.513,2012.216,I think the FBI had quite a big job in World War II.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2012.216,2013.278,It did.
2007.06-9130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.2,2018.072,I thought there were thousands and thousands and thousands of FBI people.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2018.072,2018.635,"--Well, I don't--"
2007.06-9130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2018.635,2019.182,So do we know?
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2021.649,2021.836,--Yeah.
2007.06-9130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.804,2027.303,We don't even have a ballpark.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2027.303,2049.576,"--I can't offer you a ballpark, but I think what I can say, and this accords with observations that various members of this Court have made over the years, is that there were simply far fewer Federal criminal provisions then than there are now, and I think that that is one of the reasons why we've really seen an explosion in the number of these cases as time has gone on, while the FTCA--"
2007.06-9130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2049.576,2050.606,"Well, well that might be."
2007.06-9130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.652,2100.134,"Do the members of Congress who voted on this language, when it was presented to them, did they even know who Judge Holtzoff was?"
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2100.134,2101.085,"--Well, they may very well--"
2007.06-9130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.085,2103.023,Did he testify to this effect before one of the committees?
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2103.023,2107.083,--He did testify before one of the committees.
2007.06-9130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2108.567,2110.878,"15 years before it was passed, right?"
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2110.878,2122.577,"--15 years before it was passed, Judge Holtzoff wrote this report, and as both the majority and Justice Stevens in his dissenting opinion in Kosak observed, there was no evidence that this report was even introduced into the legislative record."
2007.06-9130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2122.577,2135.291,"So... so if it was not... I mean, I would suspect at that time Judge Holtzoff was a pretty well known person in the legal community and I would suspected if we are guessing at such a thing that quite a few did know who he was."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2144.084,2144.725,Yes.
2007.06-9130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2144.896,2150.658,"So if we are going to play a magic game that we don't pay attention to what sheds light on it, fine, then we don't, but I would."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2150.658,2163.795,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I wanted simply to make the point that in the pantheon of legislative history sources for those members of the Court who are interested in legislative history, we recognized that the Holtzoff report should not be afforded great weight."
2007.06-9130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2195.047,2197.858,Is there any legislative history about what Judge Holtzoff meant by that?
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2197.858,2212.104,"--Well, one could make the argument that that legislative history is itself ambiguous; and indeed the D.C. Circuit in adopting Petitioner's construction itself acknowledged that at best, the legislative history was as unclear as the statute."
2007.06-9130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.756,2223.318,"But I think in reading that, I think that's a good point."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2260.162,2268.362,"Well, I think, Justice Breyer, with all respect, that this is not a case in which very much of a conclusion can be drawn from the legislative history one way or another."
2007.06-9130,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2326.4,2338.897,You have a difference with Mr. Andre on the extent to which other law enforcement officers assist customs and revenue agents.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2348.408,2363.371,"Well, we do believe that it is a rare occurrence, but in some sense, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the answer to that question depends on exactly what it is that Petitioner means when he says that an officer is acting in a customs or tax capacity."
2007.06-9130,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2485.979,2489.915,Are all customs and excise officers law enforcement officers?
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2489.915,2501.88,"All customs officers, by statute, have law-enforcement authority, and that is under, I believe, 19 U.S.C. 1589(a)."
2007.06-9130,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2517.014,2533.694,"Are there other circumstances in which, let's say, goods are being shipped into the country, and the... the shipment is detained by someone who is not a law-enforcement officer, at least under the definition in subsection (h), someone who has the power to execute searches, seize evidence, and make arrests?"
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2533.694,2547.765,"I think they typically would be, and I'm not aware of any examples in which they would not be, because customs officers are the vast majority of people who are employed by the various customs-related agencies."
2007.06-9130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2599.136,2601.322,Have you... have you found any... any research on that?
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2640.713,2643.962,"I wish that I could point to such a book, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2713.668,2722.321,"Mr. Shanmugam, before you get into policy, may I just suggest that there is a possible fourth category, really."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2820.626,2839.807,"--Well, Justice Souter, I think, with no disrespect to the good law-enforcement officers of New Hampshire, that these cases come up far more rarely in the Federal context, because both customs officers and Internal Revenue officers are law-enforcement officers who have, I think, quite a refined capability."
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2845.695,2851.254,Do IRS agents have... have expertise in... bomb detection and dismantling?
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2851.254,2859.221,--There certainly might very well be cases in which they would feel the need to call in the FBI or other law-enforcement agencies.
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2866.185,2871.388,"Well, there don't seem to be many cases because... I mean that's why we've got this one at this point."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2871.388,2873.948,"Well, there are quite a few cases more generally."
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2882.913,2884.288,Over what period of time?
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2884.288,2886.757,Over the 60-year period of the enactment of the FTCA.
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2886.757,2889.317,"Well, I mean that's not... that's not a deluge of litigation."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2905.17,2916.384,"But our fundamental submission, Justice Souter, is that there is no good textual reason for confining the phrase ""any other law-enforcement officer"", because that phrase, in our view, is unambiguous."
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2940.703,2949.684,"Yes, but the question of what is... what is ambiguous or not is... is a question of context."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2988.277,2999.633,"I don't believe that that's correct, Justice Souter, and the reason that I don't believe that that is correct is because this Court has suggested that the starting point is the relevant phrase that is being interpreted."
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3002.241,3004.084,"But then you are saying, don't read the statute as a whole."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3008.706,3010.299,"Well, no, Justice Souter."
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3016.203,3017.203,I agree with you.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3025.574,3026.606,"--Well, let me--"
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3026.606,3031.213,And my suggestion is that it is the context that makes your argument a tough sell.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3031.213,3037.788,"--Let me try to explain to you why you should make that assumption, and it is because Congress here used the word ""any""."
2007.06-9130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3058.826,3061.154,"But you are talking about the use of the word ""any"" all by itself."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3070.199,3072.636,"Well, we wouldn't be taking the words out of the statute, because we do believe--"
2007.06-9130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3072.636,3073.869,But you believe they add nothing to the text of the statute.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3073.869,3078.571,--They add nothing to the text of the statute in the sense that Congress could have written the statute to refer to any law-enforcement officer.
2007.06-9130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3101.438,3103.842,"There are two ""anys"" here."
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3105.108,3109.794,"I'm certainly referring to the ""any"" that modifies ""any other law enforcement officer""."
2007.06-9130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3109.794,3110.09,--Any other.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3122.881,3123.178,That's right.
2007.06-9130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.819,3126.865,"But if they repeat ""or any other law enforcement""--"
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3126.865,3127.505,--That's right.
2007.06-9130,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3169.879,3171.52,They were on point for my dissent.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3172.987,3177.517,"Well, I think... I would respectfully submit that they are on point to our construction as well."
2007.06-9130,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3180.844,3197.415,"I know your time is running out, but I would like you also to say a word about what remedy, if any, does Ali have when you're saying he had his prayer rug and Koran, and the government lost them and he didn't get any compensation?"
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3198.087,3199.181,"--Sure, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-9130,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3256.611,3261.532,But there's no court... there's no court role in that process.
2007.06-9130,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3261.532,3267.233,"There is no court role in that process, but the Bureau of Prisons routinely processes these administrative claims."
2007.06-9130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3327.911,3328.489,"Thank you, Mr. Shanmugam."
2007.06-9130,2,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3331.144,3342.514,I'd like to first address the government's resistance to making any concession that the statute is ambiguous.
2007.06-9130,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3546.901,3549.229,Wouldn't they have IFP status?
2007.06-9130,2,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3549.229,3553.993,"--Even if a prisoner gets IFP status, they still have to pay the full filing fee."
2007.06-9130,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3567.003,3572.454,Here there wasn't that much at stake.
2007.06-9130,2,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3572.454,3573.11,That's correct.
2007.06-9130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3614.171,3615.234,"Thank you, Mr. Andre."
