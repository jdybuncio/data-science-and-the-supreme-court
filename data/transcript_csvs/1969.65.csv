1969.65,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.769,"Number 65, Breen against the Selective Service Board."
1969.65,0,22770,emanuel_margolis,,21.769,24.276,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please it the Court.
1969.65,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,24.276,27.859,Mr. Margolis.
1969.65,0,22770,emanuel_margolis,,27.859,43.062,"The question presented in this case, I think, can be fairly reduced to the following whether in the light of this Court's decisions in Oestereich and Gabriel."
1969.65,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1135.971,1143.704,"In your brief, I think you state that the Vice President of the United States has given an explicit --"
1969.65,0,22770,emanuel_margolis,,1143.704,1144.348,Deferment.
1969.65,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1144.348,1145.205,Is that the deferment or --
1969.65,0,22770,emanuel_margolis,,1145.205,1146.668,That's a deferment (Voice Overlap).
1969.65,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1146.668,1147.227,It is simply deferred.
1969.65,0,22770,emanuel_margolis,,1147.227,1149.189,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart that is a deferment."
1969.65,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1149.462,1150.568,That's while he is Vice President?
1969.65,0,22770,emanuel_margolis,,1150.568,1153.787,"As long as he is Vice President, he only has a deferment."
1969.65,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1161.399,1164.87,And that is also true to the members of this Court?
1969.65,0,22770,emanuel_margolis,,1164.87,1166.996,That's true of members of this Court.
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1537.201,1542.609,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.443,1784.721,Is there anything direct to show why he was brought in?
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1784.721,1799.532,"He was brought in the -- Mr. Justice Marshall, because he violated one of the regulations, the delinquency regulations were applied to him and because he violated a regulation which provides that you must have your registration certificate --"
1969.65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1799.532,1803.766,How did they know he didn't have his certificate?
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1803.766,1817.643,"Because it was reported to them apparently by the marshal or by the -- and when he returned his registration certification into the clergyman on November 16, 1967."
1969.65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1817.643,1819.914,How did they find that out?
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1819.914,1822.888,I really can't recall exactly how did they find that out?
1969.65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1822.888,1826.818,"Well, isn't it interesting that all of the people they picked him?"
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1826.818,1835.981,"Well, I think that anyone that violates a regulation of this nature where it comes to the attention of the local board would be accelerated."
1969.65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.981,1844.33,And you consider that the handing in of its registration certificate was not the form of expression.
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1844.33,1858.878,"Well, I think it's a form of mixed expression and conduct and under the cases in this Court where there is a mixture and where there is a valid governmental purpose to be had in the regulation which is violated."
1969.65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1872.656,1875.38,Did you mean sanctions or punishment?
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1875.38,1893.314,"Well, I will get to that, Mr. Justice Marshall, I'll address myself that now, if you care to the question of punishment as far as it's concerned in this case involves the -- and it also involves the case as follows."
1969.65,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1918.472,1920.523,"That is the question of this case, is it Mr. Ruckelshaus?"
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1920.523,1922.091,"Yes, it think it is, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1969.65,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1922.091,1924.791,And the sole question asked is the --
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1924.791,1926.062,I think it is the --
1969.65,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1926.062,1930.148,"We get to the other question or at least a part of it in the next case, is that right?"
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1930.148,1933.363,"I think that's right, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1969.65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2555.767,2560.606,"But if Oestereich did left the divinity school, what would happen?"
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2560.606,2567.653,If he would -- The question of permanency does not I think put them inside or outside the pool of manpower.
1969.65,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2576.524,2578.564,"Well, then just one more question would help me."
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2588.957,2603.343,"I think that, Mr. Justice Marshall, they are referring to the question of whether there was any discretion given to the President to defer students and in the 1967 Act, there was no discretion given."
1969.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2947.282,2953.094,"Under your argument, would this man have in ane relief at all?"
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2953.094,2955.853,Mr. Justice Black he would have completes relief.
1969.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2997.557,3002.046,Would it be too late now for him to raise a question about habeas corpus?
1969.65,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,3002.046,3004.627,"Well, it would not be too late, Mr. Justice Black."
1969.65,2,22770,emanuel_margolis,,3023.997,3029.282,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.65,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3252.255,3255.576,"Well, it wouldn't interrupt this service though, would it?"
1969.65,2,22770,emanuel_margolis,,3255.576,3256.108,Your Honor?
1969.65,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3256.108,3258.01,It wouldn't interrupt his military service.
1969.65,2,22770,emanuel_margolis,,3258.01,3273.444,"No, but I think when the reference is made to litigious interruption, then the policy is not with reference to interruption of service, it's with reference to the interruption of calling men to service and it has to do with the calling men into the Armed Forces."
