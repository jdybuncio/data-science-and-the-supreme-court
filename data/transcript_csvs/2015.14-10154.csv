2015.14-10154,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.69,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-10154, Voisine and Armstrong v. United States. Ms. Villa."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,9.69,30.75,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three reasons to exclude reckless misdemeanors from the phrase ""use... of physical force"" as occurs in 921(a)(33). The first is that it's consistent with the definition of use that this Court has implemented in other cases."
2015.14-10154,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,40.305,44.52,But it's inconsistent with the treatment of bodily injury.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,82.395,92.84,"The same state of mind should attach to each, and that is why intentionality is the state of mind that under the common law can attach to each."
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,108.6,122.465,"I'm sorry. Intentionality, in my mind, is misperceived, because you think -- you're talking about intentionality as the act of causing the injury."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,155.325,158.045,"I respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,158.51,159.03,I know.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,166.48,179.0,"That's only on injury cases, and so you don't have that same confirmation or that same organization of the law with respect to offensive physical contact."
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,198.55,207.515,But -- but the point is that the contact was in -- was -- some contact had to have occurred.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,207.515,207.97,Correct.
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,207.97,216.96,The question is whether there was an act that caused that contact regardless of whether it was intentional or reckless.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,216.96,233.155,"The problem under the common law is that not all touches were considered to be illegal. And so that is why in Johnson, this Court stated the common law as being the intentional application of unlawful force."
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,233.155,239.88,"Well, we were talking about common-law battery as it applied to -- definition as it applied in a domestic setting."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,242.28,242.545,This --
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,242.545,243.745,-- which this is.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,243.745,256.845,"This is serious but the problem is, is that the government's formulation of any reckless conduct satisfying use of physical force is that it's not limited to batteries."
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,256.845,266.445,But the mens rea of recklessness could apply to the act of touching or to whether the act is offensive.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,271.81,274.96,Statutorily it does apply to both.
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,274.96,284.24,"So if someone recklessly touches another person and that is offensive, that's a battery under Maine law?"
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,284.24,284.98,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,290.65,292.8,And what happened in that case?
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,292.8,309.68,"It was whether the defendant got a -- an instruction on the simple battery rather than the sexual offensive contact, and so that the Court reversed it because it said that it was a proper instruction."
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,309.68,315.28,"No, I mean what were the facts? What did this person do that was -- involved a reckless touching?"
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,315.28,330.94,"He went to wake in -- his stepdaughter, I believe, who was asleep on a couch, reached underneath a blanket and -- to shake her awake, and touched her naked body."
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,330.94,338.1,"Well, that -- that seems like the recklessness there goes to the -- the offensive nature of the touching, not to the touching itself."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,338.1,338.74,No.
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,338.74,344.825,"In other words, there's the act of touching, so he -- he went to shake her but he didn't intend to touch her?"
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,344.825,353.125,It was -- there can be recklessness as to result or recklessness as to circumstance.
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,369.81,371.64,I don't really understand the -- the answer.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,375.0,375.89,"No, he did intend to touch her."
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,375.89,375.98,Okay.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,387.545,388.19,Correct.
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,388.19,396.785,And so then it seems like your answer to my question is that it is in the latter that has the mens rea of recklessness.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,396.785,401.87,"Under the Maine statute, it is the latter that has the mens rea of recklessness."
2015.14-10154,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,421.305,421.7,Can I --
2015.14-10154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,421.7,429.74,What is it that indicates that the Federal statute tracks the common law? The Federal statute gives its own definition.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,429.74,443.35,"Your Honor, the Federal statute is the use of physical force, and so it is only because of Castleman having adopted the common law for purposes of force."
2015.14-10154,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,485.63,499.64,"Ms. Villa, can I understand what you said? You said you're relying primarily, then, not on the common-law history but on the -- the -- just the language, ""use... of physical force"" and what that means, the ordinary meaning of those words, is that correct?"
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,499.64,503.83,The Court has to deal with the ordinary meaning of those words.
2015.14-10154,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,516.79,531.99,"But why isn't -- any of these examples that people give about the reckless behavior? Why -- why couldn't that be a use of force? I mean, Justice Sotomayor said throwing a plate against a wall."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,558.74,570.75,"There's a substantive difference, though, between driving recklessly and not intending to harm the person that is with you in the car and throwing an object at a person."
2015.14-10154,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,584.03,591.245,"Of course, you're -- you're adding language to the statute now because you said against another person, and that is indeed the language in Leocal."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,620.21,629.995,I had a client once who pled guilty to a misdemeanor where he was actually running away from a guy who was trying to beat him up.
2015.14-10154,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,637.66,638.29,You just said it.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,640.365,640.68,He did.
2015.14-10154,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,640.68,642.75,That's the -- that's the use of physical force.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,642.75,645.08,It was the use of physical force.
2015.14-10154,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,653.23,653.7,I know.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,672.1,681.445,"But the Court has said, with all due respect, that it is to -- carrying out an action or purpose by means of force."
2015.14-10154,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,695.61,696.52,"Well, quite right."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,739.66,745.34,"But not in the sense that the Court has construed ""use"" in the past."
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,804.69,821.83,"Don't you have to look at this in the domestic violence context? Because the definition, ""use of force"" as put in terms of a misdemeanor under Federal or State triable law, means -- so it means a domestic violence."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,852.37,863.93,"Because domestic violence, according to the Castleman opinion was violence or nonviolent conduct that's offensive, and is offensive --"
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,863.93,865.54,That's the offensive touching prong.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,866.54,866.89,Excuse me?
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,866.89,869.12,That was the offensive touching prong.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,872.61,873.74,Except for --
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,873.74,876.315,-- that causes injury in some way.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,876.315,889.915,"But it's a singular definition. It's ""use... of physical force."" Whether it is touching or not, it is something that is intended to control one's partner."
2015.14-10154,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,911.69,934.365,"The government tells us that this is -- heavy consequences ride on this, that is, that many domestic violence situations would not be subject to prosecution under this statute on your read, if you require knowing or intentional, rather than reckless, state of mind."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,934.365,935.3,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,935.3,936.85,Do you agree with that?
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,936.85,939.745,I don't necessarily agree with that.
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,991.02,1007.105,"Do you think that prosecutors, when they are State prosecutors, when they are charging these domestic violence offenses, are going to be looking ahead to the consequences of the particular charge for Federal firearms laws?"
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1007.105,1007.82,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1007.82,1008.715,Do you think that's realistic?
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1008.715,1009.39,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1024.66,1026.65,"Well, let me ask you this, which is somewhat unrelated."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1038.26,1039.37,"1996, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1039.37,1039.59,Okay.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1050.735,1055.535,"The offensive contact battery, yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1055.535,1055.94,All right.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1069.315,1069.97,Because of the --
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1069.97,1081.365,"At -- at that time, am I not -- is it not correct that by that time a majority of the States had battery offenses that reached reckless conduct?"
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1081.365,1084.965,You are correct that many States did.
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1099.1,1110.87,"Well, I under -- I understand that, but I thought you agree that ""battery"" in some sense falls within the definite -- falls within the category of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1110.87,1114.715,"I have to, because of the Castleman so ruled."
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1114.715,1114.96,Yeah.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1132.52,1133.59,Your Honor --
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1133.59,1134.695,"I mean, is that realistic?"
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1134.695,1137.625,"Your Honor, that is not my position."
2015.14-10154,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1203.55,1204.565,I think you're losing me.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1218.15,1231.855,"Under the common law in about the mid 1800s, there was a subset of batteries that did adopt a negligent -- not a negligence, but a recklessness factor."
2015.14-10154,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1236.37,1244.02,What was that -- what was that category? That was the category where bodily injury resulted; is that right?
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1244.02,1245.14,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1245.14,1256.98,"So the answer to Justice Alito's question is, yes, that bodily injury does trigger this statute. It's the question I opened with."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1280.249,1291.34,"Because it would be inconsistent with the idea that when you adopt a common law term, that you adopt all of the soil that went with that common --"
2015.14-10154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1291.34,1293.015,"Well, what's the common law term?"
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1293.015,1297.77,"The common law term is the ""battery"" term as informing force."
2015.14-10154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1299.34,1300.055,Excuse me.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1303.095,1319.23,"It is ""use."" And so force was at issue in Castleman, and that's where this Court identified the common law battery -- the level of force involved in a common law battery as being the level of force for purposes of the statute."
2015.14-10154,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1319.23,1325.11,"But we wouldn't think that the common law has some great definition of the word ""use,"" would we?"
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1325.11,1326.73,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1335.23,1335.33,Yeah.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1335.33,1336.09,-- so I'm just saying that --
2015.14-10154,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1336.09,1355.47,"I mean, I hear you today as basically making an ordinary meaning argument, which I think is a good thing because all the briefing on both sides of this has been talking about the common law until it's coming out of your ears, and it's not clear to me why the common law makes any difference at all here. I mean, you know, Congress was operating against a backdrop."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1392.26,1395.94,Because Congress used a narrower definition than many battery statutes.
2015.14-10154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1403.785,1409.37,"But Congress doesn't -- the -- the statute doesn't talk -- say -- say the word ""battery."" It doesn't use it."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1409.37,1410.92,"Does not use the word ""battery."""
2015.14-10154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1410.92,1412.58,It defines it in -- in this special way.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1412.58,1414.79,It defines it in a very special way.
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1494.29,1506.82,"Can you please go back to the question Justice Kagan asked you and not using the shaking somebody, because I don't understand how shaking someone doesn't constitute the use of physical force."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1523.95,1524.56,It's --
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1524.56,1527.15,-- it has to be intentionally offensive.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1527.15,1527.85,Correct.
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1527.85,1529.545,-- as opposed to --
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1529.545,1554.085,"And so if the government's formulation were adopted, and I came up to somebody who I thought was my husband and I patted him on the back and say, hi, honey, and he turns around and it's like, oh, my gosh, it isn't him. I had -- I touched him."
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1573.73,1577.88,"It always involves, however, the touching."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1577.88,1579.11,It is --
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1579.11,1583.385,And the use of force to constitute the touching.
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1583.385,1590.57,It could be by poisoning; it could be by taking a pen out of somebody's hands.
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1590.57,1594.875,So what difference does it make whether it's intentional or reckless --
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1594.875,1595.53,It --
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1595.53,1599.68,-- in terms of the culpability involved?
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1599.68,1612.36,"In terms of the culpability, it's because it's not your intent to actually harm somebody in closing a door."
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1612.36,1613.47,But the --
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1613.47,1614.13,And so --
2015.14-10154,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1614.13,1626.86,"-- use of force -- and -- and we're giving examples that are not domestic violence examples, but that has caused a sufficiently offensive touching to constitute a crime."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1629.33,1635.51,"And it could be prosecuted for many reasons, including must arrest."
2015.14-10154,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1660.26,1667.66,"The example that you gave, though, would never come under this statute, because there isn't a relationship."
2015.14-10154,0,62671,virginia_g_villa,,1681.36,1684.58,That is true.
2015.14-10154,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1716.33,1728.69,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Eisenstein."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1728.69,1755.845,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has twice interpreted Section 922(g)(9) in Hazen and Castleman, and each time concluded that Congress intended to keep guns away from those convicted of assault and battery under generally applicable State and Federal and Tribal law. Petitioner attempts to distinguish between offenses that cause bodily injury and those that involve offensive touching."
2015.14-10154,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1833.165,1852.635,"What's so bad about that? I mean, given her door example, for example, why should the accidental or perhaps you would say she -- you know, he or she knew that the person was close, why should that constitute misdemeanor crime of domestic violence?"
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1852.635,1856.53,"Well, in part because Congress intended to cover batteries."
2015.14-10154,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1902.045,1905.14,"Well, I mean, you don't know; you're running away."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1916.375,1924.33,I think to the degree to which the -- the individual consciously disregards the substantial --
2015.14-10154,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1924.33,1924.47,Yeah.
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1931.16,1976.08,"But -- but I think that the -- what feels wrong about the hypothetical is not the -- the degree of intent of the actor -- it's the extent to which that person may be justified in the door slamming, which was that this was an act, perhaps, of self-defense. I think the more prototypical examples are situations where -- that this Court highlighted in Castleman, where an individual takes intentional action to make contact with their loved one and does so in a way that is reckless as to whether, for example, if there's a push, reckless as to whether his wife simply stumbles backwards or falls down and injures herself. And that's the way States overwhelmingly frame their assault and battery statutes. And that's what --"
2015.14-10154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1976.08,1985.38,Justice Ginsburg's example of operating an automobile: A husband is arguing with his wife and speeds through a stop sign and the wife is injured.
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1987.22,1998.925,"Well, Your Honor, I think that under an assault, a general assault and battery statute, it's theoretically possible that a person could be convicted of battering his or her spouse under those circumstances."
2015.14-10154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2007.98,2012.065,"Well, the -- the Maine statute says ""recklessly causes bodily injury."""
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2012.065,2019.385,"So there -- and I agree with Your Honor that in theory, that type of offense could constitute a battery."
2015.14-10154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2043.88,2044.99,I'm not talking about overbreadth.
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2055.0,2056.3,"Correct, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2085.52,2087.82,"It's narrow, but it seems to qualify under the statute."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2094.88,2105.08,"I think it's a violation under the meaning of general assault and battery, but I also think that there's nothing wrong with -- as Justice Kagan suggested, with treating that type of offense as disqualifying."
2015.14-10154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2105.08,2107.87,So you're saying that the example is covered by the statute.
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2107.87,2127.625,"Yes, Your Honor. And I think, though, that to the extent to which that raises a concern in terms of overbreadth, I don't think this Court should be concerned about that, because what Congress was worried about wasn't an overbreadth of these prosecutions against family members."
2015.14-10154,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2141.48,2153.94,Which of our -- which of our cases say that you don't have to worry if the categorical approach covers conduct of the sort Justice Kennedy was talking about because Congress meant to cover other things?
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2153.94,2165.525,"Well, Your Honor, I think that you're right that the categorical approach and its strictures can cause real problems if there's any degree of overbreadth in the statute."
2015.14-10154,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2190.61,2208.615,"I'm not sure ""overbreadth"" -- I'm not sure overbreadth is the right legal term. So you think it's an appropriate defense under a prosecution here that the type of conduct I was charged with is really not what Congress had in mind? Yes, it fits under the terms of the statute, but it's not what Congress had in mind."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2210.765,2211.65,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2234.54,2242.75,"I feel like your answer was that the statute does cover it, but it's most unlikely that a prosecutor would bring such a case."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2245.335,2260.02,"That's correct, Your Honor. I think it's unlikely that those prosecutions would be brought in the State offense on those -- under those circumstances and that there's no reason to drastically constrain the interpretation of Section 922(g)(9)."
2015.14-10154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2260.02,2267.41,"Do we have precedent from this Court saying it's okay, we can trust the prosecutors to do the right thing? Can you cite me a case that says that?"
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2267.41,2270.93,"Your Honor, I -- I -- I do not -- I do not represent that."
2015.14-10154,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2303.4,2304.1,I don't know how --
2015.14-10154,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2304.1,2316.19,"What about the -- what about the -- the rule of lenity? We are reviewing a decision of a court that divided, and both judges wrote very strong opinions."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2342.12,2346.99,"Your Honor, the rule of lenity only applies where there is grievous ambiguity in the statute."
2015.14-10154,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2496.58,2505.205,"Ms. Eisenstein, one question. Can you give me -- this is a misdemeanor violation."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2517.54,2532.255,"Your Honor, I -- I'm thinking about that, but I think that the -- the question is not -- as I understand Your Honor's question, the culpability necessarily of the act or in terms of the offense --"
2015.14-10154,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2532.255,2558.74,"Well, I'm -- I'm looking at the -- you're saying that recklessness is sufficient to trigger a violation -- misdemeanor violation of domestic conduct that results in a lifetime ban on possession of a gun, which, at least as of now, is still a constitutional right."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2558.74,2560.77,"Your Honor, to address --"
2015.14-10154,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2560.77,2568.39,Can you think of another constitutional right that can be suspended based upon a misdemeanor violation of a State law?
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2568.39,2591.17,"Your Honor, while I can't think of specifically triggered by a misdemeanor violation, other examples, for example, in the First Amendment context, have allowed for suspension or limitation of a right to free speech or even free association in contexts where there is a compelling interest and risks associated in some cases less than a compelling interest under intermediate scrutiny."
2015.14-10154,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2591.17,2597.495,I'm -- this is a -- how long is this suspension of the right to own a firearm?
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2597.495,2600.36,"Your Honor, the right is suspended indefinitely."
2015.14-10154,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2600.36,2600.8,Okay.
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2609.165,2615.77,"Your Honor, it's not necessarily permanent as to the individual, but it may be permanent as to a particular harm."
2015.14-10154,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2632.43,2644.87,"So in each of these cases had -- did any of the defendants, or in this case Petitioners, use a weapon against a family member?"
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2644.87,2647.85,"In neither case did they, but these Petitioners --"
2015.14-10154,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2647.85,2653.16,"So that the -- again, the suspension is not directly related to the use of the weapon."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2666.795,2679.46,"Yes, Your Honor, but I believe that in terms of the -- the relationship between Congress's decision to try to prevent domestic gun violence and its means of doing so --"
2015.14-10154,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2679.46,2684.95,Even if that -- if even if that violence is unrelated to the use -- the possession of a gun?
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2684.95,2709.175,"Well, Your Honor, I think the studies that Congress relied upon in formulating the -- the misdemeanor crime of domestic violence ban didn't -- were directly about the use of a gun because what they showed is that individuals who have previously been -- battered their spouses, pose up to a six-fold greater risk of killing, by a gun, their family member."
2015.14-10154,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2709.175,2740.75,"Well, let's -- let's say that a publisher is reckless about the use of children, and what could be considered indecent displays and that that triggers a violation of, say, a hypothetical law against the use of children in these ads, and let's say it's a misdemeanor violation."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2745.64,2754.71,"Your Honor, I don't think you could suspend the right to ever publish again, but I think that you could limit, for example, the manner and means by which publisher --"
2015.14-10154,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2754.71,2759.33,So how is that different from suspending your Second Amendment right?
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2759.33,2775.66,"Your Honor, I think that in terms of a -- the compelling purpose that was identified here, which was the prevention of gun violence and the individual nature of the -- of the underlying offense, so here this isn't a misdemeanor crime directed at any person at large."
2015.14-10154,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2783.9,2786.96,Would you have a better case if this were a gun crime?
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2786.96,2807.35,"Your Honor, I think it would be perhaps a better case, except that the evidence that Congress relied on and -- and that the courts below that have addressed the Second Amendment concerns that Your Honor is highlighting have even gone into a more robust analysis of the -- the evidence that ties initial crimes of battery to future gun violence."
2015.14-10154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2871.16,2885.46,"I -- I suppose one answer is -- just a partial answer to Justice Thomas's question is SORNA, a violation of sexual offenders have to register before they can travel in interstate commerce. But that's not a prevention from traveling at all."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2887.31,2900.255,"Well, Your Honor, it's a prevention in requiring prophylactic measures in order to prevent a substantial -- because Congress has identified a substantial risk of harm from people identified as committing those types of offenses."
2015.14-10154,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2900.255,2905.445,Do it -- what is it we have -- they raised this in their brief.
2015.14-10154,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2956.95,2963.64,"-- the point is, she's raised a question, and she wants us to answer that question."
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2978.275,2980.03,"Your Honor, two answers to that."
2015.14-10154,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2995.88,2997.08,Stop you at the first point.
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,3030.025,3031.18,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2015.14-10154,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3031.18,3031.725,Thank you.
2015.14-10154,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,3031.725,3036.195,If there are no further questions.
2015.14-10154,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3036.195,3041.38,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Ms. Villa."
