1967.949,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.993,"Number 949, Reuben K. King, Commissioner of the State Department of Pensions and Security of Alabama et al."
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,28.756,34.111,May it please the Court and Mr. Chief Justice in this honorable Court.
1967.949,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,312.029,319.286,"I'm looking at the page 427 of the appendix, at Roman V, isn’t that the regulation we we’re talking about?"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,319.286,325.021,"Yes, it is and that’s mentioned in several places but that is the best place to look on page 427."
1967.949,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,325.021,327.479,"But that’s Roman V, not part—"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,327.479,328.044,Excuse me.
1967.949,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,333.637,338.841,"Yes, the child and that was filed up there to the father and mother substitute and Aid, five Aid."
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,340.725,346.985,And this is the best version because it shows you how it relates to the rest of the -- to the program.
1967.949,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,346.985,353.931,"Was any action instituted against the substitute, whatever it was spouse or whatever?"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,353.931,356.941,No and we have (voice overlap).
1967.949,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,390.146,404.551,"Well, then what you’re telling us is that the substitute father rule regulation applies even though the substitute father is not the father of any of the dependent children."
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,404.551,407.201,We stated that in that jurisdiction statement.
1967.949,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,477.85,480.543,"Yes ma’am, but our problem is one of equal protection --"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,480.543,481.017,"Yes, that’s right."
1967.949,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,481.017,483.92,And therefore a problem of reasonable classification.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,483.92,484.738,That is correct.
1967.949,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,484.738,503.289,"Now, the reason that these dependent children are otherwise eligible for Aid, are not getting the welfare payments as if their mother is having a relationship with a man, period, end of the story, is that right?"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,503.289,503.535,"No, I think it is (voice overlap)"
1967.949,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,503.535,509.899,It doesn’t matter whether the man is or is not the father of the children.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,510.28,518.124,"If you are approaching this purely from a duty of support point of view, I can certainly see why you are asking this question."
1967.949,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,546.166,552.89,"Yes ma’am, but you’re telling us that this father under Alabama Law, this is spouse or—"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,552.89,554.265,Substitute spouse.
1967.949,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,554.265,566.937,"This man, let’s call him a man and we’re so -- that this man under Alabama Law has no duty to support these children, is that right?"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,566.937,574.171,"And if you think Social Security Act never permitted states to make these classifications, I think you’re right in asking this question."
1967.949,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,574.171,579.592,"No ma’am, you let me ask a question, and then we’ll see."
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,583.961,585.492,May or may not.
1967.949,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,589.639,593.027,The children are dependent children.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,610.28,615.627,I think you had just hit the thing that puts shock and horror in the hearts of everybody who hears it.
1967.949,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,619.991,621.157,I didn’t say I was distressed.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,621.157,623.77,Initially.
1967.949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,649.866,653.222,"Mrs. Stapp, the money is for the child."
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,653.222,662.8,"I think we would consider, it is to be used for the child and we would certainly hope that if the state and the federal government is going to own this trouble it is going to be used for the child."
1967.949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,662.8,669.642,Is there anything under the sun that this child can do in order to qualify for this money?
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,669.642,674.612,I know of nothing other than the mother herself going to the office and stating --
1967.949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,674.612,676.419,There’s nothing that child can do.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,676.419,680.975,We know of nothing that the child in this family or the child in the married family can do.
1967.949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,687.834,694.93,What I'm saying is the child’s mother who is living alone.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,714.534,726.348,I would say that we maybe discriminating in the long run more against the married mother who has a husband who is not doing to will for a few weeks.
1967.949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,752.497,756.96,But I can’t see why the child is denied milk.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,756.96,757.803,Well I would hope that.
1967.949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,757.803,759.261,It was what her mother did.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,759.261,767.429,I would hope the mother when she gets a public assistance check does use the check for daycare purposes but there’s no requirement that she do so.
1967.949,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,771.973,776.252,Is the child cut off when the mother is an alcoholic?
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,776.252,781.205,The relationship which simulates the marriage relationship is the only one we are concerned with here.
1967.949,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,781.205,783.085,No but I mean under the—
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,783.085,784.676,"No indeed, we’re not concerned—"
1967.949,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,784.676,786.076,Under Alabama law regulation --
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,786.076,790.154,"No indeed, unless we can make a case to you."
1967.949,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,790.154,795.29,I am just worrying how far Alabama takes the releasing of the sins of the mother.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,795.29,812.627,"If it does not simulate the marriage relationship then I would think that we would not have a classification under deprivation of real support and our theory on it is this, that the relationships that these persons live in simulate the marriage relationship."
1967.949,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,829.436,832.689,"Mrs. Stapp, I tried translating that in the state interest."
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,835.1,847.253,"I would say that two or three very important state interest, the main one is the tremendous necessity from the point of view of money in the state program to limit it."
1967.949,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,855.963,861.253,You mean there are more dependent children than there is money to take care of--
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,861.253,865.567,"The low, very low grants that we have been giving for many, many years."
1967.949,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,865.567,867.481,And this is the way you say that you--
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,867.481,868.728,36% of me you know--
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.728,872.428,This is the way you get more milk to some children by giving none to others.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,872.428,876.428,We think it permits a fair classification because we would say --
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,876.428,879.72,"No, as far as the children are concerned, that's what it comes down to isn't it?"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,882.521,889.848,"I think you would have to consider in the light of the total program, the fact of the tremendous number of children that are not helped at all."
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,889.848,892.766,Now what others state interest do you see?
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,892.766,898.397,The economic interest is the real state interest involved here.
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,906.61,909.357,Is that the only justification then?
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,909.357,912.856,"No, I think we've got a much more profound one and I would --"
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,912.856,913.891,And that is?
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,913.891,927.448,It is the public's problem and what they consider underwriting these persons who live in infallible relationships and putting a financial premium on them.
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,928.171,933.023,That's no different than saying that morally this kind of relationship is wrong therefore--
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,933.023,933.75,I think you have to stick with—
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,933.75,936.025,Therefore the state can penalize dependent--
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,936.025,941.343,I think you do have to look at it from the point of view of the public and the tax.
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,980.341,986.089,"This is one way I suppose, one way of limiting case loads is to try to prevent--"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,986.089,988.517,I would point out to you on a bit.
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1026.799,1031.114,"Well, I gather there are other message though and they're not reaching that (voice overlap)"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1031.114,1032.309,The 1967—
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1032.309,1042.491,"What I read everyday (voice overlap), there are other ways of reaching that then by depriving those children who are already here of any milk at all --"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1042.491,1046.277,Well we hope surplus commodities and food stamps are taking care of the food problem.
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1075.129,1083.736,"Well, I gather your regulation say if they come down and said, “I gather your regulations says if she comes down to the case worker and says, I have smaller amount."
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1083.736,1084.374,That's it.
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1084.374,1085.618,Then the check is resumed.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1085.618,1091.247,I would say it puts her back into the situation of a person who does not have a spouse.
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1100.823,1107.008,And this reaches the mother whether she carries on the relationship in her house or in his.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1107.008,1107.239,We think--
1967.949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1107.239,1107.808,Or anywhere else.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1107.808,1110.914,We may need some help on part three.
1967.949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.807,1147.168,"Mrs. Stapp, if the federal regulations of the federal law, the federal regulations define the parent as the natural parent, and said that benefits shall not be denied because the mother is living in an informal arrangement."
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1150.686,1152.348,By regulation.
1967.949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.348,1159.124,And then the Alabama regulations came out in this form.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1159.124,1163.41,You have certainly hit what the law of Court said in suitable home policy.
1967.949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.468,1171.606,But now would you find -- would you think the Alabama regulation could stand in the face of the federal regulation -- (voice overlap)
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1171.606,1178.733,I think it stands up very well with the Georgia regulation which has been approved since it was patterned on Georgia regulation and it has been approved.
1967.949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.733,1183.219,Let's assume for the moment that the federal law clearly did the contrary.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1183.219,1187.345,I want to reserve 10 minutes -- I found that my light went on --
1967.949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.345,1197.231,"If it was clearly -- in Alabama, if the federal law was clearly contrary to the Alabama regulations, could the Alabama regulation stand?"
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1197.231,1199.15,We don't think it's clear in the first place.
1967.949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.248,1201.397,I know you don't but let's assume for the moment.
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1205.833,1214.886,If it prevented us from making a classification which might put married persons in a deprived situation.
1967.949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.526,1224.119,I'm just wondering whether it's some issue here short of the Equal Protection issue whether it's really (voice overlap)
1967.949,0,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,1224.119,1225.44,We do have a question with that.
1967.949,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1234.164,1238.824,Mr. Garbus.
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1238.824,1244.866,May it please the court.
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1313.475,1315.719,How many other states have this?
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1315.719,1323.298,18 states have this regulation or similar regulations and is set forth in the appendix to my brief.
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1323.298,1333.695,"Is it typical of the states not to give ADC to the children of married couples, no matter how impoverished --"
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1333.695,1337.527,"Throughout the country, there are ADC programs and ADCU programs."
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1358.184,1360.513,And then you say a minority of the states have this?
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1360.513,1361.318,Yes.
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1362.401,1370.052,"The majority of the states do not give Aid to Dependent Children if their parents are married, no matter how poverty stricken, is that correct?"
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1370.052,1377.683,"Yes, I'd like to add supplemental to the Court, give you the list of those states and I will also furnish you with the regulations."
1967.949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1419.928,1427.326,Does federal program permit a state to cut off the Aid to a child who suddenly acquires a stepfather.
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1427.326,1437.834,"The handbook transmittal which is the federal interpretation of those regulations is very clear and specific in the sense, that Aid should be given even though the man and the woman marry --"
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1437.834,1439.533,As long as he doesn't adopt the children.
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1439.533,1441.147,"Right, or as long as he's not the natural father—"
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1441.147,1450.547,"So a state regulation to that effect cutting off the child and if he suddenly acquires a stepfather who doesn't adopt him, a state regulation in that effect would be invalid--"
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1450.547,1459.858,"It should be disapproved and that is the interim regulation which Alabama has passed in this case, pending the disposition of this case, pending the disposition of this case."
1967.949,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1503.749,1507.37,Has HEW ever passed on the Alabama plan I remember?
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1507.37,1509.688,HEW has passed on the Alabama plan.
1967.949,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1509.688,1511.044,And what did it do?
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1511.044,1513.223,They disapproved the plan.
1967.949,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1513.223,1517.224,What's the effect of that?
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1517.224,1543.918,"The HEW in December 11th of 1964 sent back the last Alabama (Voice Overlap), in other words Alabama wrote and said, “Here's our plan HEW be applied to it in a serious negotiation of conversations and said, and it set forth in the decision that the Alabama plan is out of conformity with the Fleming ruling, is out of conformity with the constitution, is out of conformity with the Social Security Act."
1967.949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.22,1584.365,"But why in a case like this could you just say the Alabama plan is contrary to the federal statute and the federal regulations, and that's all you have to show?"
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1584.365,1585.998,"We say that, we also say that—"
1967.949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.998,1590.766,What is the next part that you have to go?
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1590.766,1597.736,"What I am concerned about in a sense is the feeling that in Georgia and in Louisiana, those plans have been disapproved."
1967.949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.983,1612.234,Of what a parent is.
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1612.234,1614.023,Yes.
1967.949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.898,1618.085,That's the reading of the statute.
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1618.085,1625.203,"That's the reading of the statute, and that would cut against the substitute kind of regulation that Alabama has passed."
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1634.418,1646.561,"Do I understand you Mr. Garbus to say that you think this case that can be decided in your favor purely on the basis of statutory structure rather than on any constitutional, is that right?"
1967.949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1646.561,1649.369,"Yes, it will still be a supremacy clause then."
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1649.369,1658.758,"Yes, you have in this instance and this is the first case before you like this, the relationship between HEW and the states that administer Aid."
1967.949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.727,1727.367,"What definition do you suggest that it would be given to parents from the statute, the one that you just read?"
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1727.367,1739.753,The definition would be that states must treat his parents for the purposes of ADC eligibility only persons with a legal obligation to provide support and that's the purpose of HEW.
1967.949,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1739.753,1741.653,Provided they are the parents.
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1741.653,1744.421,"Oh, yes."
1967.949,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1839.762,1854.636,Would you mind that the pointing out rather under the statute is the particular language where I could find that in the brief that you think is complex federal section. --
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1854.636,1862.023,"I'm sorry the section - no, I find that consistent, I'm sorry."
1967.949,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1862.978,1864.082,I thought you said--
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1864.082,1867.832,"I mean if that's inconsistent well what Mrs. Stapp was saying, with respect to how you should --"
1967.949,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1867.832,1874.951,We can decide this under federal statute to say that it violates the federal statute.
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1876.122,1879.941,That would be Section 606 which defines--
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1879.941,1882.202,Where is it in your brief?
1967.949,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1882.202,1886.606,Where is it?
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1910.487,1912.803,"Probably in the appendix to the appellant's brief, isn't it?."
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1912.803,1916.504,It is set forth that at page 45 of the appendix.
1967.949,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1916.504,1917.217,45 of the--
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1917.217,1921.104,45 of the appendix and it's in the decision of the Board.
1967.949,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1921.104,1922.017,Volume one.
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,1922.017,1929.581,Yes it is.
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2096.074,2139.541,"-- equal protection point of view but purely from the statute, and you concluded that the Alabama regulation was contrary that either the federal statute or to a federal regulation, or to a federal rule, would you say then that it's supremacy clause question or is it a matter of treating the State as an native federal government in administering the Act and that the Alabama regulation is simply doesn't authorize but a statute anymore than the similar regulation by HEW might not be authorized by the statute itself."
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,2139.541,2149.292,I would think that it's something other than a Supremacy Clause because of the existence-- because of the power in HEW to regulate the agency which it's specifically set forth.
1967.949,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2160.669,2169.12,Can HEW instruct Alabama as to what it should do with this program?
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,2169.12,2175.143,"No, all that HEW can expect of Alabama is that it makes reasonable classifications with respect--"
1967.949,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2175.143,2180.916,"The only power that HEW has is to cut off funds, isn't it?"
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,2180.916,2184.773,"Yes, and to approve state plans, which then release funds."
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2187.627,2195.691,But require a potential beneficiary of these grants.
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,2207.003,2207.613,That's right.
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2207.613,2211.334,And I insist that you comply with the Federal Law if you're dispensing federal money.
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,2212.291,2214.738,Yes.
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2214.738,2224.513,"But there is that question I gather, that this Federal Law does, in terms, authorize the state to do something in this area, does it?"
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,2224.513,2226.751,"Oh, it authorizes the State."
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2226.751,2228.016,"Oh, it does?"
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,2244.012,2245.443,Yes.
1967.949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2245.443,2257.449,"So whether or not you phrase this as a supremacy argument, or simply a regulation outside the authority to the States under the statute to come out the same way?"
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,2257.449,2258.398,"I do, yes."
1967.949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.257,2265.899,"Well, maybe they went on to equal protection."
1967.949,1,35918,martin_garbus,,2265.899,2274.988,"They also talked about the relationship between the statutes, and they also talked about the state plan and the obligation that it puts on HEW, and on the federal government."
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2581.68,2588.756,"In our answer to Mr. Justice White's lies question, we must comply with the federal regulation, yes."
1967.949,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2603.09,2606.326,"Yes, but the other side claims that--"
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2606.326,2607.158,There's a disagreement on this.
1967.949,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2607.158,2612.057,That properly construed the statute itself.
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2612.057,2624.44,"If you construed the statute like Mr. Garbus suggests, then HEW would never have had authority to permit any State to carve out lesser classifications."

1967.949,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2656.976,2661.308,(Voice Overlap) of the man who's not there is there.
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2661.308,2666.971,"As I said, that part of the regulation has not been used, and we would like your help on that."
1967.949,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2687.561,2690.336,How do you want our help on this?
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2690.336,2692.999,We would like you to reverse the lower Court.
1967.949,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2706.788,2709.511,You'd like us to relieve your misgivings?
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2709.511,2710.969,I'd like to.
1967.949,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2711.728,2723.301,"Did I read correctly that in one of these cases, this parent was lawfully wedded to another woman, and had some children?"
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2723.301,2725.798,I would like to point out that this is one of the--
1967.949,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2725.798,2730.661,"My question is, how can it be two parents at the same time?"
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2730.661,2733.878,We call this informal polygamy (laughter).
1967.949,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2740.24,2742.242,"Well, I didn't say you would call him a parent."
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2742.242,2744.717,I think a substitute spouse is a better word.
1967.949,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.26,2768.744,Do you think you'll be successful?
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2768.744,2780.35,"I think there's great problems involved in making a decision eventually, that welfare departments, who cannot disassociate themselves from the informal practices."

1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2833.384,2838.874,"If they have a standing, that is separate from her as a grantee relative receiving a check to spend it."
1967.949,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2838.874,2841.225,That's right if they're otherwise qualified.
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2841.225,2846.853,"If they have a standing that is separate from hers, then we may-- we may misconceive and put an ADC program"
1967.949,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2846.853,2848.118,"Well, now, let's not talk about that."
1967.949,2,36696,mary_lee_stapp,,2861.991,2864.264,Is this part two of the regulation you're speaking of?
1967.949,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2864.264,2865.947,I'm giving you facts.
