1970.548,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.866,"We’ll hear arguments next in Number 548, Ely against Klahr."
1970.548,0,38353,philip_j_shea,,30.167,31.643,Thank you.
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1258.488,1261.681,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1637.558,1641.872,"Well, I gather the legislature is not principally doing anything."
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1641.872,1642.74,No Your Honor.
1970.548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1644.05,1651.033,"And Arizona’s position of this situation of having no apportionment, no constitutional apportionment by the law."
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1651.033,1651.781,That’s correct Mr. Justice Brennan.
1970.548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1651.781,1652.328,Isn’t that right?
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1652.328,1652.686,That’s correct.
1970.548,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1652.686,1658.712,You stated in your brief that the legislature is under some judicial compulsion?
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1658.712,1661.312,"Yes sir, by November 1 Sir."
1970.548,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1661.312,1662.438,Where did you find that?
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1662.438,1665.757,In the decree of the Court.
1970.548,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1665.757,1678.039,"I read on page 113 that the Court assumes that the legislator will by November 1, 1970 enact McGowan plan."
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1678.039,1691.972,"The Court haven’t been advised a detailed population figures for the State of Arizona will be available from the official 1970 census by the summer of 1971, assumed that there is the legislation -- will by November 1."
1970.548,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1691.972,1695.029,Do you call that judicial compulsion?
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1695.029,1696.992,We think it is Your Honor.
1970.548,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1696.992,1709.995,"It says, (Inaudible) the legislature to do so, any party may apply to the Court, that just leaves it open for the continuation, does it not?"
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1709.995,1722.339,"Well sir, the state’s position is that we have a deadline and we have so instructed legislature that they have a deadline of having a Bill ready for us to offer to the Court by November 1."
1970.548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1729.474,1734.092,Do you get anymore optimistic prediction or one (Inaudible)?
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1734.092,1752.871,"Well, no sir, Mr. Justice Brennan, the figures are still -- they say now that possibly in June, but Mr. Cohen Pelt's (ph) figures in the trial, August of 1971 because they have to break them down by census tracks and in census tracks in populous areas means by blocks."
1970.548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1761.206,1763.981,"But, there is some suggestion that may in fact be available by --"
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1763.981,1765.206,"Early, yes sir."
1970.548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1765.206,1766.419,June.
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1766.419,1768.194,But only a suggestion but the witness --
1970.548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1768.194,1772.441,"But, the legislature now, will it be a continuous session between now and November?"
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1772.441,1773.719,"No Mr. Justice Brennan, it will not."
1970.548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1778.301,1779.656,By over you mean --
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1779.656,1783.289,For the regular session and it will be called – I am sorry?
1970.548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1783.289,1785.435,This would have to be -- it would it be a special session?
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1785.435,1785.95,Yes sir.
1970.548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1790.025,1792.831,And can it be unless the Government calls for a special session?
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1792.831,1798.806,"Well, there’s a procedure that House and Senate -- the Governor will call immediately."
1970.548,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.21,1813.161,"Mr. McGowan, following the census figures peculiar for Arizona or is it nationwide?"
1970.548,1,32141,john_m_mcgowan_ii,,1813.161,1825.353,"It is nationwide Mr. Justice White, but it’s peculiar to Arizona in this effect that they really only go by blocks in -- as Mr. Cohen Pelt (ph) testified in two populous counties."
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2086.884,2090.306,I’d like to respond briefly if I may to a couple of points.
1970.548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2146.21,2160.802,"Well, I know but (Inaudible), if you were to go today and ask one and I said, go ahead, read the books, take them off, and they certify those officially on 1970 figures?"
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2160.802,2166.854,I don’t know if there is any process of informatory certification at any stage.
1970.548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2168.626,2174.646,"(Inaudible) basis some officially certified, take the population figures."
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2181.067,2183.753,I don’t know.
1970.548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2187.273,2195.605,That's what (Inaudible) that's what the case (Inaudible) have referred to census figures which (Inaudible)
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2195.605,2205.415,"Well, I don’t know if they’re officially certified, and then between perhaps now and if they have not been but --"
1970.548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2205.415,2218.082,"What happens if you have to go -- the District Court will require to open the door, you want to bring in a plan based on 1970 figures (Inaudible) where would you get the basis of figures?"
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2218.082,2223.538,"I’d get them from the United States Department, the Bureau, the Census in Washington, D.C."
1970.548,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.538,2229.74,"You get attendant figures then in August, they put out a new set of figures without the reapportionment again."
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2240.902,2254.713,I am frankly not familiar with the process of the certification of figures.
1970.548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2254.713,2275.952,"What you say Mr. Shea, I gather yo do not share Mr. McGowan’s optimism at all on the changes that have occurred in the legislature up to now and their likelihood to accomplish this objective in the special session which he assures us will be held."
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2277.215,2280.862,Mr. McGowan and I are in complete disagreement on that.
1970.548,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2280.862,2282.304,Why?
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2282.304,2293.394,"Because my experience is that a legislature does not reapportion itself, so as to disseminate its leadership and that’s what's going to have to happen."
1970.548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2293.394,2304.365,"But the last reapportionment created a new leadership as Justice Harlan suggested, a new set of interest has come into being."
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2306.115,2309.265,"Yes, they did."
1970.548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2323.367,2337.038,You don’t think the polite but rather clear suggestion on the three-judge court is going to have any impact on the legislature?
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2337.038,2337.596,No.
1970.548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2337.596,2353.093,"It’s true that the Court did not order that the states obviously, according to Mr. McGowan’s representation, has treated the Court’s polite suggestion as though it had done an order, a mandate?"
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2353.093,2355.107,Yes.
1970.548,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2355.107,2356.671,Have they?
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2356.671,2363.074,"Although I take his word for, in other words, their leaders set around in a room and they say well, you know the Court said by November 1 --"
1970.548,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2363.074,2364.882,Have they acted?
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2364.882,2373.465,"No, he says that they intend to act before November 1, 1971 because they regarded it some kind of a moral time limit.[Attempt to Laughter]"
1970.548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2373.465,2379.046,"But he also ties that time under the availability of the figures, does he not."
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2379.046,2380.406,"Right, and that’s what I dispute too."
1970.548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2380.406,2403.948,"This was certainly, I do not read this as a dilatory action, but as a representation made to this Court by responsible counsel, that these figures will be available by June perhaps, but within 60 days thereafter and that the legislature will be in a special session."
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2405.183,2406.46,"No, I don’t sir."
1970.548,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2409.467,2415.981,"You agree that he can make such thing, as to what the legislature will do?"
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2415.981,2432.687,"Well, he makes the statement in all good faith and he’s a man who is close to the leadership and I am sure he is accurately reporting what he advices them what they say they will do."
1970.548,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2441.414,2444.94,Do you think then that it just have to be tried out again in the Court?
1970.548,2,38353,philip_j_shea,,2444.94,2449.095,"We’re going to go back to Court, I have no doubt about that."
1970.548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2461.918,2463.68,"Thank you Mr. Shea, thank you Mr. McGowan."
