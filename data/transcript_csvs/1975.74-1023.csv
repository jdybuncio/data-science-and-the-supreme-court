1975.74-1023,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.597,We will hear arguments first its morning in Kerr against the District Court of the Northern District of California number 1023.
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,21.165,25.22,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1975.74-1023,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,49.237,53.202,"Mr. Mayer, may I ask, did this case go to trial?"
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,53.202,53.858,No Your Honor.
1975.74-1023,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,53.858,55.038,It did not.
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,55.038,64.218,"There was a trial date that was changed to November 10, and that has since been withdrawn and there is a present no-trial date."
1975.74-1023,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,64.218,75.028,"So this issue is still alive, I had the impression of (inaudible) the purposes of the final hearing."
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,75.028,80.343,"Yes Your Honor, counsel for the plaintiffs below had expressed to the Court in a suggestion of mootness."
1975.74-1023,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,143.287,147.602,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,147.602,153.879,As to a necessity of a three-judge court for the trial below.
1975.74-1023,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,153.879,161.571,(Inaudible) from the amended complain that the plaintiffs filed the claim of the three-judge court?
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,161.571,169.043,"Yes Your Honor, the amended complaint was filed July 1 of this year, 1975."
1975.74-1023,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,197.935,208.889,"The three-judge court has convened to deal with these issues, then is there any case for decision here?"
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,212.214,214.064,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1023,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,214.064,222.0,"And he is the Judge -- when you clarified that, has he requested the designation of a three-judge court now?"
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,222.0,243.633,"His notice to the Ninth Circuit read that, this case appears to be a case requiring a three-judge court, according and as best I can, and I hereby certify it to you the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit as a Case requiring the convening of three Judges."
1975.74-1023,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,243.633,255.463,That three-judge court that is designated has reasonably assumed that he will or ought to vacate his judgment in this case?
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,255.463,276.711,"I believe that if the three-judge court is actually convened, and the three Judges are appointed and said that we as defendants in the action below could renew our motions before the three Judges together for their consideration."
1975.74-1023,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,285.451,289.349,Would these rulings be outstanding until they were overruled?
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,296.285,305.831,"I don’t think the fact of convening the three-judge court would irradiate the existing single-judge orders, and certainly will not eradicate the Ninth Circuit opinion."
1975.74-1023,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,305.831,311.093,"It will be the same case, with the same number and everything, except just now three-judge?"
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,311.093,311.67,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1023,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,311.67,313.122,Three-Judge Court?
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,313.122,314.173,Yes.
1975.74-1023,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.173,329.162,Would all the issues be automatically be referred to the three-judge District Court or just those which require the convening of the Court of the first instance?
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,329.162,332.453,I believe that the entire case would go to the three-judge court.
1975.74-1023,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.453,340.848,"Under the plaintiff’s complaint before it was amended last summer, no one made any contention that there was need for a three-judge District Court?"
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,340.848,343.08,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1023,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,343.08,344.396,Mr. Mayer.
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,344.396,346.324,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1023,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,346.324,362.101,"I wish you would clarify for me the status of the demand for these documents you said, and the brief state, that the plaintiffs below were willing to waive their demand for the documents."
1975.74-1023,0,33925,karl_s_mayer,,364.738,372.516,"Your Honor, the topic first came up in proceedings in the District Court I believe in July."
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2189.251,2192.553,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.74-1023,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2247.551,2253.092,Being that the outstanding orders or prior modification out of conform with this opinion?
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2253.092,2254.605,"That if, yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1023,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2266.511,2268.99,That you would not be entitled to anything?
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2271.947,2279.079,"The way I read the opinion, Justice Brennan, they would be permitted to make the type of showing, and that is what really is at stake here."
1975.74-1023,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2287.157,2290.044,And all which involves also in camera inspection?
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2290.044,2295.063,"It may, and that would depend upon the showing that they would make."
1975.74-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2313.4,2322.845,"Mr. Bergesen, do you think that the District Court had the right to consider your amended complaint, while the case was here --"
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2322.845,2323.578,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2336.321,2346.976,"So that under your theory a three-judge court would have been convened, could have heard this case and decided it before now, and then will be based on --"
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2346.976,2351.116,"Yes Sir Justice Marshal, that is my position."
1975.74-1023,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2410.214,2415.171,"Why Mr. Bergesen, did you go back to the District Court in those circumstances?"
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2423.973,2426.496,"In that respect Justice Brennan, maybe we should have done that."
1975.74-1023,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2435.038,2438.545,Well do you or don’t you want the benefit of the orders now?
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2438.545,2455.545,"Our position this morning that the intervening events of the last few weeks and months, mean that in all candor, we would say that if the trial is further delayed and delayed and this Court comes down with an opinion, which gives us the benefit of the documents, yes Justice Brennan, we would want them."
1975.74-1023,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2460.416,2469.354,"You would not want them except under the conditions of the Court of Appeals has laid down, namely that the State may assert privilege and perhaps as for in camera inspection."
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2469.354,2470.695,And make a proper showing.
1975.74-1023,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.256,2501.09,"Do you understand the State wants here that it has not already gotten to the Court of Appeals, namely a chance to raise and claim and justify its privilege in the District Court?"
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2501.09,2504.874,"In the District Court, this is the whole burden of our case."
1975.74-1023,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.843,2510.024,What does the State wants?
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2510.024,2518.203,"They apparently want to go back to the District Court and not have to make the showing that the Court of Appeals says they have to make, that is the only thing I can figure out."
1975.74-1023,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2518.203,2529.656,They want us to hold that just based on whatever claim they made on the District Court initially was enough?
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2529.656,2542.537,"That the District Court was required without motive to inspect all the documents in camera, that they could go in and say, here they are Judge we say they are confidential, you have got to inspect them in camera."
1975.74-1023,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2542.537,2553.119,"You have been back and forth in District Court, even if the case has been here, you have no time, and told the District Court what you are not telling us about braving this right."
1975.74-1023,1,17439,b_e_bergesen_iii,,2553.119,2554.829,And that is the second issue on which --
1975.74-1023,2,33925,karl_s_mayer,,4572.006,4573.348,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1975.74-1023,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4780.468,4781.106,Thank you gentleman.
