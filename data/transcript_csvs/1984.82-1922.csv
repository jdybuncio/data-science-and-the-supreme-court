1984.82-1922,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.982,"We will hear arguments next in Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc., and others, against the United States."
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,78.219,126.154,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, while there are many directions one can take when answering the question posed by this case in a manner which would be favorable to the petitioners, the question itself, we believe, is rather simply put: Does a state's clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed policy to displace competition with a mandatory and pervasive regulatory system which it actively supervises shield from antitrust liability the private regulated parties acting in a manner contemplated and authorized but not literally compelled by the state system?"
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.411,534.754,Mr. Hirsch--
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,534.754,535.05,"--Yes, sir."
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,535.05,539.628,"--hasn't the state said to every single independent motor carrier, go do as you will?"
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,539.628,541.736,"No, sir, they have not."
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.736,543.189,Don't they all have an independent right of action?
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,543.189,546.124,"No, what they have said to the carriers is this."
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,703.748,712.197,"Under the state schemes, is the right of independent action of the independent carrier different from what it is under the federal scheme, in your view?"
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,712.197,713.744,"I don't believe it is, Your Honor."
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,713.744,714.275,It's the same right?
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,714.275,715.508,I believe it is the same right.
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,792.977,795.742,Can they come out with one rate for the majority and a separate rate for the independent?
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,795.742,797.272,Not necessarily.
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.272,797.928,But can they?
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,797.928,798.413,They can.
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,806.941,810.47,"Well, isn't it true that within the zone of reasonableness there can be more than one rate?"
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,810.47,811.673,--That is true.
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.547,816.546,Which might include both one rate for the majority and either a higher or lower rate for the independent.
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,816.546,816.905,For the independent.
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.529,938.341,"May I ask just one other question, Mr. Hirsch?"
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,944.447,947.399,"Yes, Your Honor, absolutely."
1984.82-1922,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1190.175,1202.733,"Mr. Hirsch, can you distinguish the rate bureaus in this case from those the Court was considering in the Georgia Railroad Company case?"
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,1202.733,1215.9,"In Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad, the issue that came before this Court actually was a question of whether the State of Georgia could bring the case."
1984.82-1922,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1250.964,1257.368,"Well, my question was whether the rate bureaus operate in the same fashion here as in that case."
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,1257.368,1258.352,"--No, not at all."
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1532.491,1536.505,Do you rely on the dissenting position in Cantor?
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,1537.583,1541.597,"I am not relying on the dissenting position as applied in Cantor, Your Honor."
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.347,1544.158,What is the difference between this case and Cantor?
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,1544.158,1564.072,"--The difference is that in Cantor, the state regulatory system was not only silent with respect to the regulation of lightbulbs, but lightbulbs had absolutely nothing to do with the regulation of electric utilities in the State of Michigan."
1984.82-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1567.32,1572.069,"The Commission thought it had something to do with it, because they approved the tariff, the lightbulb--"
1984.82-1922,0,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,1572.069,1583.205,"--Their approval of the tariff proved two factors which would have been their downfall ever under the Mid-Cal test, and one is, there wasn't a clear articulation, we submit."
1984.82-1922,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1605.087,1606.119,Very well.
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1612.022,1642.697,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court... forgive my cold... one of the concerns manifested in the legislative history of the Sherman Act and that prompted the Act's passage was concern over price collusion in railroad rates that was then prevalent, and railroads were at that time the predominant form of freight transportation in the United States."
1984.82-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.368,2308.583,"Mr. Wallace, would you say if the state public utility commission had said, we will only accept joint filings, that that would be enough?"
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2308.583,2315.565,"Well, then you would get into the Mid-Cal question of whether there is adequate supervision, which is not contested."
1984.82-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.565,2320.626,"Just in your own words, the private carriers are not making the choice."
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2320.626,2321.126,That's correct.
1984.82-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.216,2339.634,"Well, if the public utility commissions said all you fellows have got to get together and file joint rates, that is--"
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2339.634,2347.145,"There might be another ground for contesting whether there was immunity, but the compulsion standard would be satisfied."
1984.82-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.145,2348.317,"--What other ground, would you say?"
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2348.317,2361.687,"The question of adequate supervision, which was the ground addressed in the Mid-Cal case, because the state can't just go around compelling conduct inconsistent with the Sherman Act--"
1984.82-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.687,2366.903,I didn't think you... what is your position in the Hallie case?
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2371.699,2375.744,--That is with respect to municipalities.
1984.82-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.744,2382.601,"But you think you have to have active supervision by rate bureaus, I mean by--"
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2382.601,2383.023,By the--
1984.82-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.023,2385.632,"--No, public utilities commissions."
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2385.632,2393.612,"--Active supervision by the Commission of private conduct, whatever that would amount to."
1984.82-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.612,2395.862,"But anyway, that is not involved here?"
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2395.862,2397.923,That is not involved in this case.
1984.82-1922,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2397.923,2426.161,"Well, on this point, then, Mr. Wallace, assuming that we have active supervision by the public utility commission, if the state has clearly articulated a policy of desiring to have joint rate proposals as part of the scheme, what more is gained by saying it has to be compelled?"
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2426.161,2444.81,"Our view, our understanding of the entire Parker line of decisions is that it is only state action, not state policy that is exempted from the Sherman Act."
1984.82-1922,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2480.436,2504.412,"Well, if the state is free to say we want all rates made as... initiated as joint rate proposals, why can't the state say, we would like to have you do that but we aren't going to compel it in every case, we will leave an avenue for independent application?"
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2504.412,2511.597,--There is a practical answer and there is a theoretical answer.
1984.82-1922,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2637.28,2646.76,"Well, didn't Parker itself leave up to the individual raisin producers some flexibility in deciding whether--"
1984.82-1922,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2646.76,2650.46,--With respect to whether the state would initiate the program.
1984.82-1922,2,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,3108.167,3109.433,"Yes, sir."
1984.82-1922,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3109.433,3111.244,You have four minutes remaining.
1984.82-1922,2,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,3111.244,3146.339,"To briefly address a few of the questions that were addressed by my brother counsel, first, to expand upon Justice O'Connor's questioning, not only in Parker did the initiation of the regulatory program require the activity of the private party to begin at the choice of the private party, but once the growers petitioned the board for a pro-raisin program, it then had to be submitted, once adopted, back to the growers and voted on with a 65 percent vote in order to be enacted."
1984.82-1922,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3152.227,3153.055,But it bound everybody.
1984.82-1922,2,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,3153.055,3153.68,--Pardon?
1984.82-1922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.68,3154.96,It bound everybody.
1984.82-1922,2,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,3154.96,3157.787,"In that zone, once 65 percent of them approved it, but--"
1984.82-1922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3157.787,3158.709,It bound everybody.
1984.82-1922,2,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,3160.271,3162.505,"--It bound 100 percent, but they did have--"
1984.82-1922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.505,3169.018,And that was an imposed state policy at that point.
1984.82-1922,2,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,3169.018,3191.618,"--That is correct, but while binding all of them, it allowed them to retain 30 percent of their crop for pure competition, to compete purely with 30 percent of their crop, so therefore they had a blend of competitive and noncompetitive activity, but it is... I think it is very important that before the program ever became effective it was the growers who eventually had to vote again, not the--"
1984.82-1922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3191.618,3199.427,But here there would be no state policy violated if no one files joint rates.
1984.82-1922,2,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,3199.427,3202.083,"--That is correct, other than the fact--"
1984.82-1922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.083,3207.94,"And the public utility commission doesn't ask them to file joint rates, doesn't penalize them if they don't."
1984.82-1922,2,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,3207.94,3208.674,--I disagree.
1984.82-1922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3212.142,3213.609,How do they do that?
1984.82-1922,2,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,3213.609,3217.403,"By their regulatory schemes, by their orders."
1984.82-1922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3221.168,3223.167,"Well, is that covered in your brief?"
1984.82-1922,2,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,3223.167,3223.729,--Yes.
1984.82-1922,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.729,3227.696,Are there regulations that say that you have to file joint rates?
1984.82-1922,2,16144,allen_i_hirsch,,3227.696,3230.602,It sets forth the procedures for doing so.
