1979.78-1078,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.518,We'll hear arguments first this morning in World-Wide Volkswagen Corporation against Woodson.
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,12.729,17.128,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-1078,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.323,207.489,It's by the St. Laurent.
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,207.489,211.163,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1078,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,247.142,273.909,"Do you think any distinction can be drawn between those two parties so far as the issue of this case is concerned, that is the distributor thinking, “Well, the things I sell are more likely to be used in Oklahoma as contrasted the seatrain who was pretty local” or would you -- I take it you classify them together?"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,273.909,277.545,"I would classify them together, Your Honor."
1979.78-1078,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.236,333.436,"But if this accident had happened on the Pennsylvania-New York boarder, it would be a somewhat different case than this one, would it not?"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,333.436,334.917,I think that there may be.
1979.78-1078,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,351.671,354.431,"At least here, your accident was in Oklahoma."
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,354.431,356.084,"Here, the accident was in Oklahoma."
1979.78-1078,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,356.084,367.011,"So your witnesses to the accident are likely to be there in contrast to Justice Rehnquist's hypothetical, had the accident happened in Pennsylvania."
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,367.011,367.392,Right.
1979.78-1078,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,403.609,410.074,Does the record show why the other defendant submitted to Oklahoma jurisdiction?
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,410.074,417.685,"If Your Honor please, the other defendants that's Audi NSU and Volkswagen of America have submitted to jurisdiction (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.78-1078,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,417.685,420.543,"Does the record show why, my question?"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,420.543,423.665,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1078,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,423.665,434.358,Does the record disclose any contractual limitations on the petitioners as to the areas in which they may carry on their activities?
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,434.358,462.051,"There's nothing in the record on that subject, Your Honor, except for the express statement by Seaway that its business is a local business and did not contemplate doing business outside of -- outside the State and the express statement by World-Wide to the same effect that it did not contemplate doing business outside the three States in which it was a wholesaler."
1979.78-1078,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,462.051,468.675,"Mr. Rubin, did you represent the other defendants?"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,468.675,473.425,I -- I personally did not --
1979.78-1078,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,473.425,474.35,Did your firm (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,474.35,478.435,-- my -- my firm has -- has connections with the other defendants.
1979.78-1078,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,478.435,489.578,And -- but then your firm chose not to resist Oklahoma or jurisdiction in Oklahoma for that.
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,489.578,491.904,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,491.904,511.403,"Mr. Rubin and that said, you said the record doesn't show why the other companies did not resist, but the record does contain the complaint which alleges that they advertised nationally and specifically in Oklahoma and that allegation is un-denied so wasn't it fair to assume that that's the reason that they -- jurisdiction could be asserted over them (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,511.403,517.139,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I don't know that that was the reason and frankly I --"
1979.78-1078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,517.139,520.008,But you said the allegation is in the record and it's un-denied.
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,520.008,525.975,There is such an allegation and there is no --
1979.78-1078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,525.975,528.851,Whereas there is a denial as to the clients before the Court now?
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,528.851,529.693,No.
1979.78-1078,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,569.747,573.024,(Inaudible)
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,573.024,576.744,"Well, the record doesn't even talk about Arizona, Your Honor."
1979.78-1078,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,586.313,588.197,Driving through Oklahoma?
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,588.197,592.496,"Driving through Oklahoma, that's right Your Honor."
1979.78-1078,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1043.223,1082.964,"Mr. Rubin, do you quarrel with the statement of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma on page 6A of the petition for writ for certiorari where it says in the first full paragraph on that page, the evidence presented below demonstrated that goods sold and distributed by the petitioners were used in the City of Oklahoma and under the facts, we believe it reasonable to infer -- infer given the retail value of the automobile that the petitioners derive substantial -- substantial income from automobiles which from time to time are use in the City of Oklahoma?"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1082.964,1084.895,"I certainly quarrel with that, Your Honor."
1979.78-1078,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.215,1149.339,"What -- what if the wholesaler had been located in Southern Kansas and although its territory was not Oklahoma, it was -- it included Kansas so that it would be foreseeable that cars sold in Kansas would on occasion be driven into Oklahoma."
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1151.0,1153.388,I -- I think it would be quite a different case.
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1173.468,1175.09,What do you mean purposeful activity?
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1185.069,1201.218,I think that there -- there would have to be a showing that there was a direction of the -- of the energy of this defendant to getting the benefits of the laws of the state of the forum.
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.218,1204.018,What benefit does somebody get?
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1219.682,1252.523,"Well, Your Honor, I think the -- the concept is one of -- if this seller intends to localize its activity, intends to isolate itself from being involved in lawsuits in other jurisdictions and simply restricts its activity, then it says, ""I want to have the benefit of the laws of my State to the exclusion of the laws of some other State."""
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.523,1259.29,What about Mr. Justice Rehnquist's example and what -- why would -- why would it be a different case?
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1264.549,1294.859,"Well, if -- if the seller, for example, considered that to be part of his market, considered that people who are coming from that State were buying its cars and it was appealing to those people, it was -- its advertising certainly would be a kind of activity which might subjected to jurisdiction in that other State and then its obtaining the benefit of the laws of that other State."
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.941,1299.385,"Well, what if it --"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1299.385,1299.997,-- from those --
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.997,1305.646,-- what if it doesn't advertise or anything but something that Oklahoma people just happen to come up there and buy some cars?
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1305.646,1318.184,"I think, Your Honor, that that would bring us to a situation where the involvement of the forum is the result of purely unilateral action on the part of people outside."
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1318.184,1320.049,And then -- and then he wouldn't be subject to suit?
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1320.049,1322.47,I think if it's purely unilateral.
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.854,1330.808,And to this case you think?
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1330.808,1337.494,In this case depending again on the quality of the contacts and the purposefulness of the activity.
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1337.494,1342.787,"Well, do you think then it's just enough to anticipate that the cars you sell will be driven in another State?"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1342.787,1348.709,"I think, Your Honor, that any product can be anticipated to be found in another State."
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.656,1408.926,"Well, if -- if the seller in Kansas sells to a traveling salesman, sells it to his next door neighbor, and he knows he's a traveling salesman who travels once a week to Oklahoma, and he knows the car is going to -- go to Oklahoma."
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1423.248,1427.458,"If it's merely an anticipation, Your Honor, I don't think that that would be sufficient."
1979.78-1078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.418,1470.413,"Mr. Rubin, if I understand your argument correctly, you really didn't have to answer Mr. Justice Rehnquist the way you did and although you think the Supreme Court of Oklahoma is illogical, if I understand your position, what you're saying is even if the Oklahoma Supreme Court is right that use in Oklahoma was foreseeable, nevertheless, there was still no jurisdiction because that wouldn't --"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1470.413,1470.71,That's --
1979.78-1078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1470.71,1484.479,"It's really the same case in -- in your legal terms as if the customers said, ""Well, I'm going to drive the car to Oklahoma and the dealer says I don't care where you drive it as long as you pay -- pay for it,"" and then he drove it to Oklahoma, you'd still say there is no jurisdiction?"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1484.479,1486.818,"I would say, Your Honor, that -- that's correct --"
1979.78-1078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.818,1486.993,Yes.
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1486.993,1489.578,-- that foreseeability alone is not enough.
1979.78-1078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.578,1492.91,So we could assume foreseeability and still accept your argument.
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1494.253,1496.136,"Except in this case, Your Honor."
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.103,1622.101,"Mr. Rubin, do you suppose it would be different if in the Kansas Oklahoma example, the -- the car that was in the accident that came from Kansas was a rental car and the defendant was Hertz."
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1622.101,1625.379,I think that there -- there would be a difference.
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.379,1632.252,"So you -- you mean that Hertz would be subject to suit because it's car, and anticipate its car would be protected by Oklahoma laws."
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1632.252,1633.79,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1633.79,1649.304,"Well, what about -- well, then what about -- what about the -- the automobile dealer who sells cars in Kansas to his next door neighbor, who's a traveling salesman and he takes a mortgage?"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1660.659,1678.047,"He -- he may have an interest in the car, but I don't think that -- I -- I would think it's -- that you have a question of whether you don't have an attenuated situation merely to indicate that there is a minimum contact by reason of the fact that he has a mortgage on --"
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1678.047,1680.559,"Well, what about the lessor of the car?"
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1681.874,1684.326,The lessor of the car has liability.
1979.78-1078,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.949,1693.66,"Well, how do -- you just answered the -- you just answered the whole case then on the -- on the lessor case."
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1696.394,1712.34,"I think the lessor -- the lessor would -- where he anticipates that the car is going to be going out of the State if it's rented, if -- if we're talking now about Hertz, I would say that the lessor would be liable -- would be subject to jurisdiction --"
1979.78-1078,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1712.34,1714.87,Because that's the activity of the defendant lessor.
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1714.87,1715.76,That's his business.
1979.78-1078,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1716.117,1717.016,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1717.016,1720.76,He's looking to lease his car and have it travel --
1979.78-1078,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1720.76,1721.448,To Oklahoma.
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1721.448,1723.331,-- throughout the entire country.
1979.78-1078,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1731.381,1743.735,For some of these rental releases have a geographical limitation and do you think that presence of such a contractual provision would change the result?
1979.78-1078,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1743.735,1749.936,"I think it would, Your Honor."
1979.78-1078,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1749.936,1751.364,Mr. Greer.
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1751.364,1756.355,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1078,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1881.278,1882.682,"Mr. Greer, it's a two-way street, isn't it?"
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1882.682,1883.194,I beg your pardon.
1979.78-1078,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1883.194,1886.582,"That's a two-way street, isn't it?"
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1886.582,1887.274,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1078,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.948,1902.144,"In every instance, is it not, with modern travel if it makes it easier for the defendant to come to Oklahoma, makes it easier for the Oklahoma resident to go to some other jurisdiction?"
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1902.144,1931.566,"Except that -- as this Court has pointed out in the recent denial of a certiorari, it's very difficult to defend personal injury action several hundred miles away from the scene of the accident where all of the witnesses and the scene of the accidents, records, doctors and so forth are located."
1979.78-1078,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.566,1940.396,"Mr. Greer, what if it had been a toaster that was sold in Massena in upstate New York rather than a VW?"
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1940.396,1952.908,"Yes, sir, I think that we must consider the nature of the product and I think the important thing here is that, this is a mobile product and it's been recognized."
1979.78-1078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1957.462,1965.641,"A moving chattel is mobile, isn't it, and long before the automobile, travelling salesman back in the days since the 19th Century had been riding trains and --"
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1965.641,1965.98,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1965.98,1972.724,"-- whether it be their -- the shoes they wear, the toothbrush and their suitcase or whatever."
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1975.423,1980.751,"Yes, sir, but in the case of an automobile, we can anticipate its use."
1979.78-1078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1981.756,1987.872,"Well, you can anticipate that a toothbrush is a -- is a very mobile product and it's going to be carried by its owner from State to State."
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,1987.872,2003.69,"That's true and I think that's a factor that should be considered if a corner grocer, for example, is selling a toothbrush, he cannot anticipate, he should not foresee that he'd be called upon, perhaps, to defend --"
1979.78-1078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2003.69,2008.56,But why -- why any less so than the -- than the defendants in this case?
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,2008.56,2009.787,"Well, because the --"
1979.78-1078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2009.787,2012.049,People have always traveled long before the automobile.
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,2014.114,2014.96,Yes.
1979.78-1078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2014.96,2020.633,"-- since -- since the 19th century, certainly, there has been a great deal of interstate travel ever since we've had railroad trains --"
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,2020.633,2020.718,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2020.718,2024.188,-- of traveling salesmen and others businessmen of other kinds.
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,2024.188,2025.284,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1078,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2043.922,2045.76,(Voice Overlap) chainsaw --
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,2045.76,2046.477,I beg your pardon.
1979.78-1078,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.477,2052.833,"What if the word ""chainsaw"" which certainly is no less dangerous than an automobile?"
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,2052.833,2074.714,"Well, our argument is that when a seller places a dangerous product or a product that can produce danger in interstate commerce with reasonable foreseeability that it will be used in foreign jurisdictions, then he should be called upon to defend."
1979.78-1078,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2074.714,2075.147,Okay.
1979.78-1078,1,30412,jefferson_g_greer,,2104.858,2120.455,"Well, again, we don't think that -- that -- if you're considering foreseeability as an element here and it has been considered -- at least touched upon by the Court in these decisions, they'll think that he can reasonably foresee that."
