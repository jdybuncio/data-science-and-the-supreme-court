2011.10-1542,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.022,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1542, Holder v. Gutierrez, and the consolidated case."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,11.056,13.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1542,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,93.676,101.866,But did it make that determination as a legal matter or as an exercise of its discretion?
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,110.137,110.554,--I think--
2011.10-1542,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,110.554,121.779,"--the statute ambiguous, where has it explained its policy decisions independent of its legal conclusions?"
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,121.779,131.301,"--First of all, Justice Sotomayor, we don't think the statute is ambiguous, and so we don't think there's any reason to go to Chevron step two in this case."
2011.10-1542,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,181.234,189.589,"You say that you think the statute is unambiguous, but it -- it doesn't address issues of imputation at all, does it?"
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,189.589,192.125,It does not address issues of imputation.
2011.10-1542,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,192.125,195.743,"Well, if it doesn't even address it, it seems to me the best you can say is that it's ambiguous."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,195.743,203.933,"Well, I don't think that a statute, as this Court has recognized, has to address every conceivable possibility in order to be unambiguous."
2011.10-1542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,213.872,232.333,"What about, there was -- wasn't there in the prior law a child domicile -- a child was able to satisfy the 7-year requirement based on the parent's domicile, which was deemed to be the child's?"
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,232.333,232.916,Right.
2011.10-1542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.186,264.905,I guess the child doesn't have any domicile except the parents; right?
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,269.125,279.231,"Under this Court's decision in Holyfield, the common law rule is that the child's domicile is determined by that of his parents, regardless of where the child resides in fact."
2011.10-1542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,296.776,311.452,And -- and is that change alone sufficient for us to say that this is -- was a clear indication by the Congress of an intent or purpose to alter the imputation rule?
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,311.452,348.827,"I think if this Court is willing to presume along with Respondents that Congress would have been aware of these three court of appeals decisions that were issued, it should be noted, very late in the life of a provision that had existed in more or less the same form since the Immigration Act of 1917, then the Court also must presume that Congress was aware that the basis for those decisions was the common law definition of the term ""domicile"", and that Congress meant what it did when it replaced ""domicile"" with three eligibility criteria that are defined terms in the immigration law and all of which refer to attributes that are individual to a specific alien."
2011.10-1542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.827,361.135,Does -- does a child who is not emancipated have the capacity to independently establish a residence?
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,361.135,369.324,"Under the -- how the INA defines the term ""residence"" is an actual principal dwelling in fact."
2011.10-1542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,388.452,395.605,Can a parent ask for a permanent resident status for a 5-year-old child?
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,395.605,398.474,"Yes, A parent could."
2011.10-1542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,398.474,401.526,"So if you have two cases, one, two 5-year-olds."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,415.036,417.221,"I think that's right, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-1542,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,443.122,472.29,"Assuming we don't accept Respondent's, what appears to be their argument, that being an LPR is not a requirement of the statute, if we assume that being an LPR is what triggers the availability for the Attorney General's exercise of discretion, how does that -- how does the imputation rule harm the statute?"
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,518.253,527.126,I think it's worth separating out two different components of the cancellation of removal decision.
2011.10-1542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,626.392,626.942,So how does it work?
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,649.923,653.042,It will depend on the individual circumstances.
2011.10-1542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,653.042,653.575,"Well, no."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,655.994,656.344,Right.
2011.10-1542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,656.344,657.311,That's all you know.
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,657.311,662.481,So Congress has taken some steps with respect to some subset of aliens.
2011.10-1542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,668.385,669.585,I'm not asking for that.
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,705.142,711.062,"--Well, I think the answer is certainly not that we impute the admission of the child--"
2011.10-1542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,711.062,711.748,I'm not asking that.
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,714.631,715.165,--So if there is--
2011.10-1542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,715.165,715.782,--to give an answer.
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,720.317,722.186,"--Well, I think that--"
2011.10-1542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,722.186,723.888,And you don't want me to reach that conclusion.
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,723.888,725.121,"--No, I think that that is incorrect."
2011.10-1542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,732.844,741.35,If the supposition -- if the supposition is that the parents -- I think Justice Breyer's supposition was that both parents were LPRs.
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,748.937,751.289,"--Well, that's certainly right."
2011.10-1542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,753.741,754.358,"No, no."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,757.042,757.642,--Right.
2011.10-1542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.886,778.606,"But I suppose if they come with somebody else's 6-month-old child, they would have to send that child back to China, too, wouldn't they?"
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,778.606,780.225,Well--
2011.10-1542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,780.225,784.427,"Which would be very sad, but that would be the law, right?"
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,784.427,784.877,--Well--
2011.10-1542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,784.877,787.379,"Actually they came from Italy, in my hypothetical."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,788.112,793.533,"--I mean, I think that Martinez--"
2011.10-1542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,793.533,795.568,"They should not have sent him back to China, then."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,799.103,804.138,--I think that Martinez Gutierrez's situation I think is a good example of this.
2011.10-1542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,856.94,874.818,"Can you give me an example of an instance in which the child who is the child of two lawful permanent residents cannot get lawful permanent resident status for himself at the age of 8, but that he can at 15?"
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,884.875,888.16,That would make him ineligible at the age of 15?
2011.10-1542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,888.16,896.314,"Well, you -- the whole point here is that some children are given lawful permanent resident status and -- and some are not."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,914.645,920.631,I think the most common scenario is one in which a visa number doesn't become available until the child is -- is--
2011.10-1542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,920.631,922.248,"Oh, I know, a visa number."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,931.937,951.767,"--That would be the most common scenario, is -- is where the child is in the queue, and they think -- Respondents placed a great deal of emphasis on the amount of time it takes for visa numbers to become available for both children and spouses of lawful permanent residents, but that has been a regular and acknowledged feature of the immigration system for decades."
2011.10-1542,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1000.014,1011.889,"Ms. Kruger, you take a statute that doesn't say anything about imputation one way or the other, and you say that statute can still be unambiguous; and that would I think be true as a general matter."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1050.364,1061.489,"I think the answer is no, Justice Kagan, because the other circumstances in which imputation has been allowed under the immigration laws differ in very important respects from the imputation--"
2011.10-1542,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1061.489,1063.789,"But none of them are textually commanded, is that right?"
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1071.094,1078.498,"--Well, I don't think that the only reason that the agency has allowed for imputation is that there is good reason as a general policy matter."
2011.10-1542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.498,1079.983,"Counsel, I can't hear you very well."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1080.95,1081.233,Certainly.
2011.10-1542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.233,1082.735,--crank up the thing or something?
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1083.335,1086.27,I will try to speak more directly into the microphone.
2011.10-1542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1128.047,1128.397,Excuse me.
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1136.87,1138.655,"--Well, that's correct."
2011.10-1542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.822,1140.589,Yes.
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1140.589,1152.212,"But I think the critical point is that the agency has interpreted imputation of intent, of state of mind, to be permissible, in part for the same reason that the common law rule about domicile formed, which is that--"
2011.10-1542,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1152.212,1158.918,So you think that all the imputations that exist in immigration law are all a matter of imputing intent?
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1158.918,1166.322,--I think that that's -- all of the imputations that Respondents have pointed to concern state of mind type requirements.
2011.10-1542,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1200.395,1205.014,So why is a parent's fraudulent conduct imputed to a child?
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1237.402,1248.21,"Well, I think that where the imputation has come in, in the board's analysis is with respect to the state of mind and not with respect to the objective conduct."
2011.10-1542,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1248.21,1252.412,"What's the state of mind of committing an act, like a fraudulent act?"
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1252.412,1264.486,"It's -- I think where this has come up is in the context of knowing that the -- that the alien is not in fact admissible to the United States, is generally where it's come up."
2011.10-1542,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1264.486,1266.538,The child doesn't commit a fraudulent act.
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1266.538,1277.729,"But again, I think that the principle that the board has applied is that, because the child is presumed not capable of forming a requisite intent, the parent's intent is imputed to the child."
2011.10-1542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1306.582,1307.982,They do say--
2011.10-1542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1307.982,1323.008,It's a little odd that the domicile is the more exacting of the two requirements and yet the Congress allowed imputation in the domicile case but not -- not in the residence case.
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1324.293,1326.426,"Well, to be--"
2011.10-1542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1326.426,1332.982,"Congress enacts a more forgiving, less exacting standard, but then takes away the imputation."
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1332.982,1339.386,"--Well, to be clear, Justice Kennedy, Congress did not supply a definition of the term ""domicile""."
2011.10-1542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1415.803,1418.588,I don't see how -- were you finished?
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1418.588,1418.972,Yes.
2011.10-1542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1418.972,1427.194,I don't see how you can read the Lepe-Guitron -- that was one of the cases -- it seems to me clearly imputes residence as well.
2011.10-1542,0,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1487.666,1500.04,"I don't think it is, but first I'd like to clarify that the Ninth Circuit had no reason to impute residence in Lepe-Guitron, in part because the alien in that case had resided in fact in the United States throughout the 7-year period."
2011.10-1542,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1575.457,1576.54,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1583.128,1586.932,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-1542,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1614.249,1621.669,I don't know whether -- I am having trouble applying the concepts of unambiguous and ambiguous in this situation.
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1632.011,1636.614,I think it's ambiguous as applied to this specific circumstance.
2011.10-1542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.865,1685.345,"Well, can you give any example -- the government says you can't -- of an instance where status is imputed, not intent, but just status; where the status that the parents have is automatically given to the child, or for that matter automatically taken away from the child."
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1685.345,1689.749,"Section 212(c) imputed status, as the Ninth Circuit found."
2011.10-1542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1703.64,1709.977,"But there -- there, you're -- what they are imputing is the intent to remain in the place, right?"
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1713.365,1722.553,"--No, they also had to impute lawfulness, which meant that the parent had to be an LPR for that period or at least in some lawful status."
2011.10-1542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.376,1737.996,And the child would not have been lawfully there but for the imputation of lawfulness from the parents.
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1737.996,1738.53,--That's right.
2011.10-1542,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1741.698,1752.554,"Mr. Kinnaird, I take it that the point you are making is the statute is ambiguous in the sense that its silence does not prevent the BIA from making this imputation if it wants to."
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1756.54,1765.896,"Well, I think if it is ambiguous, then the BIA actually has to exercise its discretion and grapple with that ambiguity."
2011.10-1542,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1769.281,1776.102,"Well, are you saying that the BIA needs to write an opinion that says, now we are doing Chevron step two analysis?"
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1778.537,1799.467,"--I don't think it's a matter of magic words, but what it has to do is actually grapple with and recognize the ambiguity, at least in the alternative, and then exercise its discretion to say if this is a permissible construction of the act and there is another permissible construction, which of the two better serves the statutory purpose."
2011.10-1542,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1799.467,1803.152,But it doesn't have to grapple with everything that's not there.
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1806.188,1807.156,Agreed.
2011.10-1542,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1807.156,1810.342,It seems to me that they don't have to grapple with everything that's there.
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1817.512,1818.881,I don't think--
2011.10-1542,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1818.881,1823.316,"You're saying: We think this law should allow -- should provide for this, should extend for this."
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1849.4,1851.085,"--Well, that's right, Your Honor."
2011.10-1542,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1864.46,1880.604,"Your -- your argument, under your argument an alien, a child who would never acquired LPR status in its own right, could get a cancellation of removal based on the parents' status."
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1880.604,1882.521,--I don't think that's right.
2011.10-1542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.935,1930.704,What would--
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1930.704,1936.173,"So if you are not an actual LPR, you need to have adjustment of status to not be in a legal limbo."
2011.10-1542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1936.173,1947.714,"--Mr. Kinnaird, what would happen if the child remains with the grandparents in Mexico and his parents are living in Los Angeles for 6 years until they can afford to take him."
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1959.605,1969.662,"I think if there is a significant separation of that duration, I think there would be a question about whether you have the significant relationship between parent and child to warrant imputation."
2011.10-1542,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1977.733,1985.672,"You had an example in your brief, I thought you might -- I thought it was an example of status rather than intent."
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2008.371,2009.054,That's right.
2011.10-1542,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2103.516,2115.391,There -- this Court has dealt in the constitutional context with parent-child relationships under the immigration law.
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2164.989,2166.34,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1542,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2180.266,2191.824,Isn't it -- why can't the BIA adopt or why doesn't the background principle apply that you are not entitled to admission unless you make an affirmative case for it?
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2201.83,2209.102,"Well, I think they have to look to the actual statute and they have to give their own reasons, which I don't think they have done adequately as a matter of discretion."
2011.10-1542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.102,2230.282,"Why isn't it -- why isn't it an adequate reason that they've come up with here and in their decisions that the prior word was ""domicile"" and a child's domicile is that of the parents, and that the word under the new statute is ""residence"" and the child's residence is not necessarily the residence of the parent?"
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2233.968,2236.586,"Well, I wouldn't say that's Chevron step 2 discretion."
2011.10-1542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.679,2251.362,"That may well be, but it's a different word."
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2251.362,2252.295,--It's a different word.
2011.10-1542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2252.295,2256.597,"And the one word demands imputation, the other doesn't."
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2262.317,2271.923,"Well, the rational basis comes in, if there is ambiguity and they are determining why, if it's a permissible construction, why it should be rejected or not."
2011.10-1542,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2271.923,2278.863,One of the problems that I have is that I see the imputation as an equitable doctrine.
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2278.863,2279.429,Yes.
2011.10-1542,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2279.429,2283.315,And to me that often means discretionary.
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2283.315,2283.998,Yes.
2011.10-1542,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2283.998,2303.561,"If it is that, discretionary, I -- I don't know what more the BIA has to say than 1229b(a)(2)."
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2339.234,2343.353,"Well, I would say the statute has an equitable purpose which allows imputation."
2011.10-1542,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2391.119,2395.904,What is so reasonable about a child who lives with their grandparents outside the country?
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2409.08,2409.531,Right.
2011.10-1542,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2409.531,2410.18,So--
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2410.18,2424.923,"And if -- and BIA, I think it would be reasonable to draw a narrower rule and we could prevail under that rule, but I think the rationale is family unity; that even though there are periods of residence where there is a dysjunction, the real reason is simply the operation of quotas."
2011.10-1542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2437.665,2448.223,"Mr. Kinnaird, I'm having trouble figuring out, is your view that non-imputation is just unreasonable per se, or is your view that they didn't explain non-imputation properly?"
2011.10-1542,1,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2448.223,2449.773,They are alternative arguments.
2011.10-1542,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2489.7,2490.4,"Thank you, Mr. Kinnaird."
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2500.257,2504.292,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2539.132,2542.25,We usually like to start with the statutory language.
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2545.952,2550.088,"Imputation as such, as has been said, is not directly addressed."
2011.10-1542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2607.843,2613.763,What does the statute say about imputation of individuals' residence to grandparents?
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2613.763,2618.75,--The rule -- it says nothing directly about it.
2011.10-1542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2618.75,2619.65,It says nothing about it.
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2629.19,2638.562,"Well, I think there could be circumstances in which imputation is appropriate when the child is in the custody of the grandparent."
2011.10-1542,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2660.744,2670.45,"What do you do -- what you do if the parents, the father is an LPR, the mother is not?"
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2678.873,2693.383,"There are rules, common law rules, that the courts had applied in determining whose residence and whose domicile would be attributed to the child when the parents were not -- didn't have joint custody."
2011.10-1542,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2696.084,2697.184,They have joint custody.
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2698.852,2716.764,"--I think that -- again, the courts have applied -- if it we are distinguishing -- for purposes of residence, and I'm not talking bower the technical LPR status here when I use the term ""residence"", I am referring simply to kind of a general common law concept."
2011.10-1542,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2716.764,2722.418,I think it's agreed that LPR status would be necessary.
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2725.77,2726.104,We--
2011.10-1542,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2726.104,2728.472,--We are talking about the five-year period and the seven-year period.
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2730.758,2737.994,"--We agree ultimately to get relief, the child has to have LPR status, and certainly under subsection (1) of the provision, which is not at issue in the Sawyers case."
2011.10-1542,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.287,2776.67,Excuse me.
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2779.088,2780.138,--It was indeed.
2011.10-1542,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2792.562,2802.751,"Just for factual correction, the record doesn't tell us whether he was living with his mother, Mr. Sawyers was living with his mother."
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2802.751,2804.37,That's correct.
2011.10-1542,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2804.37,2807.404,And the answer to that is?
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2810.523,2818.193,The record doesn't reflect -- we don't know if he was living in U.S. in an unlawful status up until the point he became an LPR at age 15.
2011.10-1542,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2819.962,2823.664,You are saying -- I just want to hear your whole argument here.
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2835.439,2838.341,That's the principle in -- that's correct.
2011.10-1542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2868.026,2874.03,"What if he came to the United States at 15 from Jamaica, he was a resident of the United States before he came."
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2874.03,2875.132,As a -- as a legal matter.
2011.10-1542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2877.332,2879.418,"Would he be a resident of Jamaica, too, at that time?"
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2879.418,2881.036,I think not.
2011.10-1542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2886.422,2890.808,"If the father was living in the U.K., would he be a resident of the U.K.?"
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2890.808,2899.331,There might be legal rules that -- that specify the physical presence is equivalent to residence for particular purposes.
2011.10-1542,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2919.328,2922.197,So can he be a resident without being a domiciliary?
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2922.197,2935.254,"One can be -- yes, because the definition, as this Court said, of ""domicile"" is residence in a particular place accompanied by an intent to remain there indefinitely."
2011.10-1542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3040.071,3054.378,"If Congress had wanted to use the term 7 years, what language would they have used, or what language should they have used?"
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3054.378,3055.961,For -- for the child?
2011.10-1542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3057.178,3068.952,"If they wanted (2) to mean that the alien must have actually -- that person -- unless the one who committed the crime later, must actually have resided in the United States continuously for 7 years--"
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3068.952,3069.721,--I would--
2011.10-1542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3069.721,3073.756,"--in which they have actually lived in the United States for 7 years, what language should they have used?"
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3073.756,3083.529,"--For -- for an adult, the language that they did use, because I think ""continuous residence"" carries with it the requirement that the person be physically present in the United States."
2011.10-1542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3083.529,3083.995,Or a minor.
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3083.995,3084.481,For a minor--
2011.10-1542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3084.481,3085.831,That's to apply to everybody.
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3085.831,3095.437,"--I -- I would think, given the context, of which imputation was the settled rule, that Congress would have had to indicate affirmatively that imputation was impermissible."
2011.10-1542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3111.548,3113.064,"""Domicile"" is a legal term."
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3122.939,3126.641,"--Well, and -- and ""reside"" can have different meanings in different contexts."
2011.10-1542,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3193.868,3201.456,Is -- is there some advantage to giving parents an incentive to apply for early lawful permanent residence?
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3221.686,3227.423,"--I -- I -- the only thing we're talking about here, of course, is -- is a particular relief from a removal provision."
2011.10-1542,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3240.164,3255.091,"Mr. Rothfeld, I'm -- I'm curious, how often -- this dispute here is simply about whether the Attorney General is permitted to cancel removal, right?"
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3255.091,3255.693,--That is correct.
2011.10-1542,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3255.693,3263.68,How often does our -- are applications for cancellation of removal granted?
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3276.606,3278.356,I -- I can't give you current statistics.
2011.10-1542,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3288.164,3289.764,You think it's as high as 40 percent?
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3289.764,3295.484,"--I believe that that's -- I wouldn't swear to that, Your Honor, but -- but it is a -- a significant percentage."
2011.10-1542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3326.103,3336.145,"I suppose one of the things you could take into account in exercising his discretion is whether we're actually dealing with a minor, or as I understand in this case, it's someone who is quite a bit older?"
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3336.145,3355.956,"He -- it is unreviewable discretion, yes, if you take anything into account -- and certainly, the nature of the family ties, the -- the background of the immigrant, all of those things are taken into account, but the question -- whether or not Congress when it passed this statute, knowing how section 212(c) had been interpreted, the prospect that Congress meant to--"
2011.10-1542,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3355.956,3358.158,"Counsel, that's a very big assumption."
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3378.388,3380.94,"--Well, I can give you--"
2011.10-1542,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3380.94,3382.024,And that's what the BIA was saying.
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3382.024,3384.542,"--I can give you two responses to that, if I may, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-1542,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3391.03,3393.296,It can't be aware of all the judicial decisions.
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3393.296,3406.806,"--No, but in this particular context, there's particular reason to think they would, because Congress, it is agreed, enacted this legislation to cure a conflict in the circuits involving the application of this cancellation provision."
2011.10-1542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3411.092,3416.395,"You -- you said you had two points in this -- do -- do you want to get your second out, in half a sentence?"
2011.10-1542,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3416.395,3418.947,"I -- I -- I can rest at this point, Your Honor."
2011.10-1542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3420.197,3420.549,Thank you.
2011.10-1542,3,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3422.082,3425.434,Thank you.
2011.10-1542,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3427.203,3433.873,"The -- the Respondent said that the BIA gave no policy reasons, no policy justifications, for its -- for its interpretation."
2011.10-1542,3,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3434.957,3436.309,--I don't think that that is correct.
2011.10-1542,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3454.52,3465.244,"But what do you respond to the point that lawfulness has been attributed, not just intent, but under the prior law, lawfulness was also attributed?"
2011.10-1542,3,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3465.244,3468.696,I think this goes back to the answer I was giving to Justice Breyer earlier.
2011.10-1542,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3521.498,3529.569,"Counsel -- Counsel, in response to Justice Kennedy's question about whether they gave a policy reason, your answer was that they, you know, followed the history."
2011.10-1542,3,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3532.087,3547.565,"Well, in -- in addition to discussing the individual nature of LPR status, they also noted the consequence of the Ninth Circuit's imputation rule would be to permit a kind of end run around the substantive eligibility requirements for LPR status."
2011.10-1542,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3565.944,3567.244,Is that the case under the prior law?
2011.10-1542,3,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3567.244,3572.598,--Under the -- under former section 212(c).
2011.10-1542,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3572.598,3573.248,"Yes, if--"
2011.10-1542,3,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3573.248,3574.049,Again--
2011.10-1542,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3574.049,3576.099,--So it's not unthinkable.
2011.10-1542,3,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3576.099,3585.171,--No court had imputed LPR status the threshold requirement for relief under the -- under the predecessor statute from parent to child.
2011.10-1542,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3595.296,3605.419,"I just don't understand that argument, because they've conceded that you need the -- the child needs their own LPR status before it triggers--"
2011.10-1542,3,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3605.419,3606.252,Right.
2011.10-1542,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3607.187,3607.604,--the residency.
2011.10-1542,3,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3607.604,3610.306,--I think that concession is important for the following reason.
2011.10-1542,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3672.879,3673.813,"Thank you, counsel."
