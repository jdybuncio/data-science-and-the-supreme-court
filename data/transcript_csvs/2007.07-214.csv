2007.07-214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,13.074,"We'll hear argument today in Case 07-214, Allison Engine Company versus United States ex rel. Sanders and Thacker."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,14.324,28.25,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The False Claims Act addresses and redresses fraud on the government, not on every recipient of government funds."
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,111.903,117.621,What about the certificates of conformance with specifications of?
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,129.378,154.63,"The district court very carefully analyzed that evidence, as well as all the other evidence in the case, Justice Ginsburg, and found that an inference could not be drawn with respect to what had happened or when it happened because there is a time lag to drawing an inference from certificates of performance when you don't know when those certificates were made, when they were submitted to the government, what they said."
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,154.63,161.067,Could the government have asked... could the Navy have asked for them?
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,161.067,164.852,"The Navy, you mean in connection with the litigation or in connection--"
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,164.852,165.038,No.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,198.675,215.386,"--The answer to your question as I understand it, Justice Ginsburg, is yes, the Navy had the right to test the equipment, look at the... look at the specifications, examine the specifications, ask for corrections if they were unsatisfied, to test the products."
2007.07-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.602,245.823,Did the Navy have the right to audit the subcontractor's books?
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,245.823,255.012,"--It's my understanding... I'm not 100 percent sure of that, Justice Kennedy, but it's my understanding that the government did have the right to follow the process all the way through."
2007.07-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.48,265.653,Suppose they audit the subcontractor's books and they don't discover a fraud and leave.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,268.219,272.187,"Well, I think it would depend upon what was in the books and whether there was--"
2007.07-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,272.187,278.841,The books show that X dollars were spent for certain parts and that was far too much.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,286.614,289.548,"--It... that might be, Justice Kennedy."
2007.07-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,383.844,385.777,I must be just missing something here.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,414.546,414.829,No.
2007.07-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,422.016,422.549,Yes.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,422.549,429.503,"--But one of the witnesses said, yes, the money that we received was money that came from the United States."
2007.07-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,429.503,430.872,Well... so why doesn't that end it?
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,435.493,438.109,"Well, that's the definition of the word ""claim""."
2007.07-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,438.109,438.528,"""Claim""."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,439.611,440.578,There has to be a claim.
2007.07-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,444.163,444.615,"That's right, that's right."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,444.615,448.901,Subsection (a) provides the standard for liability.
2007.07-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,460.041,462.06,"Well, you say (a), but we're talking about (a)--"
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,462.06,462.51,Yes.
2007.07-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,462.51,463.51,--in connection with (c).
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,463.51,463.843,Yes.
2007.07-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,465.862,467.964,But you were quoting from (a)(1).
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,467.964,470.497,"--No, I quoted from both (a)(1) and (a)(2)."
2007.07-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,471.432,487.526,"I know that, but doesn't (a)(2) stand by itself, especially as... as (c) is written, (c) and (2), (c) and (a)(2) make perfect grammatical sense without any presentation to the government."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,487.526,496.981,"--Well, it reads out the words ""by the government"" from that section, which is what the statute looked like until it was specifically amended."
2007.07-214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,496.981,499.083,"Well, the words (a)(2)."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,499.083,499.583,Pardon me?
2007.07-214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,499.583,502.063,The words (a)(2).
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,502.063,509.122,"They are in (a)(2), but the way Justice... the way Justice Kennedy was reading it, I respectfully submit, would read out those ""by the government""."
2007.07-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.157,515.195,"You're saying, in addition to being a claim, that's not enough reliability?"
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,517.361,518.913,--It's presented to the government and--
2007.07-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.913,521.765,And all that (c) does is tell you what a claim is.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,531.271,536.108,"--It's presented to the government or, under (a)(2), knowingly made to get--"
2007.07-214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,536.108,539.726,But (a)(2) says it has to be paid or approved by the government.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,539.726,545.13,--It has to be made or used to get a claim paid or approved.
2007.07-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,553.836,555.502,But you said given to the government.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,558.687,578.0,"--Well, I think a reasonable reading of the statute is... and this is essentially what this Court unanimously decided 20 years ago in the Tanner case, that these cases about defrauding the government must involve something that causes the government to suffer a loss, some something that impacts the government."
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,645.812,650.014,"But if it's disguised, how would the... how would the prime contractor know?"
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,650.014,652.899,"Well, that's just the point, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.584,685.467,"But there wasn't any trial, was there?"
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,685.467,686.636,There was a trial.
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,686.636,687.103,There was?
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,687.103,691.69,And there was a motion at the close of the evidence of the plaintiff's case.
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.744,706.699,"Well, how could... they would have at a minimum, even if your theory is not correct... they would have to prove loss to the government."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,709.918,711.651,"--That's... that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.446,731.648,"Does the other side concede that point, that you have to prove loss to the government?"
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,733.767,734.5,--I'm not sure.
2007.07-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.334,737.886,I don't think they do.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,737.886,740.171,--What the statute says--
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,740.171,742.872,"Well, the government certainly has that in its brief."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,742.872,750.728,--What the statute says is that it is liability to the government for the damage the government sustains.
2007.07-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.082,775.194,"You could say that the missed funds which are in the hands of subcontract... of contractors, harms the government, even though it doesn't come out of the government's pocket, because those funds were given for a particular purpose, and if that purpose is frustrated, the government is harmed."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,779.796,784.282,"Well, you could say that, but you don't know whether the government got what it wanted."
2007.07-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.542,812.367,"Well, suppose the government gives money for building schools, okay, to a State and a fraudulent claim is submitted as... in connection with the construction of the school."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,824.609,829.078,"Well, what you've done with your question, Justice Scalia, is left out the link."
2007.07-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.369,842.155,"I understand that, but that's a different point."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,842.155,842.721,"--No, it isn't--"
2007.07-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.721,853.527,I am talking now about the point of whether the government itself has to suffer any harm other than the fact that the money it gave was not used for the purpose for which it gave it.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,856.046,859.598,"--Well, it... it might under some circumstances be harm."
2007.07-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,878.528,881.446,"Mr. Olson, it seems to me you're fighting a hypothetical."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,897.04,898.925,--The Federal Government may have been injured.
2007.07-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,933.479,942.069,"But that's why the definition... it seems to me at the moment... that's why I'd like your view... that the language is perfectly ambiguous, the language of"
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1010.581,1012.348,--It has to be a false claim paid by the government.
2007.07-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1012.348,1013.215,It was a false claim.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1013.683,1019.485,"What... Justice Breyer, what is missing from your hypothetical is what went to the government."
2007.07-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1049.706,1052.308,"Well, it doesn't say that."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1081.577,1087.814,"Well, I think you are taking the words and isolating them."
2007.07-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.814,1088.664,That's true.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1088.664,1094.635,It is knowingly making a false record or a false statement to get a false claim paid.
2007.07-214,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1101.122,1102.657,"Well, that's not strictly correct."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1104.957,1106.593,"Yes, I should have said--"
2007.07-214,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1106.593,1137.747,"--which means there is a third way, and the third way of reading it is if the sub makes the false statement to the general contractor in order ultimately to get a false claim, i.e., the ultimate contractor's claim for conforming work, approved or this particular claim approved by the government when the government makes the ultimate decision to pay the general contractor, that would be covered by (2)."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1137.747,1141.866,"--Well, if... I should have said the word ""approved"" because I... I was shortening it up."
2007.07-214,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1154.44,1176.789,"But that can simply be done by the false claim to the general contractor, who either accepts it as true or, for that matter, knowingly understands that it is false, and ultimately submits the same claim, i.e., as an element of its ultimate bill for the whole project."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1176.789,1183.609,"Well, what I might say in addition to what I have said, Justice Souter, is that there is no stopping point for that theory."
2007.07-214,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1213.878,1216.664,"With respect, I think there is a limiting point."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1269.982,1285.158,"--I don't... I don't think, with respect, that that's a fair reading of what the government said either in the Tanner case, think making essentially the same arguments which were rejected unanimously by this Court, or what it says in its brief to the Court today."
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1285.158,1290.478,"Well, perhaps we should ask the government to explain what its position is."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1319.896,1358.706,"In... with respect to that, the government filed a brief in a case called Atkins versus McInteer in the Eleventh circuit, and I have the brief here... it is not part of the material that is before you... in which the government said that even if the District... D.C. Circuit decision that's involved in this case, the Totten case, was correctly decided, those Medicare-Medicaid cases would be substantially covered under the statute even under that construction because the provider's claim is passed on by the insurer to the Medicare agency or entity."
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1445.292,1459.819,"So the whole difference... the whole difference, then, is if the... the invoices are passed on, as opposed to the government having the right, if it so chooses, to inspect the books and records?"
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1459.819,1463.688,--I think I may not have heard your question.
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1464.456,1480.049,"The difference is if the government gets the invoices from the contractor, then there's a claim under the False Claims Act."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1496.392,1504.931,"--Well, I... I think... it's certainly not this case, because the... although the government had an opportunity to do these things, we don't know what happened."
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1504.931,1510.651,But it made... I thought you said that it is this case that the government had the right--
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1510.651,1511.686,If--
2007.07-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1511.686,1512.353,--to audit the--
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1512.353,1541.19,"--The problem is, as this Court said in the... unanimously in the Tanner case, given... forgive me for doing this, but it's important... given the immense variety of ways the Federal Government provides Federal financial assistance, always accompanied by some restrictions or conditions on its use, the inability of the substantial supervision language which the government was advancing then, which it's sort of advancing now, does not provide any test for any real guidance or--"
2007.07-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1541.19,1549.645,But the Tanner case didn't confront the statute which has the definition of claims that Justice Breyer is putting to you.
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1549.645,1549.828,--Yes--
2007.07-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1549.828,1560.417,"This statute that we're looking at, in effect, defines what a fraud against the government is."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1560.417,1574.361,"--Yes, but it... but when it was... when it added that section, it specifically added in the words ""by the government"", which those words were added after the legislative history that both the Respondents and the government cite."
2007.07-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.117,1602.661,"Am I correct in this that without the claim definition, the statute would not cover a fraudulent submission by the subcontractor to the contractor which is known to be passed on to the government ultimately?"
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1602.661,1603.196,"--No, I think--"
2007.07-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.196,1608.248,"Without that definition, the claim would be made against the contractor, not against the government."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1608.248,1608.817,--I--
2007.07-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.817,1610.8,"And, therefore, wouldn't be a claim."
2007.07-214,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1610.8,1624.36,"--I think under both the... if the claim by the subcontractor to the contractor is intended to be passed on, that the... that the contractor is an intermediary, then under Marcus versus Hess, which is the situation there, there could be liability."
2007.07-214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1628.229,1638.203,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1641.238,1657.665,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with the same point that Mr. Olson began with, namely, does the False Claims Act... is the False Claims Act directed solely at schemes to defraud the government or does it encompass schemes to defraud people who receive Federal money?"
2007.07-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1700.008,1702.21,"Mr. Stewart, I don't understand that point."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1723.357,1732.296,"Well, we would say certainly in the context where Allison knows that the engines are to be used for private work, that the False Claims Act would not--"
2007.07-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1732.296,1732.946,It just sells them engines.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1737.347,1742.318,"--I think you could still have a FCA claim, if in fact the work was being done for the government contract."
2007.07-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.89,1752.707,I have another question.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1789.563,1791.765,--Our view is that that would not be covered.
2007.07-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.765,1792.415,That would not be--
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1792.415,1793.015,That would not be covered.
2007.07-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.682,1794.2,--Why?
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1794.2,1800.688,"--Because the statute... if you look at page 2 of the blue brief, that reproduces the relevant provisions of the statute."
2007.07-214,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1828.136,1832.789,"--injured by it because it, in effect, gets less than it paid for?"
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1832.789,1833.156,Well--
2007.07-214,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1833.156,1837.943,"If it were a cost plus contract, the government would pay an extra 10,000 and it would lose."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1837.943,1838.327,--That's right.
2007.07-214,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1838.327,1846.649,"If they... if they simply supplied defective parts, the government would get less of a machine than it paid for."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1856.905,1857.472,That's correct.
2007.07-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.164,1884.222,"What you are saying is covered, I take it... and this is... I want to know how this has worked out... what is covered is... imagine government grant programs."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1928.168,1936.588,"--I mean, I think our test would be, is the effect of the fraud to cause the money provided by the Federal Government to be diverted to purposes--"
2007.07-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1936.588,1939.19,To get less than it was supposed to get.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1939.19,1939.59,--I--
2007.07-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.59,1942.009,And so this is what surprises me on your side.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1969.578,1971.195,"--I mean, I think... I think it has basically worked."
2007.07-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1974.43,1976.149,Have there been a lot of such cases?
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1976.149,1986.755,"--I think there are a lot of cases... I mean, Medicare and Medicaid fraud is an example that we would deal with differently textually, but those are programs in which the Federal Government provides money."
2007.07-214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1995.876,2006.668,"Mr. Olson said on the Medicare that the providers, that the intermediary does present the--"
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2006.668,2018.409,"--And our view is that those would be covered even if there is a presentment requirement, because subsection (a)(1) of the statute refers to a person who knowingly causes a false claim to be presented to a Federal official."
2007.07-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2058.184,2059.553,"Well, how far down the line?"
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2105.748,2108.367,I think our answer would probably be yes.
2007.07-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.055,2116.622,A hundred dollars more a can.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2117.841,2125.578,"--Well, the answer to that hypothetical... and the answer to that hypothetical really has nothing to do with whether the statute imposes a presentment requirement, because the hypothetical--"
2007.07-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2125.578,2126.947,It's not a presentment requirement.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2149.293,2167.672,"--It could be an (a)(2) question, but my point was that the same type of issue could arise even with the presentment requirement, because if the chemical manufacturer presents his own bill to the paint company, who presents his bill to the contractor who does the painting work, who presents his bill, et cetera, et cetera--"
2007.07-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.672,2168.438,He has to know that.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2179.063,2179.746,--I guess I would say--
2007.07-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.746,2181.765,"--And if he knows it, serve him right."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2190.703,2201.393,"--Again, whatever... whatever the answer... the point I was trying to make about the timing is... again assume away these issues about how much might be de minimis."
2007.07-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2241.803,2246.022,The difference is that government money today is in everything.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2258.682,2270.24,"--But the point about timing... but the point about timing is if the State's claim is submitted to the Federal Government at a time when the fraud has not yet occurred, the State's claim can't be denominated false, assuming that the State intends it--"
2007.07-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2270.24,2275.726,I don't know that that accords with the definition of (c).
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2275.726,2280.678,"--Well, the definition of (c) says it's a request or a demand--"
2007.07-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2280.678,2282.963,It says the government will reimburse.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2282.963,2285.082,"--Will reimburse, but it also says"
2007.07-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2293.253,2294.205,But I meant provide.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2295.688,2296.79,--That's correct.
2007.07-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2310.264,2312.8,"So in your own school hypothetical, there's liability."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2312.8,2327.075,"--There's liability if the Federal Government reimburses a claim for expenses that have already been incurred, but under Petitioner's theory, if the Federal Government pays the money up front, the State has submitted a claim but it's not a false claim."
2007.07-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.367,2339.083,It doesn't shock me.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2354.627,2355.393,But our point is that--
2007.07-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.393,2358.595,This statute doesn't have to cover every ill in the world.
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2358.595,2359.246,--That's correct.
2007.07-214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2377.075,2400.857,"--Before... before you finish, the major objection is the one that Justice Breyer just voiced, that your position is vastly overbroad and every time there's government money there will be... one of these qui tam people can come in."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2406.677,2408.26,There are two principal limiting principles.
2007.07-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.36,2467.799,But if injuring the Federal Government would... it would suffice to injure the Federal Government that the schools are shoddy and the roofs are leaking?
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2468.549,2469.318,--That would be enough.
2007.07-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.318,2479.024,"Even though the Federal Government is not out of pocket any more, but the program that it... that it was desirous of encouraging is simply not as good as it would have been otherwise."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2479.024,2481.442,That's... that's correct.
2007.07-214,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2481.442,2501.699,"--And you would still... your theory would still cover the case of the... of the agency that gets 10 percent of its budget by... through a general grant from the United States, no matter what it spent its money on, regardless of the fact that the United States has no connection with particular contracts."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2506.774,2511.845,We would still be asking was the... whether the fraud was of a sort that the Federal Government cared about.
2007.07-214,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2516.499,2517.365,"Right, no strings attached."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2517.365,2519.183,Then there would be no FCA liability.
2007.07-214,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2519.183,2520.117,Why wouldn't there be?
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2520.117,2531.158,"Because the fraud would not... in that... in that hypothetical, you would have something akin to a fraudulent car repair bill passed along, given to me."
2007.07-214,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2538.495,2544.882,"No, but when your salary is paid, in effect the government's interest stops when it pays for your labor."
2007.07-214,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2557.476,2569.366,"Well, we would still ask whether the government has... the Federal Government has placed meaningful limitations on the way in which the money may be spent and whether the nature of the fraud is to prevent those limitations from being honored."
2007.07-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2569.949,2587.828,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2588.911,2607.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court: Electricity is the critical component in a modern warship that allows it to fight, to defend itself, and to carry out its mission."
2007.07-214,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2708.607,2709.224,Whose certificate is it?
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2722.665,2723.283,"Yes, ma'am."
2007.07-214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2749.199,2749.532,I thought--
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2749.532,2750.684,--to be installed in the ship.
2007.07-214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.684,2756.771,--I thought it was not established that anything from this defendant got to the Navy.
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2756.771,2759.207,"You were told that earlier this morning, Your Honor."
2007.07-214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.473,2770.412,"Well, where in the record is there some indication that some... some paper from... with a fraudulent representation made it up to the Navy?"
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2770.412,2779.268,"If you'll look at the joint appendix, the Sixth Circuit joint appendix, at page 620; it's clause 6.1... talks about the certificates."
2007.07-214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.488,2788.976,"Well, I know what certificates are, I mean, you know, their general content."
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2799.015,2799.698,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-214,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2816.893,2828.934,"What about the statement that Mr. Olson quoted during his argument, when counsel for plaintiffs said to the jury: You haven't seen anything that was submitted to the Navy and you're not going to see anything that was submitted to the Navy?"
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2828.934,2829.703,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.07-214,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2831.836,2833.188,"Well, what was your statement?"
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2833.188,2844.813,"My statement was: You are not going to see the invoices from Allison... the invoices, not the certificates of conformance, not the invoices from Bath to the Navy."
2007.07-214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2852.032,2854.501,"Well, then there's less to this case than we had thought."
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2867.492,2868.178,"Your Honor, this case--"
2007.07-214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.178,2869.128,--that there's a cause of action.
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2871.296,2874.764,--This case is not a outlier on the ends of this statute.
2007.07-214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2876.731,2881.568,I wish you had said that in your brief because we could have saved ourselves a lot of reading.
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2885.12,2887.222,"Your Honor, anything that I can do to help the Court."
2007.07-214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2979.481,2989.873,"So your argument... your understanding of the scope of the statute is exactly the same if the words ""by the government"" were replaced by ""with Federal funds""?"
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,2997.443,2997.943,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2999.126,3005.18,So when the government... when the phrase '86?
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3005.18,3005.813,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3005.813,3009.767,"There were a lot of statutes that said ""with Federal funds"", right?"
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3009.767,3010.417,There were.
2007.07-214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3010.417,3016.488,"So why did the Congress add the phrase ""by the government"" instead of ""with Federal funds"" if it meant the same thing?"
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3016.488,3020.039,The legislative history is dark on that subject.
2007.07-214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3103.878,3104.312,Right.
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3108.664,3109.782,"I do, Your Honor."
2007.07-214,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3109.782,3125.876,"Suppose... you just said to Justice Scalia... if you have one minute; I rather missed that... that your point was if you lose on that point you just made and it isn't ""with Federal funds"" and it is that the government has to pay the claim, you still win."
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3127.744,3128.094,Yes.
2007.07-214,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.094,3129.494,"Well, what was that argument?"
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3133.565,3138.284,"Well, I believe they... that was the first point that I was making to Justice Scalia."
2007.07-214,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3138.284,3139.0,Yes.
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3139.0,3148.074,And my point there is that (a)(2) covers making a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or approved by the government.
2007.07-214,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3148.074,3148.874,Yes.
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3148.874,3165.703,"In this case, they were required... Allison was required by its contract with Bath and the Navy to submit a certificate of conformance to Bath and the Navy to release the Gen-Set for installation into the destroyer."
2007.07-214,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3186.366,3193.02,The certificate of performance made its way to the Navy.
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3199.024,3204.411,We did put all the certificates of conformance that were given to Bath in the record of this case.
2007.07-214,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3216.419,3217.302,But that was only the contract.
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3228.876,3236.549,"--No, ma'am, we did not have a witness who testified that this certificate was given to Ensign So-and-So."
2007.07-214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3236.799,3238.032,And whose... whose contract required this?
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3242.703,3245.253,"--It... you are correct, Your Honor."
2007.07-214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3257.911,3264.048,And that contract between Allison and Bath said that this certificate from Allison had to be presented to the Navy?
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3264.048,3265.448,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-214,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3287.746,3296.269,"In the contract between the Navy and Bath, was there a provision that Allison's invoices would be shown to the Navy?"
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3305.308,3306.775,"Justice Souter, it was different."
2007.07-214,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3340.131,3342.565,Available but not necessarily transmitted.
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3342.565,3348.57,"Not necessarily stapled to the invoice and given to the Navy, but they had to be available."
2007.07-214,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3348.57,3359.426,"But the contract between Bath and Allison says: You give those to us, and we give them to the Navy."
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3366.282,3371.417,It was specific in saying your certificate of conformance goes to the Navy.
2007.07-214,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3371.417,3372.186,Okay.
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3372.186,3376.338,"It did not say in the provision that I have cited to the Court, your invoice."
2007.07-214,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3376.338,3376.771,I understand that.
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3376.771,3383.225,"And that was why I said, Justice Alito, to the trial court, not to the jury, that the invoices are irrelevant."
2007.07-214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3385.794,3393.599,And Bath would have been in breach of its contract with Allison unless it passed these things on to the Navy?
2007.07-214,2,30970,james_b_helmer_jr,,3397.984,3400.253,The certificate was required.
2007.07-214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3405.323,3409.709,Allison could sue Bath for not passing the certificate on to the Navy?
