2002.01-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.471,"We'll hear argument now in No. 01-757, Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. v. Hurley Henson."
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,11.261,14.899,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,55.11,65.525,"Mr. Alsobrook, I see you've changed the question presented from the time in your certiorari petition to your opening brief."
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,78.442,79.077,"No, sir."
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,118.161,125.197,But you have no right to remove under 1441 because there wasn't complete diversity in the Louisiana suit.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,125.895,126.671,That is correct.
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,126.671,130.856,So you can't rely on 1441 and that's conceded.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,130.856,141.195,We... we can... our reliance on 1441 was based on the fact that the Alabama court retained original jurisdiction and--
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,141.195,143.495,But that's not... nothing in 41 rests on that.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,148.406,156.039,"--Yes, Your Honor, but we... we construed that as being a venue rather than a... a... because the Alabama court had original jurisdiction."
2002.01-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,160.056,161.851,What did you construe as being venue?
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,161.851,176.664,"--The... the fact that we had to take it to a Federal court in the district where the State court suit lay, and then it was immediately transferred to the... to the Alabama court."
2002.01-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.664,184.283,"Yes, you... you can't remove a case to a Federal court outside of the district in which the State court sat, is my understanding."
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,184.283,185.311,"That's right, Your Honor."
2002.01-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,192.991,193.628,Who is they?
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,193.628,196.699,"--There, there was a--"
2002.01-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.699,198.28,What court are you talking about?
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,198.28,199.985,--We're talking about the Second Circuit.
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,201.213,205.052,"Initially the Eastern District of New York, Judge Weinstein's--"
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,205.052,205.567,--Yes.
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,205.567,208.522,"--order, which was in no way based on 1441."
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,210.381,221.09,"But, Your Honor, also in that case was the case of Ryan, and in Ryan, it was brought by to class members in the State court in Texas."
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,236.225,241.168,But that was all done under the All Writs Act or what they thought was the authority granted by 1651.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,241.168,252.249,"Yes, and we also, Your Honor... in our removal petition, we pled the All Writs Act, as well as ancillary jurisdiction under 1367."
2002.01-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.249,255.496,"Well, what is your theory under the All Writs Act?"
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,261.043,265.975,We contend that... that in order for the Court--
2002.01-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.975,267.799,Can't you answer the question yes or no?
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,267.799,268.138,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
2002.01-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,272.018,282.995,I thought the All Writs Act required the existence of some sort of a common law writ like certiorari or prohibition or injunction or something like that.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,286.981,288.931,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.115,298.478,"Well, but can you cite any of our cases that support you in this respect?"
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,298.478,314.365,"--Well, I can cite the New York Telephone case where the Court said that... that removal was... not removal, but a writ under the All Writs Act was... was proper to avoid the frustration of judgment, and that was... that was certainly the situation here."
2002.01-757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.365,317.63,But... but that was a different... that was an existing writ.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,326.15,327.128,"I agree with that, Your Honor."
2002.01-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.128,332.261,Do you agree that the All Writs Act is not a source of original jurisdiction?
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,332.261,333.716,"Yes, ma'am."
2002.01-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,335.898,340.835,Why... why then didn't you try to get an injunction in the district court in Alabama?
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,340.835,345.015,"--There were two reasons, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,354.67,355.263,Yes.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,355.263,365.83,And we would have had... our client would have had to carry this as a liability on their books ad infinitum.
2002.01-757,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,365.83,368.639,"Well, couldn't the injunction have ordered the party to dismiss the case?"
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,368.639,374.84,"Yes, they did... they could, Your Honor, and--"
2002.01-757,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,374.84,376.599,But then why... why wouldn't that be sufficient?
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,376.599,380.594,--I suppose it would have been.
2002.01-757,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,380.594,404.397,"But if that's so, then why don't... why are we trying to read into 1441 language that isn't there and read requirements out of 1651, requirements that are there, when there was another way, totally consistent with the words, the statute, everything else, that you could have achieved any legitimate objective that you had?"
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,404.397,424.619,"Well, Justice Breyer, at the time that we did this, as I said earlier, there was... the majority of Federal circuit courts said that the proper vehicle was to remove the case and get it before the court where... that had issued the judgment."
2002.01-757,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,442.475,443.134,There is.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,448.053,448.739,Yes.
2002.01-757,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,448.739,466.701,"The... the only loose end, it seems to me, that... that you have left, after your answers to Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, is the problem you say your client would have in carrying liability on the books until the second action was somehow finally terminated."
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,490.696,491.919,"I don't know, Your Honor."
2002.01-757,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,491.919,495.805,"Well, I... I guess why wouldn't that have been the appropriate course?"
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,495.805,509.742,"I... I presume that the State court under those circumstances would dismiss it, but we don't know that as a matter of fact."
2002.01-757,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,509.742,519.623,"I... I was thinking about different writs, and you've researched this more thoroughly than I, I suspect."
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,535.507,537.983,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-757,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,540.883,558.612,"And... and... which... and so that the absence of that kind of... of writ indicates to me that the safer course, the more prudent course is to rely on the standard equitable remedies such as injunction that we've been discussing."
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,558.612,561.638,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.638,565.497,Except that a lot of other lawyers had... had relied on the course that you relied on.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,565.497,567.474,"That's correct, and a lot of--"
2002.01-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.474,569.947,You were following what had been a successful course in the past.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,569.947,572.034,"--And not only that, a lot of judges."
2002.01-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.034,574.464,"Well, to be sure."
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,574.464,600.036,"And so there were a plethora of district court cases that allowed the removal under the All Writs Act and took jurisdiction where they had jurisdiction originally under the cases of NAACP, under the Agent Orange case, and the Sixth and Seventh Circuit cases."
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,600.036,613.862,"Were there any cases under the relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act that used that device, the antisuit injunction, to accomplish the same thing?"
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,613.862,616.466,"Well, Your Honor, no."
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,638.937,648.77,"But that was... that was a question of fighting it out in the State court, and it's not the antisuit injunction that we're discussing now."
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,685.186,701.26,"--We didn't attempt that, Your Honor, because the majority of the circuits at the time approved the All Writs Act as the vehicle with which to remove the case and to get it back before the district court."
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,720.169,730.35,I don't understand that because right... built right into the removal provision is a command that the State court shall proceed no further.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,737.553,747.001,"Well, the removal petition... actually the court loses jurisdiction of it at that time because they... it... it is removed to... to the Federal court."
2002.01-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.756,770.768,May I ask this question?
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,792.289,793.373,"Yes, sir."
2002.01-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,793.373,796.616,"How do you square that with the language, respective jurisdictions?"
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,796.616,801.153,"Well, Your Honor, there again we had to rely on Agent Orange."
2002.01-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.153,804.453,"You don't rely on the statute, though."
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,804.453,809.776,"Well, we relied on the statute because it says in the aid of their respective jurisdiction, and--"
2002.01-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.776,815.039,Don't you think that refers to the court to which removal would take... would occur?
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,819.701,827.903,"--Yes, sir, and we... it was our position that there... there respective jurisdiction related to the Alabama court."
2002.01-757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,829.561,832.095,Even though you removed to the Louisiana court.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,832.095,833.088,"We had to, Your Honor."
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,849.98,852.911,But 1441 wasn't available to you.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,868.363,872.667,"That could be done under the Anti-Injunction Act, Your Honor."
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,876.706,879.743,But do... as far as... you're creating a removal that doesn't exist by statute.
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,893.04,907.127,--Because 14... we didn't know of any other vehicle that would allow us to remove it from Louisiana to Alabama.
2002.01-757,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,936.465,944.382,"But you still have problems even if it were to the Middle District of Alabama, because you don't have complete diversity in the Louisiana action."
2002.01-757,0,26472,henry_b_alsobrook_jr,,955.672,968.951,"Well, Your Honor, we feel that... that under... under the hypothet set out in Kikkonen that the Alabama court would have jurisdiction to take that case."
2002.01-757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,968.951,972.194,"Mr. Alsobrook, what is... what is this writ called?"
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1398.278,1405.797,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1420.185,1426.624,"Mr. Bederman, I just asked your... your friend to... to explain why he was up here."
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1433.009,1437.832,"Very likely Mr. Alsobrook will apply, as the Eleventh Circuit invited them to, for an injunction."
2002.01-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1462.284,1464.88,Why... why... okay.
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1467.349,1471.397,The issue on the merits would be presumably the proper construction of the settlement agreement--
2002.01-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.397,1472.084,Of the settlement agreement?
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1472.084,1472.442,--That's right.
2002.01-757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.065,1484.67,Okay.
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1488.232,1490.182,We would contest the merits of the injunction.
2002.01-757,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1492.765,1503.044,"--You can say in a sentence... as I read this, it says, class counsel hereby stipulates that the related case, including any and all claims, will be dismissed."
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1509.071,1510.214,"--That's right, Justice Breyer."
2002.01-757,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1510.214,1511.404,So I'm just curious what the defense would be.
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1511.404,1532.322,"The only defense that... that I could imagine is the ambiguity in that provision, as you were reading, at 38a of the joint appendix, that the concern about whether including any and all claims, including without any limitation any claims defined herein."
2002.01-757,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1541.126,1543.311,"Well, I guess that isn't before us here--"
2002.01-757,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1543.311,1543.508,--It's not before us.
2002.01-757,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1543.508,1544.354,--is it?
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1544.354,1546.28,"Certainly not, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-757,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1551.071,1556.072,"And several circuits have allowed the All Writs Act to be used in this fashion, do you think?"
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1556.072,1558.295,In this fashion?
2002.01-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1575.912,1581.276,"In the Yonkers case, the United States Government urged the court to take that position, didn't it?"
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1586.957,1597.809,"That is true, but my recollection of... of the procedural background with the Yonkers case was that there was some concern about how Judge Sand drafted the consent decree in that case."
2002.01-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1646.566,1652.598,But you said you would defend against injunctive relief on the ground that the settlement was narrower than--
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1652.598,1657.482,"--We would defend essentially on the merits, is that an injunction should not issue because our construction of... of the settlement is--"
2002.01-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1657.482,1663.297,"--Well, why didn't you seek that construction from the court that issued... that... that entered the settlement?"
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1678.539,1690.677,"--We believe that the proper course is... in view of the precise enumeration of the... of the case in State court, that the proper course was to amend the petition and seek a resolution."
2002.01-757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1815.02,1820.124,What would be wrong with the Eleventh Circuit saying in substance it's the same thing?
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1837.993,1856.16,"Well, if... if, of course, the Eleventh Circuit had construed petitioners' filings in that way and... and had indicated that injunction was the proper mode and essentially substituted, as they... as they seem to invite in their closing lines of their decision, I think that would be appropriate."
2002.01-757,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.332,1925.527,Administrative agencies.
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1925.527,1934.879,"--I presume that in English common law, to the extent that administrative agencies existed, the ones I'm aware of, of course, were quite inchoate."
2002.01-757,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1936.583,1938.131,"Sewer commissioners, I think is--"
2002.01-757,1,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1938.131,1938.316,--That's right.
