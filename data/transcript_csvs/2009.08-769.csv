2009.08-769,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.987,"We will hear, first, this morning, Case 08-769, United States v. Stevens."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,6.737,9.706,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-769,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,56.087,59.289,What record do you have of that fact?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,59.289,61.455,--Before Congress?
2009.08-769,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,61.455,62.49,Yes.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,62.49,78.916,"Before Congress -- Congress had a bunch of testimony that showed that there were extensive -- there was a robust market in animal cruelty videos, largely focusing on crush videos -- 2 to 3,000 crush videos that were in -- that were -- that were being sold at the time."
2009.08-769,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,78.916,85.153,"That I understand, but crush videos is only one species of cruelty to animals."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,100.93,105.381,"Well, hunting we think is excluded, and I could talk about that in a moment, from the reach of the act."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.869,141.419,"What do you mean by a ""for-profit commercial market""?"
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,144.154,145.005,--That is -- that is correct.
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,145.005,145.705,Okay.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,145.705,146.122,Yes.
2009.08-769,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,182.679,190.634,"What would you -- if you could do it in one sentence, what is your test for determining which categories of speech are unprotected by the First Amendment?"
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,190.634,216.619,"In one sentence, if -- if -- if Congress sees a compelling interest in regulating the means of production and does not target the underlying content, they can -- they can regulate a depiction, so long as it leaves alternative mechanisms for that expression in -- in place, and that is I think what Ferber--"
2009.08-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,216.619,217.135,Okay.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,218.471,220.671,--United States v. Ferber -- New York v. Ferber.
2009.08-769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,243.102,273.855,"Mr. Katyal, the Court summarily dealt with a case some years ago, American Booksellers v. Hudnut, where cities attempted to make not even a criminal offense, but the subject of a civil suit, a violent depiction -- depictions of women as sexual objects enjoying pain and humiliation and degradation."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,291.75,300.523,And this case is fundamentally different from all of those because here Congress is not aiming at the underlying communicative impact.
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.375,304.16,"Well, of course it is."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,321.871,322.787,"--Quite to the contrary, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-769,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,337.547,342.95,"Well, but to say that they are not concerned with the content, I -- I think is contradicted by the exceptions."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,355.925,358.144,"I don't think so, for two reasons."
2009.08-769,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,379.624,381.76,How can you tell these aren't political videos?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,401.739,403.839,--And often they will fall under that exemption.
2009.08-769,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,412.612,419.785,Could you -- could you tell me what the difference is between these video and David Roma's documentary on pit bulls?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,457.291,462.612,"The line will sometimes be difficult to draw, just as its difficult to draw in child pornography--"
2009.08-769,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,462.612,470.3,"But it's not in child pornography because, there, Congress says the very act -- it doesn't matter how artistic it is."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,473.852,475.704,"--Quite to the contrary, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.387,540.814,"Child -- child pornography is obscenity as far as I am concerned, and it has been treated as part of that same traditional classification which there has always been permission for the government to prohibit."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,581.289,591.413,"I want to answer your hypothetical, but if I could just have 20 seconds or so to -- to respond more generally to all of these hypotheticals which I think are going to reoccur in the course of our conversation."
2009.08-769,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,646.214,647.249,What if I made--
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.249,647.833,"Well, wait."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,652.801,654.837,Spanish depictions of bullfighting--
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,654.837,656.605,And that is true because Congress said so?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,656.605,662.343,"--Well, that is true because it is educational, and -- and a prosecutor would bear the burden of proof."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,662.343,664.226,"Well, I guess a dogfight is educational, too."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,664.226,668.497,"And some dogfights certainly are, which is my answer to Justice Sotomayor's question."
2009.08-769,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,668.497,671.365,"--Well, look what you have done, and this is what is bothering me."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,744.83,751.984,"We have had ten years of experience, Justice Breyer, under the statute, and we haven't seen those things being chilled."
2009.08-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,753.084,764.475,Can you give me an example of a case where we said a statute which might otherwise be overbroad is not overbroad because prosecutors have been restrained?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,766.176,786.922,"--Last year in United States v. Williams, an opinion that virtually every member of this Court joined, including you, Justice Kennedy, this Court said that it would look to the experience, the post-Ferber experience, in prosecuting cases to decide whether or not a -- two terms in the statute, ""promotes"" and ""presents"", were vague and would raise the--"
2009.08-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,786.922,790.874,But that was a case where we knew what the content was.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,797.795,811.955,"--Well, actually, Justice Kennedy, the reason that came up in the case is because there were hypotheticals being advanced such as police -- a man who wants to call the police that says that child pornography arrived in my -- in the mail and so on."
2009.08-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,819.042,820.227,"Well, but that -- that went to intent."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,844.609,847.544,--We do think that the--
2009.08-769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,847.544,849.08,And you have you to show that they are not vague.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,849.08,856.9,--We do think that the exceptions clause does some of the constitutional work to exclude some of the hypotheticals like bullfighting and the like.
2009.08-769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,862.471,864.756,"But what is a -- what is ""and the like""?"
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,883.134,888.871,--Dogfighting and cockfighting are illegal in all 50 States and therefore would be swept up.
2009.08-769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,893.109,893.992,But what about bullfighting?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,894.809,896.977,It may or may not be.
2009.08-769,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.429,903.565,What about hunting with a bow -- What about hunting with a bow and arrow out of season?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,903.565,904.365,--Okay.
2009.08-769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,911.07,912.936,--Can we -- have we finished with the category of fights?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,912.936,915.772,"--So let me just, to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2009.08-769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,937.721,938.088,What's the--
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,938.088,940.673,So noneducational bullfighting would be prohibited?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,945.975,948.577,"If it meets the other terms in the statute, right."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.196,950.645,Okay.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,951.145,955.099,"Now, with respect to hunting, hunting is generally not considered animal cruelty."
2009.08-769,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.132,961.836,"No, but hunting with a bow and arrow, and some depictions of hunting are pretty -- are pretty gruesome."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,961.836,962.803,--That's correct.
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.894,974.244,"""Or killed""."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1041.434,1042.702,"--Yes, sir, Your Honor."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.253,1043.686,What is that?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1043.686,1053.408,"That is the decision you wrote last year in United States v. Williams, which interprets the words ""promotes and presents"", which you yourself in the opinion said are capable of a wide variety of meanings."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1053.408,1054.26,Exactly.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1054.26,1059.831,"And -- and here the word ""kill"" in context is a term that the statute--"
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.831,1062.699,"No, it's not susceptible to a wide -- that's my whole point."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1064.383,1075.424,"--It means killed in the context of a statute that is defining the words ""animal cruelty"", and this Court has consistently said that the definition that is being defined by the legislature--"
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.424,1077.709,Some people think eating an animal is animal cruelty.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1083.613,1087.664,"--And the legislature under no way, shape, or form was targeting that."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1087.664,1089.783,"Well, it shouldn't have said that, then."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1089.783,1094.802,"Well, I think that it basically did say that by using the words ""animal cruelty"" in the statute."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.402,1107.376,"You don't have a single case in which a -- an absolutely clear word like ""kill"" is given a more narrow meaning because of other words that are different from that word."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1107.376,1115.548,"--Justice Scalia, in Leocal, this Court defined the term INA had -- that the INA interpreted wrongly."
2009.08-769,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1115.548,1118.048,"So you want to say ""cruelly kill""?"
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1118.048,1119.25,That's--
2009.08-769,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1119.25,1122.535,"Now, ""cruelly kill"" is not exactly crystal clear."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1171.885,1174.135,--And it could have been done in Williams.
2009.08-769,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1189.929,1190.879,Why?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1237.975,1251.634,"Well, here I think we should give Congress some credit, because what it actually did in the exemption clause was borrow this Court's own jurisprudence from the obscenity context on exceptions like literary, artistic, political and scientific."
2009.08-769,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1252.85,1257.204,"Counsel, would this -- would a statute like this apply to humans be constitutional?"
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1263.108,1278.552,"--Well, I think it would be complicated because Congress would have to find that by targeting the underlying videos but leaving alternative simulated mugging videos in place, somehow it would have reduced the market for muggings or something like that."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.127,1296.263,But the first order problem occurs in states where it is not illegal.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1333.538,1337.073,--So dog fighting is illegal in all 50 states along with crush videos.
2009.08-769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1338.806,1351.25,"--But it isn't -- it isn't -- illegal in Japan, and part of the video here were dog fights in Japan; legal where it occurred, no different from bull fighting."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1351.25,1352.066,--Right.
2009.08-769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1363.807,1364.69,But that wasn't--
2009.08-769,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1364.69,1368.627,Justice Scalia spoke about the aficionada of Spanish bullfighting.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1393.41,1396.795,This is -- I'm sorry if I'm not following the hypothetical.
2009.08-769,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1397.729,1400.481,A gladiatorial contests where the gladiators fight to the death.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1400.481,1401.015,--Right.
2009.08-769,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1401.015,1402.665,Do you have any doubt that that could be prohibited?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1402.665,1408.902,"Well, it sounds like it would fall under the historical exemption, at least in the hypothetical as you have raised it."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.521,1411.921,Who knows.
2009.08-769,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1411.921,1414.556,"No, no, not under this statute, under a different statute."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1414.556,1423.994,"--Well, I think that -- I think that there again, it would raise some First Amendment interest in suppressing historical -- historical information."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.986,1442.806,"If you dress up like an ancient Roman, the whole thing is of historical interest?"
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1444.408,1455.448,"Justice Scalia, I do think that is the Court's own jurisprudence with respect to, for example, obscenity and child pornography, both of which this Court has accepted precisely those types of exceptions."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.448,1456.55,A different category.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1468.273,1474.277,"Well, I don't believe the Court has actually read child pornography to be obscenity."
2009.08-769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1475.544,1484.633,"--Mr. Katyal, there is something quite different between Ferber, because the abuse of a child is occurring at the very time."
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1506.565,1507.948,--Let me say two things about that.
2009.08-769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1519.556,1521.742,Where it was legal for him to do that.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1521.742,1524.527,"--It was, just -- again, like child pornography and the like."
2009.08-769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1525.994,1535.4,It even -- what I would like you to confront is that the very taking of the picture is the offense.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1545.023,1546.674,--I agree with that.
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1575.91,1580.864,His message is that getting animals to fight is fun.
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1582.131,1583.983,--And Congress hasn't stamped that out.
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1583.983,1588.184,"To say he -- you know, he can convey that message in some other way, how else does he do it?"
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1588.184,1590.569,"With simulated messages, the written word."
2009.08-769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1594.321,1596.904,Simulated dog fights would be okay under this statute?
2009.08-769,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1596.904,1597.523,--Simulate -- absolutely.
2009.08-769,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1623.138,1624.506,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1628.958,1631.177,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1658.577,1666.417,"What about crush videos, which apparently were the focus of Congress's attention when it drafted these?"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1692.151,1702.273,"I think -- I think there's a -- that a properly drawn law could very well, at least in my humble opinion, this Court would have to decide, survive strict scrutiny."
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1719.468,1722.42,You are not -- you are not even willing to say that that could be prohibited?
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1722.42,1722.82,"--No, no."
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1731.276,1734.026,Under a properly drawn statute--
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1734.026,1735.144,--that might survive scrutiny.
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1736.228,1736.711,--Might.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1763.311,1775.052,"--I don't -- I don't want to, say this statute, because I don't think this statute -- but if the statute said, this -- I think this Court disagree -- it disagrees with me sometimes -- but I think this could pass constitutional muster."
2009.08-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1816.326,1821.247,I have one more -- one more question along the lines of Justice Alito.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1863.991,1876.131,--A properly drawn statute with the requisite congressional findings or record of a need to attack -- it sound to me like this is a need to attack production.
2009.08-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1910.368,1924.445,"We are asking whether or not that specific instance could be prohibited under a properly drawn statute, just like Justice Alito's hypothetical was under a properly drawn statute you could prohibit the conduct, the speech broadcast in that conduct."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1924.445,1933.884,"--The theory -- I mean, ultimately this Court would have to decide whether Ferber is limited to an obscenity that's historically unprotected by the First Amendment."
2009.08-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1933.884,1939.705,So your answer to my hypothetical is yes it could be prohibited under a properly drawn statute?
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1939.705,1941.355,If this Court -- two things.
2009.08-769,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1977.694,2010.249,"But the point -- the point I guess is when you say yes to this, what you are thinking is that, just as real obscenity when depicted does nothing communicative but rather appeals to the instinct of lust, so Congress could find a category of things that do not communicate, but appeal to the instinct of sadism; and that is true when other creatures are killed for the pleasure of the people who want to see them killed."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2035.983,2037.45,Two things.
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.42,2045.838,Requires?
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2045.838,2046.205,"--Alchemy, alchemy."
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.205,2046.655,Oh.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2046.655,2049.374,There's construction of--
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.374,2050.742,It's such an unusual word.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2054.278,2071.84,"--We don't often get statutes that are so far off base that we're going, I think in my opinion, so far beyond construing ambiguity and doing instead what was asked of this Court and the Court declined in Reno v. ACLU, and that is to write the statute for Congress."
2009.08-769,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2107.995,2110.696,Does this -- would this record support any ban?
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2123.687,2124.82,"--No, there is not."
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2144.583,2154.022,"Counsel, I think -- I think Ferber analytically is the hard case for you, because the Court in Ferber did said -- and I am quoting from page 763:"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2164.795,2168.531,I don't think that is a legal test that is adopted under the First Amendment.
2009.08-769,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2219.88,2221.749,I think the government does.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2223.749,2229.086,But you don't dry up the market by having a sweeping value exception like they have here.
2009.08-769,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2269.628,2272.061,May I ask you a question about your view of the breadth of the statute.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2295.124,2304.348,"--Well, they are prohibited subject to the value police and the value trial like we had here, which I think is antithetical to the First Amendment."
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.956,2323.243,"It's just not significant value; significant artistic, educational."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2325.094,2328.713,"--Scientific, social, artistic, journalistic--"
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.713,2330.063,"Strictly entertainment value doesn't count, does it?"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2330.063,2330.746,"--No, it does not."
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.746,2335.117,And most of the hunting videos I have seen people watch for the entertainment.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2336.183,2339.854,I think that's exactly right and that's what the Safari Club and the NRA have told us.
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2339.854,2343.389,"Well, I mean, but this definition or these exceptions are not drawn out of thin air."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2352.411,2356.28,"First of all, this is about -- this is Miller doubled -- there's a lot more here -- categories here."
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2380.311,2396.837,"But in determining whether this is over -- overly broad, do we -- do we think of all of the hypotheticals that we possibly can think of that might fall within this statute: somebody hunting in the District of Columbia, somebody producing fois gras with a goose and say,"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2404.807,2414.699,"--I think what you do is you look at text of the statute, and then you ask yourself, how much of a strain is it to come up with a factual pattern that will fit into it?"
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2417.651,2419.817,So we really think of all the hypotheticals.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2424.82,2443.016,"--I think at some level Congress has a job to write with a scalpel and not a buzz saw in the First Amendment area, and the only way to ensure that happens is to look at the text and say, does this text fit the purpose, does it fit what the Constitution will allow?"
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2443.699,2467.231,"If it's the fact that during the ten years when this statute has been in effect there has been no decrease in hunting videos and hunting shows on TV, and all of the rest -- the only perceptible change in the real world is that these -- is that the market for crush videos dried up, at least until the Third Circuit's decision, does that have any relevance?"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2467.231,2469.933,--I don't -- I don't think it does for this reason.
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.861,2526.871,It could be that the reason hunting videos are still out there is that the producers were quite confident that this Court would not allow them to be prohibited on the base of a statute such as this.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2526.871,2535.275,"One would hope, and I think quite frankly the NRA has been quite honest in it's brief and said you know, this -- this is not an actively enforced statute."
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2568.198,2569.131,I--
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2569.131,2570.148,You can't do that in the First Amendment.
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2570.148,2581.256,"--I understood your answers to Justice Alito to acknowledge that there would be situations where this statute could be constitutionally applied, or as you put it, you could draft a statute."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2581.256,2581.839,Not this statute.
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2581.839,2582.722,Not this statute.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2583.041,2583.574,That's different.
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2583.924,2600.467,"--But if in fact there were situations where we thought a narrowly drafted statute could be applied to particular instances, perhaps the crush videos, perhaps others, why isn't that enough to say that this statute is valid on its face and then we will consider as-applied challenges?"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2600.467,2605.471,I think in the First Amendment -- I'm not talking -- if I heard you right we were not talking about this statute.
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2606.521,2611.608,I guess I am just trying to get at what your understanding of what the test is for overbreadth in this area.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2625.885,2626.168,--Right.
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2685.021,2688.241,"Well, isn't that -- isn't that due to changes in technology?"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2695.912,2702.382,"This covers photographs, so this would go back as far as photographs."
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2709.155,2713.524,And is there -- in the real world is there a market for sketches of dog fights?
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2713.524,2717.242,I don't know if there's a market--
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2717.242,2717.678,People get a thrill from seeing that?
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2717.678,2720.194,"--With respect, I can't answer that."
2009.08-769,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2729.486,2740.107,Is there any indication that there has been any dry-up of the market for dog fights as a result of this statute?
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2740.107,2741.293,There--
2009.08-769,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2741.293,2751.315,"Justice Alito suggested that until the Third Circuit's decision, that there were fewer crush videos produced."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2763.89,2777.548,"--None whatsoever, and in fact what we've seen is robust enforcement, and we cite the article in our case, we have seen robust enforcement; there was just an arrest a few weeks ago for I think a couple hundred people involved in dog fighting rings."
2009.08-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2822.16,2824.595,Suppose an argument -- excuse me.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2837.771,2838.771,I -- I agree.
2009.08-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2839.371,2841.056,But that's the argument you are making.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2841.056,2845.192,"--No, no, I think it's -- I think it's -- I'm trying to point out that this is in fact a contrast."
2009.08-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2852.864,2866.939,"Well, it seems to me that we ought -- if there is a significant chance that Congress can affect an illegal market, an illegal activity by a statutory regulation we ought to defer to Congress on that ground."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2868.457,2870.159,--I--
2009.08-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2870.159,2875.777,"On this economic causation, I think we have to defer to Congress largely."
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.777,2888.335,"I really think you should focus, Ms. Millett, not on the educational value for -- to make people hate bull fighting and things, but on quite the opposite, it seems to me."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2917.104,2918.804,--I think that is 100 percent right.
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2918.804,2924.941,"Well, if that's 100 percent, then what about people who -- who like to see human sacrifices?"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2941.986,2953.528,"The problem with this statute is that presumably that statute would be even-handed and would it not say if the sacrifices were religious, or journalistic, or historic."
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2954.194,2956.245,--You can create a lot of First Amendment horribles.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2977.393,2978.876,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2983.713,2986.749,"I'm sorry; you agree you can prohibit it, or not?"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2986.749,3006.412,"--I agree that, just because something is repulsive, incredibly offensive or maybe even involves some harm to people does not mean that -- depictions of it that do not cause that harm, that are not integrally tied to it, that are not the purpose and animating motivation for that harm cannot be proscribed."
2009.08-769,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3006.412,3010.78,What was your answer to Justice Alito's hypothetical about human sacrifice?
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3010.78,3015.518,"The -- if -- at a minimum, Congress has got to be evenhanded."
2009.08-769,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3053.041,3055.576,And what if there is no chance of drawing up the activity?
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3067.967,3078.256,The -- the fact that conduct is repulsive or offensive does not mean we automatically ban the speech.
2009.08-769,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3095.701,3099.503,I think what -- I think what's going on is -- is not -- your conflating two things.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3136.91,3137.361,--Well--
2009.08-769,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3137.361,3139.311,So that's why they have the journalistic exception.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3139.311,3154.99,"--The -- when it comes to promoting illegal conduct, we have the Brandenburg Test, and, if you are close enough to be inciting it, to be causing it -- which I think is where Ferber, largely, is."
2009.08-769,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3180.355,3183.105,We are going to advertise a drug that is known to kill people.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3183.105,3185.49,--That is commercial--
2009.08-769,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3185.49,3186.057,We are advertising--
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3186.057,3187.425,--That is commercial speech.
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.377,3232.37,"I would have thought that your response to Justice Breyer's comment about catering to people's worst instincts in the area of the First Amendment, at least, would have been that it's not up to the government to decide what are people's worst instincts."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3236.156,3236.806,"--Well, it means--"
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3236.806,3239.524,It's not up to the government to tell us what our worst instincts are--
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3239.524,3240.643,--It means--
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3240.643,3253.117,"--Except for those areas that have traditionally been outside the area of -- of protected speech, and -- and once you allow this one, what other -- what other base instincts do people have, besides this one?"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3263.639,3265.841,"--I agree, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3271.345,3271.829,So I'm sorry.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3280.101,3287.689,--I -- the -- I think -- I -- I will start by saying -- no.
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3291.141,3298.878,"You are unwilling -- you are unwilling to say that Congress can pass a law, even-handed, straightforward, you cannot have a human sacrifice channel."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3298.878,3304.465,"--If it did, it would have to be even-handed and have narrow tailoring, but the problem is--"
2009.08-769,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3304.465,3306.567,"What do you mean by ""even-handed"", please?"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3311.804,3318.891,"--When -- when the attack -- Justice Sotomayor, when the attack is on the production -- if it -- I don't mean to be -- I want to be direct in answering."
2009.08-769,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3328.347,3331.282,So that goes with snuff movies -- snuff movies.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3333.817,3337.853,"--No one has ever found one, but the point I'm trying to get -- there are two theories--"
2009.08-769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.853,3340.137,"Adolf Hitler, can we keep him off the screen, too?"
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3340.137,3342.204,--It's a dangerous proposition.
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3352.493,3360.432,"So we don't like -- we don't like human sacrifice, and so Congress passes a law saying you cannot have a channel that shows human sacrifice -- real human sacrifice."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3362.551,3371.823,"--I think, if the point is that we don't like the could content, we don't -- we want to protect people from these images, the First Amendment says a lot about that."
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3395.522,3397.439,"Well, right, but, I mean, the hypothetical is we can't do anything about it."
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3413.316,3422.422,I -- I think the fact that -- I think it would be a lot harder under the First Amendment to say why Congress is doing that.
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3438.615,3438.899,No.
2009.08-769,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3439.082,3459.295,"But, under the First Amendment, if the only rationale Congress is giving is we are here to shield your eyes for you, we will make this censorial decision, it has got to find some basis to think that was never freedom of the speech under the First Amendment, in the way that obscenity was."
2009.08-769,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3463.847,3465.099,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3468.718,3481.792,"There is one analytic move Congress made in Section 48, which is simple and obvious, and it explains why both the human sacrifice channel is constitutional, as well as Section 48 itself."
2009.08-769,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3509.545,3510.328,I don't understand.
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3517.299,3530.209,"I'm saying that, if Congress identified a market and if a video -- if the snuff video market was driving, somehow, people to get killed, Congress would be fully within its power to regulate it."
2009.08-769,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3530.209,3531.542,Yeah; but we don't have any human sacrifice.
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3535.677,3550.17,"That's precisely correct, but, here, Congress did find an overwhelming market in animal cruelty, and the State attorney's general that filed a brief before you saying that Section 48 is a success story, that it dried up 3,000 crush videos, that it has reduced the market for animal--"
2009.08-769,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3550.17,3552.205,How many prosecutions have there been for crush videos?
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3552.205,3560.292,"--There -- there haven't been any prosecutions for crush videos, and I think the reason is because the market dried up very quickly after the enactment of Section 48."
2009.08-769,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3560.292,3571.167,"Did I just understand you to agree with your colleague on the other side, that Congress could not ban the human sacrifice channel because there would be no connection between drying up the underlying activity?"
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3571.167,3571.5,"Oh, no."
2009.08-769,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3572.916,3573.25,No.
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3576.368,3582.289,"--I think that does start to reach into questions about obscenity and expressive impact on viewers, which is not before this Court."
2009.08-769,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3589.462,3592.829,So if Congress is -- and we will give you sufficient rebuttal time.
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3602.519,3608.756,"--Again, that raises a whole different set of questions under obscenity and expressive impact that isn't before the Court here."
2009.08-769,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3632.953,3634.887,"How about the statute's term, ""kill""--"
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3634.887,3635.904,And again--
2009.08-769,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3635.904,3637.439,--what should that be interpreted to mean?
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3637.439,3642.843,"--And again, Justice Scalia, as I said before, I think that comes within a definition of animal cruelty."
2009.08-769,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3669.811,3671.361,"Wait, I want to just be sure I understand you."
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3688.039,3693.093,"--It would have to be for a reason of animal cruelty or something like torture, mutilation and the like."
2009.08-769,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3696.545,3701.532,"But the hunting would never qualify, because the hunter's motive is benign; is that what you are saying?"
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3701.532,3704.484,"--No, it has nothing to do with the motive, it has to do with what happens to the animal."
2009.08-769,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3708.936,3714.422,"If you shoot a little low and wound the animal, that is cruelty even though you didn't intend that."
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3714.422,3720.843,"Justice Scalia, with all due respect, I think the images in this case and what Congress was getting at was not shooting a little low."
2009.08-769,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3726.347,3730.032,But what about your response to Justice Stevens on the hunting matter?
2009.08-769,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3732.234,3748.494,"--And my point if those -- if there are those cases at the area -- at the gray areas, that is perfect for as applied challenge, but it's not what this Court -- this Court shouldn't be blessing the Third Circuit's decision to in toto invalidate an entire statute which has produced -- which has produced 3,000 crush videos and the like."
2009.08-769,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3748.494,3752.565,"Thank you, counsel, both counsel, for very able presentation."
