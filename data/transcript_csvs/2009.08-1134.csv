2009.08-1134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.32,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-1134, United Student Aid Funds v. Espinosa."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,8.504,25.946,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress has precisely delineated three types of debt in bankruptcy: those that are dischargeable, those that are dischargeable unless the creditor timely objects, and those debts that are simply not dischargeable."
2009.08-1134,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,60.27,65.006,Only -- only -- only if the bankruptcy court disregards the law.
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,88.437,94.591,"--Your Honor, this case turns upon the effect of section 1328."
2009.08-1134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,95.526,104.815,"Before -- before we get to that, the Ninth Circuit did say, now, bankruptcy judges, we don't want you to -- to intermeddle in this."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,123.093,134.484,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the Ninth Circuit said that bankruptcy courts have no business involving themselves in this dispute if the creditor fails to object."
2009.08-1134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,134.484,135.184,Yes.
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,135.184,150.177,"And the problem here is that 1328 specifically says that the effect of the discharge, the discharge that every debtor is looking for in a chapter 13 case, that discharge shall not include non-dischargeable debt."
2009.08-1134,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,174.126,174.645,It was wrong.
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,175.778,176.128,Yes.
2009.08-1134,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,176.128,182.732,"--the circuit -- the district court judge, the bankruptcy court judge, got it wrong, legal error."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,220.321,223.375,"Justice Sotomayor, it's not mere error."
2009.08-1134,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,233.997,244.035,"But so does -- most error committed by courts, inadvertently or otherwise, are in contravention of some statutory command."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,288.147,293.868,Because Congress's statutory scheme must be enforced as written.
2009.08-1134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,303.807,311.347,"What's the strongest case, I mean, that you can muster in favor of this proposition, my question being the same as Justice Sotomayor's?"
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,331.576,332.726,--Rule--
2009.08-1134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,332.726,334.26,Give me your strongest case.
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,334.26,344.801,"--Your Honor, Rule 60 says that void orders can be attacked, and the passage of time does not transmute a void order into a valid order."
2009.08-1134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,345.884,356.359,"But I'd like an answer to my question, because I can -- I have read the treatises, which I have in front of me, and they say that it's void only if you show a -- the same thing that Justice Sotomayor just said."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,391.865,394.484,"--Your Honor, we did cite a number of cases in the materials."
2009.08-1134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,396.234,396.867,All right.
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,396.867,398.533,--That was the insurance company case.
2009.08-1134,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,420.146,423.264,But that -- that goes back to something more fundamental.
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,441.807,447.278,"Well, Your Honor, if -- if this order is merely voidable, then why do we have section 523(c)?"
2009.08-1134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,470.991,483.565,"Can a -- can a creditor say, oh, skip it, I know this bankrupt is going to be able to prove hardship, why go through unnecessary expense?"
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,490.238,494.789,"No, Your Honor, a creditor may not waive the undue hardship determination."
2009.08-1134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,500.526,511.984,"So he can't -- he can't stipulate to -- he will say: I want the deal that is being proposed; I think I am better off getting the principal, skipping the interest."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,521.19,527.178,"Your Honor, within the proper context of an adversary proceeding in which the issue has in fact been raised."
2009.08-1134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.38,534.832,"Well, would the case be different if there had been such an allegation in the petition?"
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,534.832,540.152,"I think not, Your Honor, because, once again 523, requires a finding--"
2009.08-1134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,540.152,540.985,It would not have been different then?
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,546.056,550.091,"--Once again, I -- I think you go back to the language of 1328, Your Honor."
2009.08-1134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,550.091,552.976,I'm kind of curious to know what your answer to my question is.
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,552.976,553.892,I apologize.
2009.08-1134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,553.892,560.73,Would the case be different if the Petitioner had filed an affidavit of undue hardship with the papers?
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,565.284,567.819,"Certainly a harder case, Your Honor."
2009.08-1134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,568.919,569.619,Why is it a harder case?
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,569.619,574.889,"--I don't think -- there would not have been an adjudication of undue hardship, however."
2009.08-1134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,578.024,579.626,And I say it's supported by an affidavit.
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,579.626,580.893,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.893,582.911,Supported by -- would then the case be different?
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,582.911,585.028,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-1134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.197,588.163,There has to be an adversary hearing under your view?
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,588.163,593.034,"--Under our view, the creditor is entitled to the protections of 7001 to say--"
2009.08-1134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.034,593.117,Okay.
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,604.323,605.342,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.08-1134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,613.428,613.744,Yes.
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,613.744,614.613,--much less proof.
2009.08-1134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.613,621.683,But your legal theory would be the same if there had been an affidavit filed and the same -- the same response by the -- by the company?
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,621.683,622.266,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,623.383,630.889,"Well, what -- what if the creditor is sitting in the courtroom and has actually made arguments and appeared in some other aspects of the case?"
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,650.25,651.883,"--I think they can, Your Honor."
2009.08-1134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,665.607,667.209,"Well, what about -- what about my question?"
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,667.209,670.811,"--Your Honor, at that point the litigation has not commenced."
2009.08-1134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,672.68,672.863,"No, no."
2009.08-1134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,700.113,701.663,That's this case.
2009.08-1134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,711.236,714.438,"Well, my case is just a little different in that the creditor is there in the courtroom represented."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,714.438,715.306,--Okay.
2009.08-1134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,721.294,721.877,What about my--
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,721.877,722.177,It--
2009.08-1134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,722.177,723.277,--What about my question?
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,723.277,732.416,"--Your Honor, in your case, once again, we -- we do believe that that is not the appropriate constitutional notice, constitutional practice."
2009.08-1134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,742.457,742.623,I think--
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,742.623,743.523,--Congress--
2009.08-1134,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,743.523,749.361,"--I think that's an astounding -- an astounding conclusion, that there -- that you simply are writing out the doctrine of -- of waiver altogether."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,749.361,753.413,"--Well, Your Honor, the exception to discharge is self-executing."
2009.08-1134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,758.05,760.585,What -- what provision was this discharge under?
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,760.585,765.386,--The debtor's discharge was entered under section 1328(a)(2).
2009.08-1134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,765.386,767.488,And 1328 says:
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,773.076,776.361,"Well, but 1328 further goes on to say:"
2009.08-1134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,790.954,797.208,"(a), and section 523(a) does not refer to a discharge under 1328(a)."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,799.893,800.776,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,808.916,816.485,"No, no, no. 1328(a)(2) brings in the definition, the kind of debt specified in 523(a)."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,821.223,824.508,--It brings in the enumerated debts of 523.
2009.08-1134,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,841.553,846.438,"Well -- we're conceding that they violated the statute, the bankruptcy judge."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,914.096,926.403,"--Your Honor, we are talking about a statutory right here, and the fact that Congress has specifically provided that certain categories of debts, for very important public policy reasons, are carved out from discharge."
2009.08-1134,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,938.028,941.913,"But why -- why should it be void, looking at 1327?"
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,999.664,1001.33,"--Your Honor, I'd like to reserve some time."
2009.08-1134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1036.117,1039.335,"If -- if you'd like to reserve time, it's probably time to wrap up."
2009.08-1134,0,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,1039.335,1039.968,Thank you.
2009.08-1134,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1039.968,1051.776,Mr. Heytens.
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1051.776,1067.201,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1328 and section 523 are best construed as self-executing limitations on the effect of the bankruptcy court's discharge order rather than as directives to the bankruptcy court."
2009.08-1134,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1068.385,1070.837,"I don't -- sorry to start -- stop you at the beginning, but I don't see that."
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1088.365,1090.401,"--Two responses to that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1134,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1119.317,1121.836,"Well, then the key distinction you draw in your brief is totally meaningless."
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1134.125,1138.863,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think the provision before the comma clearly is framed as a directive to the bankruptcy court."
2009.08-1134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.267,1145.15,There are a lot of commas.
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1146.219,1146.802,"--Excuse me, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1134,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1181.456,1190.914,"Well, what about the consequence of -- there happen to be -- well, I counted -- 14 different kinds of things that follow that comma, including criminal fines, sentences."
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1210.626,1211.276,"Well, Justice--"
2009.08-1134,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1211.276,1213.343,"Now, that would be quite -- to me -- extraordinary."
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1213.343,1224.718,"--Well, Justice Breyer, it wouldn't be under Rule 60(b)(4), because if you understand this is a limitation on the effect of the discharge order, the original discharge order never covers it in the first place."
2009.08-1134,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.801,1226.051,Wait a moment.
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1257.42,1264.526,"--Well, Justice Breyer, there are three very specific categories of somebodies who can't do that, and Congress has specifically identified those three categories."
2009.08-1134,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1277.067,1279.817,So it's not -- it's not that it is not dischargeable.
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1282.769,1285.804,"--That is true with regard to student loan debt, Justice--"
2009.08-1134,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1285.804,1286.489,All right.
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1302.098,1303.364,--That was--
2009.08-1134,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1303.364,1305.8,But that's not the case with these exceptions.
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1309.752,1314.322,"--That would certainly be the argument that would be made in future cases, if the Court were to accept Mr. Espinosa's argument."
2009.08-1134,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1320.642,1322.859,"Well, but you see, it's the same problem that's bothering us."
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1324.678,1325.294,The answer is--
2009.08-1134,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1325.294,1336.501,"Is it the case if somebody feels the conditions were not met with in the 13 categories that -- or 14 -- that follow the comma, he -- you feel that they were met."
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1362.486,1367.957,"--With the exception of the three categories in (c), the answer is yes, Justice Breyer, and we think that follows straightforwardly from the--"
2009.08-1134,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1367.957,1368.373,All right.
2009.08-1134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.973,1369.49,Where is (c)?
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1373.442,1378.227,"--Justice Scalia, we discussed page -- 523(c) on pages 13 to 14 of our brief."
2009.08-1134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.227,1380.727,Why don't you put it in an appendix if it's going to be part of your case?
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1383.762,1385.131,Pages 13 and 14.
2009.08-1134,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1418.899,1420.684,Can I just get your answer to a similar question--
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1420.684,1421.25,--Sure.
2009.08-1134,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1421.25,1422.017,--I asked your colleague?
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1442.431,1446.066,"With -- with one caveat, Justice Stevens, which I -- I don't mean to fight the hypothetical."
2009.08-1134,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1451.554,1453.156,He stipulates to the entry of the plan.
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1454.606,1457.958,"--Justice Stevens, in that situation, there has not been an undue hardship determined--"
2009.08-1134,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.958,1459.458,So you -- you would have the same position then?
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1459.458,1467.997,"--We would say yes, and we think that follows naturally from this Court's decision in Hood, where the Court clearly described 523(8)(a) as a self-executing limitation."
2009.08-1134,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1469.564,1477.753,"And the only way to do it is to go through an adversary hearing with full notice, and every -- and nobody wants to incur that expense."
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1495.814,1498.849,"--Justice Ginsburg, you don't necessarily need to have the full adversary hearing."
2009.08-1134,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.897,1534.522,"But the irony of your position is it's in the creditor's interest to get what is available at this time, rather than waiting 10 years hoping to get interest later on, and even though that's the fact, you cannot give relief in this situation."
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1534.522,1536.955,"--Well, Justice Stevens, the creditor certainly does have interests."
2009.08-1134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1600.861,1602.313,Don't bankruptcy courts read the law?
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1602.313,1603.546,--Justice Scalia--
2009.08-1134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.546,1607.865,So you've got to assume that every bankruptcy court is going to violate the provisions of the statute.
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1607.865,1614.269,"--Well, first and foremost, Justice Scalia, the Ninth Circuit has specifically forbidden bankruptcy courts from doing that on pages 25a--"
2009.08-1134,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1614.269,1618.154,"--Oh, they may not have said it right, but they -- but they -- that's a different problem."
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1624.141,1625.807,--They -- the Department of Education--
2009.08-1134,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1625.807,1626.024,All right.
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1627.176,1633.246,"--Well, it's not harmless, Justice Stevens -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer, excuse me -- because the question is: Who does it make sense to put the onus on?"
2009.08-1134,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.641,1656.093,"Why, of course, they are supposed to police--"
2009.08-1134,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1656.093,1659.545,But the idea that they have to have a charade hearing is -- is equally off-putting.
2009.08-1134,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1659.545,1664.282,"--I don't think it would be a charade hearing, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1134,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1672.005,1672.721,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1677.173,1692.118,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Last term, in Travelers, this Court held that, if the plain terms of a confirmed 11 plan unambiguously apply to a particular issue, they are entitled to their effect."
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1728.708,1734.195,Do you acknowledge that what the bankruptcy court did here was wrong?
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1735.045,1737.147,I acknowledge that it did violate the statute.
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.18,1738.53,Okay.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1741.115,1744.801,--I think that--
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.801,1746.853,It makes a big difference to how I'm going to look on this case.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1747.536,1748.705,"--I would agree that that is correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.99,1785.811,--Is it -- is it easy for a bankruptcy judge to identify a particular debt as a student loan debt?
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1790.779,1792.298,"--As far as I know, it would."
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1792.298,1793.181,It would?
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1793.181,1801.168,And there may be circumstances in which there is student loan debt which is not one of the two plans that are guaranteed by the Department of Education because Congress--
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.168,1801.501,Yes.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1801.501,1803.618,"--has broadened it, so that may be the case."
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1807.42,1807.836,It was the only debt.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1809.57,1811.288,"--It was the only debt, yes."
2009.08-1134,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1811.288,1812.172,Did--
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1812.172,1812.422,Do--
2009.08-1134,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1812.422,1813.872,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1813.872,1826.746,"--So I take it that you do think the Ninth Circuit was wrong when they said: bankruptcy judges, don't stand in the middle of these arrangements."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1839.489,1843.024,"If I used the word ""obligation"", perhaps I was a little imprecise."
2009.08-1134,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1865.688,1866.89,What if there's no objection?
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1884.065,1887.85,"I do not think it is improper for the bankruptcy judge to act that way, because under section--"
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1887.85,1888.183,I didn't hear.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1888.616,1889.7,--I do not think -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.758,1906.395,"That -- that's not enough for me, that it's not improper for him to do it."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1910.279,1913.148,"--Well, Justice Scalia--"
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.148,1913.748,And you're not willing to say that.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1930.693,1949.904,"--No, I balance -- I balance your question against Justice Stevens's hypothetical, and only in the circumstance where it is clear either through extensive notice, and I say waiver here, or through an actual stipulation -- only in those circumstances would it be appropriate for a bankruptcy court to confirm a plan."
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.216,1984.709,"So you would say it's wrong for the bankruptcy court to do it without a waiver, and -- but you're leaving open if there is a clear waiver, despite the fact of no adversary proceeding -- you're not -- you're not necessarily willing to say that the bankruptcy court can't do that?"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1984.709,1988.327,"--Yes, because -- let me back up and talk perhaps a little more generally."
2009.08-1134,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2016.644,2034.105,"Was the Ninth Circuit correct in saying that an attorney can't be sanctioned under the bankruptcy rules' equivalent version of Rule 11, for attempting to sneak through a discharge of student debt in a chapter 13 petition?"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2034.105,2039.926,"Justice Alito, number one, we don't have a case here of sneaking through."
2009.08-1134,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2055.019,2055.435,"No, I understand that."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2077.198,2082.268,--I'm not able to tell you as a matter of settled Ninth Circuit law that that is or is not the case.
2009.08-1134,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2082.268,2084.468,I am not interested in what Ninth Circuit law is.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2084.468,2091.108,"Then, Justice Alito, I thought that you had been asking me under Ninth Circuit law."
2009.08-1134,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2092.274,2097.678,"No, I'm asking you -- I'm asking you, under -- under Bankruptcy Rule 9011."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2097.678,2117.906,"--My position would be that if it is up front, clear notice -- in effect, a proposal that we just don't have a Federal case out of an undue hardship determination for $4,000 -- that it does not violate Rule 11 or 9011 to make that proposal."
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2135.883,2159.899,But did you -- the net effect of this is if you have taken a debt that is non-dischargeable and put it into the category that it is dischargeable unless the creditor objects.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2159.899,2160.166,Yes.
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2160.166,2167.586,The -- the code puts the onus on the debtor to raise the hardship question.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2193.987,2198.791,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I would say that it doesn't shift the burden."
2009.08-1134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2210.08,2214.134,But why would it not be a sanctionable matter under Rule 11?
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2257.478,2261.781,"--I am not here to say absolutely it is not, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-1134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.097,2290.28,"I mean, the reason I ask that--"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2290.28,2290.497,I think it's debatable--
2009.08-1134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.497,2311.01,"--The reason I ask that is I think the argument on the other side is that it's so clear in the law that this is not the way to go about it, that you have to make a separate piece of paper saying you have special hardship; that that's so clear what Congress wanted, that 40 years later you can come back and attack it, if they didn't do it."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2336.328,2344.998,"--I think that -- I think that, again, in the context of what this case -- the issue of this case, I think that's right."
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.147,2374.601,"If that's the price of your winning this case, it's clearly worth it now -- agreeing with Justice Breyer on that point."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2374.601,2377.655,--You mean that the bar may have further scrutiny?
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.655,2377.871,Yes.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2403.936,2405.305,I would accept -- I would accept--
2009.08-1134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2405.305,2406.255,I wasn't making any conditions.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2406.255,2406.822,--I would--
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2414.911,2423.784,"--I was going to ask whether or not in -- on the facts of this case, the client could have waited until the final judgment, not appeal, but then come in under Rule 60?"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2423.784,2427.319,--I think that they could have.
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2429.186,2434.056,So then the client is not required to -- the creditor is not required to appeal?
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2434.056,2446.047,"--Well, they take the risk, Justice Kennedy, that they could fit within 60(a), (b), or (c): surprise, inadvertence, mistake, excusable neglect, fraud, et cetera."
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2450.601,2450.901,All right.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2457.005,2464.009,"--Well, void, under those circumstances, I think would throw us into the due process issue and I don't think so."
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2464.925,2465.225,All right.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2469.913,2470.346,Yes.
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2470.346,2474.381,Let me just ask this and maybe I have bankruptcy law wrong.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2485.356,2487.472,Um--
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2487.472,2489.474,I'm -- if you're having problems with this--
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2489.474,2496.913,"--I hesitate because rule 13 -- excuse me, section 1327 says the plan is binding upon creditors whether or not they are listed."
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2498.179,2504.917,"--I'm just wondering, doesn't it happen all the time that creditors are not listed and then they come in later and say the debt is not discharged?"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2507.785,2508.804,I think that does happen frequently.
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2508.804,2516.625,"And is -- is the rationale that that -- that that discharge would be void as to them, or that they are just not covered?"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2528.016,2529.718,I think it is.
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2534.085,2537.72,"Well, is this -- is this case all that different, then?"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2537.72,2546.893,"--Well, in this case, the creditor got fulsome notice, submitted to the jurisdiction of the court, filed a proof of claim, accepted--"
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2546.893,2548.626,He got notice of something that was void.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2548.626,2551.528,"--No, I may be misunderstanding your question."
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2552.38,2556.349,"I mean, that -- that -- that assumes that he got notice of something that was legally improper."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2556.349,2558.284,--But not void.
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2582.566,2582.866,Could I--
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2582.866,2586.785,"But it's in a category that's labeled ""non-dischargeable""."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2597.326,2597.643,Yes.
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2597.643,2612.736,"--The debtor says, look, I'll pay half of what I owe, and the spouse says, I need something for the children, I'll take it."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2633.899,2643.255,"Justice Ginsburg, the child support or domestic support has a number of additional protections surrounding it."
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2656.229,2658.412,But let's suppose -- this is my hypothetical.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2669.72,2676.291,"--There are additional notices that would go into your hypothetical, and I think it makes a difference in this--"
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2676.291,2677.707,"Well, there are supposed to be additional notices here."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2683.578,2692.301,"--Well, I think that the principle that we are -- that we are bringing to the Court does have broad application."
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.769,2705.624,So you're saying any of these things that are listed as non-dischargeable can become dischargeable unless the creditor--
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2705.624,2706.374,--If the creditor--
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2706.374,2706.757,--objects?
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2706.757,2709.023,--does not object and if the court does not--
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2709.023,2711.042,"So then, why do we have this third category, then?"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2712.744,2737.792,"--Well, may I submit, Justice Ginsburg, that the argument proves too much, and that is to say that if one can wait and make a voidance argument under Rule 60(b) 6 years after the discharge and 12 years after the filing of the petition, and if that could happen to anything, then what we have is that we may as well just worry about litigating Rule 60 motions whenever they come up."
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2737.792,2738.192,--Counsel--
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.192,2754.071,"--I guess I don't understand your position, because I thought you had said that this should not have been discharged and now -- now you've answered to Justice Ginsburg that so long as the -- as the creditor appears they can all be discharged."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2755.421,2757.023,"Well, Justice--"
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2757.023,2760.308,"Even if the creditor appears, it shouldn't be discharged."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2767.312,2768.379,--What I had tried--
2009.08-1134,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2768.379,2768.931,Which is it?
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2768.931,2776.835,"--The position that I had tried to explain -- and, again, I think it balances your point with Justice Stevens's point about waiver -- is that: Should?"
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2825.5,2836.891,"But your answer to me was that if the creditor doesn't object, even to a non-dischargeable debt -- if the creditor doesn't object, it's discharged."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2839.843,2840.193,--Yes.
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2840.193,2846.93,"And it doesn't matter whether it's child support, taxes, or student loans, right?"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2855.184,2866.122,"Well, my position, I think, first is, is that, as I think Justice Breyer said, this is a -- this is a clear waiver, and I think the Court could rule on that basis."
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2882.048,2883.798,"Well, I'm not sure there was proper notice."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2889.618,2890.718,"--Justice Kennedy, I think--"
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2890.718,2892.504,I'm -- I'm not sure that there was a proper notice.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2892.504,2898.741,--I think you must look at it this way: The notice that was given was for the confirmation of a plan.
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2917.285,2918.451,"Well, of course that's the problem in the case."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,2947.054,2974.538,"--Well, the argument that was made by the Petitioner and its amici on that point, I think, as -- as was pointed out in one of our amicus briefs, overlooks the electronic notice, the instantaneous notice, the fact that under Federal regulations, which, by the way, do also require the guarantee and lenders to do these things and to exercise due diligence before they can get repaid--"
2009.08-1134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2974.538,2995.551,"That's -- that's what why it's a -- this is actually -- the part that is a lack of understanding or a complete understanding on my part, is -- is how Rule 60(b) works, because -- because it does-the law does have the three categories -- the three categories that your friend described."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3023.369,3023.721,--They win.
2009.08-1134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3023.721,3026.121,But -- but they waited a very long time.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3026.121,3026.121,They did.
2009.08-1134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3026.121,3032.525,"So now they have to come in, I guess, under 60(b), and it must be either 60(b)(4) or 60(b)(6)--"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3032.525,3033.125,And it was only--
2009.08-1134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3033.125,3037.243,"--and I take it there's a time limit on that, and the time limit is ""a reasonable time""."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3047.784,3048.8,--They responded with a 60(b)(4).
2009.08-1134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3048.8,3049.267,It's good and mixed up.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3052.586,3062.544,"Well, the crux of it is, is that there are other subparts of Rule 60, of course, as -- as we all know, that are broader potential relief, but they have time limits on them."
2009.08-1134,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3063.627,3063.977,Yes.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3063.977,3069.531,"--provision in section 1330 that allows revocation for fraud, but also has a time limit upon it."
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3098.3,3112.208,But that's not -- their position is that 528(a)(8) -- or 523(a)(8) makes this -- it puts it outside the discharge order.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3131.104,3137.425,"--To be precise, if I may, 1328(a) says, ""The discharge shall not"" and then defines the categories."
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3139.158,3145.698,"--Counsel, may I interrupt for just one moment, because I -- there is something niggling at me that I do need an answer to before you sit down--"
2009.08-1134,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3145.698,3147.764,And I'd like him to answer the question that I asked him first.
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3147.764,3148.566,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3148.566,3161.308,"--1328 is the operative statute for the discharge of a chapter 13, and it says ""shall discharge"" except for those categories that are listed."
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3231.035,3233.47,"On the practicality point, you talk about electronic notice."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3259.954,3284.271,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, they have to inquire, in any event, because the Federal regulations require them to, number one, determine that there was a filing; and, number two, even before there is an adversary proceeding, to make its own assessment, the lender or the guarantee -- the guarantor to make its own assessment whether it's likely that there would be an undue hardship in the given case, and there are other circumstances which are set forth in the -- in an amicus brief--"
2009.08-1134,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3284.271,3295.293,"Oh, you mean they can't ask for a hearing unless there is a reasonable ground to believe that there is no undue hardship -- can't even ask?"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3295.293,3295.61,"--No, I don't mean to say that."
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3322.261,3341.805,"Counsel, if they had come to the court at the time the discharge order was about to be entered and said we object, there has been no undue hardship found, would the court have been obligated to alter the plan at that point?"
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3351.511,3352.696,--Justice--
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3352.696,3353.396,What would have happened?
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3353.396,3368.972,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think that the result would not change, because at that point we have a long final plan, and we do have -- you know, the issue that is real important that we don't spend a lot of time talking about because it's sort of ingrained in us is finality."
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3370.491,3371.407,So that's the question.
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3377.078,3380.43,"--It's the plan, I submit, because the plan is what determines what's going to happen."
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3384.565,3391.987,"Well, but -- but here we have a discharge order that on its face appeared to be proper."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3396.289,3397.072,--The original--
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3397.072,3400.491,And your other -- the other side has sort of given up on that as a--
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3400.491,3400.491,--They have.
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3400.491,3418.786,"--as a point, because that, interestingly enough to me, would have been the stronger due process argument, whether the Ninth Circuit and the district court could have amended that discharge order illegally to except something it didn't except, that was -- shouldn't have been excepted to start with."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3422.004,3423.238,It definitely was put aside.
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3423.988,3427.273,"But -- so, it might have been the stronger due process argument."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3441.049,3442.567,"Well, of course--"
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3442.567,3446.536,--except as permitted by 60(b) and 1330?
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3446.536,3449.721,--Well -- and as permitted by just simply appealing the order.
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3452.89,3455.073,Which order could they have -- they could not have appealed--
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3455.073,3457.608,--The confirmation -- the confirmation -- the -- the order confirming the plan.
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3457.608,3459.627,--They could not have appealed the discharge order?
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3459.627,3463.512,I can't answer that one.
2009.08-1134,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3464.928,3478.669,"Well, going back to Justice Kennedy's point, I mean, some people are listed in discharge orders that were never discussed in the plan, or otherwise some people are excluded that should have been included."
2009.08-1134,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3479.688,3483.39,"Well, I am not prepared to say that they cannot."
2009.08-1134,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3513.242,3514.125,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1134,3,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,3517.711,3531.053,"Briefly, just on this last point, no upset whatsoever to bring this matter back before the bankruptcy court."
2009.08-1134,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3564.008,3564.491,Right.
2009.08-1134,3,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,3564.491,3570.744,But 1328(a)(2) specifically then incorporates 523.
2009.08-1134,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3572.613,3574.679,"Well, I -- my -- I'm not -- I'm not sure it does."
2009.08-1134,3,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,3589.306,3594.627,"Certainly, 1328(a)(2) provides the laundry list of exceptions to discharge."
2009.08-1134,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3620.343,3625.212,Could you go back to the fundamental part of my question to your adversary?
2009.08-1134,3,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,3631.882,3633.751,"It did not so specifically state, Your Honor."
2009.08-1134,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3633.751,3642.44,It just proposed a discharge of a certain amount lesser than the principal plus interest.
2009.08-1134,3,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,3642.44,3646.142,"It had a predicate of discharge of interest, no predicate of undue hardship."
2009.08-1134,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3646.142,3646.825,Right.
2009.08-1134,3,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,3655.98,3659.715,"The final judgment, Your Honor, is the effect of 1328."
2009.08-1134,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3660.984,3661.367,"No, no."
2009.08-1134,3,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,3669.655,3673.373,--The controlling order here is the discharge order.
2009.08-1134,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3686.748,3689.633,"Well, what does the notice of -- the time for a notice of appeal run from?"
2009.08-1134,3,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,3689.633,3690.401,Pardon me?
2009.08-1134,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3690.401,3695.87,What does the time for the notice of appeal run from -- the discharge order?
2009.08-1134,3,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,3695.87,3698.155,"Well, for the plan itself, from the plan entry."
2009.08-1134,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3700.94,3709.713,"Now -- now, just in the -- in the general run of the bankruptcy, how do you calculate when you have to file your appeal -- from the time of the discharge order?"
2009.08-1134,3,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,3709.713,3722.604,"Well, if we were going to appeal from -- from the plan, it would be the plan or -- but there's no reason to appeal from the plan, because once again, 1328 excepts our debt specifically from discharge through the plan."
2009.08-1134,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3722.604,3723.973,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1134,3,36959,madeleine_c_wanslee,,3724.906,3725.506,"Thank you, Your Honor."
