1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.737,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Watt against Western Nuclear, Incorporated."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,11.356,18.212,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,123.779,133.753,At that time had the modified definition been reached by the Interior Department?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,133.753,136.789,It was in 1929 that the--
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,136.789,138.055,'29.
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,138.055,139.407,--Department of the Interior decided Layman against Ellis.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.282,193.041,"Mr. Garvey, was this the first time that the government had brought such an action against claimant or user of gravel under the Farmers and Stockmen's Act... Stockmen's Homestead Act?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,193.041,210.67,"To my knowledge, it was the first such action, although I should say that the history of the government's enforcement of this... of these rights is a little like what Mark Twain said about Wagner's music, it's actually better than it sounds."
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.043,221.728,Until when?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,221.728,222.928,--1955.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.381,320.807,"Well, I suppose a lot of holders of land patented under the Stock Raisers Act simply go ahead and use the gravel, or have in the past, on the assumption that it's not a mineral."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,320.807,324.176,That's entirely possible.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.496,348.339,"So, so far as you know, from the time of 1916, when the Stock Raisers Act was passed, until the bringing of this action was the first time the government had ever brought an action in court asserting that it retained title to gravel because it was a reserved mineral under the Stock Raisers Act?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,348.339,349.306,"So far as I know, that's correct."
1982.81-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,349.306,368.085,"But is the government's position narrow, that that... that on these, where the government reserves minerals on this kind of land, that it's a trespass for the rancher or owner to use any gravel?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,371.537,372.321,In the District Court--
1982.81-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,372.321,373.371,--your claim to commercial deposits.
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,373.371,376.941,--In the District Court... it's not that we are now limiting our claim.
1982.81-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,379.308,392.201,"So... so anyway, you... whenever you made your position clear, it is now your position at least that the... it's only commercial deposits that is at issue?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,392.201,393.051,--That's correct.
1982.81-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,393.051,396.652,So you mean commercial use.
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,399.521,402.556,But the stock-raising homesteader makes use of it?
1982.81-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,402.556,403.342,Yes.
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,404.242,413.781,"That was... that issue was left open in the District Court, and I am not in a position to concede on behalf of the Department that those deposits don't--"
1982.81-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.781,414.331,"Well, not--"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,414.331,420.602,"--belong, although if... it may be that the government could permit free use to the Stock-Raising Homestead Act--"
1982.81-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,420.602,431.826,"--Well, there are a lot of noncommercial deposits of gravel around, and the... certainly, you concede that the rancher's or homesteader's use of that gravel is permissible?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,431.826,432.693,--Indeed.
1982.81-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,433.795,435.345,"As a matter of fact, it doesn't even belong to the government."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,435.345,435.813,--That's right.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,435.813,447.787,"Well, has the federal mining law ever treated something that was arguably a mineral as a mineral when it's found commercially but not a mineral when it's not found or used commercially?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,451.989,454.108,Unless it's... unless it is a valuable mineral.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.491,458.393,"Yes, but that... that depends on whether you can properly locate."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,463.331,480.675,"--That is correct, although you have to bear in mind that under the mining law... what the Mining Act of 1872, for example, is talking about deposits on... on lands which the government owns in fee, so that it's possible to speak of minerals without taking any account of how much of the mineral is on the land."
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.589,520.217,"Well, but under the 1906 Act, or 16 Act, there certainly have been numerous instances, have there not, of entries by private individuals on land that was open... but where the subsurface was open to entry who proposed to become mineral claimants?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,520.217,521.05,--Certainly.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,521.05,533.108,"And there as in other branches of the mineral, I have never known of a court case that said the definition of a mineral turns on the degree to which it's commercially used."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,533.108,538.679,We don't maintain that the definition of a mineral turns on whether it's commercially usable.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,551.605,558.259,"Well, it is your contention that the reservation of minerals under the 1916 Act included all gravel?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,558.259,564.512,I don't know whether the Court has to reach--
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,564.512,569.15,"Well, I am interested in reaching it right now by a yes-or-no answer from you, if I could."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,569.15,570.0,--Okay.
1982.81-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.0,572.435,"You have already answered it once, and you--"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,572.435,575.97,It's... it's a little bit more complex.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,632.14,637.675,"--Well, why do you say one is ""disposable"" under the Mineral Act and the other not?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,637.675,642.845,One was locatable as a mineral under the Mining Act of 1872.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.22,656.672,"Mr. Garvey, with respect to that kind of gravel, what is your answer to Justice Rehnquist's question?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,656.672,664.528,I would say that the Stock-Raising Homestead Act leaves open the possibility that that sort of gravel can be considered--
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,664.528,665.444,Can you answer it yes or no?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,665.444,666.778,--Yes.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.778,667.48,Yes?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,667.48,667.913,The acts--
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.913,668.863,You think they do reserve it all?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,668.863,694.797,"--The act says in the second sentence that the disposal of the mineral deposits on the land shall be subject to disposal in accordance with the provisions of the mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal, which means that even though it may not have been disposable in 1916 it could well have become disposable and hence included within the mineral reservation with the passage of the Materials Act."
1982.81-1686,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,694.797,701.284,"Well, how will a rancher know whether a particular gravel is commercially... of commercial quality or not?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,706.153,710.39,"If he were in doubt, he could certainly ask the Bureau of Land Management."
1982.81-1686,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,710.39,718.996,And perhaps commercial use that is unknown today may exist a few years from now?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,718.996,728.851,"It's entirely possible, although I should point out that in that respect gravel is not different from other kinds of minerals under the Mining Act or under the... under the mining laws in general."
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,779.717,798.948,"In other words, before 1916 or whenever this first decision was made, or before the '29, whatever is the ore from which nuclear material is extracted would not have been regarded as a valuable mineral in that time, would it?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,798.948,808.136,"I am... I was unable to find cases holding to that effect, undoubtedly because nobody had any use for the material."
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,812.838,820.694,"Didn't we have a case within recent years where it turned to some extent on the adjective ""valuable"" mineral, which--"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,820.694,821.194,Correct.
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,821.194,822.144,--considers that--
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,822.144,842.775,In Andrus against Shell Oil this Court decided that the interpretation of the mineral leasing Act of 1920 since the time of its passage by the Secretary of the Interior and by Congress suggested that oil shale was a valuable mineral before 1920 and so locatable under the Mining Act.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,851.63,862.271,"--Well, how can you refer to a consistent interpretation when you have the gravel opinion sometime in the early teens, I think it was, and then the turnabout in 1929?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,862.271,867.858,I... I qualified my statement by saying that the consistent interpretation since the passage of the act.
1982.81-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.694,899.979,"But that, Zimmerman was on the books when that was passed."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,899.979,900.846,--That's correct.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,977.579,984.55,You think Congress intended a different definition of mineral in the Stock Raisers Act than it did in the Mining Act of 1872?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,984.55,987.335,--I don't want to press the point too strongly.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,987.335,990.287,"Can't you answer any question yes or no, Counsel?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,990.287,998.56,I think that Congress certainly meant to include in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act those minerals that were locatable under the mining law.
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1008.867,1012.486,"What about the granite that you just mentioned, what is the status of granite?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1012.486,1023.092,"I assume that it is now locatable, that it is now subject to disposal under the Common Varieties Act, which speaks of common varieties of stone."
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1029.948,1032.983,"Well, what is the consequence of that?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1035.435,1045.541,The passage of the Common Varieties Act in 1955 did not act as a quit claim to the government's interest in these kinds of minerals.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.201,1092.854,May I ask one other question while you pause.
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1108.698,1110.816,No.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.816,1111.852,I thought that--
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1111.852,1112.635,I am sorry.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.756,1120.156,--That's what I thought your yes answer indicated.
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1120.156,1126.176,"There are two kinds of distinctions, and I was speaking about the other one."
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.396,1133.181,"Well, I understand what they assert an interest in in this case."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1134.981,1136.383,--That's correct.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1136.383,1140.002,I am interested in physically identical gravel in which there is no commercial--
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1140.002,1142.621,The government does not assert an interest in that.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.621,1143.671,--It does not.
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1148.441,1149.241,Yes.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.241,1149.925,I see.
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1154.679,1155.479,That's correct.
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1155.479,1156.131,Or he can ignore it?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1156.131,1157.464,That's correct.
1982.81-1686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.464,1158.297,He owns it.
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1158.297,1158.764,That's right.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.764,1161.583,But he loses his ownership as soon as it acquires commercial value?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1161.583,1164.085,"I would say so, yes."
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.085,1169.188,So that his... the title to that gravel is... fluctuates as economic conditions fluctuate?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1169.188,1169.971,Yes.
1982.81-1686,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1169.971,1175.425,"Is that your so-called free-use theory, or is that something else?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1175.425,1175.975,No.
1982.81-1686,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1183.698,1193.304,"And in those, your position is that the patent owner can make free use of the commercially valuable minerals?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1193.304,1194.756,Not the patent owner.
1982.81-1686,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1204.195,1211.015,"But not subsequent patent owners; for instance, someone who now has a hotel on the premises?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1211.015,1211.648,That's correct.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.227,1230.429,Kind of like a springing use?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1230.429,1233.631,More like a... kind of.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.951,1243.903,Is there any physical limit on this concept?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1254.477,1255.377,No.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.804,1269.304,How about sand?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1269.304,1272.006,Sand is a more difficult question.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1278.743,1284.414,Would the quality... would the character of sand also turn on its economic or the economic conditions just like gravel?
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1284.414,1284.947,--Yes.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1284.947,1290.134,"Are there any other, other than gravel or sand in which there is this kind of springing use?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1290.134,1291.6,It's true of any kind of mineral.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.6,1292.419,"Well, what about coal."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1296.371,1301.775,I don't think the government has an interest in coal when it has no commercial value.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.618,1318.82,"Well, we aren't asking you whether the owner could use it."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1329.676,1338.864,--I would say that the government does not have an ownership interest in the aluminum unless there is some... unless it is there in sufficient quantities to make it possible for the government to dispose of it.
1982.81-1686,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1465.297,1466.333,"Well, let me question that."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1478.974,1480.157,That's correct.
1982.81-1686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.157,1497.018,"So with each time a stockyard patentee comes across any trace of coal on his land, he's got to wonder whether it belongs to the government or belongs to him, and he's got to make a judgment whether it's, quote, commercially valuable?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1497.018,1525.003,"That's correct, although I should say that with respect to coal, as with respect to gravel in this case, even under the Coal Lands Acts, like the Act of 1909, 1910, 1912, the government recognized explicitly in the case of the 1909 and 1910 Acts and by decision of the Secretary in the case of the 1912 Act, that people on the land could make use of the coal for domestic purposes."
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1531.776,1542.131,"Is a mineral reservation, or was the mineral reservation, the same in these grants to the Great Northern and Northern Pacific and the other railroads to every other section?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1542.131,1547.701,I believe that the language may have been similar.
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1552.522,1569.484,"I vaguely recall in some other case a great concern in Congress at the time they were making these grants, that there was some objection on the grounds that this was a give-away of very valuable public property."
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1569.484,1577.137,"That was in fact the reason for making the mineral reservation, and the railroads were entitled to choose other lands when--"
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1577.137,1589.278,So that the railroads could use it for running a railroad and the farmers and ranchers were given this grant free in order to use it for farming or ranching purposes but not other purposes.
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1591.73,1599.086,"--I think that's essentially correct, although the government doesn't maintain that the patentee has to keep it as a stock-raising homestead forever."
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1613.394,1619.464,"Under the terms of the patent, the patent didn't issue until they had worked the land for some period of time of several years, wasn't it?"
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1619.464,1626.82,That's correct; and increase the value of the land in something like $1.25 an acre for stock-raising purposes.
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1626.82,1628.203,Yes.
1982.81-1686,0,30459,john_h_garvey,,1632.474,1636.259,Something more than 33 million acres.
1982.81-1686,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1643.449,1648.401,Mr. Shaver.
1982.81-1686,1,27989,harley_w_shaver_iii,,1648.401,1652.055,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1686,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1751.865,1754.015,"Well, isn't the question a little broader than that?"
1982.81-1686,1,27989,harley_w_shaver_iii,,1768.125,1780.766,"--I think when one looks to the legislative history of the act, one sees it replete with the phrases: What we are attempting here is to settle up to one-fourth of the remaining public domain."
1982.81-1686,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3346.774,3349.142,I would just like to make three brief points.
1982.81-1686,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3492.585,3495.536,What page did you say that was?
1982.81-1686,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3495.536,3496.12,--This is in page 5A.
1982.81-1686,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3496.12,3496.503,Thank you.
1982.81-1686,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3500.44,3513.415,It was made in connection with a post-judgment motion by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association for motion for a new trial or a motion to alter or amend the judgment.
1982.81-1686,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3537.613,3544.803,"Was there a stipulation as to the fact of whether or not there was commercial gravel involved, commercially usable gravel?"
1982.81-1686,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3544.803,3548.755,"--No, there was not a stipulation, although there was never an issue about that."
1982.81-1686,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3618.017,3619.884,"Thank you, gentlemen."
