1980.79-395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.451,We will hear arguments next in the United States v. Morrison.
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,11.231,14.791,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,90.339,96.993,"This was a substantial time after she had been formally charged, wasn't it?"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,96.993,101.928,"--Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, the indictment was returned on June 28, I believe, 1978."
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,101.928,102.694,And the visit was--
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,102.694,105.473,"And the visit was August, 1978."
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,105.473,107.863,--And was her trial date set by that time?
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,107.863,111.752,I think the trial date was set for about... around the middle of September.
1980.79-395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,144.067,149.877,Does the record show whether the United States Attorney was aware of these visits?
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,149.877,154.593,"I think the record shows that the United States Attorney was not aware of these visits, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,171.01,180.146,"Didn't the agents also tell her that this judge before whom she was scheduled to be tried was notoriously tough, or--"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,180.146,187.58,The Respondent testified at the hearing that the agents did refer to the District judge as a tough sentencer.
1980.79-395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,258.099,264.284,"--Well, if he was right on his premise, then he was sound on his conclusion, I suppose."
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,264.284,267.689,"I suppose so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,355.747,371.46,"In the reproduction of Judge Hunter's opinion for the Court of Appeals, on page... 2A of the certiorari opinion, this is described as saying,"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,381.94,383.158,"--That must be a reprint, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,388.001,390.296,She entered a conditional plea of guilty?
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,390.296,391.185,That's right.
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,391.185,392.107,Thank you.
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,392.107,405.385,"In any event, Respondent's plea was conditioned on her right to appeal the denial of her motion to dismiss the indictment in the event the District Court denied that motion."
1980.79-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,405.385,413.241,Is there any statutory authority or authority under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for a conditional plea of guilty?
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,413.241,417.646,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the Courts of Appeals are divided on that question."
1980.79-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,421.895,430.564,Do they regard it as a matter that they can decipher themselves apart from the statutes or the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure?
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,430.564,436.734,--Well the two Third Circuit opinions that are cited in that footnote that--
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,436.734,437.296,Right.
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,437.296,473.532,"--Mr. Justice Stewart just referred to, Zudick and Moskow, discuss the matter at some length and I don't think that... they don't find any authority in the criminal rules for this procedure, but they point out that the appeal is from the final judgment and the sentence that is entered by the District Court and they point... they analogize that situation to this Court's decision in the United States v. Haines, and Lefkowitz v. Newsome, they acknowledge that it's not exactly the same because there's no constitutional infirmity with the charge against the defendant."
1980.79-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.735,480.232,"Well, Lefkowitz v. Newsome too, was a case that originally came up through the New York courts--"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,480.232,480.717,--Right.
1980.79-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,480.717,485.872,--where the New York Court had allowed this sort of plea.
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,485.872,491.541,"Yes, well the federal case that the Court of Appeals relies on is United States against Haines."
1980.79-395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.906,519.968,Let's assume there's a plea of guilty that isn't conditional.
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,520.64,528.401,"Well I would think that if this plea of guilty was not conditioned, this... denial of this motion would not be appealable, no."
1980.79-395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.401,529.01,Why?
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,536.054,538.851,Well ordinarily--
1980.79-395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,538.851,540.241,"Well, why isn't it appealable?"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,540.241,549.472,"--Ordinarily, Mr. Justice White, the rule is that the plea of guilty waives any other objections to the admissibility of evidence--"
1980.79-395,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,549.472,552.627,"Well what about the McCarthy case, the original case on Rule 11, wasn't that a direct appeal?"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,555.548,566.075,"--Yes, well I think that that's just another example of the general proposition that there are some matters that remain open for appeal, even after a guilty plea."
1980.79-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,702.489,716.249,Does the government disagree with Judge Garth's statement dissenting... granting en banc consideration at page 21(a) where he says
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,732.538,769.619,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that's the essence of the government's second argument, that regardless of whether or not this conduct is thought to violate Respondent's Sixth Amendment rights in some abstract sense, to dismiss the indictment in this case where there's been no prejudice whatsoever, is to essentially reverse all the rules of relief and remedy that have been developed through the years, because the more effective... I mean, the more drastic relief is given in the case where the harm is the least serious, in fact, non-existent."
1980.79-395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.714,863.706,"Well suppose, suppose someone to whom this happened wants some kind of vindication and brings a civil suit, claiming that the agent violated his or her constitutional right to counsel and he wants a declaratory judgment to that effect and a penny."
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,889.837,892.85,"Well, assuming that there was no prejudice alleged--"
1980.79-395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,892.85,894.069,That's all she says.
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,902.315,903.643,"--That's right, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.124,916.465,Or you say it was constitutional for them to do what they did?
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,916.465,921.948,"Well, that's an affirmative statement; I wouldn't put it that way."
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,924.682,926.025,"Well, that's saying the same thing."
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,933.819,942.364,"Well Mr. Justice Marshall, I think you certainly could say that whether or not this violated the Sixth Amendment, this remedy was inappropriate, yes."
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,942.364,948.892,"Or we could say whether or not it violated the Constitution, this remedy was appropriate, because--"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,948.892,949.282,Yes.
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.282,953.0,"--of the flagrantly, outrageously improper conduct."
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,953.0,956.64,Well that's essentially what the Court--
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,956.64,956.843,Even though it didn't violate any provision of the Constitution.
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,956.843,961.904,"--That's what the Court of Appeals' panel said,... the Court of Appeals' panel said that the Constitution had been violated."
1980.79-395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,987.221,992.468,"Well this action on the part of the Third Circuit has to be justified under supervisory power, doesn't it?"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,992.468,995.968,"Well, I don't believe so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,995.968,1000.746,"Well, I'm not saying it is justified, it must be justified in order to have it stand."
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1002.59,1004.855,"Well, it depends on how you use the phrase supervisory power."
1980.79-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1033.436,1045.604,"Well, isn't supervisory power basically the power that any Appellate Court has in formulating a body of law and deciding cases that it reviews from lower courts?"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1045.604,1058.677,"I think that's probably a good way to look at it, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because it really is no different than the general decisionmaking power that the Court has to decide the case or controversy before it."
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1065.876,1072.39,Are they a little different from the ordinary power of a reviewing court to correct an unconstitutional error?
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1072.39,1075.904,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart--"
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1075.904,1080.419,I never thought there was any magic in the phrase supervisory.
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1080.419,1085.635,"--I agree that there's no magic in that word, the question of whether the supervisory power should be used to dismiss indictments when--"
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1085.635,1086.619,Well that's something else again.
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1086.619,1087.259,--Exactly.
1980.79-395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1087.259,1099.909,"But the federal Appellate Courts have a supervisory power, called by whatever name, which they would not have over state courts, is that not so?"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1099.909,1100.441,Right.
1980.79-395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1101.331,1107.797,So that there is something in a supervisory category that is different and distinctive from constitutional?
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1107.797,1108.969,"Yes, but--"
1980.79-395,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1108.969,1126.4,"But they have it by virtue of the right given by Congress to any litigant who loses in the District Court to appeal to the Court of Appeals, and to anyone who loses in the Court of Appeals to petition for certiorari here, do they not?"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1126.884,1127.4,--Well that's right.
1980.79-395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.126,1154.809,--So what you're really saying is that there's no constitutional violation as long as all... that this was just an attempt?
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1154.809,1161.994,"That's the burden of the first argument, is there's an attempt to violate the Constitution but it didn't succeed and so there's no violation."
1980.79-395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.478,1178.909,"And that even if there is... even if it's a violation, you say the remedy is just excessive, and I suppose you say, even though there's no other remedy?"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1178.909,1189.217,"--Yes, I would, although in this case, I... I mean, as we informed the Court in our reply brief, there has been civil recovery of a substantial nature, but in any event--"
1980.79-395,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.217,1200.026,"I suppose that the fact of violation would be not open to relitigation, in a civil suit?"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1200.026,1212.442,"--Well, I don't see how there could be a civil suit, because as part of the terms of the settlement there's been a waiver of all future claims against the government or its agents as a result of the conduct that's involved in this case."
1980.79-395,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1366.988,1370.393,"There has been a civil recovery, I think there's a reference to that--"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1370.393,1377.282,"Yes, there's been... the reply brief describes the civil recovery at the very beginning, I think, on pages 1 and 2."
1980.79-395,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1388.183,1395.102,"--Did the attorney get something in addition to that, or was that--"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1395.102,1415.328,"The attorney in the criminal case filed an independent lawsuit against the DEA agents, charging them with defamation in the course of their conversation with Respondent and he did recover $2,000, again, 25 % of that to be paid to his attorney in the civil suit."
1980.79-395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1483.457,1499.029,"--The $4500 settlement in the civil suit has some tendency, does it, do you think, to suggest that the Court of Appeals was wrong saying that there was no other remedy available for the misconduct of the agents?"
1980.79-395,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1499.029,1502.794,"Well that's certainly true as to the second prong of our argument, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-395,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1572.516,1578.919,Mr. Cucinotta.
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1578.919,1584.698,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court:
1980.79-395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1648.454,1652.061,Don't you regard the $4500 as some sort of a remedy?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1652.061,1655.186,"Of course not, Your Honor."
1980.79-395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1655.186,1656.856,What was the $4500 for?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1656.856,1668.977,"The $4500 is... was a settlement, Your Honor, but how can that pay for selling the adversary system or avoiding the adversary system?"
1980.79-395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1692.701,1701.604,"Well, I thought the Court of Appeals would refer you to the remedy for this person, not a broadscale remedy for society?"
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1701.604,1702.151,Well--
1980.79-395,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1702.151,1709.288,So the $4500 was the remedy for what the Court of Appeals thought that no remedy existed.
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1709.288,1725.687,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I thought that the remedy as far as the system was concerned, and as far as Hazel was concerned, was the dismissal of the prosecution and also, together with that dismissal, it was an additional remedy."
1980.79-395,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.443,1754.458,I'm not sure I follow that argument.
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1758.894,1760.407,--And--
1980.79-395,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1760.407,1765.157,"And I don't think, you're not implying the public defenders are faithless to their clients, are you?"
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1765.157,1769.669,"--Well you know, the government agents, although the factual rendition was given to you by--"
1980.79-395,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1769.669,1770.809,Well are you implying that?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1771.075,1771.934,--I don't agree with that as the facts.
1980.79-395,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1771.934,1772.559,--Pardon me?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1772.559,1774.043,I don't agree with that as the facts.
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1826.647,1827.662,What are you talking about?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1834.315,1852.074,"--If the worst would have happened, is exemplified, is lying... you'd have to go on and imagine... use your imagination, as exemplified in cases like People v. Moore and People v. Mora, out of California."
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1864.304,1865.928,What about this case?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1869.521,1870.503,In terms of--
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1870.503,1873.846,Were you stopped at anything you tried to do at this trial?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1873.846,1879.439,"--In terms of prejudice, my relationship with my client was--"
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1879.439,1892.495,What did the judge or anybody else do to prohibit you from doing what you wanted to do in this trial?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1892.495,1902.069,"--In this particular trial, Your Honor, I can't speculate because I can't get involved in nice calculations as we said in Glasser."
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1902.069,1903.163,Well try.
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1903.163,1904.443,"Pardon me, Your Honor."
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1904.443,1914.049,"Try and find something that you were deprived of doing, or denied the right to do."
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1914.049,1916.329,There is a taint--
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1916.329,1920.64,"Just anything, I mean, not letting you go to the john or something, anything."
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1920.64,1924.843,--If you're referring to the government's argument regarding the lack of prejudice--
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1924.843,1926.513,"No, I'm not... I'm not referring to the government's argument at all."
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1941.757,1942.866,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1942.866,1944.146,Now what?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1944.146,1951.831,"To rely on the... on the confidentiality of our communications, to not--"
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1951.831,1953.002,How would that hurt her?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1953.002,1957.735,--not have the fee understanding between us known to the government--
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1957.735,1958.891,Well how did that hurt her?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1958.891,1959.453,--to the extent--
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1959.453,1961.172,How did it hart her at the trial?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1961.172,1963.03,"--All of these things, I cannot speculate--"
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1963.03,1964.28,I thought she pleaded guilty?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1964.28,1975.368,--She pleaded... she pled guilty because when the government did this and went along and attempted to decimate this attorney-client relationship--
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1975.368,1977.32,"Well, did they do it?"
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1977.32,1979.445,"--No, they didn't."
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.445,1980.084,Did they succeed?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1980.084,1980.944,They didn't succeed.
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1983.646,1985.926,"Well, what did you get this $4500 for?"
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,1985.926,1999.328,"The $4500 was an additional remedy, Your Honor, I suggest that Hazel Morrison's right to an adversary, due process hearing is worth $4500."
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1999.328,2000.404,Were you intimidated in any way?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2000.404,2004.107,"Oh yes, Your Honor, I've been intimidated for several years, in a sense."
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.107,2004.919,In this... this case?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2004.919,2006.294,In this case.
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2006.294,2006.526,Yes.
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2006.526,2009.682,"In this case, because you never know which way--"
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2009.682,2012.119,"Well, you'd know whether you are intimidated or not, don't you?"
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2014.541,2024.005,"--All I have to do, Your Honor, is read that they can come into Court with search warrants and accuse me of criminal activity, tell me to go get a lawyer, in a adversary proceeding--"
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2024.005,2024.786,Was that this case?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2024.786,2025.692,"--That was this case, Judge."

1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2028.098,2029.113,"It sure did, Your Honor."
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2029.113,2029.832,How?
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2029.832,2038.656,"When I have a federal court which I respect telling me, threatening me with possible contempt and disciplinary action--"
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.656,2039.811,You know--
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2039.811,2042.122,"--because all I was trying to do was prove the truth, Your Honor."
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.122,2044.044,"--You know you're not guilty, don't you?"
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2056.04,2058.538,"No, Your Honor, but I--"
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2058.538,2059.866,"I'm not wrong, am I?"
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2059.866,2060.991,"--No, Your Honor."
1980.79-395,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2060.991,2062.974,"That's right, I thought so."
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2065.287,2086.122,"Your Honor, I believe that once you find the government involved in this kind of activity, which is the most egregious kind of record that this Court has ever seen, is not lying on search warrants, it is not lying to the Grand Jury, it is not... and in fact, you've got some lies in this particular case."
1980.79-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2132.306,2167.307,"--Mr. Cucinotta, if I might interrupt you for a moment, certainly the adversary system of which you... which you champion is important, albeit... but it's a part of the administration of the system of criminal justice, and your client had been indicted by a grand jury for possession of drugs and certainly society has an interest in seeing that she is punished as prescribed by Congress if proof can be produced in the normal way, and under standards prescribed by the Constitution and the statutes."
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2167.307,2172.82,Society has a greater interest in protecting their own right to counsel.
1980.79-395,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2172.82,2184.894,"Well, society... it's not just one right as opposed to nothing on the other side, it's the system of how the laws shall be enforced in this country."
1980.79-395,1,41177,salvatore_j_cucinotta,,2208.446,2210.055,"Yes, I agree with the Court."
1980.79-395,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3154.569,3158.098,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1980.79-395,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3172.249,3173.406,And there could be a suspended sentence?
1980.79-395,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3173.406,3175.14,"--And there could be a suspended sentence, that's right."
1980.79-395,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3175.14,3177.452,Isn't there one thats about a five year minimum.
