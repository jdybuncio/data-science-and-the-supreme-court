2002.01-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.628,"The first case this morning in which we'll hear argument is No. 01-270, Yellow Transportation, Inc. v. Michigan."
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,10.953,14.884,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,54.466,59.113,"May I ask, did it waive the fee for all carriers or just the carriers involved in this case?"
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,59.113,62.864,It... it waived the fee for all carriers in the category that are involved in this case.
2002.01-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,65.534,68.812,But did it waive the fee for all carriers in the State?
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,68.812,71.099,I do not believe.
2002.01-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,90.496,92.54,Thank you.
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,92.54,106.294,"As I say, the question is whether if there is a fee that is waived as to a category of trucks in 1991, whether or not that waiver must continue to remain in place currently because of the--"
2002.01-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,106.294,108.742,You... you say as to a category of trucks.
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,117.612,124.82,"--Well, we think that the inquiry that's posed by the statute is how were trucks of a particular type treated."
2002.01-270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.169,181.024,"Now, was there some change as of 1992 in connection with the fee applicable here?"
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,181.024,185.057,There was a change that was announced for the 1992 registration.
2002.01-270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.057,186.605,"Yes, and I guess that isn't before us--"
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,186.605,187.707,"Well, that... that--"
2002.01-270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.707,188.333,--in this case.
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,188.333,213.31,"--To elaborate on... on Justice O'Connor's question, in 1991, the 1991 registration year, there is no question, and it is undisputed, that for the entitlement to operate in the State in 1991, on November 15th, 1991, the date identified as... as crucial in the statute, trucks that were base-plated in States that had reciprocity understandings with... with Illinois did not have to pay fees."
2002.01-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,234.883,236.675,What does the term base-plated mean?
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,236.675,240.069,"Base-plated means that plates, license plates, were issued by that State."
2002.01-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.508,248.502,"When you say base-plated in Illinois, then that means the title was issued in Illinois--"
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,248.502,248.637,--The title--
2002.01-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.637,251.31,--and it had Illinois license plates on its truck?
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,251.31,254.83,--Either Illinois license plates or plates that were issued through Illinois.
2002.01-270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,288.235,293.189,Your... your test that you propose is that it's the type of truck.
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,318.299,320.715,"Well, let me be clear what I... what I mean by that, Justice Kennedy."
2002.01-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,370.288,380.433,"May I ask, under your hypothetical, would that rule have prevented the company from repainting its trucks, paint the blue trucks white or the white trucks red, to get in a different category, which is what happened here?"
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,400.897,408.06,"--Well, if... if the question, Justice Stevens, is whether the... the fee payer could avoid the fee by somehow modifying its trucks--"
2002.01-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,408.06,408.48,"No, no, no."
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,416.498,421.52,"--Our... our understanding, Your Honor, is that that... the State could not do that."
2002.01-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,425.391,426.809,Locked in permanently to 1991.
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,450.228,454.301,"--Yes, and let me explain how we think that applies."
2002.01-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.678,510.183,"Well, Mr. Rothfeld, the problem I have with... with your... your argument is how does one go about identifying the category?"
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,549.24,558.533,"--Well, we are picking the category that we think is... was selected by Congress because Congress said the fee in place in 1991 is frozen."
2002.01-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.524,573.805,"For... for the particular truck, or for the particular State as to which there is a reciprocity agreement, or with respect to any State as to which there is a reciprocity agreement?"
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,576.847,580.017,"--Well, I think that it's not complex in practice."
2002.01-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.115,589.901,"That's... that's the key word, of this type."
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,589.901,590.103,Well--
2002.01-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.103,590.666,But what type?
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,590.666,591.433,"--Well, of whatever--"
2002.01-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.433,592.143,Owned by this company?
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,592.143,592.532,"--No, no."
2002.01-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.532,599.46,"Or from this State, or subject... or from a State that has... that currently has a reciprocity agreement?"
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,599.46,607.931,"I think one would consider the rule that was in place in the State just as it did in 1991 and say here's a truck, this truck is base-plated in Illinois."
2002.01-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.894,661.526,"Well, Mr.--"
2002.01-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,661.526,662.39,--What about new vehicles?
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,669.845,679.764,"If such a vehicle is base-plated in Illinois, that is the characteristic that is made relevant by the State's rule in place in 1991."
2002.01-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,679.764,685.483,"So it's not only vehicles that existed in 1991, it's any vehicle thereafter acquired."
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,710.815,712.585,"That... that is our view, and we think--"
2002.01-270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,712.585,713.493,Well that's one of your views.
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,729.057,730.928,"--That... that is absolutely correct, Justice Souter."
2002.01-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,816.6,819.092,"Well, but did they change their reciprocity policy?"
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,827.134,831.411,"--Well, I... I think that is, in our view, a change in the reciprocity policy."
2002.01-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.813,844.139,Where in the regulations does it say that the State may not do what it did here?
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,844.139,851.981,"The agency issued their interpretations of its regulations, which were published actually at two points."
2002.01-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.286,879.017,"Well, but did they change their reciprocity... did Michigan change its reciprocity agreement with either Illinois or Arkansas in this case?"
2002.01-270,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,879.017,883.356,"--Well, there is actually some question as to whether there were formal reciprocity agreements in place."
2002.01-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.463,946.12,"Very well, Mr. Rothfeld."
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,947.476,954.175,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1015.328,1021.854,"Well, isn't there at least an argument that Congress could have had that in mind by the distinction between charged and collected?"
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1052.056,1055.248,Certainly the Chevron argument is... is essential to this case.
2002.01-270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1062.623,1065.549,Even though that was not the commission's first view.
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1077.212,1078.621,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.599,1144.783,Let me just be sure you agree with your colleague.
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1155.884,1170.713,"As a general matter, that's correct, but let me explain, Justice Stevens, the particular problem presented here, which has not been addressed by the ICC or the Department of Transportation and that we think is preserved on... on remand."
2002.01-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1243.041,1243.722,I... I don't understand.
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1252.592,1265.166,"--The new rule would... would be implemented as... as a result of this unusual situation, unique in our... in our experience, where there were two... where there two fee systems in place at the same time."
2002.01-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.166,1265.548,There was only one in '91.
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1276.082,1281.972,"Well, the unique feature here is that both were in place and operational as of November 15th, 1991."
2002.01-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1287.256,1289.06,They... they were both operating in '91?
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1289.06,1289.9,--That's right.
2002.01-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.416,1292.817,Okay.
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1293.394,1293.951,And operational.
2002.01-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.762,1300.596,"--I thought the change occurred in January 1, 1992, but that's okay."
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1300.596,1312.916,"--To answer your question, Justice Scalia, the... the change... the new system became effective for the 1992 registration year commencing January 1st, 1992, but the charges were assessed in the fall of 1991."
2002.01-270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1312.916,1318.004,"So if Yellow Freight hadn't paid early, would this argument be off the board?"
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1329.867,1340.734,"The significance of that, Justice Ginsburg, would be something for the Department of Transportation in a pending proceeding that's... that is open now to consider."
2002.01-270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1344.74,1353.18,"But you're suggesting there's a possibility that somebody would be penalized for early payment, for prompt payment."
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1353.18,1354.206,No.
2002.01-270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1421.998,1429.793,Do you say the same thing for the argument that there in fact was no reciprocity in place with Illinois in 1991?
2002.01-270,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1429.793,1431.057,"--We do, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1462.193,1464.404,"Thank you, Mr. Schlick."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1467.645,1472.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.466,1526.371,That was what determined reciprocity.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1526.371,1528.534,That's what determined reciprocity.
2002.01-270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1627.787,1629.828,Albeit on a system that didn't go into effect until--
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1629.828,1634.045,"For the registration year 1992, we charged and collected."
2002.01-270,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1746.737,1755.023,"--Well, if we think it isn't altogether clear and in fact could be read the other way, don't we have to consider Chevron deference?"
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1759.149,1773.346,"--If it... yes, if... if the statute is not clear, then you proceed to the second step of Chevron, which is whether the agency's interpretation is a permissible one."
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1780.1,1793.701,But if you're wrong about the text being unambiguous... and you do have an uphill argument there because didn't the two lower courts in Michigan reason the other way?
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1801.631,1808.496,"The... I agree the second step of Chevron is always an uphill argument, to overcome an agency interpretation."
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1828.746,1834.087,"But didn't the lower courts in Michigan say that was a proper reading, that the ICC's reading--"
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1834.087,1834.252,Yes.
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1834.252,1834.991,--was a proper--
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1834.991,1835.233,"Yes, they did."
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1835.233,1839.899,--Which makes it harder for you to argue that there is a plain meaning the other way.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1839.899,1842.839,"Yes, it does make it harder."
2002.01-270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.881,1919.31,Is there anything in the record that indicates what percentage of revenue a State like Michigan gets on the basis of these reciprocity agreements or how much... how much of its revenue from this kind of tax is not affected by reciprocity agreements?
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1919.31,1923.353,The record in this case is very scant.
2002.01-270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.529,1964.029,Thank you.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1964.029,1966.959,But I don't know how those individually break down.
2002.01-270,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1991.782,1998.515,Would you tell me again why you think the statute is... is clear and unambiguous in your favor?
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1998.515,2001.242,There--
2002.01-270,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2001.242,2009.569,I see... I see the sense of a generic approach because of the trucks being painted a different color or reincorporation and so forth.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2009.569,2011.033,--There... there--
2002.01-270,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2011.033,2014.588,But I'm not sure that I can find that under the clear language of the statute.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2016.992,2020.274,--There are very few words which are at issue here.
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.599,2049.795,So you're reading in... you're reading in from any carrier.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2073.172,2080.944,"Well, if... under our interpretation, under... under the plain text, we submit you don't have to read in anything."
2002.01-270,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2094.386,2094.803,Let me ask you this.
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.656,2106.741,No.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2106.741,2109.827,These... these fees deal only with--
2002.01-270,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2109.827,2112.138,"No, but can you give me a yes or no answer to that?"
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2121.936,2128.795,"--The statute in Michigan imposes a $10 fee but permits a waiver, meaning 0."
2002.01-270,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2128.795,2131.074,So are you telling me that the answer to my question is yes?
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2135.034,2135.508,No.
2002.01-270,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2141.876,2143.394,So there are at least two categories.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2143.394,2144.091,Yes.
2002.01-270,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2144.091,2148.598,"And if there are at least two categories, don't you have to do just what Justice Scalia said you have to do?"
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2173.215,2174.702,I... I disagree.
2002.01-270,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2188.739,2190.119,No matter to whom.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2191.737,2192.309,--No matter to whom.
2002.01-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2193.625,2199.507,"May I also suggest that the... when you look at those words in the context of the whole subparagraph (4), which is the part--"
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2199.507,2200.007,--Yes.
2002.01-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2200.007,2205.652,"--which begins, shall establish a fee system, so you're talking about collected or charged as part of a system."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2205.652,2206.778,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.199,2277.258,Carrier in your view signifying the entity that owns the trucks?
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2277.258,2279.286,Yes.
2002.01-270,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2302.527,2312.556,"I... I guess our point is that for you to make the statute work, you are reading something into it that isn't there, which is this generic system and... or this generic theory."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2323.414,2327.946,"Well, I would... I respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
2002.01-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.643,2331.908,"The words, fee system, are in the statute itself."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2335.083,2335.405,--This... correct.
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.002,2362.487,--I don't understand what you get out of the disjunctive.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2362.487,2364.096,--The statute--
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.096,2365.021,How... how does that help you?
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2365.021,2365.615,--The statute--
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2365.615,2372.07,"It seems to me that for the trucks that were from reciprocity States, the fee was neither charged nor collected."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2374.412,2390.31,"--That's what the Michigan Supreme Court said, in essence, that if the... if the State collected or charged the $10 fee, period, then the statute is satisfied."
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2390.31,2391.683,Did the State sponsor that--
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2391.683,2392.362,Everything else is irrelevant.
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2392.772,2401.635,--In Michigan you... you helpfully began your argument by pointing out that the case had been decided on a different ground below.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2401.635,2402.2,Yes.
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2402.2,2411.014,"And this question of plain meaning or not surfaced for the first time in the Michigan Supreme Court, and that was the basis for its decision."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2411.014,2411.465,Yes.
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2411.465,2414.375,Did you make that argument?
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2420.732,2441.071,"It was made in a few paragraphs as one alternative argument in a long brief, but the principal thrust of the argument... it was... it was mentioned in the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion and rejected."
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2456.197,2459.364,You presented it but not as your main argument.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2459.364,2466.225,"Our argument... our principal argument, the way the case was framed in the State courts was this timing issue."
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.954,2535.956,"General Casey, you... you say that the purpose of this section was to preserve State revenues, but... but... the consequence of the... the theory that you're espousing is... is not just to preserve State revenues, but to augment them."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2558.228,2583.483,"Well, the... we... we submit that the fears that have been expressed in our opponents' briefs that these reciprocity agreements will automatically be abrogated is unfounded, for a couple of reasons, principally because those reciprocity agreements were originally entered into by States for economic reasons, totally apart from the... the statute."
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.318,2589.81,I understand that.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2615.061,2638.833,"--Under their interpretation what has happened, in effect, is that State revenues are at best frozen, but in practical effect, they may really be ratcheted downward because of changing economic circumstances."
2002.01-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2638.833,2643.46,"Would you explain one thing to me that response... it relates to Justice Scalia's question, too."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2666.963,2675.736,"Well, when Michigan changed from a base-plating to principal place of business, it resulted in, on balance, no economic benefit."
2002.01-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2675.736,2680.409,"--With respect to some States, it would increase revenues; with respect to others, it would decrease revenues."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2680.409,2680.796,Correct.
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2681.265,2685.968,But your... your argument is you can charge everybody $10 no matter from what State.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2687.425,2690.174,--Our... the Michigan Supreme... under the--
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.174,2694.098,"That you can, as far as the Federal statute is concerned, charge everybody $10."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2694.098,2698.966,--Or the maximum that they were charging at the time that the statute took effect.
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2706.379,2706.885,No.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2708.865,2710.053,As far as Michigan is concerned.
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.053,2712.811,--your argument is that you can charge everybody the full $10.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2712.811,2713.65,That's correct.
2002.01-270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2713.65,2720.656,But Michigan has some interest in getting its own trucks... having lower fees in other States I suppose.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2720.656,2720.94,Of course.
2002.01-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2804.832,2805.229,May I ask you a question?
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2822.782,2825.194,Would Michigan win or lose?
2002.01-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2825.194,2826.542,"Yes, in this case."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2839.018,2845.487,Michigan probably would not win or lose in that.
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2846.769,2850.619,You assert the right to terminate reciprocity agreements.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2851.476,2852.408,--That... under the--
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2852.408,2853.346,--Your basic point here--
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2853.346,2854.057,--Under the theory--
2002.01-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.057,2861.228,"--is that despite this Federal statute, you can terminate your reciprocity agreement with Kansas and charge the full $10."
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2861.722,2864.729,--That's the theory of the Michigan Supreme Court opinion.
2002.01-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2865.8,2868.973,"But you haven't terminated the agreement, have you?"
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2868.973,2873.506,"We... we have an agreement with Illinois, not Kansas."
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2885.092,2888.083,General Casey I have a question about the response you just gave.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2904.146,2904.427,--Well--
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2904.427,2905.505,--abandoning that argument?
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2905.505,2905.904,--No.
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2945.797,2948.01,Is that a... is that a live issue in this case?
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2948.01,2953.747,"--Michigan has a reciprocity agreement with Illinois, we believe."
2002.01-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2966.121,2970.753,So there would be no point in saying that that's an issue open for a possible remand.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2970.753,2973.112,That's... I believe that's correct.
2002.01-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2973.112,2974.01,But that's not right.
2002.01-270,2,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2982.552,2982.697,That's correct.
2002.01-270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3044.518,3045.841,"Very well, Mr. Casey."
2002.01-270,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3048.621,3050.937,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-270,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3131.243,3134.647,I didn't understand the last clause that you just spoke.
2002.01-270,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3134.647,3144.441,"--Well, the... the question whether the fact that Yellow paid in advance of November 15th, 1991 for a registration year that was not going to go into effect until sometime in 1992--"
2002.01-270,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3144.441,3146.277,"Well, the statute says collected or charged."
2002.01-270,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3146.277,3151.007,"--Well, as of 1991, and the question is collected or charged, in our view, for what?"
2002.01-270,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3166.595,3170.995,"Well, but it really hasn't been fully fleshed out here, that particular angle."
2002.01-270,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3179.535,3187.553,"--Well, our view is that if that is... if there's to be further litigation on that point, the proper forum for that is the administrative proceeding that... that Mr. Schlick also mentioned."
2002.01-270,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3210.266,3214.988,But why should we get into an issue that the Michigan Supreme Court didn't resolve?
2002.01-270,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3232.546,3236.687,"--Well, it is true the Michigan Supreme Court did not decide it."
2002.01-270,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3289.306,3290.708,Could I ask on that question?
2002.01-270,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3306.498,3308.352,"--Well, we think it can't be considered in the aggregate."
2002.01-270,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3312.281,3315.045,"No, a fee system it refers to."
2002.01-270,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3315.045,3317.773,"It does, but if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, just respond briefly."
2002.01-270,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3324.351,3325.769,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
2002.01-270,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3325.769,3326.554,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-270,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3326.554,3327.291,The case is submitted.
