1985.84-701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.841,We will hear arguments next in United States against Riverside Bayview Homes.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,80.889,95.79,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether Riverside's property is wetland subject to the Corps of Engineers permit jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act."
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.999,290.211,"Ms. Oberly, may I inquire, in your reply brief it seemed to me that for the first time the government was saying that the land in this case is connected by open water to a navigable river of the United States."
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,300.02,300.552,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.846,313.138,"Well, why, then, didn't the Corps just show that surface connection before the District Court and not bother with subsurface connections?"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,316.496,323.26,"--Your Honor, in all fairness to Judge Kennedy and the Sixth Circuit, this was one of the first Section 404 cases ever tried."
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.352,339.862,"Well, it does seem to me that if the theory that you now assert is correct, that there is a direct surface connection to navigable water, that the case is substantially--"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,339.862,341.284,I agree with you completely.
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,381.455,381.83,--What did the District--
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,381.83,383.205,--attention from the pertinent issues in the case.
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.205,391.577,--What did the District Court... wasn't there some expert testimony on the connection between this wetland and the navigable waters?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,391.577,399.854,"There was expert testimony on flooding on the surface, and there was expert testimony on subsurface, in other words ground water--"
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.854,402.493,Which was to the effect that there was no connection.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,402.493,403.602,--That's correct.
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,411.787,413.521,You just want to be able to try the case again.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,413.521,417.237,"No, we are tired of this case, and would just as soon not try it again."
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,417.237,420.736,"Well, what, should we just dismiss it as improvidently granted?"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,420.736,428.748,"No, Your Honor, I think that it would be sufficient if you take... and I plan to talk about the maps and the pictures in the course of my argument."
1985.84-701,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,432.451,434.045,I might say I am glad we finally got a map.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,436.637,478.869,"--Another factor I should mention, which is noted in Footnote 1 of our reply brief, is that for several years the exhibits in the case were lost, and in all candor I did not understand the case until we found the exhibits, and i had the same physical, mental perception of the land we were talking about that the Court of Appeals opinion describes until these exhibits were found, and once they were found, I realized that we were talking... that what was involved here in terms of both biological and scientific functions the wetlands perform and the actual hydrologic connection between this wetland and navigable waters of the United States was simply not as described in the Court of Appeals opinion."
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.119,488.114,I don't regard a USGS map as kind of an open sesame to the correct resolution of a case.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,491.567,499.61,"But, Your Honor, this map was... the map that is in our reply brief and the picture to which I will be directing your attention was before Judge Kennedy."
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.735,504.89,"Well, did Judge Kennedy make a finding that this map was accurate?"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,504.89,509.248,Nobody challenged its accuracy.
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,512.34,512.98,"I mean, is your--"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,512.98,526.521,"She did make a finding, Your Honor, and answered, in direct answer to your question, that the property owned by Riverside is adjacent to a navigable water in the United States, to wit, Black Creek."
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.409,542.609,"--So the position you are taking now, you feel, is completely consistent with the factual findings of the District Court and of the Court of Appeals?"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,542.609,550.059,"Clearly not of the Court of Appeals, because the Court of Appeals has described a totally different piece of property than what the physical evidence shows exists."
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,550.059,554.339,And so now we are supposed to hear you and kind of revise the Court of Appeals description?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,554.339,556.338,"No, Your Honor, I am not asking you to change the facts."
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.489,576.252,"What you are bringing here then is essentially a factual dispute about how this land lies, and whether there is a surface connection or not."
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,576.252,577.907,--I think it is more--
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,577.907,581.796,You say the Court of Appeals is wrong in having described a property a particular way.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,583.436,584.499,"--No, Your Honor."
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,624.138,635.478,"But the problem is if the facts are different than were perceived or articulated by the Courts below, how do we deal with that to get to the legal question?"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,641.959,649.862,"--I don't think you have to, Your Honor, because what we are relying on are trial exhibits for you to see--"
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.862,658.234,"Well, you didn't... it sounds to me like there was somewhat of some omissions at the trial stage."
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,658.234,660.733,"--Well, there were a lot of excesses that--"
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,660.733,661.624,At the appellate stage.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,667.903,668.778,--If the Court of Appeals--
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.778,669.699,--but only for one circuit.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,669.699,682.086,"--It is a circuit that has substantial and significant wetlands in it, and from the Corps of Engineers perspective would be quite a damaging precedent to leave that opinion out there as precedent."
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.254,696.925,Why are you trying to win the case on another ground?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,697.408,699.299,"Well, I would be happy to--"
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.299,700.11,--Why did you ever... why did you--
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,700.11,702.141,"--I am happy to win it on any around, but once we--"
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.838,724.929,"--Even without this map and this connection with the water, you claim the Court of Appeals is wrong."
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,724.929,725.694,That's correct.
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.349,728.584,And I would suppose you would rather win on that than this.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,728.584,772.91,"--We claimed that even before the map had been found, and we are happy to win it that way or... but it seemed to me important once the exhibits had been located for this Court to see what we were actually talking about in this case, and to the Court of Appeals' credit, they asked to see the exhibits at the oral argument in the Sixth Circuit, and they were told they had been lost, and it wasn't until the Government had either petitioned for cert or cert had been granted that someone in the District Court clerk's office found the exhibits, and that is all quite unfortunate, but it doesn't change the fact that in our view, either using these maps or using the theory that is basically set forth in our petition and in our opening brief, this is a wetland, and that the Court of Appeals legal analysis was wrong."
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,772.91,798.166,"Well, using your old theory, without the overlay of the new map and facts, the Corps includes adjacent wetlands as part of the waters of the United States, apparently without any requirement that the wetlands or the discharges to them affect navigable waters or interstate commerce in any way."
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,799.041,802.976,"I don't think that is really quite a fair characterization, Your Honor."
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,824.171,824.718,"Well, must there be--"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,824.718,825.093,--Yes.
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,825.093,825.312,--Okay.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,831.638,845.178,"I think you could argue the case, and I could answer the question no and still be correct, but in this case we can demonstrate a connection between the wetland and these navigable waters, and that is all that this Court would have to decide."
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,845.178,847.614,"Well, disregarding this case, on the pure theory, must there be a connection?"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,850.113,850.269,Yes.
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,874.431,875.806,A discharge out.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,875.806,876.478,--Discharge out.
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,947.7,954.555,So the person watering his back yard a lot is not going to be brought in in your view?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,954.555,972.235,"Unless we could show that he has got some interstate commerce activity going on in his back yard, and the Corps would take it upon itself to make that showing itself, and not require the back yard owner to come in and demonstrate it, the absence of the commerce connection to the Corps's satisfaction."
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1121.286,1128.58,"The lawns you are talking about, Ms. Oberly, then are situated to the north and west of the property line?"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1128.58,1129.502,Of the black boundary.
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1168.142,1171.687,Didn't the District Court have something to say about how often that land was flooded?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1171.687,1182.621,"Yes, she did, and she found it wasn't very often, but it had happened in a manner that was basically consistent with the flood cycle on the Great Lakes, which is an eight to twenty year cycle."
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.427,1242.064,Basically what is the constitutional authority for this statute or these regulations?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1242.064,1242.486,The commerce clause.
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.486,1244.142,Just straight the commerce clause.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1244.142,1245.267,Yes.
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.267,1248.64,And the navigable water is just a stand-in for an effect on commerce.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1255.06,1257.729,"That is correct, for an adjacent wetland."
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.729,1258.135,Uh-huh.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1258.135,1266.476,"The Act in our view also covers wetlands that are not adjacent to navigable waters, that are called isolated wetlands."
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.476,1267.648,"If then, what?"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1267.648,1272.209,If the Corps of Engineers affirmatively demonstrates that the use--
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.209,1273.209,There is a connection?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1273.209,1275.894,--or destruction of that wetland would have an effect on interstate commerce.
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1275.894,1279.471,"One way or the other, either... running either way, or not?"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1279.471,1279.815,That's correct.
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1281.642,1287.281,"Well, an effect by some connection with waters in--"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1287.281,1289.483,It could be used... it could be interstate travelers.
1985.84-701,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1296.652,1308.366,--But it would be your view that an isolated wetland that provided refuge for birds would be enough for Corps of Engineers jurisdiction?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1308.366,1311.443,"If they were migratory birds, yes."
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.443,1312.975,"If there was an aerial connection, as you say."
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1312.975,1313.771,Yes.
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1314.911,1317.458,Is the movement of birds interstate commerce?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1317.458,1324.423,It can... Yes.
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1324.423,1326.297,What case do you rely on?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1326.297,1330.747,Missouri versus Holland would be an example.
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1330.747,1332.06,That was a treaty power case.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1332.06,1337.386,"It is a treaty power case, but I think it demonstrates the importance--"
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1337.386,1339.073,"Well, it demonstrates the treaty power."
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1339.073,1341.025,--North Dakota... United States versus North Dakota.
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1356.972,1361.017,That the migration of birds is interstate commerce?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1362.157,1364.329,--That it can be.
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1364.563,1366.781,"Well, what... in what cases--"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1366.781,1367.094,--Duck hunters.
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1367.094,1369.671,--In what cases have we recognized that?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1369.671,1389.539,"I may be unable to give you a case, Your Honor, but I would suggest that duck hunters, interstate travelers who go to wildlife refuges to view ducks, migratory ducks who come from out of state, all of that together combines to make not just the birds alone but the viewing of the birds and--"
1985.84-701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.539,1390.227,It has an effect.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1390.227,1394.225,--It has an effect sufficient to constitute a connection with interstate commerce.
1985.84-701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1394.225,1397.053,Can the states legislate contrary to the Migrant Birds Act?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1403.644,1405.862,Not to my knowledge.
1985.84-701,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1405.862,1409.22,Haven't we treated that in some case?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1409.22,1414.935,"If you have, I am afraid that I am not--"
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1414.935,1424.962,"Of course, there is an argument on this case that even if... whatever power Congress might have to legislate with respect to isolated potholes or wetlands, they didn't in this case."
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1428.258,1431.273,"--That is why, Your Honor, I was trying to explain--"
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.273,1431.538,Yes.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1431.538,1434.99,"--what it is that an adjacent wetland, not an isolated wetland--"
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.99,1435.74,How about an isolated?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1435.74,1439.333,--This case isn't an isolated wetland.
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1449.721,1455.171,So we should be careful... we should be careful not to decide that case.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1455.171,1473.476,"--I don't think you have that case before you, but if you wish to put it before you, I think it is quite clear that in the legislative history of the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act, that Congress fully understood, and there is one portion in particular... it is a fairly lengthy section, but one portion of the Congressional--"
1985.84-701,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.476,1478.817,"Maybe some people who made the legislative history understood that, but is it reflected in the Act?"
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1480.052,1480.364,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1698.637,1705.447,"Ms. Oberly, I am still... going back to the very beginning of the argument, I have to confess some uncertainty about the whole case."
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1712.601,1713.382,She found--
1985.84-701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.382,1719.645,And is your map supposed to demonstrate that that basic point was just dead wrong?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1719.645,1720.956,--It is dead wrong.
1985.84-701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1727.642,1733.404,When you say it is an adjacent... what do you mean by saying it is an adjacent wetland?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1736.028,1738.7,"Yes, in two different senses."
1985.84-701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.382,1753.522,And that nobody offered any evidence about surface flow?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1753.522,1755.397,"--She had the same maps, but she made no findings."
1985.84-701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.397,1758.692,I don't know what... I am a little bit like Justice Rehnquist.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1765.143,1770.453,It proves... the testimony in the record is that the property slopes to the southeast.
1985.84-701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1790.429,1793.787,"Well, it has to drain, unless it sinks into the ground before it flows, I suppose."
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1796.567,1808.187,"--It's... I mean, it's true that the soil here is quite wet, but at some point the ground is going to have all that it can hold, and the testimony in the record is, this has been a wetland for decades, possibly for over 100 years."
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1808.187,1811.639,--Did she make any finding on this?
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1811.639,1811.999,On which?
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1811.999,1814.075,On the point that Justice Stevens asked you about.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1814.075,1815.418,The surface connection?
1985.84-701,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1815.418,1815.668,Yes.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1815.668,1817.137,"No, and she made no finding one way or the other."
1985.84-701,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.043,1820.011,She said as I understood it there was no hydrological connection.
1985.84-701,0,33931,kathryn_anne_oberly,,1822.667,1832.195,--Because what she described as the only evidence she was talking about was underground holes that had been dug on the property to see how quickly water came in.
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,1951.772,1965.798,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I must admit that I am somewhat amazed by the government's position that has been articulated here today."
1985.84-701,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.17,2017.839,Do you have at the tip of your fingers or tongue a citation to the record as to where she made that finding?
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2022.401,2040.878,"It is at the appendix to the government's petition for certiorari at Pages 24, 25, 34, 35, 36, 37, 28, and 31."
1985.84-701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2076.738,2082.049,Would you suggest that is not very much flooding?
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2082.049,2085.563,"In my opinion, Your Honor, that is very infrequent flooding."
1985.84-701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2085.563,2087.11,Six in eight years?
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2087.11,2088.016,Eighty years.
1985.84-701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2088.016,2089.876,I thought you said eight.
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2089.876,2090.968,Pardon me.
1985.84-701,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2093.875,2099.497,It is much like the Great Salt Lake.
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2102.84,2105.604,"I don't believe that is the situation for the Great Salt Lake, Your Honor."
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.338,2302.26,That is the original Act?
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2302.26,2303.743,"That's the original Act, Your Honor."
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.743,2306.525,Yes.
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2306.525,2312.803,"Congress in adopting the 1972 amendments, had something specific in mind."
1985.84-701,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2392.521,2408.779,"Do you think that there is no indication that Congress would have been concerned about pollution flowing from adjacent wetlands into navigable waters of the United States, and want to regulate them?"
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2408.779,2413.089,"The Act does regulate that, Your Honor, under Section 402."
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.115,2876.933,"You think the regulation then just exceeds the statutory authority where it says that a wetland is any area that is inundated or saturated by surface or ground water, whether it has got any connection with navigable water or not?"
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2876.933,2885.072,"To the extent it is applied in a fashion that does not require surface connection, yes, it is invalid."
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2885.072,2887.664,Or an underground connection.
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2887.664,2891.505,"The underground connection, I would say the same thing."
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.816,2903.782,"But that is what is infirm about these regulations, you say."
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2903.782,2906.36,"As applied, Your Honor, yes."
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.686,2912.435,Do you defend that?
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2912.435,2917.636,I have to admit I have some problems reading the regulations and arriving at that conclusion.
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.636,2918.292,Yes.
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2918.292,2923.353,"But I think if the regulations are to be saved, that type of construction is required."
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2923.353,2930.724,"But you... as far as adjacency is concerned, would you say this is neighboring?"
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2930.724,2936.816,I would say it is not far away.
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.751,2943.079,But if there was a connection--
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2943.079,2944.094,I would say--
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.094,2948.718,--then you would think the statute would authorize it.
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2948.718,2950.014,"--If there was a surface water connection, I would--"
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.014,2950.655,Or a ground water connection.
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2950.655,2951.372,--Pardon me?
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2951.372,2952.591,Or a ground water connection.
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2952.591,2957.182,The Act doesn't regulate ground water.
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.182,2960.041,"Well, it may not."
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2981.079,2982.735,My position would be the same.
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2996.807,2997.119,I see.
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,2997.119,2998.181,--matter.
1985.84-701,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.616,3092.721,I suppose it a fortiori would be contrary to the statute in your view to attempt to regulate that kind of a wetland.
1985.84-701,1,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,3092.721,3094.376,--Yes.
1985.84-701,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3302.982,3304.745,"Thank you, counsel."
