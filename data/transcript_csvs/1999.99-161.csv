1999.99-161,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.929,"We'll hear argument next in No. 99-161, Chad Weisgram v. the Marley Company."
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,26.298,30.617,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it... and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-161,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.321,90.451,"Mr. Strandness, I noticed that in the... the Eighth Circuit's opinion, the opinion of the majority, they did not cite the Martin Eby case from this Court which seems to me to have a great deal to do with whether they were right or wrong."
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,93.663,94.532,"I will, Your Honor."
1999.99-161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,105.345,111.101,You... you phrase the... the decision a little tendentiously.
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,124.683,126.031,This--
1999.99-161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.031,133.048,"--enough evidence to... to entitle the case to go to the jury, and that's what the issue is, whether... whether the plaintiff has to be given another chance."
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,133.048,146.188,"--Justice Scalia, what the court of appeals did was to take the record and to delete from that record that was before the jury excerpts of experts' testimony."
1999.99-161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,158.931,173.881,"Well, but we... I take it the case is being argued on the assumptions, A, that the... the expert testimony was properly stricken, and B, that without it, there was insufficient evidence to return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff."
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,178.107,186.154,"That's correct, Your Honor, that the... it's not before the Court the issue as to whether or not the court of appeals properly or improperly--"
1999.99-161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,186.154,198.187,"So... so... and your position is that when the court of appeals finds that the evidence submitted to the jury was insufficient to justify a verdict for the plaintiff, it may never order a judgment for the defendant."
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,198.187,200.932,"--That's not our position, Your Honor."
1999.99-161,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,218.939,229.253,"Well, then... then you're saying in... I... I think what you just said perhaps is inconsistent or at least it seems to me inconsistent with your answer to Justice Kennedy's question."
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,240.985,242.18,I would--
1999.99-161,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.18,248.201,I think you... I think you run right up against our Martin Eby case if you don't leave discretion to the court of appeals.
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,248.201,262.002,--The discretion of the court of appeals involves situations where the record is left intact and they're simply looking at the record to make determinations as sufficiency of the... the evidence that was heard by the jury.
1999.99-161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,273.126,281.243,"I think that that is your position, and I... and I... when you say things were deleted from the record, by reason of the expert testimony going--"
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,281.243,282.228,That's correct.
1999.99-161,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,283.025,283.482,--One of--
1999.99-161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,283.482,289.629,--But... but that's... that's always the case when... when you find the testimony of an expert witness is inadmissible.
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,291.148,293.215,"--Exactly, but what is different--"
1999.99-161,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.215,302.773,But... but do you say that it has to be automatically remanded to the trial court and then the trial court still has discretion to decide whether to grant a new trial?
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,302.773,307.846,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor, that the trial court is in the best position because the trial--"
1999.99-161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.846,308.548,On what basis?
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,316.7,330.312,"--The same criteria that any trial court, any district court, uses in exercising discretion in making decisions such as admitting expert testimony, on making decisions as to whether or not to grant summary judgment, as to making decisions as to whether or not--"
1999.99-161,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.312,334.727,But... but there's... there's virtually no discretion as to whether or not to grant summary judgment.
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,345.52,351.586,"--No, it's not, Mr. Chief Justice, because the situation here is we've got an artificial record."
1999.99-161,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.072,376.302,"Well then, how... how you distinguish the Martin Eby case?"
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,376.302,377.879,--How do I distinguish that?
1999.99-161,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.879,378.097,Yes.
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,389.105,397.054,The... the chief way I would distinguish that case is simply by the fact that this... that that case did not involve a truncated record.
1999.99-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,398.262,401.893,It doesn't say anything about truncated record in the rule.
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,406.162,408.366,--That's... that's one of the rules that apply--
1999.99-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,408.366,413.878,"What it seems to say, it says, if the motion for summary judgment as a matter of law is denied."
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,417.377,418.184,--That's correct.
1999.99-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,418.184,418.504,All right.
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,421.218,422.427,That's correct.
1999.99-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,422.427,427.251,"And it says if the appellate court reverses, which is what they did... right?"
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,427.251,428.676,That's correct.
1999.99-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,428.676,434.384,Then nothing in this rule precludes it from determining that the appellee is entitled to a new trial.
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,434.384,435.583,That's correct.
1999.99-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,435.583,438.009,"Now, that seems to me it might or it might not."
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,438.009,439.174,That's correct.
1999.99-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,439.174,453.143,"And in your case they said no, in part because you never asked for one, and in part because when you did get around to asking one in your motion for a new... you know, your motion to reconsider after the appellate opinion, you never gave a reason."
1999.99-161,0,38318,paul_a_strandness,,456.181,457.047,"Well, that--"
1999.99-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,457.047,459.703,--that would say that you have some more evidence to put in.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,1815.401,1823.825,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1861.137,1863.413,"No, but what he's thinking of, I think, is the following."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,1949.643,1952.998,And... and that is their argument I do... I believe.
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1952.998,1956.453,"So, on that argument, it is true what they said about Neely."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,1958.697,1968.006,"The response is that Neely does address a sufficiency case, and it says in a sufficiency case, it is up to... it is appropriate--"
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1968.006,1970.705,"But you see, they're saying there are two sufficiency cases."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,1970.705,1971.414,"--Yes, and--"
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1971.414,1975.143,There is type A where nobody is talking about a witness not being there.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,1978.341,1978.858,--And... and--
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1978.858,1987.538,"And then there's type B where the reason it's insufficient is because without Witness Smith it's insufficient, though with Witness Smith it would be sufficient."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,1987.538,1993.457,"--And that is essentially the rule 56 or summary judgment situation, and there is no difference."
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2004.036,1993.457,Because?
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2020.244,2021.043,And the answer--
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.043,2021.485,"--So, now, what's your response?"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2021.485,2028.302,--The answer to that is actually the question you raised earlier about rule 50(d) and... and rule 50(a).
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2029.121,2029.231,"Well, no."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2031.439,2035.787,--Rule... rule 50(a) says only legally sufficient evidence.
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.787,2037.361,"Oh, they're not denying it."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2039.165,2049.857,"And evidence that is not competent, that is not uttered by qualified witnesses and which the appellate court has determined is inadmissible, should never have been admitted in the first place, is not legally sufficient."
1999.99-161,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2062.059,2074.844,"Well, you take the position, I gather, that the court of appeals has discretion to decide whether to send it back for a new trial or even discretion to send it back and let the trial court decide that."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2074.844,2077.11,"Well, that's really the beauty of rule 50."
1999.99-161,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2077.11,2077.266,Do you agree?
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2077.266,2077.706,Yes.
1999.99-161,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2077.706,2078.324,Yes.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2078.324,2078.817,It--
1999.99-161,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2078.817,2087.502,"And that means, I guess, that under some circumstances, the court of appeals might abuse its discretion when it didn't do that."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2087.502,2093.4,--You could certainly... a court could abuse its discretion.
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2095.71,2099.03,How could a court abuse its... what... what are the criteria for--
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2099.03,2099.811,"--Well, if--"
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.811,2101.694,--for whether you allow a new trial or not?
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2101.694,2109.986,"--Well, and... and Neely did say that the appellate court and the trial court in a sufficiency case are in the same position."
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2128.535,2129.593,But come to my question.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2133.305,2133.677,If--
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.677,2136.609,--that... that could cause there to be an abuse of discretion?
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2136.609,2137.598,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2153.251,2155.387,Improperly excluded in the district court.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2155.387,2157.118,Improperly excluded by the district court.
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.649,2165.804,But there's another alternative.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2195.251,2195.82,He's... he's still--
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.82,2208.0,"Now, would it be within the discretion of either the court of appeals or the district court to say, well, there was no error, but we think the trial court ought to look at that evidence and see if that might have made up the deficiencies and justify another trial?"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2208.0,2216.034,"--I think the better rule is what... what the... what this Court said in Neely, that plaintiff has one opportunity to put in their best case."
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2217.095,2218.765,"So, you say as a matter of law, he couldn't do that."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2218.765,2220.924,"--Not... not on... on that record, no."
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.924,2224.22,But would you not agree that Neely at least doesn't pass on that question?
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2224.22,2232.484,"Well, it... it sort of does because in Neely the plaintiff did hint in their Supreme Court brief that they did have two additional witnesses, and the Court said it was--"
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.484,2237.401,"Well, but the... the issue of Court... it's very clear at the end of the opinion, saying the only issue is whether they had power to do what they did."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2237.401,2237.892,--Yes.
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.214,2243.868,"I'm not saying that's the right answer on my hypothetical, but I don't think it's been decided is all I'm really suggesting."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2243.868,2259.76,"--I... I do think, in answer to your question, Justice Stevens, a party going into a product liability case in 1997, 3... 4 years after Daubert has set down the criteria, that you have to have reliable evidence, you have to have qualified witnesses."
1999.99-161,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2269.277,2269.418,"Well, what if--"
1999.99-161,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2269.418,2269.673,"--Well, but--"
1999.99-161,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2269.673,2277.97,"--what if the... they had three expert witnesses lined up ready to go, and the trial court said, that's cumulative."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2287.99,2288.535,Well--
1999.99-161,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2288.535,2296.001,"Now, is that... would it be an abuse of discretion there not to send it back and--"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2296.001,2306.044,"--Well, very typically trial judges do require parties to limit their witnesses, and so they have to tell the court they're going to have one witness on this point and one witness on this point."
1999.99-161,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2327.08,2332.608,--And what about the case in which the trial court doesn't even get to the... the question of the trial court ruling?
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2360.158,2360.289,No.
1999.99-161,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2360.289,2363.751,"--or for that matter, the admissibility of any evidence."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2363.751,2364.603,"No, Your Honor."
1999.99-161,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2373.29,2375.146,"Well, you may... why isn't it persuasive?"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2375.146,2375.308,--Well--
1999.99-161,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2375.308,2395.314,"Because, I mean, on... on the argument that you've just made, if all the cumulative testimony had gone in and one witness was then thrown out for incompetence on appeal, there would be other evidence in there that would sustain the verdict and, in fact, the... the plaintiff would win the case."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2413.881,2422.652,"--Well, because counsel know what... if their... if their witnesses are qualified and if they have reliable backup for their opinions."
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.652,2423.292,"Well, it is a good argument."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2438.051,2438.626,And--
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.626,2444.466,But I'm not going to allow you to bring in a parade of experts just because you... you want to--
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2444.466,2448.131,--I--
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2448.131,2448.998,--gamble on the system.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2448.998,2459.761,"--I should point out... well, it's... it's certainly conceivable that there might be a situation where a trial court would become overzealous perhaps in limiting the number of witnesses a party could have."
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.393,2482.51,"No, but you don't think a trial court ever has to allow cumulation of experts or of any other testimony for the reason that, well, one of them may... may be found to have been improperly admitted."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2485.459,2502.66,"--I... I think if... that if there is... it would be better to allow some cumulation of testimony, some duplicative testimony at the trial court level rather than what the plaintiffs are suggesting is... which is allow automatic retrials in every case."
1999.99-161,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2502.66,2510.784,"But I thought your answer to Justice Scalia's hypo was going to be, look, the plaintiff has got responsibility to choose the best witness."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2510.784,2511.943,I certainly do agree with that.
1999.99-161,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2511.943,2513.684,"And if the plaintiff gets it wrong, too bad."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2513.684,2515.636,That is... that is my position.
1999.99-161,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2515.636,2522.883,"If that's the answer, then the... then the trial court doesn't have an obligation to allow cumulative witnesses even if the plaintiff wants it."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2522.883,2527.917,And... and I certainly don't think that a party is going to be encouraged to over-try his case in the first place.
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2538.976,2542.483,Why... I don't... then I may be lost in this and it may be my fault.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2591.932,2593.929,They did have the opportunity to--
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.929,2601.877,"--Well, why not have the opportunity even in the court of appeals to say, Judges, please let the district court make this decision?"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2601.877,2607.468,"--Well, they did have that opportunity in their petition for rehearing had they wanted to make that case."
1999.99-161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2607.468,2614.317,"Well, in... in Neely, I guess, this Court said that the district court is in no better position than the court of appeals--"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2614.317,2614.711,On--
1999.99-161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2614.711,2615.969,--in dealing with--
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2615.969,2616.856,--That is absolutely correct--
1999.99-161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2616.856,2617.448,--this sort of a question.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2617.448,2617.951,--Mr. Chief Justice.
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2638.319,2638.997,That's not what would be at issue.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2641.521,2647.954,"And actually the litigation history in this case, the trial judge that tried this particular case was not familiar with it."
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2666.936,2672.813,"Well, his... his point about the truncated record is that it is the record without the testimony of this witness."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2672.813,2673.315,Well--
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.315,2676.822,But that's the same record that the... that the district court would have to use on remand.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2677.43,2686.424,"--And... and I might add that our initial motion for... for judgment as a matter of law was made on the entire record, and... and clearly, the Eighth Circuit reviewed the entire record."
1999.99-161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2700.191,2705.962,"Well, this is the kind of... this is the kind of thing that a trial lawyer faces all the time, isn't it?"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2705.962,2706.484,"Yes, it is."
1999.99-161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.484,2712.259,"Do I try to get this in with a business record, or do I actually call the witness himself?"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2718.878,2721.797,They... these are... these are well known.
1999.99-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2748.762,2748.993,Ms. Hogan?
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.993,2755.84,"Talking about being in the dark, I guess the court of appeals was in the dark about Neely because it didn't cite it, and I was concerned about the reply brief."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2760.903,2762.04,--Our brief?
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.04,2764.936,"Yes, your brief in opposition to the cert petition."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2764.936,2772.762,Actually the... the whole Neely issue did not come up until the judgment as a matter of law was granted.
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2773.54,2776.925,"No, but the cert petition was filed after the court of appeals entered judgment as a matter of law."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2776.925,2777.444,But we--
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.444,2785.428,And you didn't call our attention to the fact that Neely might be a strong case on your side in your brief in opposition to the cert petition.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2792.314,2794.889,"--The... that may be true, Your Honor."
1999.99-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2855.09,2866.302,"Ms. Hogan, the... the plaintiff argued that suppose this had happened in the district court, that the district court said, oh, my goodness, I should not have allowed that evidence in."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2901.786,2912.806,"In this instance, since there was no such argument made to the trial court, the court of appeals is in equally a good... as good a position."
1999.99-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2912.806,2912.979,I'm not talking--
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2912.979,2913.095,But--
1999.99-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2913.095,2915.104,--I'm not talking about the conditional motion.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2918.017,2918.294,--Yes.
1999.99-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2918.294,2923.956,--after the jury verdict came in on the renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2923.956,2946.804,"And... and actually that... even in that type of situation, once the judgment has been made, unless there was some kind of error that the trial court prevented that evidence from coming in, I... that issue was addressed in... in the Navarro case in the Seventh Circuit where a plaintiff argued, after summary judgment had been entered, that she could have gotten a better affidavit."
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2968.377,2971.434,But... but Justice Ginsburg posits a district judge who's willing to reopen it.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,2991.432,2994.614,"Well, certainly rule 50 gives the trial court that discretion."
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3005.844,3006.919,And that's not an abuse of discretion.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3006.919,3008.142,--It might not be.
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3008.142,3013.552,Then why... then... then it wouldn't be... I assume it would not be an abuse of discretion for the court of appeals to have done that also.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3013.552,3020.702,"Well, had they been given a... a very valid, factual basis for a new trial by these plaintiffs--"
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3020.702,3023.292,No... no more of a factual basis than in the hypothetical I've just given you.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3032.774,3034.194,"--Well, that--"
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3034.194,3034.333,That's--
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3034.333,3034.646,--No.
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3038.745,3039.135,--But that was my hypothetical.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3045.796,3046.112,"--Well, if--"
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3046.112,3051.536,"And if the district court can do it, I don't understand, you know, why it wouldn't be proper for the court of appeals."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3051.536,3059.806,"--Well, rule 50 does give pre-verdict an opportunity for the parties to go back and fill in gaps pre-verdict."
1999.99-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3063.809,3066.393,But you said the district judge has that discretion.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3082.119,3086.35,"Well, it would... I think it would depend on what those circumstances were in the hypothetical."
1999.99-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3094.381,3094.672,"Well, why?"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3114.106,3117.166,--I would think that that would be appealable.
1999.99-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3117.166,3119.219,I think you're incorrect.
1999.99-161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.219,3123.978,I think there are a couple courts that have given relief by mandamus in extreme situations.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3128.027,3146.661,"I do... I do believe, Judge Ginsburg, that in... in the absence of some extreme error, a party has the duty, just as in rule 56, to come in with their best case and meet the essential elements of their case with... with sufficient evidence."
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3146.661,3149.301,"Well, let me give you a slight variation on the hypothetical."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3173.863,3179.798,"Well, you would have the record that would show--"
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3179.798,3183.9,You'd have the record and you just expunge from the record all the answers to the leading questions.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3189.486,3189.983,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.99-161,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3193.119,3198.952,You'd say he loses completely because he's expunged from the record the improper... the answers to the improperly framed questions.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3198.952,3202.22,--A party has a... has a duty under our rules.
1999.99-161,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3224.574,3229.439,"So... so, that means that they have no right to a new trial in... in Justice Stevens' situation."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3229.97,3230.122,That is correct.
1999.99-161,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3230.122,3236.212,"Now, is it error if the... i.e., abuse of discretion, to grant them a new trial anyway?"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3236.212,3248.098,Rule 50 is discretionary.
1999.99-161,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3252.087,3252.976,"So, the answer is no?"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3254.201,3254.365,The answer is no probably.
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3255.233,3258.989,"--It's the same in the court of appeals, isn't it?"
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3272.363,3273.633,And if there is not and--
1999.99-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3273.633,3283.095,"If there is not, you just can't imagine how they could give a new trial in this circumstance and you're not presented with anything that would suggest it was unfair, then you'd say, okay, there's no point."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3286.612,3286.819,--That is my position.
1999.99-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3323.122,3329.976,What about Mr. Strandness' argument that there's this theory of circumstantial evidence under North Dakota law on which they could have prevailed?
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3329.976,3338.866,"The Eighth Circuit addressed that issue, Your Honor, in their... in the... in the decision on appeal and in denying the... the request for rehearing."
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3348.69,3348.929,"Well, excuse me."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3359.134,3366.53,"And that... that's what they argued, that they should not have granted judgment as a matter of law because they didn't consider their circumstantial evidence, and the Eighth--"
1999.99-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.53,3367.391,It doesn't go to the new trial issue.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3367.391,3368.907,--It does not go to the new trial issue.
1999.99-161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3368.907,3370.039,That really isn't before the Court--
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3370.039,3371.034,That is not before the Court.
1999.99-161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3371.034,3372.946,--any question of North... North Dakota law.
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3372.946,3380.067,The circumstantial issue has been fully resolved by the Eighth Circuit and is not before this Court.
1999.99-161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3420.134,3424.778,"Thank you, Ms. Hogan."
1999.99-161,1,19185,christine_a_hogan,,3424.778,3425.369,Thank you.
1999.99-161,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3425.369,3426.14,The case is submitted.
