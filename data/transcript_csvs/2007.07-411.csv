2007.07-411,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.402,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 07-411, Plains Commerce Bank versus Long Family Land and Cattle Company."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,11.539,18.945,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Tribes lack inherent sovereign power over nonmembers."
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,57.113,67.967,We've said that regulation does include regulation by adjudication for purposes of... of Federal pre-emption laws.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,71.982,83.037,"Well, I think the reason that it would be different for Indian law is the way that it bears on the nonmember defendants' rights."
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,111.616,113.773,"Yes, I understand, but I'm just talking about the first one now."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,147.601,173.857,"--I think that it is different in the tribal-law context because in articulating the... the first exception when the Court said: Regulate nonmember conduct through other means, if the Court had meant to say ""adjudication"", I think the court could have articulated that there."
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.78,178.092,We could have said the same thing about the Congress.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,187.227,215.511,"--When I look at the... you know, at the... and compare the language in the first Montana exception of regulation to the language in the Constitution under the Indian Commerce Clause, I see a parallel there between saying that, you know, there are certain types of legislative authority that tribes may exercise over nonmembers versus exercising the power of the courts."
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,215.511,222.246,"Well, are you saying that the... that the regulatory authority could be broader than the adjudicatory authority?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,222.246,225.838,I think that has been well established: That the regulatory--
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.838,228.415,Can you give any example of that?
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,269.83,280.999,"--Well, I think that there's a tension between what the Court said in the Strate case, where it said, presumptively, if there is the power to regulate, then there is presumptively the power to adjudicate."
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.897,306.739,What was the regulation that was authorized but unenforceable in the courts?
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,318.704,334.493,"--Well, there was a... the footnote number 2 in Hicks at least called into question about whether or not... you know, I think it's been made clear by the Court's opinions that... that adjudicatory authority is certainly no broader than legislative authority."
2007.07-411,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,342.849,345.021,"Well, what is a tribe supposed to do?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,358.935,383.474,"Well, I think that there is a difference between situations where there is a clear ability to regulate and where you would move to enforce that regulation and a situation where you are adjudicating, you know, separate claims under the common law of the tribe."
2007.07-411,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,383.474,390.064,So you think there would be... there would be tribal-court jurisdiction in the case I hypothesized?
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,390.064,393.079,I don't think so.
2007.07-411,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,410.743,420.52,"So your case, your entire case, is based on whether or not there's consent to dealing with the tribe by the nonmember?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,420.52,423.394,"Well, I think it goes further than that."
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,430.44,432.796,Who would consent to be taxed?
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,443.059,456.427,"--Well, but by engaging in commerce on the reservation and by, you know... and this Court has addressed it in a number of taxation decisions regarding Indian law, the... there is a quid pro quo for--"
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.427,458.301,But that's different from consent.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,466.128,472.016,"--But that... you know, in the taxation context, I think that is the price of doing business."
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,472.016,482.588,"No, but if that kind of implicit consent applies in the tax context, I don't see why in theory it doesn't apply in the situation we've got here."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,482.588,483.73,Well--
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,483.73,500.221,"If somebody is going to do business with the tribe, with tribal members, in a way that affects the tribe on the reservation, it makes just as much sense to say, well, they implicitly consent not to discriminate against tribal members because of their Indian status."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,500.221,507.128,"--I think it is, you know, that consent under the first Montana exception can't be implicit."
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,508.672,514.544,"Well, I thought it was implicit in the tax situation, as you responded to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,514.544,519.121,"Well, I think we need to be specific about the taxation context."
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,524.601,524.808,All right.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,568.834,585.531,"I mean in that situation, if the tribe said, here is the licensing that we are going to impose on you for being a mechanic, and the mechanic then went to work at that gas station, knowing about that licensing requirement, I mean, that is... that is the sort of actual--"
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,585.531,585.921,Okay.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,588.733,590.467,--I think it comes--
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,590.467,594.433,"He doesn't sign a document saying ""I consent""; he just goes to work."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,615.893,626.031,"--Well, I don't know that I would... I would disagree that... I would say that those examples of consent of the licensing of the taxation are much closer to being actual consent."
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.092,634.309,"You don't really mean ""actual consent"" by ""actual consent"", right?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,634.902,636.696,"--Well, yes."
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.696,641.212,"Maybe you should use a different term, like ""implicit consent"", maybe."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,642.007,648.801,The... I think that there has to be a line drawn.
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,648.801,649.522,All right.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,670.326,679.618,"The reason where we would draw the line where I want to drawn it is that, you know, the discrimination claim that was made here ultimately turned out to be based on tribal common law."
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.34,717.744,"Oh, so one of your answers to an earlier question suggests the same point that you now seem to be making, although I don't... I don't recall it from your brief."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,739.169,749.26,"--If it had been a tribal antidiscrimination statute, there would have at least been the possibility of notice and the possibility of--"
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.26,750.867,That's not what I asked.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,757.754,770.33,"--I think what is required to bind a nonmember to tribal law is clear consent, and merely knowing about the tribal antidiscrimination--"
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,770.33,771.625,"Well, that doesn't make any difference."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,786.306,790.915,--I... I think that it does make a difference.
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,790.915,792.693,But you just told me it didn't.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,792.693,793.913,I think--
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,793.913,799.584,"You just told me that even if it were written down, you would still need what you think is express consent."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,799.584,806.814,--I think that that provides the clearest guidance for when tribal jurisdiction attaches or doesn't.
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,806.814,829.915,"Well, do you recognize that the bank was on notice, at least that it was a Federal requirement that when you deal with individual Indians or what this loan company was, it was an organization of Indians... that's what the Federal law calls it... there is a duty of fair dealing?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,832.897,840.817,"That is so, but, you know, we're not here to, you know... the Federal courts don't provide a substantive review on the merits."
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,846.658,858.041,But it's not... it's not uncommon that a State would adopt a Federal standard as its... as its own on a question of civil rights.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,867.493,868.788,No.
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.917,898.573,But it is an organization of Indians?
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,898.573,901.353,--It is closely held by tribal members.
2007.07-411,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,906.087,913.986,Can a State distinguish when it grants a corporation status between non-Indian and Indian corporations.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,913.986,915.285,--I don't believe so.
2007.07-411,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,915.285,917.847,Can you incorporate under tribal law.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,917.847,920.655,You cannot incorporate under tribal law.
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.655,935.808,"Wasn't part of the transaction the obtaining of back-up liability on the part of the individual Indians who, who owned the corporation?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,938.417,943.116,You have to be specific about the loan guarantees and the contracts that we are talking about.
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.763,973.15,"No, but it does give the whole thing a decided flavor of dealing with, with Indians on the reservation."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,981.335,984.802,I believe it is certainly 51 percent.
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.802,985.27,Yes.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,985.27,986.194,There is a question about whether it's more.
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.194,991.771,"And then you get guarantees from, on reservation Indians."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1016.852,1028.286,There is no question that this whole question would have been avoided had there been a choice of forum selection that placed the dispute resolution squarely in South Dakota courts.
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.363,1042.781,"In the absence of that, why should we bend over backwards to give something that has the smell of dealing with the Indians any other name?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1048.482,1055.82,"--I think that in the face of silence in the contract, the general rule controls rather than its exceptions."
2007.07-411,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1055.82,1057.743,"Well, your clients could they fully protect themselves."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1063.928,1070.58,If the tribe or if the tribal members sought to enforce that?
2007.07-411,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1070.58,1070.986,Right.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1080.657,1099.335,"Well, I think it's the question of who the plaintiff is if the Long Family Land and Cattle Company, the South Dakota corporation, had had a contract with the bank that said your forum for dispute resolution is South Dakota courts, and the Long Family Land and Cattle Company had commenced an action in South Dakota courts, I think the dispute could have been resolved there."
2007.07-411,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1099.335,1101.741,"Even if it... well, that's if it's a contract claim."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1108.846,1110.862,That's a more difficult question.
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1140.864,1142.319,Is it a contract claim?
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1142.319,1143.707,Is it a--
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.707,1145.189,Is it a contract claim?
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1154.408,1154.923,--No.
2007.07-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.249,1159.31,"It's a freestanding tort action, is that what it was?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1159.31,1160.873,--It is a freestanding tort action.
2007.07-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.873,1166.434,Would the... would the jurisdiction issue be any different if it were a contract claim?
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1176.787,1181.178,"Well, we have to look at, you know, who were the contracting parties."
2007.07-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.424,1195.469,"Well, we would assume that the corporation had a breach of contract claim, could they have sued in tribal court?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1195.469,1203.495,I don't think that the Long Family and Cattle Company appropriately was a plaintiff in tribal court to sue on breach of contract.
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1203.495,1205.012,Did they--
2007.07-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.012,1206.619,The question isn't whether that was an appropriate plaintiff.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1211.181,1214.617,I don't think so without some sort of consent to hearing that.
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1214.617,1221.502,--I thought that the bank... I thought that the Long Company was a plaintiff in the tribal court?
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1221.502,1224.236,The Long Company was a plaintiff in the tribal court.
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1224.236,1232.983,"And as I understand it, the Long Company asserted, along with the individuals, contract claims?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1232.983,1233.966,That's correct.
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1233.966,1239.043,But the Long Company did not make a tort claim?
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1239.043,1240.263,That's correct.
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1240.263,1263.52,"So why isn't this judgment, even if you're right about the individuals in the tort claim, why isn't this judgment good at least as to the contract claim, which are not challenging and which runs to the benefit of the Long Company which has nothing to do with the tort claim that you are challenging?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1263.52,1265.891,Because of the way that the case was tried.
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1350.405,1366.272,"Mr. Banker, you several times have raised a point which seems to me to go to the nature of the first exception in Montana on an issue we haven't discussed yet, and I want to get clear on it."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1472.974,1490.124,"Well, what Montana said, the actual language of Montana said a tribe may regulate through taxation, licensing or other means the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealings, contracts, leases or other arrangements."
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1490.124,1495.888,"So the consensual relationship is what you just said, contracts, leases or other commercial."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1498.902,1520.49,"Well, I mean, my interpretation of that is... I mean, Montana in its first exception meant that the consent was in the consensual relationship, then any business dealings with the tribe or its members would result in tribal ability to regulate, and that hasn't been the case, as this Court has, you know, decided--"
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1520.49,1540.604,"But the point of my question was do you agree that there... within the... the description of the exception in Montana, that there need not be a consent, either to the regulation or to an adjudicatory jurisdiction to enforce the regulation?"
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1540.604,1550.524,"--Not in the actual language of Montana, but in reading Strate and in reading Hicks and in reading Atkinson Trading Company, that is my interpretation of the--"
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1550.524,1553.632,So you're saying the Montana exception has been modified by later cases.
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1553.632,1554.661,--That is correct.
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1554.661,1555.098,Okay.
2007.07-411,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1555.098,1564.0,"Certainly not in Strate, which you quoted before as saying if you have jurisdiction to regulate, then have you jurisdiction to enforce the regulation."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1564.0,1567.502,"True, but I think Strate is an important part of that history."
2007.07-411,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1567.502,1598.722,"Well, I thought that your argument was that the general principle that was adopted in Montana is the tribal jurisdiction extends only to those things that are necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations, and that merely entering into consensual commercial transactions doesn't fall within that, but if one were to consent to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts, then that would be an additional basis for jurisdiction."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1600.129,1601.502,I believe that's correct.
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1601.502,1605.062,But if that's your argument what's left of the first exception?
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1605.062,1618.028,"Well, what's left of the first exception is certainly a tribal ability to regulate, and perhaps that's all."
2007.07-411,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1618.028,1651.247,"So the first... but as I understand it the first exception would have no independent application unless the second exception were met... were satisfied, i.e., there was a tribal need based on self-government, economic self-protection and so on which, which would in effect validate the tribe's attempt to regulate, which seems in effect to say that everything turns on the second exception, not the first."
2007.07-411,0,37696,paul_a_banker,,1651.247,1658.997,"Well, I think the first exception could still have meaning, in the sense that it grants the tribe the ability to regulate."
2007.07-411,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1676.455,1677.223,"Thank you, Counsel."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1684.328,1700.994,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address both standing and the merits, but because there are some additional wrinkles on the standing question in light of how it was briefed in the reply brief, I'd like to make three brief points on the merits before addressing standing."
2007.07-411,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1726.921,1731.574,"Well, they said they don't need to because they said if they win on their claim, then their whole case--"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1731.574,1740.523,"And I'll address that, Justice Ginsburg, on the general verdict point, which is there is actually some law of this which I would like to describe for the Court my understanding of."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1787.053,1790.395,Where do I look that up in tribal law?
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1790.395,1821.445,"Mr. Chief Justice, under tribal law number 1, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has adopted the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for procedure in the tribal courts, and under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 49, there are provisions for special verdicts and general verdicts, and Rule 49(a)(3) provides that if no specific objection is made to a fact or finding requested by the jury, it is waived."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1834.112,1836.627,I'm sorry; I don't understand.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1854.463,1856.085,"That's my point, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-411,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1901.035,1901.803,--There is no objection--
2007.07-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.803,1902.255,Wait.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1921.749,1923.59,"--Precisely so, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.59,1928.013,I don't know that they waive that when they when... when they allow a general verdict to go.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1928.013,1941.707,"The way cases say general verdicts should be deemed, if there is an invalid claim, there are competing views about what to do with that when the damages awarded is treated as a general verdict."
2007.07-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.158,1992.124,If evidence supports any one of the claims contained in the general rule.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1992.124,1992.876,--That's correct.
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2007.995,2008.931,Who wrote that?
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2011.992,2013.54,Chief Judge... I was about to say that.
2007.07-411,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2015.115,2018.347,--You're not asking us to resolve that circuit split in this case.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2018.347,2019.018,--No.
2007.07-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.438,2065.672,The tribal court of appeals would have to be finding Federal law.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2068.717,2069.28,--It is--
2007.07-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.28,2071.089,You say they have adopted the Federal rules.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2078.275,2078.79,--No.
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2106.745,2110.887,"And, presumably, tribal... whatever tribal precedent there may be, as well."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2110.887,2114.666,--That's correct although we have not been able to find precedent--
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2114.666,2117.524,"Well, neither could... and neither could anybody, right?"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2120.788,2122.504,"--Well, there are published decisions."
2007.07-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.128,2137.486,"Certainly, your reliance upon the Federal rules doesn't impress me as much as it did when you first told me about it, because apparently the Federal rules mean whatever the tribal courts say they mean; is that right?"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2137.486,2137.923,No.
2007.07-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.358,2143.187,And come to its own decision as to what they mean.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2143.187,2144.045,--Yes.
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2144.045,2152.432,"One of the points you mentioned earlier is that this is an Indian corporation, and that's a concept I don't understand."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2160.208,2165.659,I would like to beg the indulgence of the Court in not answering that question specifically.
2007.07-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.691,2169.906,And do we get special loan guarantees?
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.205,2181.246,"I understand the concept of a minority-owned or an Indian-owned corporation, but the point here is you are trying to say that the corporation is a member of the tribe."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2189.961,2191.135,"--Well, to the contrary, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2209.127,2223.123,How would a normal... I guess a non-Indian or non-Italian or non-Irish... corporation dealing with the Long Family Land and Cattle Company know that it was an Indian corporation--
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2223.123,2224.901,"--Well, I--"
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2224.901,2227.166,--putting apart the particulars in this case?
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2227.166,2235.445,"--Mr. Chief Justice, let me step back and say I'm not here to advocate that there can be different racial characteristics of corporations."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2250.688,2251.811,"Well, I know the BIA says that."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2262.091,2265.792,"Banks typically do require lots of documentation, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2265.792,2270.209,So they should have a check box on their loan application that says: Are you an Indian?
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2270.209,2278.254,"The difference here, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the bank required BIA loan guarantees as a condition of making the loans."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2278.254,2282.177,"I'm asking you about: In a general case, let's say they don't require BIA loan guarantees."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2284.86,2285.815,They did not.
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2289.516,2291.204,"Well, I am sure the facts here matter."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2307.805,2316.302,"I would acknowledge that when there are no BIA loan guarantees required, a bank may or may not know of the identity of the owners of the corporation."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2316.302,2324.674,"And do they subject themselves to tribal-court jurisdiction because they are dealing with, as you call it, an Indian corporation?"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2324.674,2327.032,"Without further facts, no."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2362.518,2366.843,"So that if the bank had two... two different types of loans, in one situation the corporation comes to the bank."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2389.99,2396.175,"--I think, in general, Mr. Chief Justice, I would agree with that hypothetical."
2007.07-411,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2412.748,2428.147,"Well, there are many facts here that are favorable to your position, but I would appreciate it if you could articulate the rule of law that you would like us to adopt in this case, the general principle that you would like... the general rule that you would like us to adopt."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2428.147,2437.345,"Justice Alito I don't think I can improve on the language that's in Montana in its first exception, itself, which is that there are consensual relations that are licensing of commercial--"
2007.07-411,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2437.345,2446.67,Can that be the case: Any consensual relationship between a member of the tribe and a nonmember is subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts?
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2446.67,2447.247,--No.
2007.07-411,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2456.622,2463.414,So an Indian goes to a bank off the reservation and asks for a loan and gets the loan.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2466.32,2467.318,No.
2007.07-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.128,2480.876,"Well, it has to be a known... a known consensual relationship, for one thing."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2482.907,2483.36,--Yes.
2007.07-411,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2483.36,2483.906,All right.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2491.074,2491.666,No.
2007.07-411,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2511.987,2514.845,"Well, isn't it necessary for there to be some kind of clear notice?"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2526.388,2532.245,I don't think that necessarily would give rise to the kind of consensual relationship that Montana was speaking about.
2007.07-411,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2532.245,2532.729,"Well, why not?"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2533.574,2543.116,"I think what's missing is the longevity of a relationship, the degree to which the cause of action arose out of the answering of that ad."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2544.992,2549.224,It's an odd sort of basis on which to predicate jurisdiction.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2553.533,2571.902,"--Well, I think that the necessary concomitant of having tribes with their elements of sovereignty residing within States and within the United States is to have somewhat less bright-line features to some of these jurisdictional principles."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2573.915,2574.402,You said earlier... I am sorry.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2578.196,2580.446,--Given the facts that are present in this case.
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2580.446,2580.899,"Yes, given the facts."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2589.115,2598.921,"Yes, it would although the court in National Farmers and in Iowa Mutual could have disposed of the case simply on a bright-line-rule basis but rejected that very notion."
2007.07-411,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2598.921,2611.728,"Do you think it's inherent in Montana exception number 1, that an Indian tribal court in the course of adjudicating commercial dealings has the capacity to elaborate common law?"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2611.728,2613.12,Yes.
2007.07-411,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2615.273,2617.101,To elaborate tribal common law.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2617.101,2618.51,--That's how I understood your--
2007.07-411,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2618.51,2619.274,Tribal common law?
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2619.274,2621.099,"--Yes, that's how I understood Justice Kennedy's question."
2007.07-411,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2623.13,2627.584,And you think that's necessary for regulating consensual relationships?
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2627.584,2629.409,"--I think that, yes, it can be."
2007.07-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2642.261,2643.481,He backed off on that.
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2646.62,2660.164,"--Well, my... my mission here is that the bank did not avail itself of any of the procedures in Rule 12 to clarify the source of the law, to move to dismiss the discrimination claim, to move for summary judgment on the discrimination claim."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2660.164,2673.439,"What about... what about their point that, under our system, governing is based on the consent of the governed, and in this case the bank has no role to play in the nature or establishment of the court to which they are being subjected?"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2673.439,2681.061,"Well, in this particular case, Your Honor, this bank has availed itself purposefully of tribal courts on at least 14 occasions."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2689.009,2689.446,"Well, and I suppose--"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2689.446,2692.276,"This is not a stranger to the tribal court, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-411,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2692.276,2694.148,"--Well, suppose it were the first occasion?"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2696.242,2697.256,My point is--
2007.07-411,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2697.256,2699.741,"In other words, if you go... if you make a mistake 14 times, you're bound to 15?"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2701.147,2706.22,"--No, I'm saying that the availment of the tribal court is what creates the jurisdiction."
2007.07-411,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2734.414,2754.469,"Mr. Frederick, before you finish, I would like for to you give your best answer to a lurking, underlying concern, and that is the the Chief Justice brought up the outsider subjected to courts where the outsider has no vote."
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2777.3,2782.082,"I have two suggested responses to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-411,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2807.884,2810.93,Not the same faith and credit that it would give to a sister State judgment?
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2810.93,2811.523,--That's correct.
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2818.83,2829.328,"Well, what if the tribal law has certain cultural principles such as fairness and equity of a sort that aren't recognized under Federal or State law in this type of contractual relationship?"
2007.07-411,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2833.419,2864.501,"The way the South Dakota statute is worded, Mr. Chief Justice, unfortunately, I can't give you a direct answer to that because it involves a panoply of issues whether State law deems the final judgment ultimately to be a fair one and... and, importantly, when this Court recognized the jurisdictional point as giving rise to Federal jurisdiction in National Farmers, I would submit it also perhaps created the avenue for the enforcement of judgments to be brought in Federal court as well."
2007.07-411,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2888.974,2890.117,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2898.926,2912.841,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: This court's Montana framework confirms that Indian tribes can, in some circumstances, exercise legitimate authority over nonmembers and nonmember land on their reservations."
2007.07-411,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2936.283,2939.22,"Well, that may be; it depends on what you mean by ""tribal""."
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2966.693,2979.314,"Well, Justice Scalia, that's of course true, that there is a difference, but the Montana framework recognizes that the political branches have not completely divested tribes of their jurisdiction over nonmembers in circumstances like this."
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2979.86,2989.948,"Well, you agree with your friend Mr. Frederick that Montana did not address jurisdiction over a nonmember and that this would be the first case in which we'd recognize such jurisdiction?"
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2989.948,2998.056,"--Well, it did not specifically address any previous cases involving jurisdiction over a nonmember defendant who is hailed into Federal court."
2007.07-411,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.056,2998.758,"Defendant, yes."
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2998.758,3013.985,"But I think it is... it is the case that it clearly recognized a consensual relationship that is established before the lawsuit begins is what provides for regulatory jurisdiction in some of the cases and adjudicatory jurisdiction, as is now clear from Strate and the Court's subsequent decisions."
2007.07-411,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3013.985,3020.158,"In your view, does jurisdiction follow all regulatory authority?"
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3027.668,3028.089,Well--
2007.07-411,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3028.089,3030.261,--in civil cases?
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3030.261,3036.369,"--Well, in Iowa Mutual, this Court did state that tribal courts are best qualified to interpret and apply tribal law."
2007.07-411,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3037.258,3048.472,"In your position, is regulatory jurisdiction concomitant with civil judicial jurisdiction in the tribal court?"
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3048.472,3050.379,"--Generally, yes."
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3050.379,3062.062,"What happens if the bank deals with a corporation that is not an Indian corporation, and then that... the shareholders of that corporation sell their shares to Indians?"
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3062.062,3063.092,Well--
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3063.092,3068.356,Does the bank now have a consensual relationship with an Indian corporation?
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3068.356,3090.988,"--Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, to expand upon the discussion that you were having with Mr. Frederick, that the consensual relationship that's necessary to establish jurisdiction in the sense of Montana's first exception requires not only that there be a consensual relationship with a member, and which we do think that implicit in that is some knowledge at least objective knowledge that you knew you were dealing with a tribal member."
2007.07-411,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3107.043,3108.525,You would add on the reservation?
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3108.966,3110.354,"Yes, absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-411,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3111.212,3117.771,"--If he walks into some town in South Dakota, the mere fact that you know he's an Indian... it has to be on the reservation."
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3117.771,3124.409,"--Absolutely, Justice Scalia, and that follows directly from the terms in Montana itself because Montana says that the exceptions are are about instances of, quote,"
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3129.735,3134.827,"Well, but the only reason... the only reason the bank is on the reservation is because the land was collateral, right?"
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3134.827,3135.919,The only reason--
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3135.919,3146.709,"They didn't want to buy land on a reservation; they wanted to make a loan and get the interest or whatever, and it just turned out that the Indians defaulted, and therefore they were left with a land on a reservation."
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3147.961,3151.678,"--Well, everything about this transaction is related to the reservation."
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3161.832,3174.965,"So if it's a different... the Indian... the corporation is owned by members on the reservation, the collateral they put up is off the reservation, is there consensual dealings with the corporation then?"
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3174.965,3185.275,"Well, the thing that's key here, I believe, is that the subject of the contract was intimately connected with the reservation itself, and that's why it comes within Montana's discussion of civil jurisdiction."
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3185.275,3190.224,"Yes, but the subject of the contract is loan to a corporation owned by Indians on the reservation."
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3197.91,3202.5,"Without any further facts, no, I don't think that would be enough to establish jurisdiction."
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3210.888,3214.432,"I guess, what I meant, what do you mean by the subject of the contract?"
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3214.432,3217.368,"--Well, the loan here was for specific purposes."
2007.07-411,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3259.712,3267.208,"Am I correct that the collateral here, the land, the land that was collateral was within the reservation but it was not Indian land."
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3267.208,3269.895,"Well, that's generally correct, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-411,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3285.876,3287.514,And you think that that's enough.
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3298.604,3306.961,The thing that triggers the regulation here or the jurisdictional authority of the tribe is the consensual relationship with the tribal member.
2007.07-411,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3312.755,3313.457,"No, no, wait."
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3337.619,3339.323,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-411,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3342.115,3347.957,"Does ""on the land"" mean... ""on the reservation"" mean land on the reservation or does it extend any further than that?"
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3347.957,3350.896,--I... I... I can't say--
2007.07-411,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3350.896,3357.096,Let's say an Indian gets an auto loan for a vehicle to be used in a business on the reservation.
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3358.609,3372.028,"--In general, the sale of goods off the reservation, unless there is some particularly intimate connection with the reservation that... that the parties anticipate at the time, probably isn't going to be enough to trigger jurisdiction."
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3372.636,3376.119,What about a home equity loan for home on the reservation.
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3376.119,3377.495,--For a home that's on the reservation?
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3377.495,3378.041,Yes.
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3378.041,3380.806,And it's for remodeling the home--
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3380.806,3382.038,Whatever home equity loans are for.
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3382.038,3383.473,--Yes.
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3397.063,3403.248,"Well, they are going to add... add a new wing onto the... new room on to their home."
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3403.248,3405.279,And that's an example where I do think that--
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3405.279,3414.51,"So if Chase Manhattan gets a home equity loan application from somebody and they grant the home equity loan, they are now subject to being sued in tribal court?"
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3414.51,3427.772,"--If they know that they are dealing with a member and they have not included any forum selection or choice of law provisions that say that they want to be sued and resolve disputes in some other forum, then it may well be the case that they will be sued in tribal court."
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3427.772,3432.175,What if the tribal court has a rule that forum selection provisions are not enforceable?
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3432.175,3447.09,"Well, I think it's probably unlikely that the tribal courts would... or that the tribe would adopt a rule like that, because as a pragmatic matter it would make it more difficult for their citizens to engage in business relationships if they had a categorical ban like that."
2007.07-411,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3448.637,3456.523,But then could you go into Federal court under what was in farmers and say we had no jurisdiction because we had a forum selection clause?
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3456.523,3464.833,--I... if... if there was a forum that would be a question about the nature of the underlyng consent.
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3473.439,3491.681,Does the judgment here that the bank discriminated against the Indian corporation because they didn't give them as favorable terms as they gave someone who hadn't defaulted on a loan impede dealings with Indian corporations by outside members... outside nonmembers?
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3491.681,3503.52,"Well, as was pointed out earlier, Mr. Chief Justice, the... the... the only duties that the bank was exposed to here were a duty not to breach contracts and not to discriminate."
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3506.16,3509.455,What was the basis for the finding of discrimination?
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3509.455,3520.062,It was the... under... according to the jury instruction it was a person or entity denied a privilege to a person based solely upon that person's race or tribal identity.
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3520.062,3526.902,It had nothing to do... the bank's justification had nothing to do with the fact that the entity had defaulted earlier?
2007.07-411,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3526.902,3529.807,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2007.07-411,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3532.368,3533.538,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.07-411,3,37696,paul_a_banker,,3535.913,3551.016,"I think when you step back in listening to the arguments of opposing counsel, you know, what is the other way that tribal courts get... that the tribes get jurisdiction over nonmembers?"
2007.07-411,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3615.022,3624.003,"What general principle underscores the validity of your point that it's... is it a republican form of government law, Due Process Clause?"
2007.07-411,3,37696,paul_a_banker,,3636.887,3643.447,"--I think that the... you know, the tribal courts stand outside of the Federal... of the Federal-State relationship."
2007.07-411,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3649.557,3651.678,Due process for whom?
2007.07-411,3,37696,paul_a_banker,,3656.693,3659.255,"Well, that's exactly the point."
2007.07-411,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3661.567,3671.842,What is... what is the constitutional prohibition that is a restriction on assigning cases to a court that does not follow the Due Process Clause if it's an Indian court?
2007.07-411,3,37696,paul_a_banker,,3677.84,3685.382,I think the difference is the constitutional protections of nonmembers do not apply down to tribal courts.
2007.07-411,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3685.382,3687.894,"Thank you, counsel."
