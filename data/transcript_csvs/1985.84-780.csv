1985.84-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,4.155,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Bowen, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, against Roy."
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,6.732,25.709,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of two federal statutes that require applicants for welfare benefits to provide the government with their social security numbers as a condition on receiving those benefits."
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.139,170.963,"Mr. Geller, the Court below found that the claim was based on a sincere religious belief."
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,181.474,184.175,My comment was simply to explain Roy's testimony.
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.497,207.057,"Well, do you challenge in this Court the finding of the District Court:"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,207.057,207.854,"No, we have not."
1985.84-780,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,213.101,223.738,"--Mr. Geller, I gather in fact the number of Little Bird of the Snow had been at some stage given to the government."
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,223.738,224.457,"Well, yes."
1985.84-780,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,225.799,226.049,Sorry.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,226.049,233.032,"I am sure as this Court is aware from reading the briefs, there are a number of peculiar aspects to this case."
1985.84-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.778,333.898,How could the District Court have enjoined the government from failing to provide Social Security based on the failure to have furnished the number if the number had already been applied for?
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,333.898,339.865,--The District Court enjoyed the government from using or disseminating the number that we already had.
1985.84-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.672,352.843,What was the District Court's response to that?
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,352.843,356.248,The District Court's response was not much of a response.
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,462.986,482.478,"Well, Mr. Geller, didn't the court's findings below say that exempting Little Bird of the Snow from use of the Social Security requirement could be accomplished in this case without any increased expenditures to the government and could be done effectively?"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,482.478,485.008,"--Yes, we think that is the wrong question."
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,485.008,486.242,And you say that is the wrong test.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,486.242,486.945,The wrong test.
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,505.718,517.682,"Well, certainly language in Sherbert against Werner and Thomas against the Review Board cut in the direction of making an individual--"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,517.682,528.928,"--I think, Justice O'Connor, that case like Sherbert are explainable by the fact that the Court there found and I think quite correctly that there was a less restrictive alternative available to the government in those cases."
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,554.621,556.495,"--Well, isn't that what the court here said?"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,556.495,558.524,"No, I believe not, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,716.711,724.271,How many people in the country have Social Security Numbers but are not involved in the Social Security program?
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,725.88,728.971,"This record doesn't reflect that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,728.971,729.862,There are millions of people who--
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,729.862,735.953,There are three... I think the record shows that there are about 383 million active Social Security Numbers.
1985.84-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,741.609,744.747,"--For a population of 240 million, that is quite a number."
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,746.326,758.382,"There are some dead people, yes, who... once you get a Social Security Number, Justice Rehnquist, that account never becomes dormant, and that number is never given to anybody else, even if the recipient is deceased."
1985.84-780,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,758.382,768.346,"Mr. Geller, if you give your license, driver's license a number, you give his Social Security Number, don't you?"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,768.346,770.518,"Yes, in most jurisdictions you have to."
1985.84-780,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,770.518,781.591,"So if the government asked that anybody asking for this age shall show their driver's license, you would be in just as much trouble, wouldn't you?"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,781.591,788.762,"Well, the problem if we only have the driver's license is that we couldn't access a number of these other record systems that don't use the driver's license."
1985.84-780,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,790.104,792.868,But the driver's license gives your Social Security Number.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,792.868,794.821,"--Well, we don't get the actual driver's license."
1985.84-780,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,805.441,809.003,"Well, my driver's license has my Social Security Number--"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,809.003,809.704,Well--
1985.84-780,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,809.704,810.47,--written on the license.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,810.47,813.219,"--I understand that, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1985.84-780,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,813.219,814.297,That is what I am talking about.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,814.297,815.297,What I am saying is--
1985.84-780,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,815.297,816.405,What is the difference between that end--
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,816.405,823.497,--just having their driver's license number and not their Social Security Number would not allow access to any other data system other than the Motor Vehicle Bureau.
1985.84-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,823.497,829.495,"--What Justice Marshall is talking about is, in Virginia your driver's license number is your Social Security Number."
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,829.495,830.713,"Well, I think it is the same way in the District of Columbia."
1985.84-780,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,841.505,843.566,All you want is the Social Security Number.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,843.566,844.066,Yes.
1985.84-780,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.066,846.143,"Well, you get it off the driver's license."
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,846.143,855.108,"Well, the problem, Justice Marshall, is that I think Mr. Roy would have a First Amendment objection to giving the driver's license number if it was a unique personal identifier."
1985.84-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,855.108,857.106,"Well, his daughter wasn't old enough to drive anyway."
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,860.527,863.511,That is why we couldn't use a driver's license number in this case.
1985.84-780,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,863.511,874.929,"Mr. Geller, as a matter of fact, has Little Bird of the Snow or whatever her name is in receiving AFDC benefits?"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,874.929,876.913,"Well, when you first apply--"
1985.84-780,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,876.913,878.646,"Her parents applied for them, and--"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,878.646,880.177,--The parents applied for it and--
1985.84-780,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,880.177,882.566,--Have they included her in the application?
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,882.566,883.082,"--Yes, they have."
1985.84-780,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,883.082,885.471,So she has been receiving benefits.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,885.471,892.109,"She received it for a few months until it was determined that they had not gotten... as soon as you apply you get the benefits, and then there is a verification."
1985.84-780,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,901.979,902.354,I see.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,911.82,917.491,"No, the application said that she didn't have the number, and we took their word for that--"
1985.84-780,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,917.491,918.505,I see.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,918.505,921.613,"--until it was determined at the trial, in fact, when some question was raised."
1985.84-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.99,1153.598,"In the days when Prince was decided, was the Court speaking then in terms of less restrictive alternatives?"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1153.598,1157.097,"I believe that was the analysis that the Court applied, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1311.315,1328.497,"Well, Mr. Geller, regardless of that argument, the District Court did find that the government's interest in preventing Little Bird of the Snow from fraudulently receiving welfare benefits can be satisfied without requiring use of her Social Security Number."
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1328.497,1335.961,"I think that that conclusion, first of all, doesn't follow from the fact findings that the District Court just made about how there are no less restrictive alternatives."
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1336.29,1338.054,"Well, it was one of its findings in--"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1338.054,1340.647,"--I think, Justice O'Connor, that it is not one of its findings."
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1342.037,1342.912,--Number 77.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1342.912,1350.19,--The District Court found that we could... that there is not going to be any withdrawal here.
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1353.861,1356.157,"Well, I was simply reading from one of its findings."
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1356.157,1363.966,"--Justice O'Connor, if I could refer the Court on Page 19A of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement, I think this is the District Court's conclusion."
1985.84-780,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1403.887,1414.085,"May I just ask, Mr. Geller, do you think there is any significant difference between the issue in this case and the issue we had in that driver's license case where the party didn't want to have a picture--"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1414.085,1416.304,I think the analysis is precisely the same.
1985.84-780,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.24,1472.983,"--May I ask you... maybe this is a little bit too theoretical, but suppose computer technology developed to the extent that they could use letters in the name and do all the things you can do with numbers, and so all you had to do was use letters for Little Bird of the Snow, but the statute still required numbers."
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1476.279,1483.792,I think it could be shown that there was a less restrictive alternative such as the use of letters that was equally as good in achieving the government's interest.
1985.84-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.834,1505.673,"Well, Mr. Geller, what if in addition to the fact that Justice Stevens has it could be shown that it would cost the government $10 billion to convert from numbers to letters."
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1507.22,1514.296,"--Then, of course, we would take the position that only a reasonable less restrictive alternative can be imposed on the government."
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1575.693,1584.455,"Mr. Geller, do you think that administrative efficiency in every case must prevail over a free exercise claim?"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1584.455,1584.689,--Absolutely not.
1985.84-780,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1584.689,1588.671,Your argument certainly sounds as though that is your position.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1588.671,1589.671,"No, efficiency, as I said, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-780,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1637.105,1641.151,"Do you think you could require a date of baptism, a baptismal certificate?"
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1643.462,1645.555,"Yes, I am sure we can and do require--"
1985.84-780,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.555,1648.335,Say somebody had an objection to revealing whether or not they were baptized.
1985.84-780,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1648.335,1658.002,"--Well, once again, Justice Stevens, it may well be that if we had the Social Security Number, we could find out everything we needed even without the date of birth or the date of baptism."
1985.84-780,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1678.886,1684.852,Mr. Gildin.
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,1684.852,1713.996,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before this Court today are the parents of now five-year-old Little Bird of the Snow Roy, whose religion, founded in native American beliefs, tells them that in order to preserve their daughter's spiritual purity, they may not provide a Social Security Number for her even if it means foregoing necessary welfare benefits."
1985.84-780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.821,1852.145,"Well, Mr. Gildin, what do you say to your opponent's comment about the opinion of the Court at Page 19A that he quoted from that last paragraph carrying over to Page 20 where the Court says,"
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,1863.375,1888.052,"That was made after discrete findings by the District Court that searches can be done of all federal files that are relevant without the Social Security Number, that searches could be done intrastate of all files without the Social Security Number, that notwithstanding the government's representations, the District Court was not persuaded that interstate searches, searches of whether an individual is receiving benefits in two states."
1985.84-780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1888.052,1893.816,But certainly that sentence suggests that the District Court says there may be a little problem but we will just have to live with it.
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,1893.816,1902.14,"I think, Justice Rehnquist, that follows its findings that it was not persuaded by the government's evidence that such interstate searches would be impossible."
1985.84-780,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1945.388,1959.976,Does the belief of this person on this particular faith have any problem with accepting any benefits out of a system that is tainted by the use of numbers for the other people who are in it?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,1959.976,1962.397,"No, it does not, Chief Justice Burger."
1985.84-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.026,2020.017,"May I ask, Mr. Gildin, on this question, religions sometimes have a way of captivating the interest of large numbers of people very suddenly, and supposing there were to become a large number of people who subscribed to the same view about the harmful effects of numbers, so you had instead of one family, you had maybe 10,000 or 15,000 families with the same objection."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2023.047,2030.841,"It may, but based upon particular factual differences here, the District Court considered, I think properly, that that is not likely to occur."
1985.84-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.742,2046.054,"Well, I understand the improbability, but that really wasn't my question."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2051.926,2061.11,If in fact the government could show that in fact what would happen as in the Lee case is that we would be besieged by a number of requests for exemptions.
1985.84-780,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2200.382,2220.0,"Wasn't that simply a result of the fact that in a system dealing with millions and millions of people, they don't catch up with all of these details the way it would happen with the local corner grocery store if there were something like that happening?"
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2220.0,2228.402,The system as described by the government's own witnesses would be that in fact the computer verification would have been done within that nine-month period of time.
1985.84-780,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2233.681,2235.726,Do you think they should defer the benefits?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2246.192,2247.144,"No, we are not."
1985.84-780,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2446.408,2455.123,"Doesn't that suggest that even at best, with all the modern computer technology, the handling of these matters is quite difficult?"
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2455.123,2474.787,"The handling of these matters is quite difficult in all circumstances, and we don't contest that fraud is in fact a significant concern as a general proposition, but as the District Court found, the government's interest in preventing fraud can in fact be accomplished without requiring the Social Security Number for these religious objectors."
1985.84-780,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2517.754,2545.102,"Mr. Gildin, on that point, it is a bit anomalous, though, to suggest that if there were many such claims based on broadly held religious views, that the analysis or the result might somehow differ, but if there were only a few such beliefs, then the result you asked for should be accorded more weight."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2549.427,2554.66,What the government contends is anomalous we suggest makes constitutional common sense.
1985.84-780,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2558.237,2565.062,You don't think there is an obligation to accommodate widespread religious beliefs?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2565.062,2568.78,We think an accommodation ought to be made to the extent possible.
1985.84-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2707.101,2713.567,"May I ask another question, Mr. Gildin, about the ramifications of your prevailing in the case?"
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2734.651,2740.868,The parties seeking an exemption must certainly establish that his belief is both religious and sincerely held.
1985.84-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.146,2753.129,So that somebody in the department would have the authority to pass on the sincerity of the application?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2753.129,2757.565,"Precisely, and that was done in this case with no special training, interestingly enough."
1985.84-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2802.81,2808.31,At least do we have to assure that there would be a hearing of that magnitude on every application?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2808.31,2813.135,--Certainly the applicant must establish that his belief is both religious and sincere.
1985.84-780,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2816.868,2821.272,"Professor Gildin, get me on the track."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2833.799,2834.627,That is correct.
1985.84-780,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2834.627,2851.76,What right does Little Bird of the Snow or her parents who do not object to the use of their own Social Security Numbers have to prevent the government from using information it has?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2851.76,2864.973,"I think in order to answer that question, Justice Blackmun, we have to identify how the government came into the possession of this number, and this was no surprise revelation to Mr. Roy or anyone else at the conclusion of this trial."
1985.84-780,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2884.372,2886.839,"Oh, it was application?"
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2886.839,2887.667,Application.
1985.84-780,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2887.667,2890.651,What she signed did not include the Social Security Number?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2890.651,2891.774,"No, it did not."
1985.84-780,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2910.346,2915.265,"Well, granting all that, there is a number outstanding, and the government has it."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2920.686,2929.917,The government's proposed use of the number places the very burden on the Roys' religion that this Court has found... has condemned in both Sherbert--
1985.84-780,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2929.917,2937.522,"That is on the child's religion, not on the parents', because apparently they are not concerned about the use of their own Social Security Numbers."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,2937.522,2952.001,"--No, they are concerned now as to the use of the child's, and certainly at age 2 Little Bird of the Snow is not in a position to say, I have articulated my religious beliefs and consequently I don't think you should use it, nor can she do so at age 5."
1985.84-780,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2995.593,3001.669,So that one's religious belief can dictate what somebody else does with information in his possession.
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3001.669,3009.992,"Certainly to that... to the extent that that information when used would affect the individual's religion, and in this case have the potency to--"
1985.84-780,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3009.992,3034.421,"Well, for example, suppose somebody has the view that the use of cocaine or heroin in a religious exercise is important to them, and the government in its effort to prohibit traffic in cocaine is aware of the use of it by this individual."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3041.966,3045.995,"--No, we do not claim the right to free exercise of religion to be absolute."
1985.84-780,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3083.495,3091.413,"Well, the interest in preventing fraud in welfare programs is likewise compelling, is it not?"
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3091.413,3093.71,If it is--
1985.84-780,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3093.71,3095.303,"You don't dispute that, do you?"
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3095.303,3102.097,--Not if in fact it was demonstrated that there was the risk of fraud presented that would in fact undermine or make the statutory scheme unworkable.
1985.84-780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.416,3136.005,"Well, if it did undermine it, the court below could not have found that there was a less restrictive alternative."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3136.005,3148.327,"That is certainly correct, and we disagree with the government's attempt to challenge those findings, first, today, by saying that those findings are not there, and in its brief, we submit, by saying those findings are clearly erroneous when quit obviously--"
1985.84-780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3148.327,3149.734,"Mr. Gildin, I tried once."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3171.288,3176.207,"--The religion says, Justice Marshall, that they would not allow it to happen to themselves."
1985.84-780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3185.454,3189.312,And does he continue to use it?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3189.312,3196.889,"He does, because under his religion once extensive use has been made, that part of your spirit has been robbed, and there is no way to retrieve it."
1985.84-780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3196.889,3200.276,"Well, the daughter's had been used for nine months."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3200.276,3202.542,The daughter's--
1985.84-780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3202.542,3206.195,Why doesn't that put the daughter in the same place as him?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3206.195,3214.412,"--The evidence is that the daughter's number has never been used, that the government in that nine-month period of time did not use her number."
1985.84-780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3226.642,3232.514,"If you leave that number there ""dormant"", you have no case."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3232.514,3233.607,--I am sorry.
1985.84-780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3233.607,3242.213,"If the government leaves that number there ""dormant"", you have no case."
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3242.213,3248.101,"If they are willing to provide the benefits while leaving that number dormant, we would not be here today because there would be no burden--"
1985.84-780,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3248.101,3250.896,"But just to leave it there doesn't affect you at all, does it?"
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3250.896,3256.3,"--If that number would remain dormant, that would not undermine his religious beliefs."
1985.84-780,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3264.969,3267.813,Let me go back to the question Justice Blackmun put to you.
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3291.738,3295.393,"Under the free exercise clause of the Constitution, they cannot."
1985.84-780,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3300.579,3306.968,It isn't very private when you get it in the mail with a number on it any more than the Social Security benefits with a number on it.
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3306.968,3307.671,I agree--
1985.84-780,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3307.671,3310.153,What is the public use that you object to?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3310.153,3312.574,--It is the extensive use by the government.
1985.84-780,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3335.097,3340.422,Then suppose they take this dormant Social Security Number and use that.
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3343.265,3348.403,The injunction we have obtained would preclude Sears Roebuck from getting that Social Security Number.
1985.84-780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.663,3379.657,"Well, Mr. Gildin, if you put together the express findings with the opinion, the discussion, do you really think the District Court held that there was an equally effective, less restrictive element in there?"
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3379.657,3381.297,What we lose by not--
1985.84-780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3381.297,3382.687,Yes or no?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3382.687,3383.062,--No.
1985.84-780,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3389.356,3390.528,I don't know.
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3404.053,3406.272,"--I disagree respectfully, Justice White."
1985.84-780,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3439.632,3443.116,May I ask another hypothetical question?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3471.167,3479.336,"If she would have the objection, and I can't speak to that, this case would not preclude the government automatically from requiring the number."
1985.84-780,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3479.93,3480.71,Why not?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3480.71,3484.958,--Because we would have to engage in the analysis in this different program that was used here.
1985.84-780,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3491.736,3503.278,But you are saying that her position is that the use of any number that may result in benefit directly or indirectly to her is forbidden by her religion?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3503.278,3508.355,"No, I believe the objection is the use of the Social Security Number as the unique identifier--"
1985.84-780,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3508.355,3510.853,But not a military identification number?
1985.84-780,1,25385,gary_s_gildin,,3510.853,3515.383,"--I can't speak to that, because the objection... they have not been presented with that situation."
1985.84-780,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3539.764,3540.967,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Geller?"
1985.84-780,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3540.967,3544.215,"Not unless the Court has any questions, Mr. Justice."
1985.84-780,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3544.215,3544.887,"Thank you, gentlemen."
