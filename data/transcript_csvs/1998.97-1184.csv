1998.97-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.66,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97 1184, the National Federation of Federal Employees v. The Department of the Interior, and a companion case."
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,12.719,17.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,35.854,46.522,Didn't the agency at one time have a different position and then changed its position just as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit?
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,46.522,55.599,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Federal Labor Relations Authority indeed did originally come down on the opposite side of this question in its IRS I decision."
1998.97-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,69.006,73.2,How much choice did it have in the light of the court of appeals decision?
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,73.2,82.747,"The Authority has in several cases, Your Honor, chosen to nonacquiesce in a court of appeals decision with which it disagreed."
1998.97-1184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,102.96,110.042,Are the terms and the substance of the reconsideration set forth on remand from the agency in the IRS case?
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,122.932,140.474,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, the Authority has, on numerous occasions, subsequent to its IRS II decision in 1987, adhered to the position it took in IRS II and determined that mid term collective bargaining is required under the statute."
1998.97-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.268,177.352,"Mr. Smith, you're here representing the Authority which is, as I recollect, three individuals, no more than two of whom can be from the same political party, appointed for 5 years and not removable except for cause."
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,177.352,178.07,That's correct.
1998.97-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.07,190.0,"And also appearing is... in today's argument is the Solicitor General, who, I suppose, is appearing on behalf of the President of the United States."
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,190.0,196.412,"Well, he will, of course, tell you on whose behalf he is appearing."
1998.97-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,198.225,214.054,"Well, so we have a disagreement between these three individuals and the President of the United States regarding a statute that goes to the internal management of the personnel of the executive branch."
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,216.495,219.089,--I think we interpret the statute differently.
1998.97-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.49,229.243,And you want us to give deference to these three members of the Federal Labor Relations.
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,238.39,242.274,"--Well, there are several points raised there, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,269.853,286.553,"Mr. Smith, how could it be the will of the Executive, since the Executive is always an adversary in all the proceedings that are before the FLRA, so Congress set you up to be an arbiter between the unions and the Federal Executive."
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,286.553,297.281,"That is, of course, correct, Justice Ginsburg, and on the several occasions when we've had the privilege of being before the Court before, we are virtually always in opposition with agencies on--"
1998.97-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.281,298.501,I'm not questioning whether you're an arbiter.
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,356.01,363.146,"--Justice Scalia, I would only point out that the members of the Authority are on a quasi independent body."
1998.97-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,375.096,378.277,But Congress is not free to create any scheme of things it wishes.
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,388.515,407.625,"--Well, at the end of the day, Congress' statute has articulated several rights that Federal sector employees have when they bargain collectively under the statute, and if it is that we read the statute different from the agencies of Government, so be it."
1998.97-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.625,418.084,"Maybe the Pendleton Act, passed back in 1983, was unconstitutional, if Congress can't do anything to regulate the way the Executive deals with Federal employees."
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,418.084,425.387,"Well, clearly Congress can, Mr. Chief Justice, do things to regulate the way the Executive deals with its employees."
1998.97-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.788,436.195,"Well, it can tell them, as the Pendleton Act did, just what the President must do, but it can't tell the President to obey somebody else as to how he should treat Federal employees."
1998.97-1184,0,21550,david_m_smith,,436.974,455.707,"--Perhaps it is, but we are at this point reevaluating some 20 years of judicial review of Authority decisions, and disagreements between the Federal Labor Relations Authority and agencies of Government over what the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute requires are not rare."
1998.97-1184,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,1012.23,1032.405,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1184,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1569.446,1580.633,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1184,3,21550,david_m_smith,,3258.912,3272.162,The very first sentence of the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute notes that Congress has examined both the public and private sectors and has determined that collective bargaining is in the public interest.
