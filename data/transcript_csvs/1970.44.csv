1970.44,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.619,"We’ll hear arguments in number 44, Precunier against Atchley."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,18.479,23.401,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.44,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,786.251,797.643,Did Mr. Travers testify to the conversations which he had at the first visit in the cell block?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,797.643,799.091,"He did, Your Honor."
1970.44,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,799.091,801.271,Did he testify to the second also?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,801.271,811.28,"He testified to the second, and the tape recording of the second conversation was played to the jury."
1970.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,851.011,853.614,When was that section enacted?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,853.614,855.921,"November 2, 1966, Your Honor."
1970.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.921,859.376,What problems arose from that?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,859.376,879.484,"Your Honor, I am convinced that it was dissatisfaction with this Court’s decisions in Faye versus Noya and Townsend versus Sain, and the great expansion of the use of habeas corpus in the federal district courts to mount collateral attack on state criminal convictions."
1970.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,879.484,882.693,Did-- have you looked at the legislative history of that provision?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,882.693,883.573,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,883.573,886.854,Did it come through the judicial conference of the United States?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,886.854,888.187,"I believe it did ,Your Honor."
1970.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,888.187,889.822,Was it approved?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,889.822,890.89,I believe it did.
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,938.194,950.469,I don’t understand your observation that you thought the amendment to 2254 (d) reflected some congressional dissatisfaction with Townsend and Sain.
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,962.772,963.527,Mr. Justice Brennan.
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,963.527,965.659,It’s not a congressional acceptance of it?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,965.659,971.802,"Mr. Justice Brennan, it’s been suggested that 2254 (d) is a codification of Townsend versus Sain."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,971.802,973.345,"Well, it uses the identical language."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,973.345,974.565,"No, it doesn’t, Your Honor."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,974.565,974.954,It doesn’t?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,974.954,980.522,"In fact, the only thing that those two sections have in common is that criteria are present."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,981.623,985.127,Are the criteria any different from those laid down in Townsend and Sain?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,985.127,986.61,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1013.115,1015.966,Deleted or omitted?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1015.966,1017.427,"Omitted, Your Honor."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1017.427,1018.321,That would be the better--
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1018.321,1030.267,"It’s interesting to note though, that, contemporaneously, Congress amended 2244 which involved subsequent hearings on federal."
1970.44,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.267,1032.65,2255.
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1032.65,1033.035,Excuse me.
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1229.054,1234.795,"Mr. Granucci, may I just interrupt you there with some question."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1262.134,1262.824,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1262.824,1274.344,"Well, I don’t find that, in your brief, you’ve argued that our disposition back in 366 was tantamount to sustaining the Supreme Court of California."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1274.344,1274.689,We have--
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1274.689,1287.582,"What we said there was, after hearing oral argument and fully examining the record, we conclude that the totality of circumstances, as the record makes the manifest, did not warrant bringing the case here."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1295.358,1298.499,"Your Honor, I wish I could’ve argued that in the District Court."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1298.499,1298.633,"Well, I--"
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1298.633,1300.81,The reason I couldn’t is because--
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1300.81,1301.579,Why can’t you argue it here?
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1301.579,1304.365,"It’s a denial of certiorari, Your Honor."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1304.365,1305.165,"No, it’s not."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1305.165,1307.763,It’s not a ruling on the merits.
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1308.718,1307.763,We dismissed the writ.
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1313.012,1321.33,"I’ve always understood, Your Honor, that a dismissal of certiorari, after hearing, argument is a denial of hearing."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1321.33,1323.652,We didn’t dismiss it as improvidently granted.
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1325.477,1329.44,I think that’s fairly-- I think that’s fairly apparent from Your Honor’s language.
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1329.44,1339.722,"Well, in any event, if we construe this as having passed on the merits and reverse on that ground, are you going to be offended?[Attempt to Laughter]"
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1339.722,1344.558,"Your Honor, I could never be offended by winning a case in the United States Supreme Court."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1344.899,1346.634,I’m just surprised you haven’t argued it.
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1349.208,1349.749,Your Honor--
1970.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1349.749,1354.22,"Somewhere in your brief you do say, I think that this is a little bit more than a simple denial of certiorari."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1354.22,1354.325,It is--
1970.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1354.325,1356.574,"I can’t find it here, but I read it yesterday, I think."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1356.574,1357.301,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1382.146,1383.91,You don’t really want to win this case then.
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1387.809,1389.074,"I would like both, Your Honor."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1389.074,1389.795,"Yes, I see."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1389.795,1395.179,"I would like both and, if I can’t have both, I will take one."
1970.44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.179,1398.505,You may not get either.[Laughter]
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1398.505,1403.164,That is always a risk.
1970.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1562.158,1563.632,"Well, in doing the trials as well."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1563.632,1565.889,"In doing the trial, too."
1970.44,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1565.889,1568.941,"Whenever-- at the first opportunity that they’re raised, that’s--"
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1568.941,1573.98,At the first opportunity that they’re fairly raised.
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1590.119,1594.839,I gather the District Court and the Court of Appeals did nothing that we haven’t already done.
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1596.781,1596.882,I--
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1596.882,1601.666,Because they acted only on the same record that was before us.
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1601.666,1601.87,That’s correct.
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1601.87,1605.272,By which we heard oral argument which we are fully examining.
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1605.272,1607.432,"That’s correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1607.432,1609.64,And I still get back to my original question.
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1612.417,1614.032,Because we didn’t think it was a ruling.
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1614.032,1614.253,"Yes, I know."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1614.253,1617.856,We didn’t think the decision in this Court was a ruling on the merits.
1970.44,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1617.856,1619.966,"Yes, if you prefer to look at it that way."
1970.44,0,39374,robert_r_granucci,,1619.966,1627.444,"Now, with the permission of the Court, I’d like to reserve the remainder of my time to rebut counsel."
1970.44,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1627.444,1631.211,"Very well, Mr. Granucci."
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1632.818,1636.656,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1683.761,1686.366,"Well, I’ve put to you. Didn’t we review the facts from this case?"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1686.366,1688.833,"I do not believe you did, Your Honor."
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1688.833,1690.83,And we say we did?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1691.954,1693.148,"The ruling of the Court, I believe--"
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1693.148,1694.482,Not the ruling.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1695.6,1697.271,You said the--
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1697.271,1706.961,"After hearing oral argument and fully examining the record, we conclude that the totality of circumstances, as the record makes the manifest, didn’t warrant brining the case here."
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1709.674,1719.201,"Yes, those words were there, Your Honor, but I must say that the relief granted by this Court to what the dismissal of the certiorari petition as improvidently granted has in many--"
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1719.201,1720.932,We didn’t say the “improvidently granted.”
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1720.932,1723.343,"Well, I believe that was a construction of the Court."
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1723.343,1723.884,Who’s Court?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1725.329,1740.64,"Yes, but it seems to me that you’ve wrestled with this question in the Rogers case, and have gone into the question of when and where this Court must pass upon the merits of a decision and when and where it may rule a certiorari is improvidently granted."
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1770.571,1776.405,"Yes, but I’m right, am I not, Mr. Legge, that the decisions here in habeas were only on the State Court record."
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1776.405,1778.046,"That’s quite correct, yes."
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1778.046,1780.101,Just the same record that we had before us.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1780.101,1785.343,"Yes, that’s quite correct because you granted the remedy that the District Court granted was “let’s have a hearing."
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1787.311,1788.558,They didn’t have a hearing.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1790.166,1791.893,"No, this is what the District Court granted."
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1791.893,1795.91,What happened in the District Court that hadn’t already happened here in the way of argument?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1795.91,1797.74,"In the way of argument, Your Honor?"
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1797.74,1798.58,"Yes, are they different?"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1798.58,1799.716,I can’t say that.
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1821.884,1824.496,On the merits of the voluntariness?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1825.773,1828.641,I’m-- merits of any of it.
1970.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1838.938,1850.552,"Were the questions-- I know the record was the same when it was here before, as it is now, but were the questions pressed by the petitioner when it was here before the same--"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1850.552,1854.9,"I cannot answer the question, Mr. Justice White, because we did not represent him in that prior."
1970.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.9,1856.288,You never looked-- you haven’t looked at the--
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1856.288,1857.572,I have made an attempt to do so.
1970.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.572,1858.819,Petition for certiorari?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1858.819,1863.536,"Yes, we do find that there are questions presented of voluntariness."
1970.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.536,1868.638,"Well, are there any questions raised in this proceeding and by habeas corpus petition that were not raised?"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1868.638,1869.495,Certainly.
1970.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.495,1869.826,What?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1869.826,1870.691,Certainly.
1970.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.691,1871.156,What?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1871.156,1884.364,"The denial of counsel, the Jackson v. Denno case, and the application of Miranda and Escobedo retroactively back to the time of his confession."
1970.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.244,1892.782,New legal issues were raised--
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1892.782,1893.248,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1893.248,1894.673,This petition for habeas corpus?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1894.673,1895.036,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.036,1896.356,On the same factual record?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1896.356,1897.851,"On the same factual record, yes."
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1897.851,1906.029,"But, I gather, the standard of voluntariness under our Johnson decision was the pre-Miranda, pre-Escobedo standard, wasn’t it?"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1906.029,1914.461,"This Court has said that, in evaluating the voluntariness of a confession, that Escobedo and Miranda are retroactive."
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1914.461,1920.656,"No, you mean relevant that there was no counsel when he sought, but wasn’t that always the case on voluntariness cases before Miranda and Escobedo?"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1920.656,1922.154,"I’m sorry, always the case on what?"
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1922.154,1928.582,"Wasn’t-- weren’t those relevant considerations: councilman, vice, the recent title of counsel?"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1928.582,1929.098,They may have been.
1970.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1929.098,1931.347,Even before we decided Miranda and Escobedo?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,1931.347,1937.016,"They may have been, but certainly sharpened by Miranda and sharpened by Escobedo."
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2044.805,2051.321,How-- were-- do you suggest they were different from the facts which Travers testified to independently?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2051.321,2054.315,"There were material differences that were referred to in the brief, Your Honor."
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2104.945,2108.291,Let me see if I get-- I’m not sure I understand the thrust of your argument.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2116.791,2120.672,Yes.
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2120.672,2124.859,Would you suggest that Travers could not testify at that new trial?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2124.859,2126.865,"No, I wouldn’t suggest that at all, Your Honor."
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2188.657,2192.633,What kind of extraneous facts are you-- do you have in mind?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2192.633,2194.216,You mean in our case or hypothetically?
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2194.216,2195.05,This case.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2195.05,2205.348,"In this case, Your Honor, the facts that we would bring in would be the facts which were admitted from evidence by the State Court."
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2372.097,2373.441,Was he indigent?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2373.441,2374.133,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2374.133,2375.633,Did he ever claim indigence?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2375.633,2380.697,He was represented in the trial of his case by a Court-appointed attorney.
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2380.697,2386.539,Did he claim indigence at the time that he asked-- did he asked for an appointed lawyer?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2386.539,2391.052,"He asked for-- yes, he asked to have-- he asked the police to provide him with a lawyer."
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.052,2393.909,"And, did he give any reason for it?"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2393.909,2394.824,"For what, Your Honor?"
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2394.824,2397.19,"Well, he’s supposed to be a millionaire."
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2397.19,2399.487,"Well, the record doesn’t say, Your Honor."
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2399.487,2401.345,"It doesn’t show one way or the other, does it?"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2401.345,2402.905,"It doesn’t say, no."
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2424.116,2424.793,It’s what?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2424.793,2429.984,It’s undeniably clear that the man was asking for a lawyer to be appointed for him.
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2429.984,2435.948,"But it’s not undeniably clear that he needed it, that he didn’t have money."
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2435.948,2436.968,"Well, the record can say--"
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2436.968,2442.102,I understand the Deputy Attorney General to say that this man had property.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2442.102,2452.907,"Well, the record, I don’t believe, Your Honor, contains any language to the effect of whether he did or did not, but I would say this."
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.25,2468.172,The state said that’s harmless error.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2468.172,2469.726,"Yes, and the Trial Court says you can’t even hear it."
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.726,2471.333,"Well, what’s your answer to that?"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2471.333,2473.499,My answer to that is it is not a harmless error.
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.499,2473.972,Why?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2473.972,2475.523,Because of Escobedo and Miranda.
1970.44,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.469,2519.317,"Well, on the question that we should do it as a matter of law, on the basis of that, I get back to Mr. Justice Brennan’s point."
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2522.118,2524.217,"Well, it may have done so."
1970.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.485,2532.338,I had not understood that either Miranda or Escobedo had been applied retroactively.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2532.338,2539.513,"They have been ret--applied retroactively, Your Honor, to the subject of confessions."
1970.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2549.874,2554.321,"Isn’t it Johnson against New Jersey, held that there-- Miranda was to be applied retroactively?"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2554.467,2560.077,Retroactively to the relevance and to the substance of whether a confession is or is not voluntary.
1970.44,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.077,2563.32,That is always the truth.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2563.32,2566.322,"Well, it may have always been the rule."
1970.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2571.553,2579.271,"This-- excuse me, the circumstances surrounding this man’s, what you call, his confession, it actually wasn’t quite that."
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2583.62,2584.269,I’m not-- I’m sorry.
1970.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2584.269,2586.472,And Chiconia against New Jersey.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2586.472,2588.341,"I can’t respond to these specific cases, Your Honor."
1970.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2588.341,2597.267,Involving situations very much like Escobedo in which this Court affirmed the convictions.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2597.267,2603.465,"I can’t respond to the cases, Your Honor, because we-- neither the state nor I have considered them in our briefs here."
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2603.465,2617.045,Does your case depend upon whether you have to make out ultimately that the statements made to Travers before they were recorded constituted a confession legally?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2617.045,2637.742,"No, I do not believe so, Your Honor, because what Mr. Travers did not directly testify in this record to what Mr. Atchley told him, and I assume that what Your Honor is saying is this, that suppose the recorded confession were just lifted from the transcript and placed aside and you had left was Travers’ oral testimony, would that be a confession?"
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2648.013,2651.827,What about the defendant’s testimony added to the defendant’s testimony?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2651.827,2665.253,"Well, with the defendant’s testimony following after the confession, that is after the confession is played to the jury, you have a circumstance, Your Honor, where “What can he do?”"
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2695.164,2698.043,"Your-- although, the ultimate relief you want is a new trial, of course."
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2698.043,2701.772,"The ultimate-- the best ultimate relief we can get, Your Honor, is a new trial."
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2701.772,2704.881,"Now, the criminal acts here took place when, 1958?"
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2704.881,2704.995,1958 or 1959.
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2704.995,2707.041,1959.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2708.648,2710.508,"I believe so, 1958 or 1959."
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2710.508,2717.369,"So, we’d be trying this case, if it were retried, sometime in 12 years or 13 years."
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2717.369,2718.4,"That’s quite true, Your Honor."
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2934.865,2938.638,Do you say that page 102 material is from the recording?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,2938.638,2955.213,"Yes, page 102 and page 100 of the-- what I just quoted are from the recoding of the conversation, that is the so-called confession that is in dispute here."
1970.44,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3064.59,3069.695,Is the state judge who originally tried this case in New York City?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,3069.695,3072.359,"I understand that he is deceased, Your Honor."
1970.44,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3072.359,3081.342,"This-- even on your second alternative, it’d have to have a reappraiser or you so think the Court or the judge did not try the case."
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,3081.342,3091.199,"It would, but I think, Your Honor, that that is what the habeas corpus statute requires anyway, and I think that’s what this Court’s decision in Faye against Noya and Townsend against Sain are requiring."
1970.44,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3091.199,3101.489,Where’s it shown that it’s necessary to dispose of question?
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,3110.359,3112.46,Could this case be retried?
1970.44,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3112.657,3114.988,Witnesses are available on both sides.
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,3114.988,3116.363,Are you-- well--
1970.44,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3116.363,3120.527,"Or perhaps that’s an unfair question to ask you, if you’re concerned with it."
1970.44,1,19446,charles_a_legge,,3120.527,3129.378,"Well, I can say this, and the state’s attorney will have an opportunity to reply to what I say in the event if what I say about their advice to me is inaccurate."
1970.44,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3166.479,3168.2,"Thank you, Mr. Legge."
1970.44,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3172.589,3173.607,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1970.44,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3193.665,3194.951,Where are you reading from?
1970.44,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3194.951,3195.28,I’m reading from--
1970.44,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3195.28,3196.457,What page?
1970.44,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3196.457,3201.706,Page 32 of our petition for a writ of certiorari.
1970.44,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3208.432,3209.8,This is good enough.
1970.44,2,39374,robert_r_granucci,,3209.8,3221.837,"Moreover, the recorded conversation demonstrates that Travers referred to the insurance policy to explain why he was asking questions and not as an inducement for any particular answers."
1970.44,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3381.721,3382.375,Thank you.
