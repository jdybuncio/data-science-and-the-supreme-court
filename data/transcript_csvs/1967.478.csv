1967.478,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,32.794,"Number 478, Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local Number 590 et al., petitioners versus Logan Valley Plaza Incorporated and Weis Markets Incorporated."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,34.119,37.589,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,192.131,194.615,The entrance is on the parking area?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,194.615,195.222,Yes.
1967.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,217.661,219.826,Are there fences around it?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,219.826,223.268,"No sir, I don't believe there's a fence around it."
1967.478,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,254.198,256.844,"This is in a suburban Altona, that space?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,256.844,257.63,"Yes sir, it is."
1967.478,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,326.735,333.761,"But it sometimes involved in that, weren't they 14 in one time?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,333.761,344.385,"On one night, there were 13 pickets and the witness testifying as to their conduct said, they walk, two have rest and sometimes three and four."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,366.809,374.412,"Well what companies did the state court involved 5, 6 and 7."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,376.734,387.373,There is no question that the picketing which was conducted at and in the pick up zone which is in front of the sidewalk.
1967.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,387.373,391.297,That's the place where one was pulling his car to put his package.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,391.297,392.213,That's correct Your Honor.
1967.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,392.213,397.104,Now isn't that an activity somewhat obstructive?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,397.104,399.89,"Well, the best way I can reach that Your Honor is to --"
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.89,403.582,"Well, the fact that it's not violent, it doesn't mean it isn't obstructive."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,403.582,409.91,"No, I'm not suggesting that the word peaceful excludes the obstruction."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.423,417.113,Where is that?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,417.113,422.545,That's of -- we have it on page 6 of our reply brief.
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,512.208,529.795,"You may have covered this and if you did, I'm sorry but I was unable to get clearly in my mind either from the text of the briefs or the drawings whether the pickets were on the little walk there in front of the store or in the driveway or both."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,530.904,536.272,They were primarily in the pickup zone which is on the street in front of the sidewalk.
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,538.616,542.104,Let me -- let me be very clear about that.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,547.146,547.267,Yes.
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,547.267,549.88,"Then, there's a curb and a wall."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,549.88,552.34,Let me -- let me try to put it this way.
1967.478,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.34,554.131,There is a picture of this somewhere --
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,554.131,560.608,There's a pretty good diagram of it at page 4 of the respondent's brief.
1967.478,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,560.608,561.105,Thank you.
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,561.105,572.687,What I want to know is whether they were picketing in a way that ould -- that might disturb vehicular traffic or just pedestrian traffic or both.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,572.687,596.611,"I would have to say that the picketing at the pickup zone had a possibility of interfering with the traffic flow in and out of the picket zone -- pickup zone, and therefore, I would say that the ideal place for those pickets to have been would have been on the sidewalk and not in the pickup zone, and we would be perfectly content to have them on the sidewalk and not in the picket zone --"
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,596.611,597.124,But they were.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,597.124,597.791,-- in reasonable numbers.
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,597.791,600.448,"But as a matter of fact, they were in both places."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,600.448,607.116,"As a matter of fact, they were primarily in the pickup zone and occasionally on the sidewalk, but they were in both places, yes."
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,607.116,609.402,Thank you.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,609.402,624.066,"As a matter of fact, however, the case does not turn on whether they were in the pickup zone or on the sidewalk because what both courts below found is that they shouldn't have been any place in the vicinity of the store."
1967.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,644.656,644.961,Well does that --
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,644.961,645.711,Sir?
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.711,646.941,Does that follow?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,679.243,683.037,"No sir, because that is not the basis for the injunction."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,685.732,689.915,Why didn't you just say no that the injunction was too broad?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,689.915,691.002,No.
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.17,701.102,"Well, would you say that -- would you say this procession was bad if it banned only the picketing on the sidewalk within the pickup zone?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,701.102,703.914,"And -- and remitted picketing to where, Your Honor."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.914,708.565,"Well, all it then was that, do not picket in the -- on the sidewalk or in the pickup zone."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,708.565,709.26,"Yes, sir."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.569,711.226,That that was bad?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,711.226,716.429,"That that was bad, yes sir, because we would take the position, one of two positions --"
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.429,722.997,For a state -- the state court has no power to -- to stop picketing there if it interferes the vehicular traffic in front of the store.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,722.997,724.431,"No, that's not what we're saying."
1967.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,742.06,751.046,"But do you think -- so you also say you may have one or may have two, but they may not picket, they may not walk either one or two in the pickup zone?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,751.046,758.406,"I would be willing to keep these people off the pickup zone, let them stay on the sidewalk and we would be content."
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,758.824,763.889,"When you say pickup zone, you mean -- you're talking about what I talk about as the driveway where the vehicles --"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,763.889,765.489,The driveway --
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,765.489,774.437,So you're willing -- you -- you would be willing to throw the court to say that you've got to stay out -- stay out of the way of vehicular traffic?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,774.437,775.674,"Yes, sir."
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,775.674,780.646,But -- and then you think that that would remit them to what I call the sidewalk.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,780.646,781.371,Right.
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,781.371,791.126,"And then you'd further be willing for the Court to hand her an order that would be a reasonable regulation of number, etcetera."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,791.126,792.182,"That's correct, sir."
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1142.932,1147.462,Suppose it was just inside the store?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1147.462,1148.882,"Picketing within the store, sir?"
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1148.882,1149.393,Yes.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1149.393,1152.335,"No sir, we would not claim that we have any right to picket within the store."
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1152.335,1159.877,I understood you to say that they cannot divide up and say that some could come and some may not.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1159.909,1160.009,No because --
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1160.009,1163.134,"If that's true, why would that not also apply inside?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1163.134,1188.427,"Because we think that there is a functional difference between the shopping center premises outside the store where everyone is parking these cars, where no one needs any leap to walk its streets, and the store function proper itself which is we believe devoted to selling and buying, and which that it is inappropriate in that place to conduct peaceful picketing or indeed to distribute handbills."
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1188.427,1188.609,Do you think the --
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1188.609,1189.267,We --
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1189.267,1197.066,"-- owner of the store couldn't provide a parking place and say, ?for customers for this store only""?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1197.066,1205.528,"No, because when he says ?for customers of this store only?, he is opening that parking lot to the public and therefore, it seems to us --"
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1205.528,1206.655,But he's not opening.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1210.631,1211.57,"Oh, that's correct, sir."
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1232.458,1240.374,"In other words, the owner cannot provide that he wants his parking lot to be used only by those who buy goods from his store."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1240.374,1252.059,"That's correct, sir, with respect at least to the entry of working people for the purposes of expressing a labor message connected with that store."
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1253.017,1266.46,"Well, do you really -- do you really mean that or do you differentiate between the sort of case that Justice Black was talking about in the parking area and the shopping center?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1289.73,1290.465,Yes.
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1340.762,1346.302,Why would you think the shopping center case is easier for you?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1350.403,1352.935,I cannot draw a difference in theory or principle other than that --
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1352.935,1365.72,"In other words, you say -- you say you have -- you really have to defend your position with respect to both of them, both the individual store parking lot and the shopping center."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1365.72,1372.732,The only distinction that I can see would be one based on the degree of openness to the public.
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1429.548,1431.522,Why do you say no one can claim that?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1431.522,1433.609,Because I think this Court has decided that question.
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1433.609,1435.372,In what case?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1435.372,1438.074,This Court I think has decided that in Thornhill v. Alabama.
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1438.074,1440.383,"No, it did not."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1444.643,1455.605,"Yes sir, but I think that the rationale of Thornhill against Alabama is not limited solely to the ambiguity of the statute."
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1480.792,1487.365,"Well, in later cases that explained Thornhill as having a different view to that what you say it had."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1487.365,1493.363,"I know of no later case, Your Honor, which would explain the way Thornhill to the point of --"
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1493.363,1499.537,"It doesn't explain it that way, it's just explain it was talking about it in ambiguous statute."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1499.537,1528.778,"Sir, I cannot quarrel with a view that peaceful picketing because it has aspects of conduct, as well as speech, has been suggested by Your Honor to the totally prohibitable as a matter of constitutional law with the sole differentiation being that a government cannot discriminate and allow some peaceful picketing to some and prohibited to others."
1967.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1735.751,1737.518,"Mr. Dunau, does your argument go this far?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1769.077,1773.43,I again have the same problem with that question as I have with the single parking lot --
1967.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1773.43,1774.359,"Well, this is why I asked."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1774.359,1778.677,-- to what degree has it been open to the public.
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.999,1797.981,"Well, as you know, it's an ordinary large office building and the Prudential say happens to have half of the 22nd floor and they have the usual common hallways and access to the common hallway by elevators, and one or two pickets just march up and down in front of the Prudential --"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1797.981,1801.441,"In my view, these pickets should have a right to be on the 22nd floor --"
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.441,1802.861,This is under the First Amendment?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1802.861,1804.242,This is under the First Amendment.
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.242,1808.431,Have you have to really rely on the First Amendment in this case?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1808.431,1808.648,No.
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.647,1816.478,"And if you do, I don't suppose that you would suggest reaching the First Amendment?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1816.478,1820.189,I have to leave it to the Court as to which ground it wants to place its decision.
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1827.998,1838.492,"Well, do you understand that preemption defines a state of -- state court of jurisdiction to do something about violence?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1838.492,1839.804,"No, sir."
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1839.804,1855.527,"Well then, do you understand that preemption prohibits the state from doing something if an aspect of the otherwise immune picketing is the disruption of traffic?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1855.527,1857.098,"No, sir."
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1857.098,1880.752,"So that the preemption were not necessarily disposed of this case if -- if there is a finding that -- and we don't disturb it, that the vehicular traffic and pedestrian traffic here were unreasonably disrupted."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1880.752,1886.886,"That would be our same problem, whether the decision is grounded on the First Amendment or on preemption."
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1890.686,1892.159,And the state would still have --
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1892.159,1897.058,And the state would still have power whether it's under the First Amendment or on a preemption assignment --
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1897.058,1898.488,Perhaps I misunderstood you.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1900.313,1900.751,"No, sir."
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1900.751,1901.09,Sorry.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1901.09,1913.875,"We have no claim that the state cannot, no matter how this injunction has upset either on the First Amendment or preemption, the state has power to reach and control obstructive picketing."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.605,1991.119,"Well, Mr. Dunau, in -- on the First Amendment ground though, you wouldn't really distinguish between labor pickets and other pickets --"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1991.119,1991.354,"No, sir."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.354,2001.99,You -- and anyone who wants to communicate a message to the -- that kind of a public should have the right to picket wherever you can.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2001.99,2002.99,"Sir, I think --"
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.99,2011.702,You're treating any place of business that's open to the public or any other property that's open to the public like a public park.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2017.763,2018.267,That --
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.267,2020.293,-- as long as he doesn't obstruct.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2020.293,2022.263,"That would be our view, sir."
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2042.115,2045.929,"And it's also the fresh air that makes it a little easier for you, didn't it?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2045.929,2050.465,"Well, I suppose there's just as fresh air at the highway entrance to that shopping center."
1967.478,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2050.465,2054.681,"Well, it's a little fresher than it is on the 22nd floor of an office building."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2054.681,2059.697,"Yes, except on a humid day where the air conditioned building might be a better place to picket."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.697,2062.621,And how about the apartment house?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2062.621,2065.728,"No, that gets closer to where, in my view --"
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.728,2067.072,And this is too private?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2067.072,2077.55,"We get to where I think it becomes an interference with a person's right to be free from any annoyance at all, where it is his virtually his own home."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.695,2084.896,"Well, it's open -- delivery -- it's open to the delivery man, it's open to all --"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2084.896,2085.612,"Sir, I am --"
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.612,2086.963,-- a lot of people --
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2086.963,2090.748,I am not suggesting an argument here which is an absolute as one.
1967.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2122.726,2135.507,But rather that there's no -- you indicated that you didn't feel like the Constitution for that state protect a man from picketing at his home.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2135.507,2139.627,"That would be my own information, yes, Your Honor."
1967.478,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2363.585,2369.458,"When you say that you can see that picketing is more than speech, what precisely do you mean?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2371.796,2411.226,"When we say picketing is more than speech, we mean only that part of the way in which one communicates his message is to either stand with a placard or walk up and down with a placard, and when it is that aspect of it which we concede is regulable, we think you can restrict the number of persons who can walk and the places at which they can walk so as not to obstruct access, and that is all we concede when we say that picketing is more than speech, that that part of it which is more than speech is regulable but that part of -- a part of it which is speech, that it is speech --"
1967.478,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2411.226,2423.951,You don't concede that it's more than speech in that it is a distinct message to certain members of the public just not to go into that store.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2426.802,2431.651,There is nothing in this record which -- which show a prohibition as a result of the picket line.
1967.478,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2440.465,2441.797,Or that it's --
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2441.797,2447.862,"-- or that they will, when they see that picket line, not cross because they've been taught since childhood not to cross a picket line."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2641.173,2646.63,But how can we ever find out that?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2646.63,2649.103,"By filing a charge with the Labor Board, Your Honor."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2649.103,2657.218,"Well, you can't file a charge to the Labor Board in order to say (Inaudible)."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2664.51,2665.443,No.
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2697.198,2701.328,(Inaudible)
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2701.328,2701.758,No.
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.997,2720.093,"Do you think that's a different Congress, so that's really sort of a surplus --"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2720.093,2722.237,"No, no, no."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.337,2727.461,But you said it is if it is the charge then it is a violation.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2733.285,2747.784,"In order to determine whether the union picket has a right to be at the premises of the shopping center, the board will decide is his conduct within the protection of Section 7 of the Act."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.123,2765.756,You mean this board will decide whether it violates 8 (a) (1).
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2765.756,2768.843,But that turns out whether it's protected by Section 7.
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.843,2769.619,(Inaudible)
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2769.619,2772.508,"Yes, sir, almost -- well, yes sir."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.043,2826.064,But you just said that everything -- anything that's preempted is arguably prohibited.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2828.453,2829.385,"No sir, it would not."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.385,2832.667,You file the charge and the charge is turned down.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2832.667,2834.559,"Yes, sir."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.559,2837.106,"Then, it's not a protection."
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2837.106,2838.934,That's correct.
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2839.561,2842.204,Then the charge is sustained.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2842.204,2847.318,"Yes sir, but there are two separate concepts here."
1967.478,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2887.23,2891.741,We'll recess now.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,2895.748,2897.544,May it please the court.
1967.478,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3034.687,3045.001,"Would the same rule necessarily apply to union solicitation as it would apply to picketing, you think, inevitably?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3045.001,3051.412,Only one would draw distinction between placarding and talking or distributing literature sir.
1967.478,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3051.412,3054.587,"In this case, it was not union solicitation or it was not --"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3054.587,3063.175,"No sir, in this case and so far as the activity conducted which was the object of the injunction, it was picketing."
1967.478,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3094.823,3110.794,With union solicitation you have the obvious need to reach the employees and the only place you can reach them sometimes is that the entrance or the exit of the place where they work or the parking lot where they park their cars.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3116.788,3160.17,"No, this particular picketing and so far as the record discloses, what it was aimed at was to reach the customers to persuade them not to buy but in terms of reaching the customers to persuade them not to buy, you have the same need of getting as close to the place where they shop as you can, and for the board, you would then have the same sort of question in terms of exercising your concerted activity for mutual aid or protection should be allowed to get up to the premises of the store and to that degree, modify the employer's pure property right saying his title to his property entitles into exclude everybody."
1967.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3177.854,3186.104,Did you say Mr. Dunau that the Board has not had occasion to deal with any kind of conduct on an area like this?
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3186.104,3194.819,I have been unable to find a case certainly which deals with peaceful picketing on a shopping center.
1967.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3194.819,3197.003,"Well, I meant any kind of activities the board dealt with --"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3197.003,3199.083,On a shopping center as such.
1967.478,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3243.531,3245.851,Now the Board in that --I should remember but I don't.
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3253.976,3262.057,"I'm told it was at the stores but I have no recollection of the specific facts at the moment, Your Honor."
1967.478,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3367.596,3385.964,"If the picketting has appeared, was then that a pick up on the street, would you still contend the state court in accordance to regulate that this (Inaudible)?"
1967.478,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,3385.964,3386.838,No sir.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3667.0,3673.206,"Mr. Chief Justice, honorable members of this Court."
1967.478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3746.701,3754.299,You mean the question is not whether the state court may prevent any picketing in the shopping center?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3754.299,3763.668,"Well, I'm saying that the question is whether there should be reasonable regulation, I submit sir that that's what was done here."
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3763.668,3769.778,"You mean at this instance, total prohibition was indeed reasonable regulation?"
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3770.524,3774.32,"In this instance Your Honor, this was not a total prohibition."
1967.478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3774.32,3779.613,Except that you mean -- they permitted to go on either side of the entrance?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3779.613,3780.178,That is right.
1967.478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3782.053,3785.317,It wasn't then the shopping center property at all.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3785.317,3786.803,"Yes, it was."
1967.478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3789.304,3802.197,Do you think -- do you think that that -- in the terms on the -- according to the terms of the injunction that that picketing was permitted or did it just go on and it wasn't --?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3802.197,3803.586,Oh no.
1967.478,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3826.345,3829.404,"Well then, do you concede -- I beg your pardon."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3829.404,3829.743,I beg your pardon.
1967.478,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3829.743,3846.888,"You concede then that the fact that this is -- that it's a private property, the picketing takes place on private property that is to say the shopping center property does not make the picketing unlawful."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3846.888,3850.802,I don't like to put it that I concede anything Your Honor but I don't --
1967.478,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3850.802,3852.2,"Well, that's what I'm asking you."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3852.2,3852.955,Yes.
1967.478,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3857.922,3883.633,"Well, I would like your answer because you say, I understood from the adversary's argument that the basic issue in this case was whether shopping center property was private property in the respect and with the result that picketing thereon was not permissible."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3907.069,3909.636,"Under certain circumstances, yes."
1967.478,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3909.636,3912.672,And those circumstances are what?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3918.536,3919.479,That's right.
1967.478,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3920.633,3945.636,So you do con -- I don't want to press you to take a position that is not yours but I think it's very important for us to know whether there is an issue here as to whether the mere fact that the picketing takes place on property of the shopping center makes that picketing unlawful.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3945.636,3948.188,I do not take that position.
1967.478,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3955.443,3966.623,"Well that meant, I gather, so that all that's before us is whether this constituted appropriate regulation."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3966.623,3967.065,Yes sir.
1967.478,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3967.065,3968.991,In all the circumstances of this case.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3968.991,3974.422,That is right as you put it sir -- exactly without any qualification.
1967.478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3974.422,3987.688,"Well, it seems to me that the injunction says picket -- forbids picketing and trespassing upon the private property of plaintiff Logan Valley Plaza, Inc. including the parking area and all entrances and exits leading to said parking area."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3987.688,3988.125,Right.
1967.478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3988.125,3996.825,I don't see any -- any reservation of the right to picket on the berms.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,3996.825,3997.562,If you will --
1967.478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3997.562,4002.844,It maybe that you just didn't apply this injunction to it.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4011.966,4012.328,No --
1967.478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4012.328,4013.962,That's what it says.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4016.881,4017.694,It said that.
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4043.094,4046.732,"It's 1-B of prayer, is it?"
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4046.732,4050.854,Thank you.
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4053.59,4056.468,I'm looking at the prayer.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4056.468,4067.083,"Yeah, I think its page 10 of the appendix, paragraph 13."
1967.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4090.903,4091.951,What appendix?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4091.951,4097.111,"Oh, the appendix of this case -- I mean the record."
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4097.111,4098.353,"Mr. Lewis, may I ask you."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4098.353,4099.609,Yes.
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4099.609,4106.189,"It used to be in my day at practice, if you want an injunction like this, you draft it and the Court signs it."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4108.14,4110.493,Yes.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4110.493,4115.328,"Well then, does this prohibit picketing on the berm on that?"
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4115.328,4117.307,Prohibit or forbid on that.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4117.307,4118.42,Prohibit.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4118.42,4119.769,Picketing on a berm?
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4122.287,4128.846,"It says -- well, is the berm owned by Logan Valley?"
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4128.846,4131.631,I believe -- I'm not sure whether berm is part of the --
1967.478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4131.631,4133.117,You said so a while ago that it was --
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4133.117,4138.937,"Yes, I responded to you and then as I read this complaint in paragraph 13, I notice that it says, private --"
1967.478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4138.937,4145.504,"Well, I don't think the -- I would understand -- I thought it was part of the right of way of the road."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4145.504,4146.779,Yes sir.
1967.478,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4146.779,4160.663,So why do you say that what this amounted to is a total prohibition of picketing on private property because the only picketing you wanted to reserve was on the berm which is on private property.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4160.663,4166.404,"Okay, if that's the way the question was raised before to me, you're right."
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4178.002,4189.227,"Well, let me see is it your position that all picketing from a private property is unlawful?"
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4189.227,4194.317,No.
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4197.24,4201.826,I framed it on the premise that the berms were part of the private property.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4212.378,4214.409,They're adjacent to the private property.
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4214.409,4216.677,Adjacent to but are they within the property line?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4216.677,4217.079,No.
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4223.303,4226.282,"Well, the picture here at page 83 is that a berm?"
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4226.282,4228.695,Eighty three.
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4230.543,4232.052,Now --
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4232.052,4233.483,Yeah.
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4233.996,4236.422,There's a ditch there --
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4236.422,4240.606,The berm as you see it is right end side.
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4240.606,4243.471,It's between the ditch and the --
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4243.471,4244.125,That is right.
1967.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4244.125,4252.274,And whose property is that?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4252.274,4255.906,We alleged it to be a public property.
1967.478,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4280.547,4305.356,"I still have to know that after all of these whether it's your position that all of the property owned by your client, the shopping center is in such status by reason of private ownership that it's unlawful to picket on it."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4305.356,4305.558,Our position --
1967.478,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4305.558,4312.169,I don't want to know what you said in your complaint but I want to know what your submission is to this Court.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4329.036,4334.36,"In the circumstances of this case, yes."
1967.478,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4334.36,4335.124,In the what?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4335.124,4336.371,Circumstances of this case.
1967.478,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4336.371,4337.467,What does that mean?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4337.467,4350.948,"Meaning that the lower court is affirmed by the state court of Pennsylvania was correct in enjoining all picketing, in view of what happened."
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4390.299,4401.279,"Well according to your Court, it said you cannot have 13 pickets in that area doing what they're doing rather than the sweeping language have used."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4401.279,4410.706,"The Court could have said, We will restrict the number of picketing, and the Court could have said We will restrict the place."
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4410.706,4411.772,Right.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4411.772,4414.157,The Court in effect did this Your Honor.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4414.236,4421.274,"The Court in effect, -- I well, they restricted the number in front of that building to zero."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4421.274,4421.89,That's right.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4421.89,4427.536,"That is not restricting, wouldn't you agree?"
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4427.536,4428.139,"Yes, I would agree."
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4428.139,4429.65,"They said, Get out of that area."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4429.65,4430.494,That's what they said.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4430.494,4435.514,And get off of all of the private property owned by this company.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4435.514,4441.616,That's what they said in view of what took place and in view of the union's position.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4441.616,4445.703,So that they -- but you agree that they could have limited the picketing?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4445.703,4446.756,That's right.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4446.756,4448.216,And said don't obstruct?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4448.216,4449.494,That's right.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4450.175,4451.28,But they didn't.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4451.28,4451.964,That's right.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4451.964,4467.918,"So you're talking about what we have before you is not the only thing that we have before us, this broad sweeping language in this order."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4467.918,4468.802,Except -- yes sir.
1967.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4513.497,4534.809,"You're speaking of the issue that was drawn and I read your complaint, you sought to have all picketing of every kind, removed from the property of the respondent."
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4534.809,4535.535,That's correct.
1967.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4535.535,4542.672,On the ground that it was private property and they were not entitled to it and not entitled to do so.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4559.041,4560.858,Yes.
1967.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4560.858,4573.368,And the issue is really whether or not there can be any kind of picketing on your private property.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4573.368,4574.564,Yes.
1967.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4585.933,4587.116,And public property.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4587.116,4590.711,"Yes, surely we alleged this question."
1967.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4598.459,4602.955,But you have to defend the whole injunction don't you?
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4602.955,4606.746,Yes.
1967.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4608.917,4612.889,Also that which says that it cannot be done on the private property of these people any picketing.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4612.889,4616.759,"Yes, I have to defend that."
1967.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4620.202,4622.149,"Yes, I just want to know where --"
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4622.149,4624.458,"Alright, thank you."
1967.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4713.455,4717.594,He doesn't say that they're entitled with the 13 pickets.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4726.54,4728.557,"Oh, I misunderstood him."
1967.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4734.585,4734.805,Yeah.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4734.805,4756.602,"I think that's probably so and I might say Your Honor that if there's just one picket standing there, not obstructing anybody in anyway, we feel that that's a significant consideration that the state court should take into account in deciding whether or not to issue an injunction here."
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4766.158,4773.048,"But what need be in violation of this injunction, the one picket?"
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4773.048,4775.267,Oh surely at this point --
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4775.267,4777.656,"So he couldn't do it, could he?"
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4784.659,4787.989,"No, but they could have asked the court for a permission to do that."
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4788.955,4789.878,As of now.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4789.878,4790.632,As it's now.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4790.632,4794.168,And that's what we have before us.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4794.168,4794.778,Yes.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4801.07,4806.431,That solely because it's privately owned street.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4806.431,4811.436,I think there's more to it Your Honor and I hope to develop that.
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4811.436,4819.795,I'll wait with great interest.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,4819.795,4827.411,"In fact, I would like to underscore certain facts appearing in this case which are not denied."
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5030.908,5034.608,"Mr. Lewis, does the record show how many times they had 13?"
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,5034.608,5037.799,"Yes, one afternoon and one evening."
1967.478,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5037.799,5039.792,Right.
1967.478,1,39764,robert_lewis,,5039.792,5043.778,Which caused us to immediately go into Court.
1967.478,2,17581,bernard_dunau,,6802.806,6804.467,May it please the court.
