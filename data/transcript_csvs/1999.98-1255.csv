1999.98-1255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.795,"We'll hear argument now in No. 98-1255, United States v. Abel Martinez-Salazar."
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,10.031,13.003,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,112.57,118.393,"Mr. Dreeben, you...  you mentioned I think peremptory challenge right impairment."
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,121.858,139.774,The source of peremptory challenge rights in the Federal system is rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which provides a right of peremptory challenge to the defense in criminal cases that increases in number depending on the type of case that there is.
1999.98-1255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,155.666,163.923,I take it then it really is impossible to justify the Ninth Circuit's reasoning if there's a constitutional question here where we're talking about Federal rules.
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,163.923,165.409,"That's right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-1255,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,203.199,216.762,"But as far as rules are concerned, Mr. Dreeben, this case is...  is perhaps larger than...  on the face because the same peremptory challenge by rule, by Federal rule, exists on the civil side."
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,233.646,242.768,"Certainly, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the rule that...  that we are arguing for today would apply equally, if not even more strongly, in the civil context."
1999.98-1255,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,302.461,306.92,"Do you adequately preserve it if you object and say, I want an extra peremptory?"
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,319.301,326.814,"Well, in our view it would...  it would not result in an error that would require reversal of the conviction."
1999.98-1255,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,326.814,329.415,Even if you have no peremptories left and the judge doesn't give you one?
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,329.415,337.505,Unless the...  the juror who you would have exercised the peremptory against is in fact a biased juror so that he sits on the jury...
1999.98-1255,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.505,337.877,"No, no."
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,339.075,359.032,"If he does not...  if he does not sit on the jury, our position is that the claim may be preserved, but the claim doesn't warrant relief because the costs to society are simply too high to reverse a conviction simply because a defendant has been deprived of, in that...  in the hypothetical that Your Honor has given, one peremptory challenge."
1999.98-1255,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,359.032,360.623,"So, there's never any prejudice."
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,363.223,374.74,"There will be prejudice, Justice Souter, if in fact the defendant is forced by virtue of the exhaustion of peremptory challenges to accept a juror on his panel who is biased."
1999.98-1255,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,374.74,375.112,Okay.
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,386.962,397.631,"If the Court accepts our primary harmless error theory that the only cognizable harm that the defendant can assert is the deprivation of an impartial jury, that's correct."
1999.98-1255,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,398.729,402.527,"But in...  in effect, you...  that...  that says, forget peremptories."
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,409.996,415.94,"Well, Justice Souter, it doesn't say to the litigants or to Federal trial judges, forget peremptories."
1999.98-1255,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,418.503,428.412,"Well, I think it says, forget them if the judge doesn't let you have them because the only issue that can be pursued is the issue of the biased juror who should have been excused for cause."
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,428.412,431.013,"Well, there are a variety of different scenarios that could come up."
1999.98-1255,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,452.477,455.738,"What if he...  what if he doesn't...  what if he, in fact, goes to trial?"
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,463.911,473.449,"That's correct, and I would expect that the appellate court would write a rather strong opinion that would admonish that trial judge and others in the circuit not to flout the rules of procedure."
1999.98-1255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,473.449,474.108,"Mr. Dreeben, what if..."
1999.98-1255,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,474.108,483.313,"Well, I suppose under your rule it works the other way around because if...  if...  I suppose the trial judge could say, you know, there's a lot of close for-cause issues here."
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,487.771,506.43,"Well, I think that a defendant would have a different objection in that case, which would be that there the...  the judge had essentially changed the way the peremptory challenges were...  were administered under settled rules of the common law, and therefore he could tell the judge that that is not the way that peremptory challenges are administered."
1999.98-1255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.545,509.198,Would he get a reversal on appeal?
1999.98-1255,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,509.198,509.485,Would he get an appeal?
1999.98-1255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.485,510.312,That's...  that's the issue.
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,512.746,513.116,That's right.
1999.98-1255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.116,513.943,on appeal unless there's been a...
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,539.661,541.685,This Court...
1999.98-1255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.685,543.748,And the biased juror is...  is then seated.
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,543.748,544.408,This...  this Court...
1999.98-1255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.408,551.261,"Now, is it the Government's position that he...  that there's no harm because he had a peremptory which he could have used to strike that biased juror?"
1999.98-1255,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,551.261,554.771,"I think that would be our position, Justice Scalia, but it's important to distinguish..."
1999.98-1255,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,554.771,556.462,Do you have a fall-back position?
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,1608.473,1624.637,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.764,1653.388,"That...  the error would not be harmless where a biased juror was, in fact, seated."
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,1654.337,1655.785,That...  that's correct.
1999.98-1255,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.864,1680.555,"But where...  where a biased juror has been seated, yes, you...  you would be able to claim that this error was harmful, but...  but that ability is totally superfluous."
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,1691.429,1692.444,"Well, I agree with that."
1999.98-1255,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1720.474,1731.825,"Yes, but the rule that you propose would turn every for-cause ruling of the judge into an automatic reversal it seems to me."
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,1731.825,1733.766,"Well, I...  I would disagree with that."
1999.98-1255,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1733.766,1735.252,And I think that would be troublesome.
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,1735.252,1739.05,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I would disagree with that characterization for two reasons."
1999.98-1255,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.517,1818.434,"I mean, why shouldn't...  why shouldn't your client have been put to the...  to the hard choice of if he was so sure about...  about the impropriety of seating this juror, he shouldn't have wasted one of his peremptories."
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,1821.322,1821.527,No.
1999.98-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1850.134,1852.735,"Well, that's...  that's one...  one...  that's one version certainly."
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,1873.434,1876.118,I think that's...  that's partially true.
1999.98-1255,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.972,1888.999,"But again, the...  the Government isn't...  doesn't have to say that you...  you were forced to use it."
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,1920.496,1921.033,I think...
1999.98-1255,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.033,1921.693,It was your choice.
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,1921.693,1926.068,"I think, Justice Scalia, that ignores the reality of the trial."
1999.98-1255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1956.904,1970.445,"But, Mr. Gordon, in this case there wasn't even the suggestion by counsel that if I had that extra peremptory, juror 10 would not have been on that panel."
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,1985.39,1990.524,"With all due respect, Justice Ginsburg, I disagree with that proposition for two reasons."
1999.98-1255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2034.363,2045.016,"For the record, he could have said, Your Honor, I've been obliged to use my peremptory, but I want it on the record that I would have used it against one of these jurors."
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,2045.016,2053.188,"Well, he...  the earliest possible opportunity he could have done that was not at the time the peremptory challenge...  or the for-cause challenge was denied."
1999.98-1255,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2103.799,2108.879,"Well, when he asked for a further perempt, wasn't it because a juror had been excused and was going to be replaced?"
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,2109.289,2110.403,That's correct.
1999.98-1255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2122.103,2132.694,"But that...  that absconding juror was, in fact, replaced by the alternate against whom no peremptory had been exercised."
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,2132.694,2141.405,"Well, that's...  well, we know that when the defense counsel and the Government are exercising peremptories, they focus at the very beginning of the panel."
1999.98-1255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2154.742,2159.777,But there could have been a peremptory challenge exercised against the alternate and there wasn't.
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,2159.777,2161.18,And I agree with that.
1999.98-1255,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2173.151,2173.234,Petit jury.
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,2173.234,2176.206,Petit jury?
1999.98-1255,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2183.554,2205.185,"But it is the case, isn't it, to make sure that I understand the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, that at the time the original panel selection plus the selection of an alternate was concluded, your client did not at that point go to the court or his counsel didn't go to the court and say, Judge, I want to exercise one more peremptory?"
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,2212.122,2213.609,That is absolutely correct.
1999.98-1255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2213.609,2217.157,How is the judge supposed to know that he's making a mistake?
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,2231.441,2232.927,I disagree with that.
1999.98-1255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.99,2236.355,What part do you disagree with?
1999.98-1255,1,35931,michael_gordon,,2236.355,2236.931,The part...
1999.98-1255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.931,2239.343,The part that judges aren't mind-readers or the part...
1999.98-1255,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3416.504,3428.93,"There are many things that a trial judge can do in orchestrating jury selection that have effects on the defendant's peremptory challenges that are equally severe, if not more severe than this one."
1999.98-1255,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3501.005,3502.286,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
