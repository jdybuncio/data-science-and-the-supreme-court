1977.77-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.99,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 77-10, Exxon Corporation against the Governor of Maryland and the related and consolidated cases."
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,16.902,20.727,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,246.864,253.779,"Mr. Simon there had been declining number of retail outlets in Maryland, haven't there, at the time this law was passed?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,253.779,292.778,"Yes Mr. Justice Rehnquist and as will point out later, the number of service stations of any kind and all kinds whether or not this act prevails will continue to decline because the economics of high prices in gasoline going from the $0.20, $0.25 range of the 50s to the $0.60 and $0.65 range of current prices makes it essential that we have high volume stations that can operate more economically and not have the inefficient marginal stations."
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,295.59,301.329,"You say it makes it essential, essential from whose point of view?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,301.329,313.838,First from the point of view of he who wants to compete for the motorist business and secondly for the motorist who wants to get the benefits of competition in the sale of his gasoline.
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,313.838,319.431,Well so essential that it can override Maryland policy on that point?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,319.431,358.776,"Well as I understand the decisions of this Court, a statute which burdens interstate commerce will be sustained only if the local benefits are so persuasive and so important as to override the restraint on interstate commerce which they impose and we submit that this mere matter of fair allocation which is already being done by the federal government and preventing monopoly which is already prevented by many statutes does not justify the restraint on completion which this statute imposes."
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,412.093,419.739,Well you advocated before the Maryland Legislature and they have turned you down and the question now I suppose is whether you have a constitutional claim?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,419.739,425.25,"Exactly, exactly."
1977.77-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,425.25,449.617,"And now traditionally though, have not the price cutters, so they were called by the majors, have not -- the price cutters, the small independents who just bought their gas catches catch can than the people who supplied a major share of price competition in the market, I am not speaking of Maryland specifically but over the country generally."
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,449.617,472.082,"No Mr. Chief Justice the motorist may not know it but the large share, certainly not all of it but over 50% of the price cutting gasoline is supplied by integrated refiner suppliers."
1977.77-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,517.645,520.63,"When you say the management, do you mean the management is running the station?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,520.63,527.014,"Yes sir, tell him exactly how to run it so as to achieve all of the economies of scale and tell him what to price."
1977.77-10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,527.014,532.878,Aren't there some areas where they buy the gas directly from the big companies?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,532.878,535.218,I have no doubt that that is true Mr. Justice Marshall --
1977.77-10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,535.218,536.689,Delivered at night --
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,536.689,537.158,Sir?
1977.77-10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,537.158,539.446,Delivered at night in --
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,539.446,547.808,"Oh, I don't believe that there is any secret made about it where it occurs, there is no secret about it where it occurs."
1977.77-10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,562.715,564.652,Is that in the record?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,564.652,565.996,"No sir, no sir."
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,671.857,684.948,Well is the state not entitled to prefer independently operated stations to the kind of perfect model of competition without violating the commerce clause?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,684.948,694.649,"We say no Mr. Justice Rehnquist, no more then North Carolina was entitled to prefer North Carolina apples over Washington apples in the Hunt case."
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.649,698.239,Well Maryland isn't preferring Maryland oil over other oil in this case.
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,698.239,717.296,"No but Maryland is preferring Maryland dealers, the pinch on competition, the squeeze on interstate commerce comes at he retail level and Maryland is preferring the local retailers against interstate sellers of gasoline at retail."
1977.77-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,717.296,724.635,But are not these local retailers characteristically the price cutters?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,724.635,727.838,"No sir, they are at the high price people."
1977.77-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,732.677,753.206,"Perhaps I was not on the same wavelength in terms what they're called, I'm talking about the individual station the independent who buys this gas wherever he can get it including as you suggest 50% of the major producers output frequently goes to these independents and it sold without a brand name."
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,770.861,789.583,I can't answer your question yes or no Mr. Chief Justice because the people that you obviously think as you drive down the street as an individual station who is a price cutter is more likely then not a part of a large chain.
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.533,863.587,Why is Shell appealing here?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,870.012,891.013,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it can be argued that Shell that I represent and Axon and there like would short termed be benefited by driving out these large chains of price cutters and I think in one sense they would."
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.739,950.591,Do you think the state of Maryland would be prohibited by the commerce clause from making a – the selling of gasoline a state monopoly?
1977.77-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,950.591,952.331,As Virginia does with liquor?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,952.331,952.767,Yes sir.
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,960.936,963.549,They couldn't do what Virginia has done with liquor?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,963.549,965.18,I think not.
1977.77-10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1001.787,1014.488,"Mr. Simon on the question of the interest of these big companies, is there anything in the record about the problem between least stations and company owned stations, in Maryland?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1014.488,1027.643,"No sir, only the fact is that less than 5% of the major oil company stations in Maryland are company operated and 95% of them are --"
1977.77-10,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1027.643,1030.577,(Inaudible) about the problem that I read about it in the newspapers?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1030.577,1032.766,No sir that -- that the --
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.766,1040.781,"Mr. Simon would you tell me how the -- you arguing burden on interstate commerce, how does it burden the interstate commerce?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1047.996,1052.114,Yes sir but it burdens into respect Mr. Justice White.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.969,1060.652,Which market?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1060.652,1065.303,The Maryland market they will be prohibitive from selling at retail in Maryland.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.303,1069.628,So how does that burden interstate commerce?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1069.628,1075.5,Because it denies them access that this Court has said many times that we all --
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.5,1098.195,Well let's say you have company owned station and you move -- and you supply your own stations and you have storage tanks at the stations you're keeping full and are you suggesting I guess you're that the sale by your company owned station out of that supply that's stored supply to a -- to a motorist is interstate commerce?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1098.195,1101.275,Certainly it affects interstate commerce and –-
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.275,1103.023,"Well, it isn't thought is it?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1103.023,1108.98,Well there are many Sherman Act cases involving retail sales of gasoline where this Court has held that the --
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.98,1117.121,I know but that is -- that maybe a Sherman act matter of effect but I'm talking about the constitutional burden on interstate commerce.
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1117.121,1118.248,Well if the burden on --
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.248,1124.241,"Just because something affects interstate commerce, it doesn't mean its an unconstitutional burden?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1124.241,1128.078,"No sir, no sir, but may I give you this example."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1169.223,1185.752,"Let me ask you -- are there any examples in, I suppose there must be a lot of them, where the out of state or the out of state refiner or wholesaler sells directly to a consumer other than through a company owned station?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1185.752,1188.717,If you mean consumer literally yes Mr. Justice White.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.717,1199.725,"Say there's a big truck line that uses gasoline and so you -- do you send your supply you're tank wagons directly to them, from out of state directly to them?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1199.725,1200.715,Yes sir.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.834,1203.75,Is that -- does this forbid that?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1203.75,1207.009,No sir this law relates solely to dealers Your Honor.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1207.009,1212.291,So I can be a dealer if you sell -- why does that exempt that?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1212.291,1216.847,This law applies solely to service -- retail service stations.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.847,1219.256,Yeah but you're selling at retail to this truck line?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1219.256,1221.57,Yes it but the law does not prevent it.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1222.418,1225.899,"Well, then I ask you again how does it burden interstate commerce --"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1225.899,1239.258,"It burdens -- it burdens interstate commerce Mr. Justice White in two reasons, in two ways; one it prevents on out of state refiner from operating a retail gasoline station --"
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1239.258,1241.26,And selling direct to the consumer?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1241.26,1252.93,And selling direct to the consumer and secondly it dines the consumer the benefits of competition furnished to him by out of state refiners.
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1282.258,1294.109,"But the commerce clause isn't though basically protect consumers, it's to prevent barriers erected by one state to people who want to do business and then on the same terms as people who are there?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1294.109,1299.041,"Exactly, exactly Mr. Rehnquist Justice, I couldn't have said it better."
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1313.774,1318.719,Well all you have to do is sell your gas to an independent retailer.
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1318.719,1322.137,Yeah but then we can't do business at retail.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1326.182,1339.852,"Well, here -- but critical your argument then is selling -- that selling gasoline at retail to motorists in Maryland is a matter of concern to interstate commerce."
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1339.852,1341.605,Yes Mr. Justice White because --
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.605,1343.711,Within the meaning of the constitution --
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1343.711,1364.464,"And having in mind that there are no refineries in Maryland, it's all out of state gasoline, having in mind that these refiners like Ashland sell a very substantial part of their refinery runs of gasoline through their own retail stations on a basis of low price."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1423.076,1428.382,I take it your only attack on the sections you've been talking about as the burden on interstate government?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1428.382,1429.088,Yes Your Honor.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.088,1435.47,You're not claiming a privilege and immunity to be able to sell at retail if Maryland people can sell at retail?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1435.47,1437.651,"No, no Mr. Justice White."
1977.77-10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1437.651,1442.862,Well one of the -- one of the appellants is right relaying on the Due Process Clause of --
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1442.862,1456.224,Yes Continental relies on the Due Process Clause but I believe Mr. Justice Stewart and their basis is that as to sea which applies to stations in already existence.
1977.77-10,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1471.025,1474.987,But – argument under the commerce -- it's under the different provision of the Constitution.
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1474.987,1476.391,Yes it is Mr. Justice Stewart.
1977.77-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1476.391,1491.781,"Mr. Simon we've been taking up a good deal of your time, and perhaps we do the same with your friends, we'll enlarge the time for 10 minutes for you and that will enable the Attorney General to give his colleague equal time if he wishes to, you'll have an additional 10."
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1491.781,1493.892,Thank you sir.
1977.77-10,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.782,1620.516,"Mr. Simon, can you give me an example of compliance with the Maryland Statute that would violate the Robinson-Patman Act?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1620.516,1625.597,"Yes, the example I just gave --"
1977.77-10,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1625.597,1629.231,"That to have a uniform price throughout the state, you don't have a price discrimination?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1629.231,1634.68,"Well, let's assume for the moment that you have a price war in Baltimore."
1977.77-10,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.68,1641.803,"Whatever caused it, as long as your price is uniform throughout the state, you don't have price differential to even trigger 2(a)."
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1641.803,1651.406,Well you have two problems Mr. Justice Stevens; one is Maryland borders the District of Columbia -- Virginia --
1977.77-10,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.406,1654.92,Are you talking about differential between the State of Maryland and nearby states?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1654.92,1656.198,"Yes sir, I am talking about Silver Spring --"
1977.77-10,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1656.198,1662.724,"But don't you always have where you have different taxes and that sort of thing, isn't there typically a price differential when you cross state lines?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1662.724,1693.218,"There are typically differentials, but where a price war gets the differential to six, seven, eight, nine cents a gallon, that is not the kind of differential that is typical and you can have the problem of a differential with the dealer across the street at the state line particularly in the State of Maryland which borders so many states and where there are so many cities like Washington and Wilmington that are literally across the street from Maryland."
1977.77-10,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1693.218,1701.397,"It's the remote possibility, isn't it, six to seven cent differential between a uniform price throughout the State of Maryland and price across the State of Maryland?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1701.397,1716.596,Well I must confess to you Mr. Justice Stevens that I am positive in my own mind that the authors of this bill intended to make -- giving a price assistance to a dealer so costly that it would never be done.
1977.77-10,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1716.596,1719.423,Doesn't the state have the authority to do that?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1725.485,1727.158,Not at all.
1977.77-10,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.559,1739.988,"-- contrary to the 2(b) of the Robinson-Patman Act, but the basic philosophy of the Robinson-Patman Act is very similar."
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1745.562,1757.366,"But Mr. Justice Stevens, I am sure you know that this Court has many times sought to balance the anticompetitive problems of Robinson-Patman with the Sherman Act."
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.563,1779.926,Well –-
1977.77-10,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1779.926,1787.422,"If Maryland said that gasoline will be sold at $0.75 a gallon in our state, would that be unconstitutional?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1787.422,1788.144,"Well, I think so."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.236,1859.631,"You are saying that although Congress says you don't violate the Robinson-Patman Act if you are lowering your price to meet the price of a competitor, you are saying that a state may not have the contrary rule, a state may not say that you may not lower your price to meet the price of a competitor, are you suggesting that?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1859.631,1864.355,"Yes, because I say that frustrates the congressional intent of Congress --"
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1864.355,1869.79,Well it was just saying – all Congress has said as you don't violate the Robinson-Patman Act if you do that?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1869.79,1875.178,But the Robinson-Patman Act represents Mr. Justice White a congressional policy.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1875.178,1878.306,It doesn't say -- Robinson-Patman doesn't say you have to?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1878.306,1879.641,No sir.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.781,1882.792,And the state just says you can?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1882.792,1891.466,"But, in 2(b) this Court has held that Congress gave sellers an absolute right to reduce their price to meet competition."
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.466,1900.847,"Well, a minute ago you said how Robinson-Patman has been so tempered by the Sherman Act and now you say it's a fundamental congressional policy."
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1900.847,1908.838,"Well, I don't suggest for a minute that this Court has amended the Robinson-Patman Act in any of its decisions."
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.231,1947.964,It simply says he doesn't violate the Robinson-Patman Act if he does that?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1947.964,1949.504,Yes.
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1970.741,1980.325,Well you say then the Robinson-Patman which the Court has viewed is kind of an intrusion on the Sherman Act nonetheless preempts the field when it comes to the state legislature?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,1980.325,1985.041,I would not go so far as to say the Court has viewed it as an intrusion.
1977.77-10,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2012.827,2027.564,"Mr. Simon, let me put it this way, because I am slightly confused, are you arguing that there is a constitutional right to engage in conduct that is protected by the 2(b) defense?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2027.564,2060.678,"Well, I think the short answer is, yes, a little longer answer is that under the Supremacy Clause of the constitution we say that the State of Maryland cannot deprive us of a competitive right which the Congress has granted under 2(b) and which this Court in 1951 in Standard Oil said was an absolute defense to a charge of price discrimination no matter how serious the harm and the injury were that it caused."
1977.77-10,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2060.678,2067.757,"Well, it just seems to me you are arguing that there is a constitutional right to engage in something that's protected by a 2 (b) defense."
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2072.469,2101.581,"Well, I think Mr. Justice Blackmun we have exactly the problem that was in Perez where the Bankruptcy Act said that if you go through -- you're discharged in bankruptcy, you don't owe anybody any money anymore, and the State of Arizona passed a law which says if you have a judgment against you for negligence in operation of an automobile, you may not get a driver's license till you pay that judgment."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.707,2166.0,But now the Robinson-Patman Act doesn't require anybody to lower his price to meet a competitor?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2166.0,2169.342,But the one thing -- and I believe --
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2169.342,2179.989,And all it does is permit them to do it without violating Robinson-Patman Act and you are saying Maryland cannot prevent meeting competition that way?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2179.989,2189.955,"But Federal Law, Federal Policy which is reflected not only in the Sherman Act but in the Robinson-Patman Act as well is pro-competition."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.505,2203.499,That certainly is the effect of the law?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2203.499,2210.617,"It's anticompetitive Mr. Justice White, it seeks to make the price of reducing the cost."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.617,2212.655,"It costs you; it's really going to cost you, right?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2212.655,2214.992,It seems to make the cost so high --
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.992,2216.139,That you are not going to lower the price?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2216.139,2222.886,"That nobody will do it and certainly if they passed the law and said, you couldn't reduce your price, that would be unconstitutional."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.886,2226.18,Would you mind if I went back to your first argument just for a moment?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2226.18,2227.978,No sir.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.978,2244.155,I take it that Maryland Law does not forbid just chains of wholesalers -- from a wholesaler who owns a chain of service stations to operate in Maryland.
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2244.155,2246.333,"As introduced, it did."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.333,2247.027,"Yes, but it doesn't."
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2247.027,2250.767,And the wholesalers that have a little more power have a --
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2250.767,2273.146,"Let's assume -- well, however it came about, let's assume I have a wholesaling chain of service stations, the headquarters are in Pennsylvania and they buy their gasoline from producers or refiners and have their own delivery system from outside the state into Maryland and they have a string of stations in Maryland, now that's not forbidden by them?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2273.146,2277.401,"So long as you do not integrate backward and buy a little refinery, you are exempted."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.401,2285.855,"So it's a discrimination against producers and refiners, it isn't – it's not a -- why is it a discrimination or a burden on the state commerce?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2285.855,2286.533,Because --
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.533,2288.583,That kind of commerce is going to --
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2288.583,2313.902,"Because the record shows that it is the out of state refiners who produce the competition in the marketplace in Maryland, and that it is that very competition which the legislature sought to eliminate to protect the high price major brand dealers so they wouldn't have to compete with these lower price people."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.902,2320.605,The interstate -- the Constitution doesn't say that every burden on competition is bad.
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2324.794,2344.634,"Yes sir, but I can only say Mr. Justice White that this burden is far greater than that one in Hunt or in Raymond Transport or in Cottrell or in the Bruce case, the cantaloupe case in Arizona for this far greater restraint on competition here than in any of those cases."
1977.77-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2344.634,2349.776,"But they didn't turn competition, they turned down commerce, didn't they, the movement of goods?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2349.776,2356.655,But in each of those cases the restraint on commerce was much less than that here.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.872,2371.546,"But in the long run the same amount of gasoline is going to come into Maryland, isn't it?"
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2371.546,2376.388,"But, it's going to cost the Maryland motorist a lot more money, a lot more money."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.388,2377.06,May be.
1977.77-10,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2377.06,2379.475,You are going to end your rebuttal time now.
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2379.475,2384.417,I appreciate the extra time and I realize I understand --
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.417,2386.501,May I ask you one question before you sit down?
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2397.556,2400.73,"No sir, at least not in the oil industry."
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.73,2404.355,I am not talking about the retail grocery business actually.
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2404.355,2406.717,I do not know of any challenge.
1977.77-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.701,2416.599,"Yeah, I know you would."
1977.77-10,0,46195,william_simon,,2417.828,2420.13,Thank you.
