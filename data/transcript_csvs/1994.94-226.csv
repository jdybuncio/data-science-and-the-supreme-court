1994.94-226,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.409,"We'll hear argument next in case number 94-226, Florida Bar v. G. Stewart McHenry."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,78.873,90.811,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.94-226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.704,192.525,Does Florida permit lawyers to solicit business in person?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,192.525,193.787,"No, ma'am, it does not."
1994.94-226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.27,281.034,How do you distinguish this case from that of Shapero?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,282.776,292.461,"Justice O'Connor, I believe that this case can be distinguished from Shapero on the basis of the fact that it is a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction."
1994.94-226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.461,296.906,"Well, doesn't a time, place, and manner restriction have to be content-neutral?"
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,296.906,298.946,"It does, and we believe that--"
1994.94-226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.946,300.238,How is this content-neutral?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,300.238,307.05,"--Well, we believe it is content-neutral within the scope of what this Court has interpreted as content-neutral."
1994.94-226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.329,343.816,"But doesn't this regulation address only certain types of speech, and it's there with reference to a particular kind of speech?"
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,343.816,347.428,"Yes, Justice Connor, it does, but this Court has never--"
1994.94-226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,347.428,348.109,O'Connor.
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,348.109,358.315,"--has never said that simply because you must make reference to the content in order to determine whether or not it falls within the scope of the regulation, that it therefore violates the content-neutral rule."
1994.94-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,358.315,365.11,"Yes, but you justify this regulation by what the communication says."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,365.11,367.601,We justify it--
1994.94-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,367.601,371.014,And that was not true in the cases that you've cited.
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,371.014,373.075,--It justifies... I'm sorry.
1994.94-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,373.075,379.75,"Here, you do justify the regulation in terms of the content of the communication."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,381.13,382.221,"Well, Just--"
1994.94-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,382.221,388.164,"Now, you might... you might still prevail, but it's not content-neutral."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,388.164,397.441,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, I would suggest that it's justified by the nature of the person to whom the communication is sent, the circumstances of that individual."
1994.94-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,436.496,441.96,But do you think the effect on the person to whom the message is addressed is a secondary effect within the meaning of Renton?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,441.96,446.652,"--Well, that... that is, Your Honor, if you're talking about the effect upon that individual."
1994.94-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,447.693,450.646,"In Renton, you're not talking about the people who wanted to go to these theaters."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,450.646,451.357,"--Well, you are--"
1994.94-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,451.357,452.556,You're talking about what it did to the neighborhood.
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,452.556,455.839,--You're talking about the effect upon the community and the surrounding area.
1994.94-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,455.839,457.949,Not the audience or the message.
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,460.741,478.064,"What we're suggesting, Your Honor, is that the State has the right to determine that it has a secondary effect upon the legal profession as a whole and, in turn, the administration of justice, and that the ability of the State to make that judgment has been entirely removed by this Court's prior opinions."
1994.94-226,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,478.064,495.576,"What the State is saying, then, is that a certain number of lawyers will chase ambulances if we don't prohibit them, and it's going to make the whole bar look bad if they find out that these people are chasing ambulances, therefore we'll prohibit it."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,498.477,531.347,"What we're talking about, Justice Rehnquist, is the extent to which we are going to permit the States to make these judgments, as opposed to the extent to which the Federal courts are going to micromanage the question of attorney advertising, and what's happened here is that as a matter of law, essentially this Court has said that the question of whether or not a given type of attorney advertising will have an adverse effect upon the view of the public as to lawyers and the institutions that they serve is beyond the scope of State consideration."
1994.94-226,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,531.347,545.168,"Well, but is it really a terribly legitimate State goal to say, we want to protect not the substance of the reputation of the legal profession but the appearance of the reputation?"
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,545.168,547.459,"Well, Your Honor, I believe it is."
1994.94-226,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,558.425,560.866,"Personal injury lawyers, not probate lawyers."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,585.464,591.156,"--Well, that's indistinguishable, Justice Ginsburg, I would suggest, from the Renton situation with adult films."
1994.94-226,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,604.035,622.018,"I don't see how, in terms of your justification, the privacy of the person, it makes any difference whether the person who is making the solicitation is an insurance adjuster for the other side, or a potential defendant's lawyer, or a probate lawyer."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,633.084,643.983,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, that may well be true, and it's an issue that was addressed by this Court in Ohralik, where they mentioned precisely what Your Honor is saying with regard to the possibility of adjusters contacting individuals."
1994.94-226,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,662.196,669.048,"Did Ohralik say only personal injury lawyers can't have face-to-face contact, or was this all lawyers?"
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,669.048,676.033,"--That is what the rule says, but this Court has said time and time again... well, it doesn't define the lawyer."
1994.94-226,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,711.708,723.284,Does the State bar regard this Court's decision in Edenfield v. Fane as a guiding light in this area?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,746.72,753.385,"The Edenfield case was a case of limited application, and we do not have a problem with Edenfield."
1994.94-226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,916.152,931.84,"So suppose that in Florida... I can... suppose there's been a bad accident, and it involves a man or a woman who knows nothing about law, so obviously they're terribly upset, and I can understand why you might want to keep lawyers away from them for 30 days."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,955.225,957.498,"Well, there are numerous ways to do it."
1994.94-226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,965.904,968.305,I'm not asking you... I wanted a factual answer.
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,981.852,982.653,--Both of--
1994.94-226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,982.653,983.905,Is there a lawyer referral service--
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,984.855,985.346,"--Yes, ma'am."
1994.94-226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,989.289,989.93,How does it work?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,989.93,996.882,You call the bar and they make available to you from a list of lawyers those who have indicated that they handle that type of work.
1994.94-226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1016.497,1019.218,Do lawyers advertise on television in Florida?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1019.218,1020.107,"Yes, they do."
1994.94-226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1020.107,1021.95,Personal injury lawyers?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1021.95,1022.749,"Yes, they do."
1994.94-226,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1022.749,1025.881,And do they advertise on billboards in Florida?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1025.881,1033.217,"I'm not aware of whether or not we have billboard advertising, but this Court's decision in Shapero would not allow the State to control billboard advertising."
1994.94-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1037.29,1038.95,But should we be con--
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1048.116,1054.051,"The bar takes no position as to that, because it believes it is not permitted to as a result of this Court's decisions."
1994.94-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.051,1058.294,"Did the bar association... I'm talking about the bar association, not individual lawyers."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1064.957,1075.416,"Oh, yes, sir, and as a matter of fact it has publications that it attempts to widely distribute, it has public service announcements that it distributes, all of which a bar is entitled to do as a public service in the Florida--"
1994.94-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.416,1078.879,And they mail those to the accident victim within the 30-day period after the accident?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1078.879,1083.549,--I'm not aware of any practice by the Florida Bar to mail things to any victims.
1994.94-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1083.549,1092.025,"I'm just wondering if it would be consistent with your position here to say maybe we should prohibit it because they don't want to be... they're... you know, they're emotionally disturbed during that 30-day period."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1092.025,1095.147,"Well, I would like to address that, Justice Stevens."
1994.94-226,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1139.736,1140.996,Within limits.
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1143.299,1144.179,--That's correct.
1994.94-226,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1145.07,1151.304,"Indeed, you supported... you came in as a friend of this Court and said the State is not permitted to have that kind of regulation."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1151.304,1159.829,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and we were happy with the opinion that you wrote in the case, and the opinion was a unanimous opinion, and we had no problem with Ibanez whatsoever."
1994.94-226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1179.742,1182.394,"Well, maybe you want to add a word or two."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1222.821,1224.661,--Justice Breyer--
1994.94-226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1224.661,1227.383,"One way is they'll write him a letter, and then he'll know somebody's interested."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1227.383,1229.384,--I'd like to give you several responses to that.
1994.94-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.283,1305.135,May I follow up on how this works?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1320.175,1321.716,"Yes, he is, or she is."
1994.94-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1321.716,1329.749,How does... that's... is there some exception to the written communications rule that you quote at page 2?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1336.053,1344.602,Florida interprets that rule not to prohibit it once a contact has been made with the lawyer and he has a relationship with the potential client.
1994.94-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1352.977,1359.259,What about... suppose a relative of a client writes... tells the attorney please write my nephew?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1359.259,1362.32,"Your Honor, you're asking me questions now that I don't know the answer to."
1994.94-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1371.126,1382.706,"Well, we have to examine the regulation as it's given to us, and as I read it, at least in the case that I put the lawyer could not write the client, or the proposed client."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1382.706,1390.781,"Florida I can tell you doesn't interpret it that way, but the question of that interpretation was never an issue in this case, and--"
1994.94-226,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1390.781,1392.692,Mr. Richard... I'm sorry.
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1395.112,1437.712,"--I was just going to point out that there's a significant distinction between what Your Honor is suggesting and a mass mailing of innumerable letters to an individual who has just been involved in an accident or a personal tragedy at any point and who has not sought any lawyer, and finds a virtual feeding frenzy taking place as to who that individual is going to select as a lawyer, or whether that individual is going to select anybody, and the issue here which this Court has recognized is that there is a substantial State interest in protecting the professional standards of the bar, and the question is what does that mean, and I would suggest--"
1994.94-226,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1437.712,1442.904,I thought your... I thought your primary justification was protecting those who were in shock and grief.
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1442.904,1444.266,"--Well, we--"
1994.94-226,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1444.266,1449.408,"And you said, we don't want to trivialize this case by saying we're simply trying to protect the image of the bar."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1449.408,1450.34,--We see--
1994.94-226,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1450.34,1456.973,I took it from that that your primary justification is the sensibilities of the people to whom the letters would be addressed.
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1456.973,1461.767,"--Justice Souter, we have advanced two separate substantial interests."
1994.94-226,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1481.219,1521.655,"Well, if that is the... to the extent that that is the justification, may I take you back to the underinclusiveness point, because the issue that is raised by that is the extent to which the regulation in question really does have any substantial effect in accomplishing your object, and when it is as underinclusive as this is... insurance adjusters can get in touch with them, potential defendants can get in touch with them, probate lawyers can get in touch with them, and so on... isn't that a rather heavy mark against your justification, to be as underinclusive as that?"
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1521.655,1525.929,"--Well, the Florida supreme court, and the Florida Bar prior to that, perceived a particular problem."
1994.94-226,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1537.155,1538.697,"Well, I have no doubt of that."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1555.157,1561.973,"--Well, this Court has said in a number of cases that underinclusiveness is not itself unconstitutional."
1994.94-226,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1561.973,1569.186,"No, but it goes very much to the question of the degree to which your regulation advances the interest that you claim."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1569.186,1570.768,I think that's correct.
1994.94-226,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1570.768,1578.993,"I suppose one reason for the underinclusiveness, if it be that, is that the Florida bar can't regulate insurance adjusters."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1578.993,1582.255,"Well, that is an answer, Your Honor, and that's correct."
1994.94-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.497,1586.249,"No, but it can regulate defense lawyers and probate lawyers."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1586.249,1592.942,"--It can regulate defense lawyers, but Florida apparently has not perceived a problem with defense lawyers inundating an individual who's been... who has been injured."
1994.94-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.942,1595.275,"There can only be one defense lawyer at a time, I suppose."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1600.859,1604.41,"You know, Your Honor, the lower court here didn't strike--"
1994.94-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.41,1606.382,What is the evidence that there's these mass mailings?
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1615.077,1617.689,"--That's not in the record, Your Honor, and I don't know the answer to that question."
1994.94-226,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1617.689,1635.961,"--Mr. Richard, for purposes of judging this case, do we have to simply... do we not, in fact, simply assume that what is being used here is State power, and therefore it... as a practical matter it's the State rather than a bar association as such which is being judged by First Amendment standards?"
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1637.443,1638.071,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-226,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1658.805,1668.032,And one of those justices made the point that several of the questions you've received are trying to get at... Justice Shaw.
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1689.175,1703.866,"We think here are numerous ways in which the Florida bar and the Florida supreme court through the bar can remedy that problem, which is essentially a problem of the social question of how we make people aware of the accessibility of legal services."
1994.94-226,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.114,1807.342,"Thank you, Mr. Richard."
1994.94-226,0,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1808.905,1810.374,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-226,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.374,1810.985,Mr. Rogow.
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1810.985,1815.357,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-226,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.748,1913.262,"Well, certainly some of our cases, Mr. Rogow, in the commercial speech area have said that the Government can confront evils one step at a time."
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1919.195,1923.669,"It is true, Mr. Chief Justice, but there are several problems with this."
1994.94-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.283,1946.344,Why can't they say--
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1964.656,1966.797,"Justice Scalia, the change--"
1994.94-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.797,1967.998,That's been a long tradition.
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1967.998,1971.59,"--It has, and lawyers are treated differently."
1994.94-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.272,1977.843,So at least insurance adjusters are irrelevant.
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1977.843,1986.84,"No, I don't think they're irrelevant when the purpose stated by the bar, Justice Scalia, is to protect the privacy of people at moments when they've had an accident."
1994.94-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1986.84,1987.701,That's one purpose.
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1994.146,2000.179,"The State has made this argument, which basically is an image and dignity argument."
1994.94-226,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.442,2049.811,"Well, Mr. Rogow, supposing the bar were to conclude, and the Florida supreme court should agree, that this kind of solicitation gives an impression to people who receive it that lawyers are extremely greedy, and very anxious to make a lot of money."
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2060.427,2066.853,"--I do not think it could try to prevent that image by trying to preclude truthful, nonmisleading speech."
1994.94-226,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.746,2090.908,"Well, what if the Florida State Bar tries that and it just doesn't work."
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2095.62,2101.046,"--We have fought an image issue for a long time, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2108.8,2116.454,We should probably pass a statute saying you can't say un-nice things about lawyers.
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2122.398,2123.92,"I'm sorry, Mr. Justice Souter?"
1994.94-226,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2123.92,2126.041,Not admit greedy people to practice law.
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2126.041,2131.496,Justice Breyer--
1994.94-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.496,2140.043,I'm certainly glad I never passed through the stage of being a lawyer before--
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2198.069,2207.095,"--Well, Justice Breyer, grief is not the gravamen of this rule and, indeed, there are two other portions of the rule that address that."
1994.94-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.329,2255.999,"Yes, but your opponent says it's not one letter, it's a flood of letters, and as I understand it you said there's nothing in the record, and I haven't read this, but they do refer to a study that the bar made that indicated that this was regarded as a problem of some magnitude."
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2255.999,2270.297,"The study that the bar made was made of 200 people in 1987 who apparently received direct mail letters, and something like 11 percent, or 21, said that they were offended by receiving the direct mail letters."
1994.94-226,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2283.855,2286.747,"Well, do you think your client is sensitive to such matters?"
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2296.534,2297.524,"--It is a lawyer, Justice O'Connor."
1994.94-226,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2307.25,2309.932,"--Went For It, Inc., and do you represent Went For It, Inc.?"
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2309.932,2310.883,"I do, and--"
1994.94-226,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2310.883,2321.459,"And would you describe for us just what it is that Went For It, Inc. does in Florida to contact accident victims?"
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2332.746,2351.599,"--It does not, Justice O'Connor, because as a referral agency, all it can do is identify people who may be in need of this information and then a lawyer can obtain that information from the referral service, but the referral service is bound by the same rules as the lawyer is, and that's why Went For It, Inc. is a plaintiff also in the case."
1994.94-226,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2351.599,2355.932,"Yes, but I... it gets information about accidents and then--"
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2355.932,2358.444,Shares them with lawyers.
1994.94-226,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2358.444,2362.956,--shares that with lawyers who send letters to these victims.
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2362.956,2370.593,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, letters that are highly regulated by the bar that must include a statement of the lawyer's qualifications that are at the same moment--"
1994.94-226,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2370.593,2371.101,And what does it do?
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2374.454,2377.946,"--Police reports, accident reports, which are matters of public record."
1994.94-226,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2377.946,2381.75,"And presumably it also runs ads, does it?"
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2381.75,2382.451,It does not.
1994.94-226,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2383.48,2385.523,"Do the lawyers run some ads, do you--"
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2385.523,2401.401,"Well, some lawyers may run advertisements of different sorts, but whether or not they run an advertisement of their availability is different from running an advertisement saying, I am in the referral business."
1994.94-226,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2401.401,2411.438,--The service Went For It provides is finding names of victims and furnishing them to lawyers who pay them for that information--
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2411.438,2412.33,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1994.94-226,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2412.33,2412.798,--is that it?
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2412.798,2413.259,Yes.
1994.94-226,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2418.652,2426.569,"Mr. Rogow, maybe you could just go back and amplify your statement that these letters are highly regulated."
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2430.21,2434.954,"--Well, actually, there is, Justice Ginsburg, although it's not in this record."
1994.94-226,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2455.337,2468.936,"Could... does the bar, or could it, consistent with the First Amendment, require pre-screening of letters, solicitation letters that are going to be sent out within the first 30 days, or ever?"
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2468.936,2491.511,"I don't think the bar could... could require pre-screening, and one of the problems is, is that this delay in the access to information is inconsistent with the notion that it is important for people to have information quickly, and I think that the bar agrees, and has stated in its brief, that it is important to communicate to people the availability of legal services."
1994.94-226,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2494.593,2498.695,"Not letter-by-letter, but the attorney's own form letter."
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2498.695,2504.69,I... perhaps the bar could request these letters and look at them.
1994.94-226,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2622.138,2625.71,"What do you refer to as the institutional speech cases, Mr. Rogow?"
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2625.71,2627.682,"--Pardon me, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1994.94-226,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2627.682,2631.404,You referred to the institutional speech cases.
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2634.035,2649.854,"Kuhlmeier, Hazelwood v. School District, whether or not schoolchildren can publish things, Goldman, the yarmulke case in the military, situations in which there is custody and control in employment and property interests at stake of the Government."
1994.94-226,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2664.105,2677.252,Do you think there's room for any more regulation under the commercial speech doctrine for people who are licensed by the State to carry out their duties?
1994.94-226,1,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2700.019,2722.403,"--It is true, Justice O'Connor, and they are more highly regulated, and yet that regulation must be delicate, because the lawyer's work informing people of their rights, remedying wrongs, redressing grievances, may be more important than selling shoes, and so it needs to be able to be communicated if it's truthful and nonmisleading, and that's exactly what this case is about."
1994.94-226,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2733.5,2737.002,"Thank you, Mr. Richard."
