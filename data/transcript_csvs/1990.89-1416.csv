1990.89-1416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.189,"We'll hear argument now on No. 89-1416, Air Courier Conference of America v. American Postal Workers Union."
1990.89-1416,0,34446,l_peter_farkas,,75.797,78.23,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.978,286.061,"Could you speak up a little bit, Mr. Farkas."
1990.89-1416,0,34446,l_peter_farkas,,289.78,296.6,--In 1979... can you hear me now?
1990.89-1416,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,445.78,457.504,"Did you raise below the jurisdictional question at all, whether it was appropriately brought under the Administrative Procedure Act?"
1990.89-1416,0,34446,l_peter_farkas,,457.504,466.277,"No, we did not and we disagree with the Government that that issue was either properly raised here and we also disagree with their position on the merits of that issue."
1990.89-1416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.806,624.179,"Is this, is this really an argument or is it part of an argument that the statute doesn't provide the private cause of action to anybody?"
1990.89-1416,0,34446,l_peter_farkas,,624.179,626.781,"--No, this is not a private cause of action case."
1990.89-1416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,641.957,652.829,"At the time of the debate on the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, was any of that debate addressed to the merits of the private express statute?"
1990.89-1416,0,34446,l_peter_farkas,,652.829,653.681,"No, it wasn't."
1990.89-1416,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,717.422,719.874,"Well, that's parallel with their contention here, isn't it?"
1990.89-1416,0,34446,l_peter_farkas,,725.61,737.668,"Well, they are being inconsistent in the sense that, Justice Kennedy, that they were opposed to the Postal Reorganization Act because they thought it would cost them jobs."
1990.89-1416,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,738.435,739.287,"Well, they're still saying that."
1990.89-1416,0,34446,l_peter_farkas,,739.287,741.204,"--Well, but they're--"
1990.89-1416,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,741.204,746.941,And then it shows they have a continuing interest in the enforcement and the operation of this statute.
1990.89-1416,0,34446,l_peter_farkas,,751.345,758.749,"--Well, but Congress has spoken by passing... by passing the Postal Reorganization Act over their objections, and Congress--"
1990.89-1416,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,758.749,759.368,"Well, the question is whether the--"
1990.89-1416,0,34446,l_peter_farkas,,759.368,761.651,--That's not their intention to save postal jobs.
1990.89-1416,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,761.651,767.437,"--Well, it was... it was to keep jobs in some stat, in... at some level."
1990.89-1416,0,34446,l_peter_farkas,,767.437,778.579,"In any event, the purposes of the private express statutes are not clarified or helped by the Postal Reorganization Act."
1990.89-1416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,799.993,802.528,"Very well, Mr. Farkas."
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,804.147,821.358,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.525,854.912,"Well, Mr. Larkin the Government did not petition for review in this case."
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,854.912,855.412,Correct.
1990.89-1416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,855.412,859.131,"And it's simply here is a respondent, right?"
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,859.131,859.564,Correct.
1990.89-1416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,859.564,863.435,Is it permitted to raise a separate question from that raised by the petitioners?
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,863.435,864.968,"Normally, no."
1990.89-1416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.172,873.307,What's the authority for that exception?
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,873.307,889.133,"The exception would be where the matter is jurisdictional, and we think that the way this Court discussed this type of issue in the case of Block v. Community Nutrition Institute that it treated these types of issues as being... as the Court said in Block... in effect jurisdictional."
1990.89-1416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,931.079,934.947,Even though... even though not jurisdictional in any strict sense of the word at all.
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,934.947,942.285,"Well, the term ""jurisdictional"", Your Honor, is one, I readily admit, has been used to cover a variety of different types of claims."
1990.89-1416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1004.794,1005.294,A narrow one.
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1005.294,1006.96,A narrow one.
1990.89-1416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1037.313,1039.365,That surely is not a jurisdictional argument.
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1039.365,1040.048,True.
1990.89-1416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.108,1063.147,"Mr. Larkin, in addition to the APA problem I guess there's also the question whether the postal express statutes create a private cause of action, and of course you say, you say they don't."
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1065.416,1082.294,"Well, there is indication of that in the case that is cited in footnote 4 in the Block opinion, which is the Amtrak case, where in that case the Court resolved a cause of action issue without, to the best of my recollection, resolving a different type of standing issue."
1990.89-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1108.06,1110.861,"Mr. Larkin, you didn't raise this below?"
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1110.861,1112.563,"Correct, we made a mistake."
1990.89-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1112.563,1118.633,"Well, do you know of any other instance where we take up a point that wasn't raised below?"
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1118.633,1133.977,"Well, generally the Court doesn't resolve questions that weren't raised below, but for example, if the Court believes it's necessary properly to resolve the case... yesterday's opinion is some indication that the Court will resolve the case at least on a basis that wasn't--"
1990.89-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1133.977,1134.843,Do you know--
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1134.843,1135.679,--argued by the parties.
1990.89-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1135.679,1140.631,"--Do you know of any instance, other than the one you gave, where this has been done?"
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1140.631,1143.516,"Not off the top of my head, no."
1990.89-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1143.516,1146.551,Off of any other part?
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1147.486,1150.438,You've got... the rest of me can't come up with an answer either.
1990.89-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1159.877,1162.329,"Well, what is different from that and an amicus curiae?"
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1162.329,1168.066,"--Well, we, as a respondent, I don't think, Your Honor, don't have any greater right to--"
1990.89-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1168.066,1171.268,The trouble is you can't be a respondent and an amicus curiae.
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1171.268,1172.152,--Correct.
1990.89-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1172.152,1174.304,But aren't you doing just that?
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1174.304,1175.637,I don't think so.
1990.89-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1179.958,1180.941,"Well, you won't."
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1182.224,1188.811,"--But it is... it is the way we looked at the case, and we think that it's one that the Court could decide."
1990.89-1416,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.032,1198.734,"Mr. Larkin, in the case that we decided yesterday... I assume you're referring to Arcadia?"
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1198.734,1199.784,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-1416,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.784,1222.932,"There, it was difficult to decide correctly the issue that was initially presented, namely whether you needed a conflict or there was field preemption, without first deciding... it bore upon that question whether the field you're talking about was the entirety of FURC jurisdiction."
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1233.657,1236.942,I think that bears on my answer to what I gave to Justice White.
1990.89-1416,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.942,1238.242,"Which I didn't understand, I guess."
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1238.242,1248.249,"Well, what the Court in the Clarke case said, that the zone of interest inquiry is best looked at... best looked upon as analysis of section 702 of the APA."
1990.89-1416,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.894,1270.346,"Well, we'd still decide the zone of interest thing the same way."
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1276.067,1276.936,"Well, I--"
1990.89-1416,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.936,1284.69,"All you're saying is that the zone of interest test maybe shouldn't be applied, but we could... we would still apply it correctly even though it might be unnecessary."
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1284.69,1290.159,"--Well, you... the zone of interest test wouldn't be applied differently, but as you say, you may or may not want to apply it."
1990.89-1416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1497.478,1499.164,"Well, maybe it's right?"
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1499.164,1499.964,"--No, it's not."
1990.89-1416,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.751,1591.703,"But you don't have to give reasons not to adopt a rule, do you?"
1990.89-1416,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1597.957,1613.652,"Well, you had a request in this case and you had a difference of opinion between some officials in the Executive Branch and the Postal Service over whether or not for example this was a practice that could be conducted under the regulations that existed beginning in 1979."
1990.89-1416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1635.999,1638.951,"Thank you, Mr. Larkin."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,1639.951,1646.271,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1771.148,1774.933,Did you present testimony or present your views to the hearing?
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,1774.933,1777.635,We presented comments.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.635,1778.404,Comments.
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,1778.404,1779.02,Yes.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.295,1870.461,"Mr. Secular, it strikes me--"
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,1870.461,1870.811,Yes.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.811,1872.894,"--now these are your arguments on the merits, you say."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,1872.894,1873.061,That's right.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.061,1879.381,"It strikes me there as something that could be made by any person from the general public, so to speak."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,1884.552,1890.623,"Well, under the case law, as I understand it, standing is a separate inquiry and--"
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.623,1898.394,"You say, in effect, that if you can show standing, then you can come in and make arguments that have nothing to do with the reason for your standing?"
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,1898.394,1901.746,"--Yes, we can assert the public interest once standing is established."
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.882,1907.0,Does that seem at all odd to you?
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,1907.0,1909.602,"--Well, it's a... it's a bifurcated inquiry."
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.91,2035.712,"May I interrupt with a question, and I don't know if the record comments on this at all, but we're talking about a net loss... I mean, a loss of gross revenues."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2046.92,2055.507,That's... what you're driving at is whether or not the net... whether there would be a loss of net revenue.
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2055.507,2055.757,Yes.
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2055.757,2062.244,Whether the costs incurred by a Postal Service in furnishing international mail service are greater than the loss of revenue.
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.244,2063.694,Is there anything in the record that--
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2063.694,2075.219,"Yes, we submitted a declaration by an economist which was not rebutted which tended to show... and the court of appeals cited to that, although without referencing the declaration... that there was a net loss, and that in fact--"
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2075.219,2077.77,--Is there anything to indicate the magnitude of the net loss?
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2077.77,2100.702,"--There are documents, and I don't have the number off the top of my head, but there are documents in the record from the Postal Service's comprehensive annual statement of operations which show a declining international mail volumes and textually a comment by the Postal Service that attributes at least a significant portion of that loss to the growing practice of remailing."
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2102.802,2104.088,I'm not sure that responds to my question.
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2112.01,2112.51,--I don't... yeah... I understand.
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.477,2117.628,"--your standing argument that you're hurt by this and your relying entirely on the loss of gross revenues, it seems to me."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2117.628,2121.115,"--Well, it was the Postal Service that cited the loss of gross revenue."
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2145.862,2146.647,Let me ask one other question.
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2154.234,2163.756,"--No, what we cited to was the threat of job loss, which I think is sufficient to confer injury and fact standing under the cases."
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2163.756,2168.208,--Was there anything to show the impact on jobs of the 1979 regulation?
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2168.208,2169.708,"No, there's no evidence of that."
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2169.708,2172.426,Because there would have been some history to work with there I suppose?
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2172.426,2181.948,"Well, one of the interesting issues that is raised by... and I may be wasting my time by elaborating on this."
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2207.111,2207.896,"Yes, I see."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2207.896,2226.624,"It's also... now I'm really just speculating but I think it's fair... one could theorize that the marketing activities of the express mail industry have increased the overall market, and possibly increased the Postal Service's express mail business."
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2329.339,2330.539,Let me go back to Block for a second.
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2336.742,2337.442,That's correct.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2463.557,2467.175,"Well, where is... is that particular statutory section set out in your brief?"
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2467.175,2472.995,601 is in the statutory appendix.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2472.995,2474.53,Whereabouts?
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2483.22,2496.778,"Just to paraphrase it, it provides that the Postal Service may suspend the foregoing section or any part thereof where the public interest requires the suspension."
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2587.453,2591.988,--The present structure authorizing the suspension of the PES?
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2591.988,2597.642,"Yes, the present structure which can be read as authorizing suspension of the private express statute."
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2611.385,2625.744,"Well, was there any debate or discussion or was the statute that was finally formed in 1960, was that changed in any way in the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970?"
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2625.744,2634.517,Only in the sense that Post Office was changed... postmaster... the reference to Postmaster General was changed to Postal Service.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2634.517,2636.234,"Well, no substantive change?"
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2636.234,2636.75,No substantive change.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.75,2648.456,"So, no part of the debate over the Postal Reorganization Act in 1970 involved this statute, which you say is the crux of the Government's power to move here... the Post Office's power to move."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2648.456,2648.808,That's correct.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2657.829,2658.479,"No, that wasn't what they were thinking about."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2658.479,2658.996,That's right.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2658.996,2663.817,And it seems to me that greatly weakens your case for standing.
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2681.279,2685.397,"Well, I... let me make two responses to that... to that point, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2720.154,2729.343,But did... but did that have any... but did its viewing when it did at the 1960 statute in such a way have anything to do with the Postal Reorganization Act?
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2729.343,2739.365,The governor's report in 1973 didn't address the issue as... in any thorough way.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.983,2747.137,"Well, what is your answer to that question, the question I just asked you?"
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2756.493,2756.81,No.
1990.89-1416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.81,2762.164,"Before you move on, can I ask another question about the same section?"
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2762.164,2762.464,Yes.
1990.89-1416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2762.464,2764.683,Why is that the crucial section?
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2783.56,2783.86,"Well, this--"
1990.89-1416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.86,2788.148,"Not the later provision, whenever it was adopted, allowing an exception from it."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2788.148,2797.404,"--Well, I'm not sure, claiming the protection of the monopoly is precisely the right characterization."
1990.89-1416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2797.404,2803.658,"Well, you're claiming it was... you're within the zone of interests for which the monopoly was designed."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2811.33,2822.602,"Well, our argument on standing, our basic argument on standing, treats the Postal Reorganization Act and the private express statutes as functionally a... an integrated statutory scheme."
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2863.262,2868.298,"But they were... they were the linchpin before the Postal Reorganization Act and afterwards, weren't they?"
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2868.298,2868.5,--That's correct.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2869.166,2871.1,The Postal Reorganization Act didn't change them.
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,2871.1,2872.118,That's correct.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3011.676,3013.811,Does this... again I'll ask you the question I asked.
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,3016.197,3019.632,"--Well, I think it depends, Mr. Chief Justice, on the case."
1990.89-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3093.18,3101.417,"Mr. Secular, I'm not quite clear on why it is essential to the Postal Reorganization Act and the various things it accomplished that there also be a monopoly."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,3101.417,3108.022,--The basic rationale for that was articulated in the 1973 Governor's Report.
1990.89-1416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3163.693,3164.693,I don't see how that follows.
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,3170.597,3175.382,"Well, the statute also--"
1990.89-1416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3175.382,3181.488,"Even if other people are scream... cream skimming, the people left will pay the freight."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,3181.488,3184.773,"--We can get into an economic debate on that, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3198.997,3201.882,Already... they've already skyrocketed far beyond the rate of inflation.
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,3201.882,3206.12,"--Well, the Postmaster General has made that a fact, and I think that points up our argument on the merits."
1990.89-1416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3220.863,3222.982,"Maybe competition might determine it, too."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,3222.982,3228.45,"I'm not sure I understand the thrust of the question, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3228.45,3232.17,"Determine how fast rates go up, as it does in other segments of the economy."
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,3234.539,3259.655,"Well, the problem with that is that the Postal Service has to maintain a fixed, nationwide infrastructure, which prevents it, I think, from responding to competition out on the fringes in those particular areas where rates... where rates... where a lower rate could be charged by a private business while competing with the Postal Service."
1990.89-1416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3327.965,3337.94,"But the employees of the Postal Service are within the zone of interest that that actively, as you say, intended to protect?"
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,3337.94,3339.39,"Oh, there's no question of that."
1990.89-1416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3339.39,3343.844,"The purpose of this legislation, of establishing the Post Office is--"
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,3343.844,3345.861,A substantial--
1990.89-1416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3345.861,3347.129,--is to ensure employment to people?
1990.89-1416,2,33990,keith_e_secular,,3347.129,3358.52,--A substantial purpose of the 1970 reorganization was to address the legitimate grievances... that the phrase that's found on the House report... of the employees.
1990.89-1416,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3384.969,3386.671,"Thank you, Mr. Secular."
1990.89-1416,3,34446,l_peter_farkas,,3388.973,3390.506,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1416,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3493.99,3496.059,"Thank you, Mr. Farkas."
