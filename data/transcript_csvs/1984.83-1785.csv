1984.83-1785,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.185,We will hear arguments first this morning in Air France against Saks.
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,19.759,27.333,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case turns on the proper construction of a treaty."
1984.83-1785,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.342,173.415,"Mr. Johnson, the language in Article 18 dealing with property damage uses the word 18."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,190.564,192.266,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.422,200.966,"The drafters of the Convention then, did they have greater concern for property damage than for personal injury recovery?"
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,200.966,214.898,"--I think you have to look back into 1929, in fact, and still today, I think that under concepts like bailment rules there are generally stricter standards of liability than apply to the handling of baggage than there are to persons."
1984.83-1785,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.004,231.062,Is there something in the minutes of the drafting of the Convention to which we might refer that would point to this difference?
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,231.062,233.405,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, there is."
1984.83-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,287.008,291.757,May I ask one question?
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,303.158,316.139,"I think, Justice Stevens, yes, we probably do, but I think first of all you should realize that in this case I think we are dealing with the two extremes, the air catastrophe and the absolutely normal flight."
1984.83-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,325.102,336.756,"But you would say then that if during a little bumpy air someone had a heart attack, that that heart attack would be covered; if it was just heart attack because of fear of landing, say, it would not be covered."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,336.756,343.376,"It's difficult, isn't it, when you get into the middle area, and in fact I think the parties to the Convention have had difficulty with this themselves."
1984.83-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,361.322,366.476,"Well, yes, I guess everyone agrees that the injury must be caused by something related to the flight."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,373.364,375.206,I am sorry?
1984.83-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,375.206,389.935,"I say, I think both sides seem to agree that there must be something connected with the flight that caused the harm, so that if you had a heart attack in flight that you would have had at home anyway, that would not be covered even under the Ninth Circuit view, as I read it."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,389.935,401.885,"That is correct, and I think what you have to focus on is the event outside of the injury which causes it, and it is that event which should be unexpected, under the Third Circuit standard, and, I think, consistently with the Convention."
1984.83-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,401.885,405.055,"But if you adopt Judge Wallace's view, how do you know whether something is unexpected?"
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,415.536,430.185,"If you look at the event, the two parts of Article 17's requirement, that there be an accident and that that accident in turn caused the injury, then I think if you look at the accident, it doesn't make too much difference from whose perspective you look at it, it is an unexpected event."
1984.83-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,430.185,437.293,"But if you look at it from the passenger's point of view, you might have a new passenger who didn't expect a dramatic change in air pressure within the cabin."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,441.524,447.131,"I think another way to approach it, Justice Stevens, is to realize what the Warsaw Convention does."
1984.83-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,457.941,462.203,Then you are departing from the spilling of coffee example of Judge Wallace.
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,462.203,469.638,"No, I don't think so, because I think you can easily see that a carrier has a duty to retain people that don't go about the airplane spilling coffee."
1984.83-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.493,489.428,"If I understood Judge Wallace, his example of burning oneself in air turbulence didn't depend at all on any fault by the airline."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,489.428,490.535,That's correct.
1984.83-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,502.124,504.265,"My question is, how do you know when it occurred under your view?"
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,511.995,523.194,"--I think if you go back to the fundamental purposes of the Convention itself, it would be more likely to be from the carrier's standpoint, but I think the primary focus is on the event itself."
1984.83-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.194,527.255,"Well, I am not saying you would have to, but then I think your position is different from Judge Wallace's."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,534.316,544.857,"I am not sure if the certified record does, Your Honor, but I believe it may well be stated by the plaintiffs in opposition to the motion for summary judgment that there were no other complaints, no other problems on the flight."
1984.83-1785,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,544.857,551.074,"Well, if there were, I would rather assume that the plaintiff would make it a point of showing that."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,551.074,559.867,"Yes, Your Honor, I am sure they would have, and in fact in responding to our motion for summary judgment, they conceded to the Court that this flight had been normal in all respects."
1984.83-1785,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,559.867,569.004,What about the terrorist attack causing injuries to a passenger?
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,571.629,577.751,"Justice O'Connor, I believe those cases are consistent with the analysis here."
1984.83-1785,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,583.716,587.418,And you would think there would be liability on the carrier for that?
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,587.418,590.511,"--Yes, I think that has been fairly well established now."
1984.83-1785,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,612.658,618.39,How about an assault on a fellow passenger in a perfectly normal flight?
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,618.39,625.309,I think there again you can view that in terms of the duty of the carrier.
1984.83-1785,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.631,645.644,What about a passenger who chokes to death on his food?
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,650.939,652.174,"It is a bit more difficult, isn't it?"
1984.83-1785,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.844,655.11,I don't know whether it is or not.
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,656.593,657.156,Yes.
1984.83-1785,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.156,659.249,What about that one?
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,659.249,660.343,I am not sure.
1984.83-1785,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.449,676.662,"But if a passenger drinks too much and gets up and trips and falls because of that, that would be covered because the carrier has a duty not to serve passengers too much to drink?"
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,676.662,679.287,--There has been a case along those lines that suggested that ruling.
1984.83-1785,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,680.084,682.332,Yes.
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,689.877,692.267,"I think that that's correct, exactly."
1984.83-1785,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,692.267,703.48,"Well, you refer in several of your comments to the carrier's duty, and then you refer in many of your comments, and of course your position here is that an accident is required."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,705.433,711.211,You have to go back to realize that you are interpreting a treaty.
1984.83-1785,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,723.8,730.986,Then in the Montreal Convention they in effect bargained away the fault.
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,730.986,732.468,Not necessarily.
1984.83-1785,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,753.726,763.409,"But once you have this unexpected occurrence, the carrier can't defend by saying we could not have prevented that occurrence by any sort of care."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,763.409,764.378,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,793.649,803.191,What about if on a landing they slam on the brakes and he gets thrown out of his seat?
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,803.191,807.783,"If that happened, Justice Marshall, I think it would definitely be an accident."
1984.83-1785,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1049.138,1054.261,"Mr. Johnson, your brief mentions on Branch decision."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,1061.352,1071.208,"Your Honor, I don't believe so, because normally in all other countries that are not affected by the Montreal Agreement, they go immediately to the due care defense."
1984.83-1785,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.856,1100.368,"May I ask about the... of course, the United States isn't speaking to us, but their brief, they describe letter that they got from different departments of the government."
1984.83-1785,0,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,1103.788,1108.1,"--Your Honor, I would hesitate to say."
1984.83-1785,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1126.435,1142.757,Mr. Dubuc.
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1142.757,1196.672,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on behalf of the Republic of France, as indicated by Mr. Johnson, one of the principal signatories and one of the initiators of the original Warsaw Convention, we rise to emphasize to the Court on behalf of France and other countries of Western Europe as well as throughout the world the extreme importance to these nations of the continued enforceability, reliability, predictability, and uniformity of result with respect to dealing with matters arising under this treaty until such time as the signatories and the parties have come to a mutual agreement to modify it as might be necessary if desirable."
1984.83-1785,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1279.28,1284.404,The Entebbe case involved people who weren't parties to the Montreal Convention... the Montreal Agreement.
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1285.278,1287.731,"Oh, no, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-1785,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1324.841,1333.666,Why was the due care defense available if the carrier was of a nation who was a party to the Montreal--
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1333.666,1372.587,"It was not available in the cases which were brought in France, so it did not come up, but the issue of whether accident qua accident encompasses a hijacking as opposed to the coffee spill, as opposed to the heart attack which was preexisting and long existing, as opposed to the problem with the fingernail, as opposed to phlebitis for example, or as opposed to Mr. Abramsom's hiatal hernea, which was preexisting, these consistently would not be included in the term ""accident"" in other countries."
1984.83-1785,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1372.587,1387.41,"--How do you apply the unpredictability to the loss of hearing, a person who has never had any problem flying before, but he suddenly has a very unpredictable ear problem?"
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1387.41,1408.385,"I think, Mr. Justice White, I think and submit that on behalf of the government of France and other governments, the definition of accident would be something akin to the sudden, unpredictable mechanical failure or external means, external--"
1984.83-1785,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.385,1411.603,"So there must be something else besides unpredictability, I would think."
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1411.603,1412.071,"--Yes, because the--"
1984.83-1785,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.071,1415.929,"There has to be something that is connected with, what, flying, or--"
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1415.929,1418.771,"--With either mechanical failure, human failure."
1984.83-1785,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.771,1423.754,--What about weather?
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1423.754,1426.643,Unpredictable weather which was not anticipated--
1984.83-1785,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1426.643,1427.206,Weather is always unpredictable.
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1427.206,1428.69,--You are correct.
1984.83-1785,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1428.69,1431.486,And which was improperly--
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1435.576,1435.764,"Sudden turbulence, yes."
1984.83-1785,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1435.764,1439.481,And heart attack or swallow food or something.
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1440.903,1442.386,I don't think heart attack would be.
1984.83-1785,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.331,1474.06,"But I am asking under your view if it were proven or stipulated that some harm resulted to a passenger as a result of turbulence in flight that might well have been predicted, but just very rough there."
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1474.06,1485.993,"And provided the passenger was injured, I would assume the passenger probably failed to fasten his seatbelt when requested to do so, and if that was the case we go on to another regime."
1984.83-1785,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.993,1495.505,"No, let's make it a proven that he swallowed his food and some injury, something... the causal connection is strictly caused by unexpected turbulence in flight."
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1495.505,1506.127,I think if it is proximately caused by an unforeseen outside force or mechanical defect or failure to--
1984.83-1785,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.127,1509.392,"No, no mechanical... it is a very simple case, very simple case."
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1523.824,1525.652,"--No, I would say that is not an accident."
1984.83-1785,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.652,1526.355,Under your view they are not.
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1526.355,1531.664,"I think that would be the view that we support, at least that we represent before the Court."
1984.83-1785,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1531.664,1545.299,"But that wouldn't necessarily be the view of even the cases that have gone in the direction you are urging us to take, is it?"
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1545.299,1546.237,I believe--
1984.83-1785,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1546.237,1550.578,Wouldn't there be some dispute about that response--
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1550.578,1551.469,"--Yes, there would be."
1984.83-1785,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1551.469,1552.563,--in the cases that we have?
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1552.563,1566.667,"I am sure there would be, I am sure, and there are plaintiff's theories, and the plaintiff is very imaginative where they would come up with a theory of recovery on that, and if we were dealing with a jury and the proof balanced out in favor of the plaintiff, they might well recover."
1984.83-1785,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1577.348,1590.968,The Solicitor General's brief argues that the Montreal Agreement was designed to provide prompt resolution of claims against airlines.
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1612.552,1641.371,"--Ms. Justice O'Connor, I believe that we already are seeing, this Court is seeing a number of cases in the last couple of years dealing with interpretations of this treaty which is under revision and which is spawning a lot of litigation to interpret some esoteric terms that have existed for 40 or 50 years and have been interpreted that way worldwide."
1984.83-1785,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1686.243,1707.592,"Well, quite apart from your concern about the adoption of a new treaty or amendments to the Warsaw Convention, I asked you about the effect of the Montreal Agreement as modifying the treaty that we have before us today, and the purpose of that, according to our Solicitor General, was to facilitate prompt resolution of claims."
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1711.888,1727.054,"Ms. Justice O'Connor, the prompt resolution of claims anticipated by the Montreal Agreement was part of a quid pro quo which came as a result of the United States denunciation of the entire Warsaw Treaty in 1966."
1984.83-1785,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1804.257,1807.411,"Your time has expired now, counsel."
1984.83-1785,1,18754,carroll_e_dubuc,,1807.411,1807.63,--I am sorry.
1984.83-1785,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1809.146,1812.128,"I think you have answered the question, unless Justice O'Connor wishes you to pursue it."
1984.83-1785,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1812.128,1816.657,"No, it was non-responsive to my question, and I am satisfied."
1984.83-1785,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1816.657,1817.204,Very well.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,1820.5,1858.719,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented is whether a total hearing loss suffered by an airline passenger through no fault of her own is a compensable injury under the Warsaw Convention as modified by the Montreal Agreement where her hearing loss was proximately caused by the operation of the aircraft, and was a risk inherent in and peculiar to air travel."
1984.83-1785,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1894.892,1900.108,Were there any other hearing losses of any other passengers on that day and on that flight?
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,1900.108,1901.514,"None that we know of, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.514,1908.154,Wouldn't you think that is a somewhat important predicate for your case?
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,1908.154,1909.902,"No, Your Honor, we do not--"
1984.83-1785,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1909.902,1917.758,"Suppose, then, suppose that she was the only one out of 225 passengers, she is the only one that suffers this."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,1925.692,1944.497,"--Yes, Your Honor, if she is the one out of 200, yes, and I think to answer the Court's question, we should look to the intent of the original framers and as the Republic of France stresses, we should look at the intent of the framers in light of the conditions and circumstances which existed at the time the treaty was drafted."
1984.83-1785,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2133.062,2150.196,"Well, to pose a more extreme example, I suppose if the pilot announces that all the engines are gone, we are going to crash in two minutes, the fact that you then crash does not make it not an accident just because you expected it for the last two minutes."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2150.196,2166.969,"Correct, Your Honor, that would certainly be an accident under the Third Circuit's formulation or under the formulation we are urging, which is an injury proximately caused by the operation of the aircraft and risk inherent in flight."
1984.83-1785,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2166.969,2169.702,"But how does that incorporate the word ""accident""?"
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2169.702,2180.434,"Well, long ago, Your Honor, the word ""accident""... I guess I am not understanding the Court's question."
1984.83-1785,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.434,2194.709,"Well, you just gave two tests, I guess, for imposing liability, neither of which seem to me to deal at all with the word ""accident"" which you find in the language of the convention."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2194.709,2202.658,"That is because, Your Honor, the original framers intended either the word ""accident"" or ""occurrence"" to be comprehensive words, as comprehensive as possible."
1984.83-1785,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.658,2204.798,Why did they use two different words then?
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2204.798,2206.439,There is a good reason for that.
1984.83-1785,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.509,2265.414,"Well, then, you agree that accident and occurrence mean two different things in the convention."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2265.414,2275.379,"They mean... the distinctions are slight, Your Honor, and let me give you one example why we should not make much of that distinction."
1984.83-1785,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.148,2309.022,"That is because the word ""occurrence"" is a good deal broader than the word ""accident""."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2310.723,2351.831,"Well, if we look at both what Mr. Goodhice says and also what a 1949 ICAO convention, a committee which met to consider revisions of the Warsaw Convention, they reiterated, and this is cited by Air France and, I believe, the U.S. government, they reiterated Mr. Goodhice's explanation that the word ""accident"" was used to ensure that the airlines were not held responsible for an irate passenger giving another passenger a black eye, because that is not a risk inherent in air travel."
1984.83-1785,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2352.347,2355.409,How about terrorist attacks?
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2355.409,2357.206,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
1984.83-1785,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2357.206,2363.89,"Under your view, then, there would be no airline liability for injuries caused to passengers by terrorists?"
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2363.89,2365.843,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2387.896,2405.373,"Well, if I understand your view, injuries inflicted intentionally by another person upon a passenger do not impose liability on the airline, so I assume that under your present view there would be no liability for the terrorist attack."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2405.373,2406.185,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.185,2409.152,"What do you mean, no?"
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2409.371,2416.259,I don't agree that that is the ramification of the position we are advocating.
1984.83-1785,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2452.477,2467.05,"Mr. Cohen, is there anything in the record that shows how many occurrences just like this happen without anybody claiming loss of air problems?"
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2467.05,2469.128,How many--
1984.83-1785,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.128,2480.624,How many times a plane has landed and had the same problem with the reduced pressure and nobody made any claims.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2480.624,2481.873,--And nobody made any claims?
1984.83-1785,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.33,2512.47,"I have done a lot of problems, and I have an ear problem."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2516.578,2520.545,"Your Honor, you would be--"
1984.83-1785,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2520.545,2522.342,I would sue all the airlines.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2524.887,2527.043,--I feel hesitant giving legal advice to the Court.
1984.83-1785,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2554.516,2557.359,Let me put this one to you.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2591.205,2593.314,"Yes, Your Honor, it's an accident--"
1984.83-1785,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2593.314,2598.499,And it's an accident that could have been prevented if the airline had enforced its own rules.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2598.499,2600.639,"--Probably, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2600.639,2605.809,"So the injured fellow who got these books on his head, this briefcase on his head, has got a case, hasn't he?"
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2605.809,2609.51,He has a case either under the Third Circuit's formulation or under the formulation we urge today.
1984.83-1785,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2609.51,2619.398,"But then to go to one of the recent questions, you do not claim that any other person on this plane suffered any hearing problem."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2619.398,2620.192,Yes.
1984.83-1785,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2620.192,2622.332,Do we know how many people were on the plane?
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2623.832,2628.315,"No, but it was a 747, and I think we could safely assume it was several hundred."
1984.83-1785,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.268,2638.061,"Well, I suppose... Justice Rehnquist asked you what content do you give to the word ""accident""."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2650.307,2652.259,"That is one of the definitions, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.547,2681.934,Would the Warsaw Convention limit the liability of a carrier if one of its employees deliberately assaulted a passenger?
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2681.934,2688.744,"--Under the present system, it would not, because willful misconduct gets you around the liability limits."
1984.83-1785,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.744,2689.025,Exactly.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2691.681,2695.195,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.195,2698.288,Because of some other provision in the convention?
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2698.288,2706.673,The willful misconduct exception applies only to acts by agents or employees of the airline.
1984.83-1785,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.673,2707.907,Is that in the convention?
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2707.907,2711.531,"Yes, it is now, and that raises an important point."
1984.83-1785,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2871.153,2886.21,"Are you suggesting that if something is not an accident within the meaning of the convention that we are talking about, then one can sue the carrier under state common law?"
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2886.21,2897.972,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and that is what the Abramson case says, the Husserl case, and all the other cases we have cited towards the end of the brief, and it is not subject to serious dispute, though petitioner attempts to distinguish those cases."
1984.83-1785,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2920.805,2923.446,Does that make any sense to you?
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,2937.831,2944.467,"--Not, Your Honor, respectfully, not as phrased."
1984.83-1785,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3014.518,3038.196,"Well, if the Warsaw Convention is modified by the Montreal Agreement, says an airline is to be liable to a passenger in a case of accident, and this is not an accident, then you have to ask yourself, was this meant to be the exclusive liability for international carriers, and I dare say a lot of airlines probably thought it was."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3047.41,3065.233,"--I think the Court is correct that originally the... and that was my argument at the outset when I cited those examples from 1929 with the ear injuries due to the normal rotation of the prop, the airlines and the countries probably wanted this to be extremely comprehensive, indeed, the sole exclusive remedy."
1984.83-1785,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3083.849,3088.067,Do you think that modifies the Warsaw Convention somehow?
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3088.067,3089.646,Does what--
1984.83-1785,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3089.646,3096.361,That the convention is modified by virtue of the holding that we would potentially make in this case?
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3096.361,3097.111,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3098.454,3100.375,It sounds like that is your argument.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3100.375,3114.15,"--No, no, Your Honor, I respectfully urge that this Court adopt the formulation I expressed in the issue presented, which--"
1984.83-1785,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3114.15,3115.337,Suppose we don't.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3123.49,3138.921,"--I believe that it would... rather state it this way, that it would not be achieving the intent of the framers in light of the conditions and circumstances in which the treaty was drafted."
1984.83-1785,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3138.921,3144.857,"May I see if I understand your argument, which I frankly hadn't entirely before?"
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3170.144,3172.19,"It may very well be negligence, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.19,3173.33,That is your theory.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3173.33,3175.392,"Yes, and if this case were returned--"
1984.83-1785,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.392,3178.75,So if it is not an accident it is just outside of the treaty entirely.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3178.75,3198.851,"--Absolutely, and if this case were returned to trial to the District Court and not under the Warsaw Convention, what we would have to embark upon as any plaintiff would would be a massive discovery program to the FAA, the NTSB to see whether there has in fact been a trade-off between cost and safety."
1984.83-1785,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3198.851,3202.818,May I ask if under normal operation... I am just not quite clear.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3211.941,3234.571,"Yes, that is correct, and petitioner's argument would have the following effect if you assumed you had a new airline which had a much better pressure system than Air France's, and Air France continued to fly its own planes."
1984.83-1785,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3257.594,3264.246,"Mr. Cohen, do I understand... suppose this were an accident."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3270.259,3283.473,"Well, the complaint was filed in the state court and quickly removed to federal court, and all parties agreed that the Warsaw Convention applied."
1984.83-1785,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3290.471,3302.434,"What I am trying to get to is, as I understood your colloquy with Justices O'Connor and Stevens earlier, you said that if this is not an accident, then your client may be relegated to a state court suit--"
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3302.434,3303.887,I really mean common law.
1984.83-1785,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3303.887,3305.588,--with a possible... common law.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3305.588,3306.213,Yes.
1984.83-1785,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3306.62,3309.181,With a possible recovery in six or eight figures.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3309.181,3310.212,Or more.
1984.83-1785,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3312.195,3321.99,"I can't understand if that is available to you why you would want to press a Warsaw Convention suit where you are limited to $75,000."
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3321.99,3335.515,"--If this case were a case of total deafness in both ears, like the rest... but the plaintiff part does not support us in our position here because they want accident construed as narrowly as possible to allow them to get those large verdicts."
1984.83-1785,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3368.564,3379.841,"Now, if it is an accident, what is there about the Warsaw Convention that bars your suing in state court under common law?"
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3381.029,3384.979,--Article 24 specifically.
1984.83-1785,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3384.979,3392.148,But your earlier answer in effect would repeal the Warsaw Convention so far as the limits are concerned.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3407.845,3410.782,"Then I misspoke, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3434.303,3437.161,It is as though the Warsaw Convention had never been adopted.
1984.83-1785,2,17541,bennett_m_cohen,,3437.161,3437.911,--Yes.
1984.83-1785,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3500.385,3502.914,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Johnson?"
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3502.914,3504.9,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I do."
1984.83-1785,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3504.9,3506.444,You have two minutes... you have two minutes remaining.
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3506.444,3507.382,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3542.743,3545.226,What of the case where it is not an accident?
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3548.428,3550.13,"--No, Your Honor, it does not."
1984.83-1785,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3555.238,3557.237,What would be the theory of the case?
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3557.237,3559.159,--I am sorry?
1984.83-1785,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3559.159,3562.203,What would be the theory of the case if it isn't an accident?
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3565.218,3567.484,If there was a negligence claim?
1984.83-1785,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3570.624,3571.059,Yes.
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3574.621,3589.177,"No, I am saying that there would be... if there was any conceivable... and I have some problem conceiving of it... conceivable other cause of action or claim, it would be subject to the Warsaw requirement that there first be an accident before you have liability."
1984.83-1785,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3589.177,3590.536,"I know, but there isn't any."
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3601.078,3601.594,"No, I don't, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3601.594,3603.327,I thought you said that.
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3603.327,3604.343,"I am sorry, I misspoke."
1984.83-1785,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3617.98,3623.821,So you are saying that before an airline can ever be liable for anything there has to be an accident.
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3623.821,3624.866,--If there is an injury--
1984.83-1785,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3624.866,3629.988,"And if there is an accident, it is then subject to limitation."
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3629.988,3630.394,--Yes.
1984.83-1785,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3630.394,3637.97,"May I ask, I want to be sure, there is quite a wide difference of opinion between you and your opponent on the fundamental of the treaty."
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3665.241,3670.613,"Your Honor, I think you are talking about the airline not under the Warsaw Convention--"
1984.83-1785,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3670.613,3671.066,Correct.
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3671.066,3672.596,--because... that liability is not established.
1984.83-1785,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3672.596,3677.923,"His theory is, if you get outside of accidents, you also get outside of the liability limitation."
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3677.923,3678.985,"Yes, Your Honor, and--"
1984.83-1785,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3678.985,3679.876,"That is correct, is it not?"
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3679.876,3681.249,"--No, it is wrong."
1984.83-1785,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3681.249,3687.45,"So the liability limitation applies even if there is no accident, is your view."
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3687.45,3693.636,The liability limit applies to claims for injury and death in international air transportation under the convention.

1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3698.586,3699.758,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1785,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3716.438,3720.531,Is a liable limitation found in Article 17?
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3720.531,3725.138,"--No, it is a later article, I think, Article 23, under the convention sets limits."
1984.83-1785,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3725.138,3729.23,And that applies even though the incident is not one described in Article 17?
1984.83-1785,3,41554,stephen_c_johnson,,3729.23,3737.977,"Well, in a sense it wouldn't apply because you have to have a direct... for liability first under the convention's uniform rules before you begin to consider a limit on liability."
1984.83-1785,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3750.44,3751.315,"Thank you, gentlemen."
