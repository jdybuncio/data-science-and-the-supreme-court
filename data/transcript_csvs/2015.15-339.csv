2015.15-339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.695,"We'll hear argument next in Case 15-339, Ross v. Blake. Ms. Bernhardt."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,5.695,19.105,"Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: In this case, the Fourth Circuit adopted a nontextual exception to the requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act that a prisoner exhaust available administrative remedies."
2015.15-339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,44.6,50.41,"Ms. Bernhardt, could I just ask you to talk about the procedures? Could you explain to me what they are?"
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,50.41,64.5,"Certainly, Your Honor. And I'd like to begin with the Inmate Grievance Commission -- or, I'm sorry -- Office, formerly the Commission -- which is the primary administrative remedy for an inmate with use-of-force or other condition of confinement."
2015.15-339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,64.5,76.815,"Could I start you off in the reverse order? Because the ARP seems to be the low-level one, and in the initial understandings of this case, everybody was being told the ARP is where you file."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,88.62,96.615,"Well, Your Honor, the view's been consistent throughout, and that is the Inmate Grievance Office is the primary remedy."
2015.15-339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,99.455,101.51,I really did ask you to start with the ARP.
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,101.51,103.265,"I'm trying to, yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,103.265,107.69,Are you supposed to file with the ARP even when there's an IIU in --
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,107.69,108.41,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,109.33,120.9,"Well, why do all of these cases suggest that, when that happens, the ARP throws out the case on the view that there's an IIU investigation?"
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,120.9,135.95,"When this case arose in 2007, the warden was not required to dismiss it. And so in some cases -- in some of the cases that are before the Court, that is, indeed, what occurred."
2015.15-339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,142.7,155.22,Do you have any example anywhere of the AR -- ARP responding and actually investigating and looking at the issue and making a recommendation or ruling?
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,155.22,159.245,The -- we don't have the paperwork.
2015.15-339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,170.75,181.335,"In your reply brief, I looked for one ARP case where the prisoner filed and the ARP itself made a determination."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,182.65,184.38,"There's nothing in the record like that, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,193.84,211.755,"Well, you've lodged now quite a number of materials, and we can talk about the materials that you've lodged, but now, you know, both parties have lodged materials, and nobody has come up with a case in which the ARP has adjudicated a complaint when there was an IIU complaint investigation going on; is that right?"
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,211.755,219.46,"That's right, Your Honor. And there's a four-year retention policy for these records, and this case arose in 2007."
2015.15-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,224.41,249.32,"But at least it would show that there are papers staying -- saying as clearly as it could possibly say, ""You involved an ARP; there is an IIU investigation; ARP dismissed."" Couldn't be clearer. So you say, well, other cases went beyond the way."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,280.44,281.34,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,327.56,340.849,"Let's go back to the -- the procedure for the employee -- I mean, for the prisoner. There is an IAU investigation."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,355.84,368.03,"At the time of this case and today, the warden had discretion to reach the merits of it or to administratively dismiss it. Both of those are appealable orders."
2015.15-339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,368.03,378.77,"Ms. Bernhardt, can I just ask, because in the materials you lodged yesterday, in three different places you appeared -- the office appears actually to have a rubber stamp."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,399.945,401.28,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,426.39,449.925,"Ms. Bernhardt, we took this case on the view, which was the view that the office represented to us at the time, that the ARP was the proper place to go to receive a remedy, not the proper place to go to receive a rubber stamp saying ""You've come to the wrong place,"" but the proper place to go to receive a remedy even when there was an IIU investigation going on."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,449.925,451.3,"And that is true, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,451.3,453.51,Notwithstanding this rubber stamp that says it's not true.
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,453.51,457.88,"Yes, Your Honor, because the remedy will be received from the Inmate Grievance Commission."
2015.15-339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,459.4,470.9,"Could you please tell me why you can't -- what's the purpose of this process? You have regulations and administrative handbook that says, ""Take all of these things to the ARP."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,494.35,514.56,"Because there's one process for all use-of-force complaints, Your Honor, and it will be confusing to inmates if you told inmates, ""Well, if you've requested an IIU investigation, then you should use a different process."" And it's the one -- every use of force, the inmate files the ARP with the warden, he appeals to the commissioner, and then they go to the Inmate Grievance Office."
2015.15-339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,518.06,518.29,All right.
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,524.53,524.78,That would --
2015.15-339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,524.78,536.72,"If you go to ARP, if you haven't, if you have -- that's more confusing than this process where they go to ARP and they can't get anything."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,536.72,540.5,"They do, because they proceed up the -- up the process."
2015.15-339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,550.22,552.05,I'm sorry.
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,552.92,556.945,He had properly exhausted -- he had a hearing at the Inmate Grievance Office.
2015.15-339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,556.945,563.44,"We're talking about what's in the lodgings and what they stand for. These are not in the record before the Court, are they?"
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,563.44,564.3,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,564.3,565.92,"Neither yours or the other side, right?"
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,565.92,566.56,"That's true, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,566.56,573.04,I take seriously the requirement that we limit appellate review to the argument -- to the record that's before the Court.
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,588.42,589.01,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,589.42,608.19,"So how do we deal with that? I mean, again, both of you are guilty of what I think is a serious -- a serious question. What's your proposal for dealing with the fact that, so far as we have seen so far, the cases -- the case might well turn on these lodgings if people are going to look at them?"
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,608.19,614.23,"Well, your Honor, we would welcome a remand from this Court, decide the issue in front of it."
2015.15-339,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.58,628.675,"Well, it seems to me that we should dismiss your writ as improvidently granted."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,635.875,640.55,"Well, Your Honor, the district court rightly found that the remedy is primary."
2015.15-339,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,646.63,647.14,That's a different --
2015.15-339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,647.14,653.145,"Well, I suppose dismissing it would be based on a judgment about what these extra record materials show."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,680.07,681.06,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.13,702.86,"Yeah, I understand that. But, as I look through, the reason that it wasn't presented below, I would guess, is given the briefs that I've read, which are very good briefs, people have gone to an enormous amount of work."
2015.15-339,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,767.0,770.54,"-- you know, while an IIU investigation is going on."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,796.605,806.125,"Decide the question presented, Your Honor, and that is because it's squarely presented by this record. The procedures in the -- the procedures were taken to be clear in the court below."
2015.15-339,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,806.57,825.645,"It's pretty hypothetical if we are to answer the question, is there a special kind of exception to the rule that you have to take into -- that you have to follow available administrative procedures if it is the case where there was no such remedy availability."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,825.645,828.71,"Well, Your Honor, we've produced 13 inmates who used it."
2015.15-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,834.59,837.18,And it's available to some and it's not available to others.
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,837.18,838.805,"It's available to all, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,848.48,850.69,"Let's talk about, then, the current regulation."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,873.975,875.66,"That's not a regulation, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,949.44,961.0,"I have to say that when I read the Fourth Circuit decision, there are lines in the Fourth Circuit decision that seemed to be deciding this on the burden of proof."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,1025.05,1027.26,The Fourth Circuit assumed it was available.
2015.15-339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1056.99,1069.26,"There's a new regulation that has come in, correct, after this case? And it makes official that the ARP process will not handle an IIU proceeding?"
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,1069.26,1073.0,"It's not a regulation, Your Honor; it's a -- it's a prison directive."
2015.15-339,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1073.0,1074.15,Prison directive. This --
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,1074.15,1079.335,"This was the first two stages of the process, but not the third stage, not the Inmate Grievance Office stage."
2015.15-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1085.195,1093.925,"But the IGO, or whatever it is, that is described in this hierarchy as an appellate remedy."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,1093.925,1094.775,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1099.95,1103.41,"The setup is, there are these levels that you go to."
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,1113.97,1119.3,"But it's not an appeal, Your Honor; it's a de novo contested case qua an adjudicated hearing."
2015.15-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1119.3,1137.22,"Where is -- where in this handbook or whatever it is, the grievance procedures, does it tell an inmate, you can go or you must go, in the first instance, to the IGO when there's an IIU investigation underway? Where does it say --"
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,1137.22,1138.735,"It does not say that, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1138.735,1138.98,Yeah.
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,1138.98,1142.935,The inmate has a -- the inmate can always go to the IGO first.
2015.15-339,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1148.54,1151.735,Where -- where -- where does it say you can go to the IGO first?
2015.15-339,0,62683,julia_doyle_bernhardt,,1151.735,1152.79,That's in the handbook.
2015.15-339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1208.625,1216.075,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.15-339,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1216.075,1223.445,Mr. Tripp?
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1223.445,1228.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We're asking the Court to do two things here today."
2015.15-339,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1282.87,1297.97,You do say in your brief that if regulations are so confusing that we're -- we're -- we're arguing about whether -- to every inmate or every reasonable inmate or to a reasonable inmate.
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1308.97,1321.88,"So we definitely agree, as we say in our brief, that -- that rules could be so confusing that -- that they're no longer available. As this Court said in Booth, ""available"" just has its ordinary dictionary meaning of capable of being used for a purpose."
2015.15-339,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1327.61,1334.23,"No, you keep saying ""no reason."" That a reasonable -- I would say, consistent with how we always talk about this --"
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1334.23,1335.33,Well -- and I don't --
2015.15-339,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1335.33,1339.01,-- no reasonable -- a reasonable prisoner would not understand them.
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1339.01,1344.25,"Well, I think there's a big difference between a reasonable mistake standard, which is what the court of appeals held."
2015.15-339,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1348.25,1350.255,I understand that that's different.
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1350.255,1350.83,Right.
2015.15-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1376.185,1393.37,"What words should we use? The statute uses the word ""exhausted."" The word ""exhausted"" in administrative law, where it's most frequently found, has a huge meaning, with exceptions, built up over the years."
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1405.995,1408.31,"You know, I think --"
2015.15-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1408.31,1417.895,"Now, is that the way to put the exception? To decide that, one, does the word ""exhausted"" pick up its administrative law meaning? That's a big question."
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1417.895,1418.32,So I'm --
2015.15-339,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1418.32,1427.78,"I'm not sure. Two, if it does, is there such an exception that I just said in administrative law? And, three, how do you put it? All right."
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1430.78,1452.755,"So I think the -- the point that you're getting at about not regular followed is that's better handled in a situation so -- at Woodford and this Court's case law says that when somebody has exhausted but has made some kind of a procedural misstep, and the question is whether they should suffer a procedural default, that -- that the question there is, as this Court said in Woodford, whether it's a critical procedural requirement."
2015.15-339,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1486.18,1487.26,Please.
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1487.26,1491.34,There's two big differences between a reasonable mistake standard and ours.
2015.15-339,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1538.88,1539.13,Can I --
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1539.13,1539.87,-- in the record.
2015.15-339,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1540.585,1544.92,"Can I ask, it seems to me that there are three kinds of unavailability."
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1566.215,1567.11,"Yes, I think so."
2015.15-339,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1567.11,1568.56,In the hypothetical sense --
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1568.56,1568.66,Yes.
2015.15-339,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1568.66,1576.03,"-- not saying anything about this case? Now, the second is what you're saying. It's like, if it's just so confusing that a reasonable person can't use it."
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1578.505,1579.975,Right.
2015.15-339,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1579.975,1590.26,And the third is some of these cases arise in the context where the State is deliberately trying to interfere with or trick the inmate or something like that.
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1592.17,1594.66,"Yeah, in, like, a -- sort of a threat hypothetical, that kind of thing."
2015.15-339,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1594.66,1597.42,A threat or just deception or something like that.
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1597.42,1604.035,"Yeah, we think that's -- as we said in our brief, we think that's fairly usually dealt with under availability."
2015.15-339,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1641.715,1642.32,"Mr. Tripp, are you --"
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1642.32,1645.08,-- it asked this Court to reverse that in his effort to repackage it.
2015.15-339,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1645.08,1656.95,Are you taking -- are you -- I assume that you're taking no position on whether the remedy is available to this -- to Blake.
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1656.95,1658.88,The Maryland-specific question?
2015.15-339,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1658.88,1659.17,Yes.
2015.15-339,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1659.17,1665.495,"Yeah, we -- we just frankly don't have an interest in the outcome of that question, and -- and don't think this Court would have ever granted cert on it."
2015.15-339,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1683.48,1696.015,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hughes."
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1696.015,1715.21,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We submit that the proper outcome of the case would be to dismiss it as improvidently granted or, alternatively, to affirm. If the Court were to consider affirming this context, we think the first place for the Court to begin is what the term ""available"" means in the statutory context."
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1716.03,1723.635,"Well, before you get to that, the Fourth Circuit seemed to assume that there was a procedure that was available."
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1732.35,1734.05,"Your Honor, I -- I would disagree."
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1766.87,1770.5,"Well, what was the legal rule that -- that the Fourth Circuit adopted?"
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1770.5,1779.75,"Well, Your Honor, the -- the Fourth Circuit did adopt a legal rule, as has been discussed, as that there could be implicit exceptions to the exhaustion requirement."
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1779.75,1780.05,Yeah.
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1783.25,1785.41,"We think that's a correct statement, yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1805.96,1812.205,"Do we think that the Fourth Circuit was wrong with respect to that? I mean, it's a problem leaving it on the books, isn't it?"
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1812.205,1834.04,"Well, Your Honor, I think the Court could, though, still, even if it thinks that the court -- the court of appeals was wrong about that, still recognize that the additional argument, what the term ""available"" means in this context that we're correct about, and that, for multiple reasons, the system that Maryland has in place doesn't meet any conceivable understanding of what available would be. So I think the Court could certainly do that."
2015.15-339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1849.93,1850.985,But if we know what we --
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1850.985,1851.37,Go ahead.
2015.15-339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1851.37,1860.83,"I was just going to say ""what we now know."" Do you have any help for me with my concern that none of this is in the record in this case? None of it was before the court of appeals."
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1865.99,1866.62,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1902.85,1907.02,"Well, I'm not -- I'm not so much talking about waiver; I'm talking about evidentiary record."
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1939.73,1955.03,"Well, first, Your Honor, I still think it does only support our burden argument, and -- and we still would think our burden argument sufficient. But, additionally, in the -- the papers to this Court, Maryland has consistently said that the IIU and the ARP process were entirely distinct."
2015.15-339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1964.905,1968.24,They said that in the district court and court of appeals; right?
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1968.24,1968.71,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1984.96,1991.0,And is there any reason that couldn't have been done before the district court and before the court of appeals and included in the record before this Court?
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1991.0,2002.47,"Well, Your Honor, I think these materials, because they are briefs that the court -- that the State of Maryland submitted in these cases are things that are properly considered by this Court as legal documents."
2015.15-339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2008.14,2009.48,"Well, these are not briefs."
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2009.48,2011.87,"Your Honor, we do submit two briefs to the Court."
2015.15-339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2019.01,2024.22,"Well, you're also submitting documents that were filed, I guess, by prisoners in particular cases?"
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2024.22,2030.75,"Your Honor, most of these documents were submitted by the State of Maryland as attachments to their briefs that they filed in Federal court."
2015.15-339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.54,2042.4,But not part of the record in this case?
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2042.4,2055.29,"They -- they were not introduced in -- in -- in the court of appeals, that's right, Your Honor. But, again, it's consistent with our argument that the State has never worn its -- met its burden of demonstrating that the ARP is, in fact, available in these circumstances."
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2059.11,2067.065,Why should this issue of availability be decided by this Court as opposed to the district court or court of appeals on remand?
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2067.065,2079.84,"Your Honor, I certainly think that could be one possible outcome if the Court were to say that ""available"" as a legal matter means what we think it means, but that there could be subsidiary questions that would be left for remand. We would not quarrel with that outcome."
2015.15-339,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2079.84,2080.33,I'm sorry.
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2082.455,2083.29,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2105.8,2119.65,"What is the difference between that and what the statute used to say before it was amended where it required exhaustion of such plain -- plain, speedy, and effective administrative remedies as are available?"
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2119.65,2120.18,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2120.18,2122.21,I think it's saying it has to be plain.
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2122.21,2123.33,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2161.63,2179.76,"Do you think that there is also substantial daylight between your standard and the solicitor general's standard? In other words, what I took the solicitor general to be saying with respect to this clarity question is that the standard is if the procedures are so confusing that a reasonable person could not use them."
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2184.6,2186.81,"Honestly, I don't think there's a substantial difference, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2217.46,2241.155,"This is quite important to me, and the solicitor general, I think, has -- has -- has made very clear why this is such an important question, not just your client, but I mean in general in the system. The Fourth Circuit copied a full page of what it said was the Second Circuit's special exceptions test, and then it listed it."
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2332.315,2335.47,"Well, we certainly think that the outcome here was correct."
2015.15-339,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2426.4,2457.63,"If I could understand you, though, I mean, one argument that you would have, whether here or below or -- is this notion of the prison system didn't meet this level of clarity, whatever it is. But there's another argument, don't you think -- or do you think -- that you have, which is just, they said to go to the ARP, and the ARB -- the ARP was not in the business of giving this remedy. So we did exactly what we were told to do, and it turns out the remedy is unavailable because it's just not available."
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2457.63,2459.22,I think that's precisely correct.
2015.15-339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2497.97,2518.445,"I don't -- I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but the -- the citations you cited, it is true that that's to the lodgings. But I don't have any confidence that these lodgings represent the complete universe to allow me to make a judgment about the procedures under Maryland law, because this wasn't litigated or -- or subject to discovery in the district court or court of appeals."
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2518.445,2591.63,"So, your Honor, two things. First, again, we would not disagree if -- if a remand could be appropriate for some of these issues; but, second, I think there is enough that is undisputed in the -- the record currently that -- that doesn't even require a look in -- in the hole to the lodgings to find that this was not an available system. To begin with, the IIU exclusivity regulation that we discussed at page 17 of the red brief made quite clear at the time of this incident that the IIU had exclusive authority whenever there was a referral that was made to the IIU at that point and that no other agency could proceed. That, again, has nothing to do with the lodging material and, I think, makes quite clear that the ARP was not the proper place to go. We have the additional briefs, which we think are on somewhat different footing than some of the -- the other agency materials, and we have the 2008 directive that did happen after the case but made quite clear that the ARP is simply the not -- not the correct place for these cases to go. So I think all of these things, even independent from the lodgings, demonstrate that there was an enormous amount of confusion as to how the system works and is not one that could be described in any sense as available without even --"
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2591.63,2621.93,"You would argue that even if the ARP procedure turns out to have been available as a formal matter, suppose that this -- that issue were remanded, and the district court explored it thoroughly and concluded that, although there's a lot of -- there are these materials that might suggest otherwise, as a formal matter, it is available, even when the IIU procedure is going -- is going forward."
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2640.04,2640.32,That's right.
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2640.32,2641.38,That's a separate agreement?
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2641.38,2642.485,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2645.04,2651.0,"As to that argument, your -- your client did not try to use any procedure; isn't that correct?"
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2651.0,2651.52,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2651.52,2652.605,How was he confused?
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2652.605,2662.25,"So on the day of the event -- this is at the Joint Appendix, page 229 to 230, he filed a very detailed report of the incident."
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2732.28,2743.46,He received -- he received materials from the prison saying that that -- the ARP procedure is available in cases of -- of excessive use of force; isn't that right?
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2743.46,2747.77,"He did, Your Honor, but none of that material said anything whatsoever about the IIU."
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2761.185,2765.91,What did he see that said that the IIU procedure was specific?
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2765.91,2766.91,"Well, it -- it was in the --"
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2766.91,2767.19,I'm sorry.
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2767.975,2773.84,"It was in the -- the regulations that -- again, all of the regulations that Maryland had enacted that would be available to prisoners --"
2015.15-339,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2773.84,2775.095,And he read those?
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2775.095,2781.535,"No, Your Honor, I don't think there is direct evidence that he read those, but I think the question is what an objectively reasonable prisoner would have understood."
2015.15-339,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2880.3,2881.955,Where is that in the record?
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2881.955,2883.17,Sorry?
2015.15-339,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2883.17,2886.25,The recent amendment.
2015.15-339,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,2886.25,2901.02,It's at page 367 of the Joint Appendix. And this is part of the directives. It's -- it's a long directive that provides several different pieces of guidance as to how the ARP procedure works.
2015.15-339,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3102.095,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
