1995.94-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-1453, D. Grant Peacock v. Jack Thomas."
1995.94-1453,0,20862,david_freeman,,14.241,20.462,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,77.5,82.987,"If we were to decide the second question in your favor, would we need to reach the first question, Mr. Freeman?"
1995.94-1453,0,20862,david_freeman,,82.987,90.491,"Your Honor, you would not, I think... the second question being the ancillary jurisdiction--"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,1739.877,1744.245,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court:"
1995.94-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.537,1787.858,"Our rules, Mr. Few, are that amicus may not inject a separate issue into the case that has not been raised by the parties."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,1787.858,1790.726,--That certainly takes care of that issue.
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1862.706,1864.024,What page was that?
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,1864.024,1867.559,"--Page 57a, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1902.982,1906.617,Why is it... you said that that's classic ancillary jurisdiction.
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,1906.617,1918.075,"--Under Justice Scalia's opinion in Kokkonen, as I read it, Justice Scalia says there are two bases of ancillary jurisdiction."
1995.94-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1939.321,1942.523,Was Justice Scalia's the prevailing one in Kokkonen?
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,1942.523,1944.073,"Yes, sir."
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1944.073,1954.414,"I'm... well, perhaps Justice Scalia will clarify this for us, but I thought that he was talking about pendant jurisdiction and the common nucleus of facts, which is not--"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,1954.414,1959.485,"Well, let me read briefly from Justice Scalia's opinion in--"
1995.94-1453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.485,1961.202,--It's really the opinion for the Court.
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,1962.687,1963.27,"--Well, all right."
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1964.537,1965.37,"Well, in any event--"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,1965.37,1969.257,"The Court's opinion, having been written by Justice Scalia."
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1969.257,1987.218,"--my basic concern about the argument you're making is that, as far as I know, the standard incidences of ancillary jurisdiction, now called supplemental jurisdiction, is for a defending party who is being brought into a lawsuit."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2028.795,2040.417,"Justice Ginsburg, that is part of it, and that's the part that comes under 28 U.S.C. 1367, which is called supplemental jurisdiction, as I understand it."
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2147.788,2161.346,"Mr. Few, if that's your position, then why did you say in your brief that you recognize that the petitioner's argument might be tenable if we were dealing here with just a contract claim or a tort judgment?"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2161.346,2162.298,I'm not--
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.298,2166.084,There would similarly be the undermining of the Federal judgment.
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2166.084,2179.676,"--I'm not certain that we said that in our brief, but if we did, of course we did, but I don't think that we meant to say that."
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2198.138,2216.682,"So then imagine that there are 40,000 cases in the Federal courts every year where plaintiff sues a defendant corporation, and let's say in 20,000 the plaintiff obtains a money judgment against the corporation, and let's say in 3,000 the corporation might be insolvent."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2273.888,2292.266,"--My answer to that is that there would be very few cases in which you would have the facts that you have here, as found by the Federal district court, where the district court found there was a specific intent on the part of Mr. Peacock to undermine and defeat this particular judgment."
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2292.266,2306.84,"There are always... a fraudulent conveyance, I take it, is a case where a creditor has a claim against a corporation or a person, and that person or the officer decides to prefer his friends or his family to the rightful creditor."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2318.179,2327.503,I would take issues with Your Honor's statement that there are no authorities to support ancillary--
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2327.503,2328.003,--I didn't say there weren't.
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2329.686,2330.136,--All right.
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.407,2337.942,--The Dewey case is a case which would be ancillary today.
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2357.022,2357.588,"--Yes, I--"
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2357.754,2358.17,"Well, they--"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2358.17,2371.228,"I would then cite Swift & Company Packers v.... I'm not real good at pronouncing non-English words, not too good with English words, sometimes--"
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2371.228,2371.728,--Mr. Few--
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2418.875,2422.577,"--Well, I think that there are a number."
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2429.148,2429.981,--Which one--
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2429.981,2436.42,--Krippendorf is cited in a number of our briefs.
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2449.894,2454.298,"--That's the ones that I want, exactly that, because the ones you think... I haven't read the Swift one."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2457.833,2458.249,"--Yes, sir."
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2462.035,2475.545,"No, no... I mean, probably if you had one you'd say look, here are the facts right here, and the one that seems a most likely cite are ones which seem fairly readily distinguishable, at least to me, so the one that's the best for you is which?"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2475.545,2486.4,"Well, I think I'm going to receive some assistance on this from our arguing amicus for the United States, but I believe that--"
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.4,2501.176,"I thought Empire was the best actually, to tell you the truth, and Empire seemed to be one in which Judge Hand was going on the peculiar fact of New York law that they treated a fraudulent conveyance as if it was something they called an equitable execution."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2501.176,2526.393,"--In that case, I will cite that case back to you, but I would argue that it should not... it should not, from the perspective of respect for thou, Federal courts be the determining factor that the interference took place before or after the judgment."
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2537.701,2542.737,"You see, my concern, which I'll go back to for a second, is a totally practical one."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2572.72,2589.682,"Going back to the Chief Justice Marshall's opinions in 1825 and coming forward to the Riggs case, it has been... always been the rule as long as the question has been addressed here the Federal court has jurisdiction until the action is satisfied."
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2620.467,2623.569,"--Mr. Few, are you saying that the Federal court, after a judgment has--"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2623.569,2623.869,--Yes.
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2623.869,2638.245,"--been rendered as part of its ancillary jurisdiction can exercise jurisdiction over a third party, the transferee, and that's all part of this ancillary jurisdiction?"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2638.245,2652.505,"In those three instances that I have mentioned, all of those, if the purpose of those transactions is to defeat the jurisdiction of the court, then the court to vindicate its authority and carry out its decree would have ancillary jurisdiction--"
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2652.505,2658.076,"Do you have any, apart from reading what you read, where a judgment creditor--"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2658.076,2658.826,"--Yes, ma'am."
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2658.826,2671.717,"--can then sue someone who is not diverse, and there's no Federal claim, who is the alleged transferee of property from the judgment debtor as part of ancillary jurisdiction?"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2671.717,2675.835,I believe that the Swift & Company case is one such case.
1995.94-1453,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2680.22,2697.498,"None of those cases were cases where the judgment creditor, after getting the judgment, then brings an ancillary lawsuit against an alleged transferee, and we have that litigation decided by the same Federal court."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2707.62,2719.012,"--Well, I think I'll take issue with Your Honor's statement but without being able to specifically call your attention to the case at this particular time."
1995.94-1453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2725.398,2727.267,"Mr. Few, let me ask you--"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2727.267,2727.433,"Yes, sir."
1995.94-1453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.433,2753.631,"--when would it be that someone who derives a fraudulent conveyance from an insolvent company which numbers among its debts some judicial judgments, when would it be that such a person would not have an intent to frustrate the court's judgment?"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2754.714,2755.631,There are many... there are many--
1995.94-1453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.631,2759.416,"--whenever there's a fraudulent conveyance of a bankrupt who has a judgment against them, which most bankrupts do."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2759.416,2761.801,"--I think, Justice Scalia, that there would be--"
1995.94-1453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2761.801,2765.689,"Wouldn't it always be not only... not only allegeable, but wouldn't it always be true?"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2771.057,2795.208,"--I think that there's a very strong burden under the applicable law here to prove what we have proved in this case, and there are many instances where a businessman who is in control of a corporation that is insolvent makes a transfer that is in... is a good faith business judgment on his part."
1995.94-1453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2795.208,2796.941,"I mean, what does it take to prove it?"
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2819.49,2833.214,"In the majority, the vast majority of instances, there is going to be a good and sufficient consideration flowing back to the company, and if they are in a position to prove that, then that would defeat the claim."
1995.94-1453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.214,2833.931,"Well, that's true."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2839.049,2845.989,I think that you're right to the extent that the issue is there.
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2845.989,2850.357,"--Well then, what about... I'm worried as well... you see, workers."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2877.972,2879.555,I think my--
1995.94-1453,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2879.555,2881.34,And the answer to that is what?
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2881.34,2896.767,"--My answer to that is that it would be much more important that the court have the power to vindicate its judgment and to act against those who would lawlessly undermine its judgments intentionally, as was held here."
1995.94-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2896.767,2898.5,"Thank you, Mr. Few."
1995.94-1453,1,30209,j_kendall_few,,2898.5,2899.051,Thank you very much.
1995.94-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2899.051,2901.418,"Mr. Bress, we'll hear from you."
1995.94-1453,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2901.418,2911.526,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1453,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2914.561,2918.597,"Well, I'd like to know where you think the line should be drawn."
1995.94-1453,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2932.023,2938.443,"--Your Honor, I was about to address that, and if I might address that in the context of just setting out our affirmative position, and I'll make it short."
1995.94-1453,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2995.863,3021.164,"Mr. Bress, apart from principles, I do not know of any case of the kind that Justice Breyer's been asking about and that I've been asking about, and I do know where ancillary jurisdiction starts, and it starts with cases like Swift, where there's somebody in the defendant posture, and the court says, we're going to allow that defendant to bring in somebody else on the counterclaim, to bring in someone on the claim over."
1995.94-1453,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3027.318,3032.388,"--Your Honor, I would... first, I'd just like to take issue with the notion that that's the core of an ancillary jurisdiction."
1995.94-1453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.667,3080.286,"Excuse me, did the court have jurisdiction in rem in that case, or was it just--"
1995.94-1453,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3080.286,3083.171,--There's no holding it had jurisdiction in rem in that case.
1995.94-1453,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3087.04,3098.165,"--But it was assumed that the shareholders could pay over and, in fact, going against Peacock is not on all fours with that, because Peacock hasn't got the money."
1995.94-1453,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3098.165,3100.033,"Actually, Peacock does have the money, Your Honor."
1995.94-1453,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3119.911,3120.261,"Well then, I stand corrected."
1995.94-1453,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3120.844,3121.244,No.
