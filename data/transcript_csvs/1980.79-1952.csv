1980.79-1952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,0.83,"Thank you, counsel."
1980.79-1952,0,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,57.135,61.435,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1980.79-1952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.304,213.665,"Mr. Zimmerman, I gather you disagree with the Court of Appeals from the Ninth Circuit as to our jurisdiction in this case."
1980.79-1952,0,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,213.665,216.114,"Well, this Court does have jurisdiction, Your Honor."
1980.79-1952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.114,221.811,"Well, do the -- do you agree or disagree with the Court of Appeals' treatment of the jurisdiction?"
1980.79-1952,0,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,221.811,223.262,"Well, I -- I agree with it, Your Honor."
1980.79-1952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.185,227.669,Under what section?
1980.79-1952,0,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,227.669,232.001,"Well, they -- the majority of any event, Your Honor, didn't hear --"
1980.79-1952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,232.001,233.728,"Well, that's what I mean."
1980.79-1952,0,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,233.728,234.707,Right.
1980.79-1952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.216,279.001,"But this was an interlay if it -- if it were an ordinary case and not an FEC case, clearly, the question certified by Judge Orrick were interlocutory and the -- the Court of Appeals wouldn't be justified in simply resting its jurisdiction on the en banc statute."
1980.79-1952,0,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,279.001,281.88,"Well, Your Honor, this isn't interlocutory appeal."
1980.79-1952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.685,298.5,"Yes, but the -- the majority didn't -- didn't rest on -- on that provision."
1980.79-1952,0,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,298.5,299.922,"Yes, I think they did, Your Honor."
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,1745.836,1749.393,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1980.79-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1933.832,1936.555,"Now, did the panel members sit only en banc?"
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,1936.555,1938.627,"Yes, they did."
1980.79-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.627,1940.859,On the 35?
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,1940.859,1955.809,"The -- the of the panel members, there was some disagreement as to the requirement but the -- the Court as a whole in a -- in a vote that was 20-to-4 felt that they should sit pursuant to Rule 35."
1980.79-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.809,1961.917,And would you suggest whether they would -- had there been 437 that they would have sat at all?
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,1961.917,1970.168,"Well, the suggestion is that they felt that there was a -- that they did not have to sit pursuant to 437h."
1980.79-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2026.682,2034.805,But Western Pacific also held that there had to be some proceeding for a hearing.
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2072.945,2082.333,"I think that's correct, resolving the conflict with the Third Circuit, which had held that it had had that power in -- in the Textile Mill's case, and -- and I think Western Pacific follows that."
1980.79-1952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2175.713,2190.554,"Although every -- as I understand it, at least, every Court of Appeals has accepted the basic appealability provisions of 437h and they -- what they've done is duck the en banc requirement of 437h."
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2191.228,2192.277,I think that's correct.
1980.79-1952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2194.703,2194.891,Right.
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2194.891,2215.239,"For instance, in the Second Circuit in the (Inaudible) case, they there took the case on the 437h certification but turned around and said, “But the only way we can see to deal with these issues that are being raised is to send it back to the District Court where you have, in effect, the trial of the 437g proceeding."
1980.79-1952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2240.417,2265.151,"And but -- but in -- in this case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, while it avoided the -- what it thought to be the -- an issue, a serious issue as to the constitutionality of the en banc requirement, nonetheless accepted the merits of the appeal under 437h, although I guess it would have been an -- well, an interlocutory appeal and not appealable under the general appeal statute."
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2265.154,2268.755,That seems to me -- it seems almost there to be a -- a bootstrapping.
1980.79-1952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2268.918,2269.151,Yes.
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2269.151,2271.872,-- to me that they took -- took half the loaf --
1980.79-1952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2271.872,2271.874,Yes.
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2271.874,2284.0,"-- and I would argue anyway that by not obeying the commands of 437h, they therefore despite the statement in their -- in their opinion were not hearing the case pursuant to their 437h jurisdiction."
1980.79-1952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2284.0,2285.544,Although they said they were.
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2285.544,2285.938,They said they were.
1980.79-1952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2285.938,2298.993,"And indeed, that's pretty much what the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia said it was doing in Buckley against Valeo in a case in which we accepted jurisdiction under 437h, appellate jurisdiction."
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2298.993,2300.006,I think that's correct.
1980.79-1952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2302.156,2303.727,Perhaps they were -- perhaps they were not.
1980.79-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.727,2318.345,"Mr. Steele, does this bring you out that if we were to agree with you that this had to be a 437 en banc or not at all, and that really was a 437 en banc that they had no jurisdiction?"
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2318.345,2329.285,"Yes, and that the decisions that they -- that the decisions they reached would then be reached in the course of the 437g proceeding which is presently on appeal in the course of normal events."
1980.79-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.019,2332.403,I just wanted it to be clear.
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2334.767,2339.86,"Yes, we -- we would say it was jurisdictional and that was our -- our brief to the Ninth Circuit."
1980.79-1952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2347.589,2366.371,"What if, in that section of the opinion that Mr. Justice Rehnquist read to you they had said, “We are in doubt as to the source of our jurisdiction here, so we will consider ourselves sitting under 437h and the -- the rule,” both?"
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2366.41,2382.232,"Now, it would seem to me that where they refuse to follow -- I think the problem is that where they refuse to follow the commands of the statute for them than to say that they were sitting under that jurisdiction and it also seems to me that the -- though there are --are exceptions I know --"
1980.79-1952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2382.232,2393.908,"And if they have the requisite number of people there, what difference does it make whether they are -- under which statute do they say they're sitting any more than it would make a difference whether they did or did not wear their robes?"
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2393.908,2407.64,"Well, they would have to be -- they would have to find and you would have to approve of their finding jurisdiction under 437h, but not following the commands of en banc because otherwise, it would seem or at least we would argue there was no other statute that gives them jurisdiction."
1980.79-1952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2412.641,2413.091,(Voice overlap)
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2413.091,2413.608,-- which could not have been --
1980.79-1952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2413.608,2420.09,But this has something -- that this has something of -- of the reading of the common law pleadings some centuries ago.
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2430.663,2432.047,Well --
1980.79-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2432.047,2432.914,Excuse me.
1980.79-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.914,2439.35,"Mr. Steele, am I not correct in thinking your fundamental position is that the District Court did not have jurisdiction."
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2440.564,2441.53,Yes.
1980.79-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2441.53,2443.839,"And it's -- everything else follows from that, in your argument?"
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2443.839,2445.059,"Yes, that it was not --"
1980.79-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.059,2457.473,"Now, if the District Court did have jurisdiction and therefore, an appeal was properly or the question was properly certified to the Court of Appeals and if in fact they sat en banc, then there'll be no -- no jurisdictional problem?"
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2457.473,2458.502,I think that's correct.
1980.79-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.502,2478.994,"Except were we to review the exercise of their decision to sit en banc under Rule 35 because that does lay down some standards for a court convening en banc under Rule 35, an exceptional case and the hearings en banc are not favored and that sort of thing."
1980.79-1952,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2486.307,2492.937,"In any event, Mr. Steele, if in fact from my understanding that the District Court had jurisdiction and I know you argued it."
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2504.978,2506.012,I think that's correct.
1980.79-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.418,2543.844,"And your argument that the District Court had no jurisdiction relies on the fact that there was then anything, a proceeding before the Commission."
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2543.844,2553.12,"Yes, I should make point -- I should -- the -- the dependancy, the Commission's proceeding had been pending for a period of approximately a year, and we would rely on that fact."
1980.79-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.484,2613.844,Your view with the jurisdiction is that it determines on a proceeding being pending before the Commission?
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2619.663,2630.151,"Well, of course, the proceedings in front of the Commission really don't begin in informal ways as a process for filing of a complaint and notice to the parties which sets forth this factual and legal basis."
1980.79-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.151,2636.066,I mean is it a formal proceeding before the Commission would oust the District Court of jurisdiction under 437h?
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2636.066,2638.328,"I would certainly say on those circumstances, it would not."
1980.79-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2645.975,2648.961,What you really ask is to rewrite the statute.
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2648.961,2668.413,"No, I think that I'm only asking you to -- to say that the -- the statute vests in the courts a discretion under the terms as may be appropriate only to take under 437h jurisdiction very, very specialized kinds of cases which raise basically facial issues."
1980.79-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.337,2681.051,"We have a facial issue here, don't we?"
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2681.051,2703.05,"Well, you have -- you have a facial issue here as well issues of how it's applied because the -- the trial in the court below is related to questions of -- of allocation, was related to other offenses so that you -- you may have a facial question, but you may never reach it, which is, of course, the other reason that I would argue that you should limit the jurisdiction is because you -- you may never need to reach that question in this case."
1980.79-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2705.899,2711.321,"Procedurally then, you agree with Judge Wallace."
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2711.321,2712.142,I think yes.
1980.79-1952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2893.115,2899.846,"So far as contributions go, each one -- each doctor is limited to a total of $25,000 per annum, isn't he?"
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,2899.846,2932.223,"Yes, the individual -- and it seems to us that the very rationale that this Court used in -- in approving the $25,000 limitation and the $1000 limitation on contributions to candidates is the same rationale that is involved here, to wit that you do not have the situation, I mean, in effect that that the -- the holding in Buckley in that area was that the contribution limitation served a strong end of this in limiting impropriety from permitting unlimited contributions."
1980.79-1952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3048.627,3060.478,Do you see a constitutional objective or proper constitutional objective in limiting what you call the proliferation of committees?
1980.79-1952,1,20154,charles_n_steele,,3060.478,3077.733,I think that the -- the legitimate constitutional objective there is to deal with the problem that Congress had met under the old statutes that the proliferation of committees was used as a method for avoiding the contribution limitations.
1980.79-1952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3398.048,3400.36,Do you have anything further Mr. Zimmerman?
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3402.215,3404.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1980.79-1952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3449.734,3459.507,"But here, the -- your defense to the 437g action was precisely the same as your offense in the 437h action, was it not?"
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3459.507,3477.363,"Yes, Your Honor, and -- and to cause us to wait for the Commission to file enforcement proceeding, and to wait for them to move it through the courts and -- and to rely on the vagaries of their administrative processes leading up to an enforcement action, means that we have to put off the resolution of those questions."
1980.79-1952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3477.363,3480.089,"Of course, that's the -- that's the faith of most litigants."
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3480.089,3489.037,"Well, You Honor, we are participating in the -- in the political process and the Commission indicates we've violated the law in an administrative ruling."
1980.79-1952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3498.064,3502.378,"Well, you can just go ahead and do what you think is right and then -- and then will bring that."
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3502.378,3505.167,"That's fine, Your Honor, but that's done then at -- at our peril --"
1980.79-1952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3505.167,3505.17,That's all right.
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3505.17,3505.882,-- and that's the purposes of this section.
1980.79-1952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3505.882,3507.662,And that's what most litigants have to do.
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3507.662,3509.38,"Well, Your Honor, but in the election mockery --"
1980.79-1952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3509.38,3511.332,If you say that Congress has provided that you don't --
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3511.332,3511.393,Absolutely.
1980.79-1952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3511.393,3512.283,-- have to do that.
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3512.283,3515.467,It's so important that we need this section.
1980.79-1952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3516.313,3526.371,"You wouldn't have -- you wouldn't say that the -- that your case and the Commission's case, if it brought one, couldn't go ahead simultaneously."
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3526.371,3527.656,They did go ahead simultaneously.
1980.79-1952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3527.656,3530.8,And if they came to judgment first --
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3530.8,3531.375,That's fine.
1980.79-1952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.375,3534.067,Then you might -- and you might seek review of that.
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3534.067,3537.028,"Your Honor, there was a motion to stay in the enforcement action."
1980.79-1952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3541.304,3541.963,I can remember turning that --
1980.79-1952,2,40850,rick_c_zimmerman,,3541.963,3545.628,-- cases at once and Judge (Inaudible) denied that.
1980.79-1952,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3545.628,3546.445,"Thank you, Counsel."
