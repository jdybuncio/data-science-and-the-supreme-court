2017.17-269,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.48,"We will hear argument next in Case 17-269, Washington versus the United States. Mr. Purcell."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,6.48,16.56,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State of Washington wants to protect salmon and has voluntarily spent billions of dollars to achieve that goal."
2017.17-269,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,38.04,41.4,"I think you mean at least, right?"
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,41.4,43.8,"Well, sorry, we'd prefer that you reverse."
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,85.88,100.24,"In the courts below during the argument in the Ninth Circuit, you said the Stevens Treaty would not prohibit Washington from blocking completely every salmon stream into Puget Sound."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,111.08,115.48,"I -- I remember that answer well, Your Honor, and that was a mistake at oral argument about how our theory --"
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,115.48,120.84,So what is your position now? When can you and how much can you block fish?
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,120.84,131.6,"So, Your Honor, we believe that to show a treaty violation, the tribes should have to show four things: That a state barrier is causing a large decline in a particular river and that it's not justified by substantial compelling interests."
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,131.6,135.2,I don't know -- I don't know that it's a large decline.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,138.32,138.92,"Well, it --"
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,138.92,139.88,Every -- every --
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,139.88,157.96,"The precise word, Your Honor, we're less concerned about than that it be a meaningful decline, because, otherwise, as I was saying, the concern is that there are many, many things that affect salmon, Your Honor, from zoning decisions to climate change to transportation, and if you don't set the bar at least at some reasonable level, then --"
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,157.96,159.96,"Well, don't you think the court below did?"
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,159.96,171.2,"No, Your Honor, the court below explicitly said that Respondents did not need to show anything about the -- to quantify the effect of state culverts on salmon and -- and just said that any diminishment is a treaty violation."
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,175.2,194.68,"Well, it didn't quite do that, because, as I looked at its remedy, it -- it chose not to have you fix culverts that were -- were degradating the fish, but it said they can wait until the normal life of the culvert ends."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,194.68,195.36,"Your Honor, that --"
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,195.36,195.96,And so --
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,195.96,196.36,Sorry.
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,196.36,205.68,"And it also gave you leeway, rather substantial leeway, 200 culverts, I think, or over 200, not to fix at all."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,213.48,227.52,"Your Honor, the court told us we could defer until the end of the useful life culverts that had less than 200 meters upstream of useful habitat. So the -- the -- those are culverts that will make extremely little difference to be replaced, and each one costs several million dollars."
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,227.96,229.56,And the court excluded those?
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,229.56,233.76,"Well, the court said that those are the ones we could do at the end of the useful -- at the end of the useful life. The court --"
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,233.76,236.04,"Yeah, well, that means, because if you don't do it then --"
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,236.04,236.88,"Fair enough, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,236.88,237.92,-- it's going to fall down.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,238.16,249.76,My -- my point is the court did not exclude ones even where there's another barrier 10 yards upstream or 10 yards downstream that the state does not control. So we have to replace culverts even where no salmon can reach them.
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,255.96,258.76,But they gave you the discretion to exclude those?
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,258.76,259.0,No.
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,269.08,271.04,It gave you the choice to measure it.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,271.04,271.68,"No, no."
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,284.92,292.76,"I think your adversaries told me that there aren't hardly any culverts downstream, that virtually all of them are upstream from you."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,292.76,295.6,"I don't think they would characterize it that way, and if they would, it's incorrect, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,364.44,366.8,I -- I'm just still having a hard time.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,413.36,417.24,"First of all, Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit was incorrect when it said we refused to participate in the injunction."
2017.17-269,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,451.56,457.36,Could you say -- could you say again what -- what you think the standard is? The treaty talks about the right of taking fish.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,457.36,457.88,Yes.
2017.17-269,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,457.88,460.16,What do you think that means?
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,460.16,466.36,"Well, it's clear that it guarantees three important rights, Your Honor, this Court has recognized: A right to access historic fishing places."
2017.17-269,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,486.64,496.52,And what do -- what is the difference between that and the federal government's position about substantially degrading the supply of salmon?
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,496.52,501.2,"Well, Your Honor, for one thing, it's not -- I'm not -- I'm not sure whether they would limit their rule to obstructions."
2017.17-269,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,511.88,511.96,All right.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,515.96,516.24,Right.
2017.17-269,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,516.24,518.44,-- that's not a difference between the two positions.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,518.44,518.48,Okay.
2017.17-269,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,539.12,542.64,"So what -- again, what -- they say substantial degradation, and you say what?"
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,542.64,544.96,"We -- we said large decline, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,545.4,546.4,A large decline.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,546.4,548.48,I'm not being -- I don't want to be picky about the word.
2017.17-269,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,551.2,551.84,What does it mean?
2017.17-269,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,551.84,558.72,"Well, I don't understand what either of those things means. I don't know whether it's substantial degradation or a large decline."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,558.72,565.56,"Well, it -- it has to be more than -- than a fraction of 1 percent of historic harvests or 5 percent of recent harvests."
2017.17-269,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,572.4,575.64,"I mean, do you have a number in your head?"
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,575.64,585.12,"Well, again, I think that a decline of half or anything approaching half would obviously be a large decline, a substantial decline, but certainly something between 1 and 5 percent is not a substantial decline."
2017.17-269,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,585.6,590.96,"Well, 5 percent is often deemed a material number in other contexts of law."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,592.36,593.96,"Well, Your Honor --"
2017.17-269,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,593.96,603.04,"A 5 percent decline in stock price or something like that is often used as a point of reference in -- in securities law, for example."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,603.04,605.04,"Several points about that, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,619.12,622.4,"Well, now that's a causation argument as opposed to a materiality argument."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,623.56,623.96,Fair enough.
2017.17-269,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,633.48,634.72,"Again, I understand the causation argument."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,646.84,647.96,I don't think it --
2017.17-269,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,647.96,651.04,"And, if not, I guess I'm where Justice Kagan is."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,652.92,657.0,"Well, again, I think, you know, something approaching half would obviously qualify."
2017.17-269,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,660.76,661.52,So the -- so the treaty --
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,661.52,662.8,-- will affect 5 percent of the salmon --
2017.17-269,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,662.8,670.8,"-- the treaty, which guarantees the right to all usual and customary fishing grounds, really means half of them?"
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,670.8,671.28,"No, no, no."
2017.17-269,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,677.68,682.0,I don't even understand why it's -- why decline or degradation matters.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,693.64,698.28,"I don't think that would be a violation even under the Respondents' theory, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,719.08,724.96,"I guess that's -- for me, I think that's really where the case boils down, and -- and -- and I'm struggling with that."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,762.8,774.4,"Your Honor, we're not saying at all that they outweigh the treaty. We're saying that the treaty recognized -- in the treaty, it recognized that there were other interests, that there were -- the future government would regulate the off-reservation land."
2017.17-269,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,778.4,781.32,"Surely, it allowed -- the whole point of the treaty was to give up land."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,806.32,810.0,"Not exactly, Your Honor. The treaty right -- first of all, there's the cession language."
2017.17-269,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,824.12,824.64,Why?
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,824.64,826.04,"Well, for example --"
2017.17-269,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,826.04,835.92,Why does it have to be broader? I would have thought a treaty would have been the supreme law of the land and would have overridden any municipal interests and --
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,835.92,837.28,We're saying it considered those.
2017.17-269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,857.2,859.64,I don't understand what we're -- this discussion.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,872.88,873.52,Yes.
2017.17-269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,873.52,877.24,"I don't know what ""alarmingly"" is supposed to refer to, but I think probably a lot."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,877.24,877.96,Yes.
2017.17-269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,877.96,890.52,"Then in the -- there's a Finding 161 where he says, if you look at the whole watershed, the water -- the -- the -- barrier culverts are accounting for 6 to 13 percent of the decline."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,901.64,901.84,Well --
2017.17-269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,901.84,904.16,-- now you're going to tell me why I do have to worry about it.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,904.16,904.48,I will.
2017.17-269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.48,919.8,"Then I went and looked at what the court of appeals held, and it said we're not -- if there's an act of God or some good reason, you know, so on and so forth, we're not saying you have to replace it, but we are saying where -- where nothing like that is -- is present, you do."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,924.32,925.84,"I don't want to say you have it all wrong, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,925.84,926.48,What have I got?
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,926.48,927.88,But you have some parts of it wrong. So two things.
2017.17-269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,932.76,939.72,"Yeah, but, I mean, I can't go back and review -- I can, but, I mean, it's pretty hard to start reviewing the details of a district court record --"
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,939.72,940.12,"Well, it --"
2017.17-269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,940.12,946.8,"-- unless there's something that you've told the court of appeals and told everybody else this is clearly wrong and so forth, which I haven't found."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,946.8,950.4,But the -- the district court didn't make any finding that that was a sort of across-the-board effect.
2017.17-269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,959.16,961.08,They said that was the whole watershed.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,980.92,982.16,"That's -- that's not what I'm saying, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1013.2,1013.6,"But, General --"
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1013.6,1019.04,"-- as that finding of fact shows, the effect in tributaries is dramatically different than the effect in larger bodies of water."
2017.17-269,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1019.04,1033.4,"General, just to take you back to Justice Gorsuch's question, because I think you just gave an answer and it went something like this: It said if there were a 30 percent decline and it wasn't for good reason, then there would be a treaty violation. So now we have a number."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1050.76,1055.24,"Well, I think it's in the -- in the cession language, in the ""in common with"" language --"
2017.17-269,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1055.24,1056.6,What -- what language are we pointing to?
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1056.6,1063.08,"The -- the fact that the tribes ceded control over off-reservation land to the future government to regulate. And, Your Honor, if you don't adopt that --"
2017.17-269,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1063.08,1073.52,"But this is -- I mean, that cuts against you, General, because this is a compact, a contract, made into federal law in which the Indians gave up a very substantial thing."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1075.36,1075.88,Right.
2017.17-269,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1075.88,1080.52,"And it got something in return, which is the right to take fish."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1080.52,1080.96,Absolutely.
2017.17-269,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1089.56,1093.52,But where does this public interest theory come in in the treaty? I thought this was an agreement.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1108.6,1119.32,"Well, Your Honor, if -- if the rule is narrowly limited like that, it's much less problematic for the state, but there's also not -- the findings would not support that rule, and it would outlaw every dam in the Northwest."
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1139.72,1140.36,They -- they could --
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1140.36,1141.0,We're not --
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1141.0,1187.92,"We've had cases that have basically said, the example you used -- if we're going to regulate fishing for the purposes of ensuring that there isn't degradation of fish, bacteria, some other form of fishing that -- that would be more harmful than -- than your catch, we've said that's okay, but if you're going to degradate for the benefit of the landowners, as opposed to the people entitled to the fish, that you can't do that because you have to make sure that the Indians receive their fair amount of the -- of the catch."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1187.92,1188.0,Well --
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1188.0,1194.2,So your substantial public need is not creating that difference for me.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1194.2,1194.52,Okay.
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1194.52,1201.76,It's -- it's not defining what type of public need is -- is proper.
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1201.76,1202.64,Right.
2017.17-269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1224.92,1240.48,"Well, I'm sorry, if -- if you could have built this bridge in a way to permit the free flow of fish, you seem to be saying that you can get out of that obligation merely because you wanted to spend less money."
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1240.48,1241.48,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1293.92,1297.76,Which -- which test did you say the district court did not consider?
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1297.76,1305.52,"The -- the idea that -- that -- as I understand their theory here, it's that obstructions that cause a substantial degradation are a treaty violation."
2017.17-269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1340.88,1341.28,Well --
2017.17-269,0,62975,noah_purcell,,1341.28,1343.04,-- but that doesn't make it a treaty violation.
2017.17-269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.04,1351.4,-- the common law cases that we were able to find say things like -- there's a good Massachusetts case here -- I just say it's good because it's from Massachusetts. (Laughter.)

I'd like to start by taking head-on the state's suggestion that we've changed our position in this litigation, and I don't want to mince words."
2017.17-269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1562.64,1566.68,"Well, you may not have sought it, but isn't that what the Ninth Circuit panel did?"
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1566.68,1567.52,It's not.
2017.17-269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1570.52,1571.36,Please.
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1571.36,1618.16,"If you look at the beginning of the discussion section, page 86a of the Petition Appendix, you'll see that the Ninth Circuit posed the relevant question as follows: Whether the state was correct ""that it has no treaty-based duty to refrain from building and maintaining barrier culverts."" It then spends the next six pages refuting that argument based on the text of the treaty, the understanding of the parties, this Court's case law. Then six pages later, on 92, the court says: ""Even if the treaties did not contain such protection explicitly, the court would infer it."" And then two pages later, we get the infamous sentence in which ""moderate living"" makes its first appearance. So, at best, we're talking about something that supports an alternative holding. It's also not what the parties argued for."
2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1653.28,1653.4,"Well, there's --"
2017.17-269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1653.4,1653.6,When you say --
2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1653.6,1661.08,-- there's an awful lot in your brief about the common law nuisance theory supporting the prohibition on physical barriers.
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1663.24,1663.52,No.
2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1670.52,1687.4,"Well, it's pretty prominently featured, and it's -- the -- the state makes the argument that, well, there are exceptions or what the common law theory of nuisance with respect to barriers inhibiting access to fish is a complicated question. And you don't just say, well, it's a nuisance, so you win."
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1702.96,1703.64,"No, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1717.4,1732.52,"And on that basic point, can you explain -- the treaty language gives -- gives the tribes the right to take fish in common with all citizens."
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1732.52,1733.4,That's correct.

That is, you could read it as a provision for non-discrimination against Indians, but you read it as much more than a non-discrimination provision, right?"
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1759.8,1760.76,That's correct.
2017.17-269,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1801.64,1811.08,Do the dams that the -- do the dams that the federal government has built on the lower Snake River and the lower Columbia River violate the treaty?
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1811.08,1815.72,So you're going to hear me say a number of times today the state didn't argue that or it's not in the record.
2017.17-269,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1854.0,1861.08,There are articles claiming that they have caused more damage to salmon than anything else.

2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1868.04,1868.92,That's not correct.

It built these culverts in -- in -- consistent with federal standards and, in some cases, with federal permits, right?"
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1921.76,1923.24,That is not correct.

2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1969.2,1970.28,Go ahead.
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1970.28,1974.52,"In fact, they have changed the design of their culverts to allow for fish passage."

2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1977.72,1979.6,Did I understand you to -- go ahead.
2017.17-269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1979.6,1980.6,I'm sorry.
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2009.88,2010.32,Sure.
2017.17-269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2010.32,2020.12,"And, second, that they did not weigh whatever and however we define substantial public interest."
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2022.24,2022.48,Right.
2017.17-269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2022.48,2036.2,"-- their refusal to give me a definition of that that would not give them free rein to design things that will degrade materially a run, only because they want to help some other landowner."
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2036.2,2037.32,Right.
2017.17-269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2061.96,2064.52,"Well, when you use that term, do you have a number in your head?"
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2064.52,2078.6,"So we don't have a number. I think you are talking about harm that is both durable and appreciable, meaning the type of thing that shows up year after year, despite normal fluctuations. The district court didn't use a number -- population number approach."
2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2099.12,2107.32,"I just want to get back to -- it was a while ago, but I -- I understood you to say that Clean Water Act permits do not take account of local conditions?"
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2107.32,2120.04,"The Clean Water Act permit that we're talking about, the only thing that the state has pointed to, is a blanket permit that's granted in advance, and it says generally that you need to take account of these things, but it doesn't review individual culverts."
2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2122.4,2123.76,To take account of these things.
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2125.04,2133.28,"Well, it sometimes mentions threats to wildlife or treaty obligations, but it doesn't, again, in advance tell you that you have, in fact, complied. Talking about --"
2017.17-269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2133.28,2141.44,"Mr. Kedem, when you read from the government's prayer from relief, as I heard it, it didn't have anything to do with obstructions or dams --"
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2141.44,2141.88,That's --
2017.17-269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2141.88,2142.92,-- or culverts particularly.
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2142.92,2144.28,That's elsewhere in the sentence.
2017.17-269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2144.28,2149.08,"So you are arguing only with respect to obstructions today, is that correct?"
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2149.08,2150.68,That's certainly all that's at issue here.
2017.17-269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2163.28,2169.68,And what is your view of the state's right under the treaty to take account of other public interests?
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2169.68,2188.72,"So we would describe it in the way that this Court did in the Puyallup trio, which is that the state can enact non-discriminatory measures that are aimed at protecting the resource. So, in the example that my friend gave about poisoning of shellfish or other fish, that would be an action that the state could take to reasonably protect the resource."
2017.17-269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2188.72,2189.24,Where does that --
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2189.24,2190.32,"That doesn't mean, however --"
2017.17-269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2190.32,2194.44,"Where does that come from, though? Because you pointed us to the common law of nuisance."
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2194.44,2194.6,Yeah.
2017.17-269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2194.6,2207.56,"And there it appears to be, from my first read, a defense that there's another public good unrelated to the resource that might outweigh the -- the problems of the nuisance and -- and diminish it. So where --"
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2207.56,2208.52,Not as a general --
2017.17-269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2208.52,2210.24,-- where do you -- where do you get your rule from?
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2210.24,2213.28,So the common law does not allow that as a defense as a general matter.
2017.17-269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2213.28,2213.64,Okay.
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2213.64,2215.04,They cite the Woolrych Treatise.
2017.17-269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2215.04,2215.36,Yes.
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2215.36,2217.96,If you look at the very next sentence in that treatise --
2017.17-269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2217.96,2218.24,Yes.
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2218.24,2242.12,"-- it makes very clear that an obstruction is not a nuisance simply because, on balance, you think it does more good than harm. Instead, what it says is, and if you read the cases that support the treatise, that if there is a way to build whatever structure you want to put in the water in such a way that it does not obstruct -- usually, the cases are talking about navigation, but, presumably, it would apply as well to fish -- if you can do so, then it is a nuisance to fail to do so. And that is --"
2017.17-269,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2242.12,2247.36,Are these cases involving actions taken by private parties or by governmental authorities?
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2247.36,2248.56,Pardon?
2017.17-269,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2248.56,2257.2,Are these nuisance cases cases involving actions taken by private parties or by the government?
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2257.2,2260.64,"By and large, they're actions taken by private parties, but what the --"
2017.17-269,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2260.64,2269.64,"Do you think it's clear that the same standard applies to -- under the common law, the same standard would apply to things that were done by the sovereign?"
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2269.64,2277.6,I think what you would need under the common law is a legislative enactment saying that whatever would otherwise be a nuisance is not a nuisance.
2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2283.48,2286.52,Any of these issues discussed in the court of appeals?
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2286.52,2287.0,Pardon?
2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2287.0,2289.28,Any of these issues discussed in the court of appeals?
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2289.28,2290.72,Not with respect to the common law.
2017.17-269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2366.84,2373.68,"What do we look at to -- to see that the district court looked at that figure, the substantial increase?"
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2373.68,2381.92,"So I think, for the benefits that you would get, you would look to pages 166 to 168 of the Petition Appendix."
2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2411.44,2416.44,So his argument was waived because he didn't make it until it got to this Court?
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2416.44,2416.96,Pardon?
2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2416.96,2423.8,The argument you're talking about was waived by your friend on the other side because it wasn't raised until it got to this -- until the case got to this Court?
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2423.8,2436.52,"If you're making a new argument as to why it was that the district court abused its discretion, that is the type of argument that you would normally expect at a minimum to be brought up in the court of appeals, if not in the district court itself."
2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2436.52,2437.64,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.17-269,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2437.64,2437.76,"I mean, I --"
2017.17-269,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2437.76,2444.24,"Did the United States pick up any of this tab? I mean, the principal state's objection is the cost to the state."
2017.17-269,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2447.84,2471.52,"The United States pays tens of millions of dollars directly to the state, in addition to all of the other efforts that it has -- it has undertaken to mitigate harms and to compensate the tribes."
2017.17-269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2471.52,2475.56,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jay."
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2475.56,2523.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If the promise made by the United States in exchange for millions of acres of the tribes' land means anything in terms of substantive protection of the fishery, it protects against a threat to the fishery like these, a threat that obstructs fish from getting to the usual and accustomed fishing grounds where the tribes have a right to fish and that substantially degrades the fish population. And the idea that the state or a locality or even the United States can simply disregard that based on an agency's or an individual local government's balancing of its own perceived public interest against the promise made by the president, ratified by the Senate, is simply not consistent with the promises in the treaty or the background of the treaty."
2017.17-269,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2523.08,2535.56,"I hate to keep asking the same question, but is ""substantial"" -- does ""substantial degradation"" mean a number or ""significant degradation"" mean a number? And, if so, what is the number?"
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2535.56,2538.72,I don't think it means a hard and fast number.
2017.17-269,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2568.44,2576.88,"I mean, the -- the -- the -- what -- what happens here -- happened here, may or may not meet any definition of ""significant"" or ""substantial."" That's not the -- my question."
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2589.28,2594.2,"Well, I think that it -- it takes account of what kind of question you were asking."
2017.17-269,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2625.92,2626.64,So when you say --
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2626.64,2627.12,-- year after year.
2017.17-269,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2627.12,2634.56,"-- ""materially affects,"" is that just a kind of it can't be de minimis, but if it's not de minimis, then, yes, there's an obligation?"
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2634.56,2636.04,It certainly can't be de minimis.
2017.17-269,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2654.44,2655.04,I don't know --
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2655.04,2655.52,-- by the treaty.
2017.17-269,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2655.52,2687.28,"-- if we can decide a global standard for all of the Indian problems, but the question presented here -- there are three questions: One, was the scope of the remedy too much; the second question is whether the government has to contribute in light of its equitable situation. But the first question was whether the treaty right of taking fish in common with all citizens guaranteed that the number of fish would always be sufficient to provide a moderate living to the tribes."
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2709.08,2716.52,"We recommend that you look at what the injunction says and affirm it, because the injunction says nothing about a moderate living."
2017.17-269,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2754.0,2762.52,"But do you -- do you agree with that, that it guarantees a moderate living, regardless of what you think the court said in the injunction? Is that the standard that you want us to adopt?"
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2762.52,2763.12,It's not.
2017.17-269,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2778.68,2783.36,"Well, but you just told me you want us to affirm an injunction that specifies a moderate living."
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2783.36,2783.68,No.
2017.17-269,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2784.24,2784.36,No?
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2784.36,2786.28,There's not a word about moderate living in the injunction.
2017.17-269,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2786.84,2789.16,"Well, where did the words come from?"
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2789.16,2791.4,Historically or in this case?
2017.17-269,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2791.4,2792.12,In this case.
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2792.12,2839.08,"In this case, the -- as Mr. Kedem walked you through, the Ninth Circuit has two hold -- two pieces of its analysis starting at 1 -- at 158 and it -- and it -- that's not right -- starting at 58 and continuing on until it gets to a place where it says even if the treaty did not make this express promise and even if there weren't the express promises by Governor Stevens in the negotiation, even if we would infer such a promise and analogizing to the Winters doctrine, that is the section from which the state derives the supposed moderate living holding, but -- and we think that the analogy to the Winters doctrine actually helps to refute that. The Winters doctrine is a doctrine whereby, when Congress creates an Indian reservation, it doesn't expressly make provision for water."
2017.17-269,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2844.32,2851.88,"So if we were to write an opinion in this case, you would have no objection if it said that there is no moderate living standard at issue here?"
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2851.88,2853.48,We would have no objection to that at all.
2017.17-269,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2853.48,2857.44,"And just so I understand it, you're saying that that was not at issue."
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2861.4,2864.12,"The district court says, at 163, that it's not considering it."
2017.17-269,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2882.92,2891.0,"And how would you phrase that, if not moderate living? What would be the determine -- what would be the standard that you think should be applied in interpreting the injunction?"
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2891.0,2919.16,"In interpreting the injunction? Well, we think that the reason an injunction was justified in this case is because the state has violated the treaty by, one, putting barrier culverts in the streams that prevent salmon and other anadromous fish from getting to the usual and accustomed fishing grounds, all of which -- all of which are places where the state -- the tribes have a right to fish. And, second, those blockages -- those same blockages are what is degrading the fishery in a substantial way."
2017.17-269,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2919.48,2927.0,Do your clients agree with the United States that the dams that were built by the United States are in compliance with the treaty?
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2927.0,2930.76,So let me -- let me give just a conceptual answer.
2017.17-269,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2954.32,2967.84,"Yeah, I understand that, but there are particular dams on particular rivers, and I wonder if your clients have a position as to whether those are in compliance with the treaty, as the government has told us this morning."
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2967.84,3016.96,"Well, what I can say is that when the federal government has built dams without ensuring fish passage, that the federal government quite appropriately has paid compensation to the Indian tribes in exchange for the destruction of its usual and accustomed fishing grounds and the inability to take fish there. So, certainly, a dam or another obstruction that blocks a usual and accustomed fishing ground can be a violation, but there's nothing in the record in this case, because it has not been litigated, about particular dams that don't meet that standard. My friend from the state talked about the idea that the state's -- some of the state's barriers are partial barriers, and there are a number of things I'd like to say about that. First is the idea that the common law did not prohibit partial barriers to passage. That is simply incorrect."
2017.17-269,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3082.28,3086.48,But there's still 600 -- there are about 600 and something left. Suppose they discover --
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3086.48,3087.08,Five-hundred something.
2017.17-269,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3087.08,3106.6,"Because that's a lot of them, when they go out there, that there are like five culverts somewhere which would be unbelievably expensive to change, and, moreover, it would really save only three fish or something. Now suppose that they find that out. Can they go back into the district court and say: Judge, we would like you to modify this in respect to those five?"
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3106.6,3131.96,"That's exactly what, at page 125, of the Petition Appendix you will see that the court of appeals underscored, that the district court retains equitable discretion under this Court's cases, applying Rule 60, to modify the injunction if changed circumstances warrant it. And the -- the court of appeals said that it's confident that the district court, which has supervised this case, these proceedings, and this injunction for a long, long time will exercise its discretion appropriately."
2017.17-269,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3131.96,3141.6,"Do -- do you think, Mr. Jay, that this -- that these treaty obligations differ at all from the reigning common law principles? And, if so, how?"
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3141.6,3151.08,"I agree with what Mr. Kedem said, that the common law is a guide to what the -- to what the treaties' protected right of taking fish means."
2017.17-269,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3178.72,3179.2,But what I'm really --
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3179.2,3179.88,My second point --
2017.17-269,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3179.88,3184.44,"-- asking is when you look at the common law and you look at this treaty, do you see any difference between the two --"
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3184.44,3185.04,The -- the --
2017.17-269,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3185.04,3186.24,-- and where would that difference be?
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3186.24,3194.56,"The principal difference, I think, is on this point that Mr. Purcell brought up, the idea that there could be some public interest balancing."
2017.17-269,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3235.4,3240.92,"Mr. Jay, what do I look at? I know the district court made certain findings about the costs of remediation."
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3256.48,3257.0,Right.
2017.17-269,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3257.0,3268.56,"What can I look at to tell me what the cost is projected to be? I -- I just need a realistic number, and I wasn't sure I got it from anybody."
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3268.56,3269.16,Yeah.
2017.17-269,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3279.6,3283.32,Six hundred million dollars is still a lot of money.
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3283.32,3286.96,"I don't think it would be $600 million, I mean, but --"
2017.17-269,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3286.96,3288.88,There are 600 -- I'm on average.
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3288.88,3289.08,"Right, it's --"
2017.17-269,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3289.08,3297.2,"Six hundred culverts, you're right, he -- he said it was like $650,000 per culvert, so you're right, maybe half that."
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3298.4,3305.64,"It -- it is a lot of money. Of course, in the context of the state's transportation budget, in -- at that figure, we think it's about a half a percent of the state's transportation budget."
2017.17-269,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3306.2,3308.92,And I know there's some federal money coming.
2017.17-269,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3308.92,3310.32,There is federal money coming in.
2017.17-269,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3387.08,3392.2,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Purcell, you have five minutes remaining."
2017.17-269,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3392.2,3397.68,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to make three points."
2017.17-269,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3443.88,3470.6,"Some -- the sentence says, ""in the context of state culverts that appreciably degrade fish passage and interfere with the tribe's ability to obtain a moderate"" -- so they have to do both: One, appreciably inter -- degrade fish passage; and two, also interfere with the moderate standing. Isn't that what it says?"
2017.17-269,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3470.6,3471.84,"That's what they claimed, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3471.84,3473.16,"Well, that's what it seemed to me to say."
2017.17-269,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3473.16,3477.92,The -- the district court essentially said the moderate living standard -- any decline from that is a violation.
2017.17-269,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3506.2,3509.48,"Counsel, I -- I -- you know, I -- I have read the language."
2017.17-269,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3531.88,3535.84,"In Fishing Vessel, the Court said the tribe -- each side is entitled to half the available fish."
2017.17-269,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3535.84,3536.76,Right.
2017.17-269,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3538.2,3540.16,Unless less than that is sufficient to provide a moderate living.
2017.17-269,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3540.16,3541.6,Exactly.
2017.17-269,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3569.04,3571.64,We said we would not dispute that the tribes were not currently earning a moderate living from fishing.
2017.17-269,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3572.4,3572.52,So --
2017.17-269,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3572.52,3573.6,-- the district court said I don't need to define this term.
2017.17-269,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3573.6,3574.84,So it doesn't really matter.
2017.17-269,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3580.32,3580.8,"No, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3588.48,3598.76,"Yes, but -- but what I'm saying to you is, if you stipulated that they're not making a moderate living, they're still entitled to 50 percent of the undegradated catch."
2017.17-269,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3598.76,3601.28,"That's not what the Court held in Fishing Vessel at all, Your Honor."
2017.17-269,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3619.36,3619.88,Then my words are -- are wrong.
2017.17-269,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3634.64,3637.08,"Again, that's not the Court -- the approach the Court took in Fishing Vessel."
2017.17-269,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3690.56,3691.32,"Thank you, counsel."
