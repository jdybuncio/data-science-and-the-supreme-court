1966.89,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,36.194,"Number 89, Roy Walker, petitioner versus Southern Railway Company."
1966.89,0,31044,j_nat_hamrick,,38.368,43.985,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Court."
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1604.664,1608.543,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1705.34,1709.581,Well did the contractual remedies track the Railway Labor Act?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1709.581,1710.386,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you?"
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1710.386,1716.034,Did they -- did the contractual divisions track the Railway Labor Act?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1716.034,1725.216,The contractual provisions provided for normal handling of the dispute up through the various officers who would be responsible for it.
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1726.858,1730.035,And then did it provide for the Adjustment Board?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1730.035,1735.003,It -- the contract itself did not specifically mention the Adjustment Board.
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1744.008,1752.121,"Well, it doesn't make much difference about the contract and one way or another does it except -- the Railway Labor Act could make go to the board anyway."
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1752.121,1753.153,"Well, this is correct."
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1754.898,1764.874,"You can't contract out of that division that -- can you -- you couldn't by agreement say, well our grievances, we're going to have settled to Court?"
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1764.874,1767.424,"No, I didn't say that you couldn't."
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1767.424,1782.391,"Well, the obligation to go to the Board as I understand it is made mandatory by the statute in those cases where the Court's jurisdiction attaches which matters of interpretation and application of what the party agreement."
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1782.391,1794.908,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan and this is precisely such a case because the question of the laws of Mr. Walker's seniority turns on that language of a provision of a contract."
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1794.908,1799.819,"But -- but may I ask this, you say it precisely such case."
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1804.077,1804.256,No.
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1805.417,1815.184,And didn't more say that -- that was instance where the obligation that to go to the Adjustment Board was not present.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1825.183,1825.939,This is correct.
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1825.939,1831.111,Now is that a matter -- that then was matter of statutory interpretation of the Act --
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1831.111,1846.704,I would have thought that the Moore case was perhaps not so much a matter of statutory interpretation as it was a notion that state law could have some application in this field.
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1848.603,1863.659,"Well, but -- but isn't that -- I wouldn't that necessarily have to be a plus the statutory construction if the provision for the Adjustment Board is a mandatory requirements of those provisions."
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1875.167,1879.219,"Well, I would have viewed more as I started to say before."
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1889.404,1898.509,"Well tell me this, to affirm do we have to overrule Moore, in this case?"
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1898.509,1899.227,I believe so.
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1899.227,1900.01,Uh-hum.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1900.01,1900.477,Unless --
1966.89,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1900.477,1903.294,We certainly didn't overrule Moore and Maddox?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1903.294,1905.097,"No, that -- that's quite correct."
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.768,1943.411,What's your answer to the -- what the idea that the Adjustment Board is really that the employee there would just be before the same two people who already said that he was rightfully discharged --
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1943.411,1943.962,"Well, here --"
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.962,1945.023,-- not wrongfully.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1955.173,1969.513,"Mr. Justice White, this whole line of argument is predicated on an assumption that there is something inherently untrustworthy about the Railroad Adjustment Board simply because it is a balance agency."
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.513,1981.611,"I know but the Government -- but the normal dispute, you have to admit arises almost all the time when the union and management has come to let things points of view."
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,1981.611,1982.585,This is correct.
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.153,2044.096,"Now, under the Act if the thing isn't settled on the property and the employee isn't satisfied, doesn't one side of the other half to take it to the Adjustment Board?"
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2044.096,2047.019,"Well, either the em -- the carrier."
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.019,2047.564,Yes.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2047.564,2052.029,"The Union or an employee, an employee himself can take --"
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.029,2052.659,"Oh, he can?"
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2052.659,2053.453,"Oh, yes."
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.453,2055.672,The Union cannot refuse on his behalf to --
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2055.672,2056.11,No.
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.11,2056.353,--before the Adjustment Board?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2056.353,2059.554,"No, an employee has a right to take a case before the Adjustment Board."
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.554,2060.282,Why?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2075.388,2076.065,Yes.
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.065,2078.395,There'll be no impartial party involved.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2091.136,2094.411,I believe that there are variations in this practice.
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.554,2100.556,Have you ever heard of a trial in the sense of witnesses being heard before --
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2100.556,2107.129,I believe that in the article by Garrison we've cited in --
1966.89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.129,2107.422,Yes.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2107.422,2115.724,"-- our brief, mention is made of cases in which hearings have been held and I think that from time to time there are hearings."
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2121.59,2123.491,But before you go to that.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2145.985,2147.412,"Well, Your Honor I --"
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2147.412,2153.391,"If you do, I'd like to have your report to the letter they originally sent to him."
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2153.391,2163.124,The letter that was sent to Mr. Walker told him to report for work within 30 days pursuant to a specific provision of a contract for --
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2163.124,2163.471,I understand that.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2163.471,2165.103,-- for -- forfeit his seniority.
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2165.103,2167.525,But I'm talking about the next letter that they wrote to him?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2167.525,2171.811,He was then told that because of his failure to report within the time period.
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2183.4,2185.287,"They went farther than that, didn't they?"
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2190.72,2191.031,That is quite --
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2191.031,2194.064,What is that mean in the common language?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2196.475,2202.282,I -- I don't -- I don't intend or try to make a great issue out of the distinction.
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2219.151,2222.472,I -- I understand but -- I understand your position there.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2230.458,2231.019,"Well, I -- I was --"
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2231.019,2231.662,What are the two?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2234.129,2234.588,"Well, I -- I would --"
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2234.588,2237.619,"That you are entitled to have one of the two, I would think."
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2237.619,2240.732,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would say that as a practical matter."
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2247.971,2252.033,"Well, we might consider that difference but you --"
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2252.033,2252.072,He --
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2252.072,2253.851,-- do you concede that he was discharged?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2253.851,2255.839,"No, I do not say that he was discharged if one --"
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2255.839,2261.893,Would you read the last -- would you read the last paragraph of that letter that I just referred to.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2278.142,2281.252,"The last paragraph, just please turn in all company property."
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2281.252,2282.35,What page it is in?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2282.699,2284.49,This is page 68.
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2284.49,2288.328,68 of the record.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2288.328,2304.88,"The second to the last paragraph, “as you did not report and protect your seniority as instructed and this is to advise you under the provisions of the Fireman's Agreement, Article 25 (e) (3), that your name has been stricken from the Fireman Seniority List and you are no longer considered an employee of the Southern Railroad Company.”"
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2304.88,2309.739,That the man be – could a man be discharged any more effectively?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2309.739,2311.657,"Your Honor, I say as practical matter."
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2312.401,2317.619,But why do we quiver about it whether it's impractical matter or whether he is?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2326.929,2331.913,You had said before Mr. Chief Justice that you didn't care which way I came out on this --
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2331.913,2332.181,"Well, I just want --"
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2332.181,2332.956,-- it was the question how I viewed it.
1966.89,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2332.956,2334.701,-- I just want to know your position.
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2350.543,2359.138,"I would say that in the context of the agreement, he was not discharged."
1966.89,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2371.507,2374.025,Who would represent him if he stayed in front of the Board?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2374.025,2374.79,I beg your pardon?
1966.89,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2374.79,2378.998,Who would represent this fellow if he stayed in front of the Board?
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2378.998,2382.556,"Well, I assume he could have Mr. Hamrick represent him."
1966.89,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2383.185,2386.991,"You have a lawyer to try it before that Railroad Board, it is?"
1966.89,1,28885,jerome_ackerman,,2386.991,2387.796,Right.
1966.89,2,31044,j_nat_hamrick,,2908.303,2909.177,"Thank you, sir."
1966.89,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2909.177,2912.865,"A few moments Mr. Hamrick, you have two minutes left."
1966.89,2,31044,j_nat_hamrick,,2912.865,2914.537,"Thank you, sir."
1966.89,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2939.133,2941.01,"Oh, no -- not that issue --"
1966.89,2,31044,j_nat_hamrick,,2941.01,2942.531,The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.
1966.89,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2942.531,2944.27,All of these?
1966.89,2,31044,j_nat_hamrick,,2944.27,2944.917,"Yes, sir."
1966.89,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2970.549,2973.474,Very well.
