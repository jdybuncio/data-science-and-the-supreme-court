1978.77-1465,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.374,We will here arguments next in Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation against Rasmussen and the consolidated case.
1978.77-1465,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,61.075,64.257,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1465,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,205.382,209.948,I take it then that your entire case rests on 6 (d)?
1978.77-1465,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,209.948,219.468,"We believe that Section 6 (d) provides for the ceiling, the application of the 6 (b) (1) ceiling to death benefits."
1978.77-1465,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,639.058,646.401,"I suppose you must concede that Congress as is so often the case, could have drafted it a little more intelligently?"
1978.77-1465,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,646.401,648.722,"Indeed, we should had."
1978.77-1465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.876,681.134,"Mr. Jones, while you are interrupted, where is Section 10 in the briefs you rely on this?"
1978.77-1465,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,681.134,691.983,"Yes, it is shown on page 16 of our brief in the text."
1978.77-1465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,711.582,713.796,It's cited as 10 (f) there.
1978.77-1465,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,713.796,721.157,"Well, 10 (f) and 10 (h) are both relevant as we discuss briefly in our brief."
1978.77-1465,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,738.781,741.829,Do you quote 10 (h) in your brief?
1978.77-1465,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,741.829,744.089,I believe it is quoted.
1978.77-1465,1,16976,albert_h_sennett,,1063.652,1065.469,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1465,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1351.858,1357.972,"Very well, Mr. Ostmann."
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,1357.972,1361.11,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Court.
1978.77-1465,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.031,1686.562,Did the Commission distinguish between maximums and minimums for disability and maximum and minimums for death benefits?
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,1686.562,1693.721,"When they discussed maximums and minimums at the beginning of the report, there was no distinction made."
1978.77-1465,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.746,1704.849,Did they later make any distinguish between?
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,1704.849,1706.486,"Yes they, we believe they did."
1978.77-1465,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1831.976,1845.578,Isn't it true that a death benefit could be lost by a widow's remarriage in a fairly short period of time whereas a disability benefit could continue for a rather indefinite period of time?
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,1845.578,1846.756,That's correct.
1978.77-1465,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1936.386,1940.867,I am not sure what you want us to draw from that concept?
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,1940.867,1952.471,"Well, I think what's important about that is that concept was not recommended by the National Commission, was not even discussed by the National Commission."
1978.77-1465,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1961.597,1974.112,"Mr. Ostmann, on that point, if the person dies while he is receiving permanent disability benefits under the statute, the Section you just read, will that disability benefit be converted into a death benefit?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,1974.112,1976.122,I wouldn't say it is exactly converted.
1978.77-1465,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.743,1991.168,"And then if he was in a high enough weekly wage, here the benefit would rise?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,1991.168,1991.934,That's correct.
1978.77-1465,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1991.934,1994.641,Yeah.
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,1994.641,2004.97,"Respondents submit that this language, I just mentioned from Section 9 which is another example of the Congress here treating death benefits in a more expansive way that they have been treated before."
1978.77-1465,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.053,2225.874,"But Mr. Ostmann, if the exclusion of temporary disability beneficiaries from the language of 6 (d) is intended to exclude them, why wouldn't the same rationale apply to the Section 10 as well because if that refers only to permanent and death and fails to mention temporary why wouldn't, why do you need the (d)?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2225.874,2248.26,"We believe that 10 (f) is in there to show that all recipients of permanent total disability and death benefits will get the increase, the benefit of an increase because without that Section the only individuals that would get an increase would be those whose benefits are figured on a national average weekly wage."
1978.77-1465,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2251.456,2260.393,"I understand that, but wouldn't 10 (f) of its own force exclude temporary disability recipients for any increases?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2260.393,2275.572,It would perhaps exclude the entire range of them but we would say without 6 (d) the question would still be open in minimum and maximum situations where the benefits are figured in disability on the national average weekly wage.
1978.77-1465,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2287.943,2298.624,"Mr. Ostmann, if there is redundancy between the two sections, do you think that your case is demolished, can you live with redundancy?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2298.624,2300.832,"Well, I could live with redundancy Your Honor."
1978.77-1465,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2300.832,2302.275,It's a question whether we can?
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2302.275,2304.613,"Yes, that's true, that's certainly the question."
1978.77-1465,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.209,2326.978,"There is one strange thing about the 6 (d), it refers to determinations under this subsection?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2326.978,2327.505,Yes.
1978.77-1465,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.505,2330.811,What subsection you understand that it referred to?
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2330.811,2337.711,I believe as everyone in the case has agree that there was an oversight that should refer to Section 6.
1978.77-1465,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.711,2338.729,It would be a Section rather --
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2338.729,2343.522,"Yes, because in that bill it was a subsection."
1978.77-1465,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2343.522,2363.192,"I suppose counsel you have read some of the published articles of members of the Congress, which would hardly support your suggestion that the -- really members the Congress knew what was in the statute and how the statutory scheme worked."
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2373.424,2395.845,"Yes Your Honor, that it is true however we believe that when the entire legislative history is read here, the choices to go what the government called the torturous route of finding through a myriad of provisions, a death benefit maximum or to declare that the Congress eliminated it."
1978.77-1465,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2395.845,2419.341,"Well, they couple that argument as I hear that either express or by implication that this tortured route takes them to what is the sensible and reasonable solution and did any other route does not produce the sensible and reasonable solution in light of the total purposes of the Act?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2419.341,2421.435,We would not agree with that Your Honor.
1978.77-1465,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.873,2477.977,"Mr. Ostmann after hearing this before the revised 2381 or 2318 whichever it was proposed, how much testimony was there in support of the view that there should be no maximums at all, is there significant testimony?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2477.977,2480.908,"There was substantial testimony to that effect, Your Honor."
1978.77-1465,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.406,2500.639,"So, what you are cutting through all the language, your basic position is that even though it doesn't appear in the legislative reports directly that there must been a compromise between the two facts and they said okay we will but the ceiling in -- keep a ceiling on disability and take it often and."
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2500.639,2508.035,"Yes, we believe that for instance the National Commission's discussions of death in a different light indicates that."
1978.77-1465,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2521.507,2541.107,"What if we would conclude that the statutory language is absolutely clear that disabilities do have maximums and death benefits do not, but we were also to conclude that we can't think of any conceivable reason why Congress would do that, should we affirm or reverse?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2541.107,2550.312,"I would say affirm, Your Honor because I believe the function of the judiciary is to determine what the statute says and what the Congress intended."
1978.77-1465,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.54,2574.689,Having no reason wouldn't be as bad as having an unreasonable reason?
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2574.689,2578.006,"Well, either one Your Honor I guess but."
1978.77-1465,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.006,2583.204,"Either one, either way you can -- [Attempt to Laughter]."
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2583.204,2593.96,In any event in our estimation 6 (d) is designed to establish that the lower classes of disability are frozen at the level when they are awarded.
1978.77-1465,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2601.758,2608.838,Was this part of the 1972 amendments were -- there were some trade-offs on both sides?
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2608.838,2608.957,Yes.
1978.77-1465,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.957,2615.976,So then why do you talk about this being beneficently construed and liberally construed toward a worker?
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2623.637,2629.45,I think historically the development of workmen's compensation has been to benefit the worker.
1978.77-1465,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2629.45,2641.993,"Well then, that may be true historically, but as I understand your response to my question there was just some pretty hard nosed bargaining in 1972 and management was on one side and labor was on the other?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2641.993,2653.371,"That's correct Your Honor, but the benefits were enhanced for instance unseaworthiness doctrine was removed as an alternative remedy, that was one of the trade-offs and there were others."
1978.77-1465,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2653.371,2663.279,"How should we construe the removal of the unseaworthiness doctrine, unseaworthiness doctrine beneficently, remedially?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2663.279,2680.952,"We believe that when the statute is to be construed by the courts, it is to be construed in favor of the worker and his family because that has been the historical purpose of workmen's comp to create a liability without fault against the employee."
1978.77-1465,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.952,2685.224,"How about the elimination of the unseaworthiness remedy, how should that be construed?"
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2685.224,2688.169,"I think that's a very clear elimination, Your Honor."
1978.77-1465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2698.32,2701.097,Because it just didn't make sense.
1978.77-1465,2,32285,james_buckley_ostmann,,2701.097,2709.956,"In a sense it created dual remedies for the workers, that's correct."
1978.77-1465,3,16976,albert_h_sennett,,2776.367,2777.345,I have a brief rebuttal.
1978.77-1465,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2804.962,2807.491,"Mr. Sennett, can I interrupt you there?"
1978.77-1465,3,16976,albert_h_sennett,,2815.598,2816.711,"There certainly is, Your Honor."
1978.77-1465,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2816.711,2824.095,"But why is it totally irrational for a couple of Senators on opposite sides of the argument to say, well we split the difference and will take it off one, but not the other?"
1978.77-1465,3,16976,albert_h_sennett,,2824.095,2840.261,"Because in the light of a compensation system which is meant to replace the loss of wages to a family, the logic would be to as indicated previously in the opening remarks to increase disability benefits because the impact of a loss of wages of a man who is --"
1978.77-1465,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.261,2847.48,"Well, but may be in a negotiation between the two they thought there are less dollars writing on death benefits than there are disability benefits and let's make this our trade-off."
1978.77-1465,3,16976,albert_h_sennett,,2847.48,2872.129,"It's perhaps, well it might be well to speculate about that but along those lines keep in mind the Longshore Act by extension applies to employees of District of Columbia to commonwealth employees to a vast variety of employees, many of them enjoyed very substantial salaries greatly in excess of what has been contemplated for Longshoremen."
1978.77-1465,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2919.502,2925.541,"And with that 167, they would have to divide all the care for him?"
1978.77-1465,3,16976,albert_h_sennett,,2925.541,2941.354,"That 167 would last and that is the reason for the increases on a yearly basis provided by the Congress, it's exactly what Congress had in mind Mr. Justice and that is because of that concern of that kind of money would not reflect the needs of a family."
1978.77-1465,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2948.305,2952.954,Just where we get this concept of a premium on death?
1978.77-1465,3,16976,albert_h_sennett,,2952.954,2955.739,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that this perhaps in illustration --"
1978.77-1465,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2955.739,2972.949,The family was one one fewer persons to support and no medical bills gets almost three times as much as the family which still has the totally disabled father head of the household.
1978.77-1465,3,16976,albert_h_sennett,,2972.949,2978.92,"It sounds like somewhat of a cynical remark, kept in light of the fact this is a compensation system and not a damage system."
1978.77-1465,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2983.14,2996.407,That course is that you and the Solicitor General argued that reading of the statute just doesn't make any sense and Congress should not be considered to help.
1978.77-1465,3,16976,albert_h_sennett,,2997.303,3013.621,"We believe that Congress has given a signal to the Court and the signal perhaps is a bit murky, but the signal was there and that one examines the intent of a system I think the answer is relatively straight forward and self-evident."
1978.77-1465,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3018.131,3019.06,Thank you gentlemen.
