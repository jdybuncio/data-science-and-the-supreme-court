1993.92-9059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.117,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-9059, Jonathan Dale Simmons v. South Carolina."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,49.965,53.626,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-9059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.745,189.163,Mr.--
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,197.451,199.121,"No, not at all."
1993.92-9059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.964,226.269,"Well, can a State say that we're not going to answer jury questions that involve collateral matters that are just going to distract the jury?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,226.269,228.109,Certainly.
1993.92-9059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,262.304,267.445,Do juries or judges in South Carolina impose sentences in noncapital cases?
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,267.445,267.956,"No, they do not."
1993.92-9059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.956,270.037,"Well, one must."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,273.219,273.45,"Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me."
1993.92-9059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.215,295.745,"So supposing that in a noncapital case a jury comes in with a question after some deliberation and they want to know what the sentence is for this offense if they find the person guilty, is a State obligated to furnish that information?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,295.745,296.686,Not by any means.
1993.92-9059,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,317.518,324.394,"What your position really boils down to is not, as I understand it, a position about information or a position about alternatives."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,336.391,336.682,Yes.
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.641,373.855,"What if the jury asks... surely, you know, how severe the alternative punishment is is always an issue."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,385.513,392.418,I would submit that there is... one quite reach... readily reaches a de minimis level where the--
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.418,393.059,"Well, I don't know that that's de minimis."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,398.582,401.094,--Um--
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.094,407.658,Those are very relevant questions for a jury that wants to know how severely this person is going to be punished if the capital sentence is not imposed.
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,410.03,422.087,"--I don't think they have absolutely no relevance, but I think it is within the broad range of the State's ability, under cases such as Johnson v. Texas, to channel and mold the jury's consideration of sentencing factors."
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,422.087,422.748,But just not this question.
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,423.947,425.51,"No, that's correct."
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.317,439.319,What if there's a statutory amendment pending that would eliminate parole?
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,443.843,445.083,--That would eliminate parole--
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.083,449.457,"There is no... parole is unavailable... I'm sorry, that would make parole available."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,454.007,456.2,--I would think--
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.2,462.863,"I mean, isn't that the problem of answering them with respect to anything that--"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,462.863,465.806,"--I don't think the Constitution, obviously, requires that they be told."
1993.92-9059,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,483.528,486.76,--But you... you keep answering these questions in terms of information.
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,506.371,517.44,"Well, I agree with that, but I suppose the... Justice Scalia's question could always be posed, well, it means life without parole, but then it also means that he will or won't have a TV set."
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.169,521.082,"It's life in prison, but it isn't really prison."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,521.082,522.554,--Whatever.
1993.92-9059,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,532.381,533.961,But doesn't... but your point is the meaning of a word.
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,533.961,534.762,Yes.
1993.92-9059,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,534.762,535.313,Yeah.
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,535.313,535.92,"Yes, that's right."
1993.92-9059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,539.744,544.398,"Well, do you argue simply that you're entitled to the instruction if the jury asks?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,544.398,545.307,--No.
1993.92-9059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,545.307,553.742,Is not the foundation of your argument that the defense counsel is entitled to make this argument to the jury if it chooses?
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,553.742,554.403,Absolutely.
1993.92-9059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,562.18,562.708,"Well, what--"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,579.521,599.414,"--Well, turning to the Eighth Amendment, the Skipper-Locket aspect, which this Court need not reach, but if it were to reach that, I think the language from Justice Powell's opinion in McCleskey, any relevant circumstance which could cause the jury to fail to... to decline to impose the death penalty."
1993.92-9059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,599.834,611.191,"So if a prosecutor wanted to put in... or, pardon me, a defense counsel wanted to put in a videotape of what an execution looks like, he should be able to do that so the jury could see the consequences of what they're doing?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,611.191,611.732,--No.
1993.92-9059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,636.316,638.229,I suppose we're struggling for the definition of what's relevant.
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,638.229,638.76,Yes.
1993.92-9059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,638.76,643.162,"How are we going to do that in the confines of this case, other than make it parole specific?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,643.162,658.141,"Well, of course, this case is about parole, and the Court need go no further than to say that when the State has a... has a dangerous mentally ill defendant who it wishes to execute, it cannot urge the jury... it cannot create a false dilemma."
1993.92-9059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,661.493,664.296,But that leaves us without a guiding principle.
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,664.296,671.521,The Court has struggled with the meaning of relevant.
1993.92-9059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,701.669,721.682,"Mr. Bruck, may I try to ask what it is exactly you're urging, that the defendant had a right to put in evidence about what the parole system law meant in South Carolina?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,721.682,724.356,"No, we do not think that it was necessary."
1993.92-9059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,728.988,743.717,"Well, is it an argument that the defendant's lawyer should have been allowed to argue it to the jury, or do you say that in every case the trial court should, sua sponte, instruct on it?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,748.309,749.28,--I'm asking--
1993.92-9059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,749.28,750.682,What's your request here?
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,750.682,760.717,"--I'm asking you to hold that where parole is not an option, where State law is clear, as it is here, that the jury not have that information withheld from them."
1993.92-9059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,765.994,778.268,"But if you were allowed to tell the jury in your argument that life means life, you wouldn't have a constitutional objection, I take it."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,780.802,781.1,Yes.
1993.92-9059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.1,786.874,"But does it require the judge to tell them, or... the judge wouldn't permit you to tell them either, right?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,786.874,787.725,That's correct.
1993.92-9059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,789.657,799.314,"So is there a constitutional distinction that requires the judge be the one to say it, or is your point that the term ""life"" must be defined... you must be allowed to define it for the jury?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,803.567,805.117,It is the latter.
1993.92-9059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,819.986,820.717,I assume--
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,839.351,852.297,"Yes, I think that the... it's... it is difficult for me to lay down a rule, I think, that does not have some element of generality in it to propose one."
1993.92-9059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.623,869.778,"Yes, but isn't it part of your case... now I don't know if... there's some evidence in the record, as I understand it, that without this instruction the jury will be acting on a false premise."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,869.778,872.29,"Absolutely, absolutely."
1993.92-9059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.29,878.595,"So your... whatever your standard is, it's limited to situations, as I understand it, where in the absence of an instruction the jury will be mislead."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,878.595,879.235,Yes.
1993.92-9059,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,879.235,881.796,"And mislead, as I understand it, about the law."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,881.796,883.569,"That's correct, about the meaning--"
1993.92-9059,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,883.569,892.414,"You sometimes speak in terms of fact, but what you want them told is what a legal term means which they have got to use in sentencing."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,892.414,892.963,--That is correct.
1993.92-9059,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,892.963,901.959,"And some jurors may think it means life subject to parole, other jurors may think it means life without parole, and you want that legal definition given to them."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,901.959,902.58,That is correct.
1993.92-9059,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,902.58,917.701,"So why don't you just limit your principle here to saying when there is a legitimate doubt about the meaning of a term which is used in instructing the jury, and which the jury must, in turn, use in sentencing, that term must be defined."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,919.593,931.358,That is a entirely satisfactory way of framing the issue and it does... I must say that it does simplify the issue of how to--
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.358,932.019,"It does, Mr. Bruck."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,955.044,955.835,--I read Ramos--
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.835,956.276,Fair is fair.
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,956.276,957.247,--Fair is fair.
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,957.247,958.367,"If it goes to the meaning of the word, right, right."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,958.367,958.968,Fair is fair.
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.968,960.961,"Now, it is my impression... it is--"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,961.859,963.321,I agree with that if it's true.
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.321,963.84,--Yeah.
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,963.84,967.413,"If the prosecutor can produce South Carolina law to show that, in fact--"
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.413,968.164,"Right, right, right."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,968.164,969.764,"--Life doesn't really mean life, even though there's no parole."
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,971.256,993.859,"It's my impression that some States exclude information about parole for the very purpose that juries will not distort the State parole system by discounting it in advance, so that knowing that a person's going to get time off for good behavior, or whatever, they up the sentence from what it otherwise would be in order to defeat the parole system."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,993.859,994.27,Yes.
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,994.27,996.672,"That's a perfectly rational thing for a State to do, it seems to me."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1007.571,1008.92,"No, I don't say that can't be done at all."
1993.92-9059,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1012.522,1017.205,Isn't the crucial fact that the jury is sentencing here and the jury is normally not sentencing.
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1017.205,1018.076,"Well, that's true."
1993.92-9059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1029.653,1037.27,"Well, what if the jury comes in with a question after deliberation and asks in what prison would a life term be served?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1037.27,1047.214,"Well, I do not view that as part of the legal definition of its sentencing alternative."
1993.92-9059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1047.214,1051.399,"Well, then, how do you define the legal definition of a sentencing alternative?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1051.399,1055.502,"Well, South Carolina law does not provide for statutory law."
1993.92-9059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1089.043,1099.849,"Well, could a State... could a State... could the prosecutor produce evidence that the place all these lifers are sent is really not a very well built prison and it would be fairly easy to break out of?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1099.849,1118.172,"If that information is accurate, I think that that... that under the... I would be very surprised if a State supreme court would allow that sort of collateral trial, but I, frankly, have to say I don't read the Eighth Amendment, under your cases, as creating a bar."
1993.92-9059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.018,1128.42,"Well, isn't it even narrower than that, Mr. Bruck?"
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1137.174,1138.093,Yes.
1993.92-9059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.093,1145.99,"Now, in the Chief Justice's example it presumes, you know, one State prison in each State, and presumably there's not much doubt about where the man's going to go, so you wouldn't need the instruction."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1145.99,1146.691,That's correct.
1993.92-9059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.691,1152.964,"And if they thought they were all going to spend their life in a country club somewhere, then perhaps it would be appropriate to clear up the misunderstanding."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1152.964,1153.595,That's correct.
1993.92-9059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.595,1163.612,"You're saying the jury will send this man to his death if he... if it knows he's only otherwise going to be in prison for 25 years, whereas it might otherwise not."
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1163.612,1166.795,"Might, and we submit in this case likely did, yes."
1993.92-9059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1166.795,1167.265,Well.
1993.92-9059,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1171.307,1197.833,"Because of the way the case was presented; because of the facts of the case; because of the manifest dangerousness of this man's record and of his mental illness; because of the prosecuted argument; because of the fact that the defense was prevented from making this crucial argument that you can protect society adequately, you can exercise the right of collective self-defense without putting him to death."
1993.92-9059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1236.488,1248.407,"Mr. Bruck, but if we're talking about what does the term ""life"" mean, I take it you're saying you should be allowed, or the judge should instruct to say that there is no parole in this case."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1405.429,1408.572,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court:"
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1442.565,1448.149,"Why don't we assume that they were asking what they asked, and they asked about eligibility for parole?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1448.149,1451.771,"Well, Justice Souter, they may have asked about eligibility for parole."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1466.999,1480.89,"Well, maybe Mr. Bruck's suggested instruction was inaccurate in that respect, but do you take the position that the jury should not be told the meaning of a term about which it has a legitimate question?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1480.89,1484.513,I think the jury should be told the meaning of the term.
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1484.513,1500.753,"Well, do you think there's a legitimate question possible in the minds of jurors, given what most people know or think they know about the penal system, as to whether or not the term ""life"" includes a parole eligibility factor or whether it doesn't?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1501.944,1511.869,"I think it is a legitimate question, and the response by the South Carolina judge under the South Carolina case of Torrence is that you cannot consider parole; do not consider parole or parole eligibility."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1511.869,1517.403,"In other words, it's a legitimate question about the meaning of the terms, but the jury cannot be given a legal answer."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1517.403,1522.618,"Well, I think that the jury was given the legal answer, which is something we should not consider."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1524.758,1535.216,"But the consequence of that, it seems to me, based on what you've already said, is that the jury should not be informed about the meaning of a term that it's got to use."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1542.63,1545.314,"They were given the meaning of the term ""life""."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1546.112,1548.543,You mean in the last sentence of the judge's response.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1548.543,1548.783,--Yes.
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1548.783,1549.765,Plain and ordinary meaning.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1549.765,1550.135,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1550.536,1558.04,"But isn't the problem with that that that is a... given the premise of the question, it is a totally ambiguous answer."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1582.989,1584.717,--Well the answer was life means life.
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1586.079,1588.01,"No, that isn't what the answer was."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1591.573,1592.464,--Without considering--
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1592.464,1596.625,"--And if you give it a plain meaning in a strict sense, it means life means life."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1607.053,1609.074,--But they have been told not to consider parole.
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1609.074,1613.997,"But you're then simply, it seems to me, backtracking on your answer."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1618.931,1620.733,"No, sir, I don't dispute that."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1620.733,1623.274,"And you are now saying, but they can't be told about that term."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1623.274,1626.765,I don't think that is a term that is necessary for them to know about in sentencing.
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1628.636,1635.271,"In other words when they have to make a choice between the death penalty and life imprisonment, they don't need to know the meaning of life imprisonment?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1635.271,1640.624,"--Life imprisonment, for their purposes, was defined as life imprisonment."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1641.065,1647.269,"Well, we're getting... we're getting nowhere, because the question is whether they are entitled to a clear definition responsive to their question."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1647.269,1652.161,--And I submit that they got a clear definition of that charge.
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1652.161,1663.191,"So your answer, then, is that they were entitled to the answer, they are entitled to know the meaning of the terms they have to use, but there's no problem here because the definition they got was adequate."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1663.191,1666.711,"They do not need to know the definition of the term ""parole"" to make that decision."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1666.711,1669.893,"But they do need to know the definition of the term ""life"" or ""life imprisonment""."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1669.893,1670.363,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1671.615,1671.875,Okay.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1674.848,1676.187,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1676.187,1676.748,Okay.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1676.748,1683.423,"To go beyond life means life, and that's exactly what they were told, we would have to discuss pardon, work release, furlough."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1683.423,1685.524,"Excuse me, I don't want to play with words, but that is not exactly what they were told."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1690.098,1690.647,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.953,1701.105,"Well, what you contend is that they were told that the sentence that they would impose would be a sentence of life imprisonment."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1701.105,1701.515,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.515,1719.687,"And you think they do not have to be told that there are other laws which we have in our State which would enable a person sentenced to life in prison, which is a sentence for life, to perhaps get parole, to perhaps get a pardon, to perhaps get work relief, all other different laws which have nothing to do with the meaning of the word ""life""."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1719.687,1721.378,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1730.694,1745.144,"But I take it, then, that if we think or a majority of us think that the definition was inadequate, that it just did not respond to the jury's perplexity, that you would agree there would have to be a reversal here?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1745.144,1747.303,"No, sir, I would not agree with that."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1747.303,1755.018,Then I don't understand what I thought was your answer to the question of whether the jury was or was not entitled to be told the definition of the terms it was using.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1762.404,1763.386,"No, sir."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1775.003,1782.007,"But let's assume, for the sake of the hypothetical, that it does fail, there would have to be a reversal, wouldn't there?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1782.007,1790.441,"Well, I would submit that the definitional term of ""life imprisonment"", if you have to define every term, if you have to parse--"
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1790.441,1799.28,"No, but you're... with respect, I don't want to cut off your argument, but I want you to answer my question, and I think what you're doing is basically denying my premise."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1804.352,1805.902,--You--
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1805.902,1808.684,--Do you agree that there would have to be a reversal here?
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1808.684,1814.118,"--As to the second part of the charge, if that was inadequate, that life means life, that you were to give it the plain and ordinary meaning."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1814.118,1814.849,"Yeah, yeah."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1814.849,1820.882,I would not concede that because of the prior sentence which... in which the judge indicated do not consider parole or parole--
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1820.882,1829.216,"Well, then it... then you are taking the position that the jury is not entitled to know the meaning of the terms which it must use in pronouncing the sentence."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1829.216,1831.039,--I am of the opinion--
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1831.039,1838.904,"Because you are saying, if I understand you, that they do have to use this term, but it is perfectly proper to deny them a definition of it."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1838.904,1839.434,--The term--
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1839.434,1841.004,Because that's what South Carolina said.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1841.004,1842.837,--I just don't think parole is part of the definition of the term--
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1842.837,1843.606,I'm not talking about parole.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1846.0,1846.908,"--No, what I'm saying is--"
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1846.908,1851.613,Do they have to be given the definition of life imprisonment if they're going to use that as a sentencing alternative?
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1851.613,1855.684,--I think that they have to be given... they have to have a definition of life.
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1859.667,1860.589,"Okay, so we're back to the question."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1867.942,1868.292,Right.
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1868.292,1869.194,And I'm not asking you to concede it.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1872.507,1878.41,"If one of the two sentences is misunderstood, there's a reasonable likelihood of misunderstanding under Boyde, yes, sir."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1878.41,1878.921,Okay.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1878.921,1882.913,If we have not met the Boyde... the Boyde v. California standard.
1993.92-9059,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1882.913,1891.328,"But you say it's legally irrelevant that there are, in fact, two different kinds of life sentences, life with parole and life without parole, that that's legally irrelevant?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1891.328,1891.989,That is correct.
1993.92-9059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1891.989,1905.359,"Mr. Harpootlian, do most States that have a system of life without parole tell the juries that it's life imprisonment without parole?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1905.359,1910.02,"There are a variety... different States have different schemes, if you will."
1993.92-9059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1916.154,1925.691,It was my understanding that most States that have adopted a life imprisonment without parole go ahead and advise juries if a jury is sentencing--
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1925.691,1926.28,--Many--
1993.92-9059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1926.28,1928.143,--That it's life imprisonment without parole.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1928.143,1932.026,"--Many do, but many have a specific verdict by the jury of life without parole."
1993.92-9059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1932.026,1937.049,How many States would do as South Carolina and refuse to clarify that?
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1937.049,1937.53,There are three.
1993.92-9059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1937.53,1939.09,And they are?
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1939.09,1947.415,"Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina... and Pennsylvania, I'm sorry."
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.415,1952.849,Pennsylvania instead of North Carolina or in addition?
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,1952.849,1953.518,"Yes, sir, I'm sorry."
1993.92-9059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2002.762,2012.557,"Suppose in a case the prosecutor tells the jury, sentence this man to death because if you don't he can roam free some day and kill somebody?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2027.618,2028.939,That is not the circumstances in this case.
1993.92-9059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2032.631,2033.242,"Well, that's my next point."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2054.775,2060.572,"No argument about release, about parole, about being back out on the street."
1993.92-9059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2062.192,2069.277,You don't think jurors could fairly infer from that argument that he was a danger to society because he might be released?
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2069.277,2074.821,"--Well, in this case the petitioner's own psychologist testified he would be dangerous, number one."
1993.92-9059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2077.411,2080.333,All the more reason to tell the jury that he's going to be confined.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2080.333,2102.157,"--Well, the Skipper adaptability evidence was introduced by petitioner and so my position is that pursuant to the argument taken in contex with the judge's charge, and argument by defense counsel where, on Joint Appendix page 125, petitioner's argument was that he's 22 years of age, a life sentence is punishment."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2125.103,2133.689,"Well, wasn't the jury also told by the use of a phrase that described the prisoner as being ""among us""?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2139.205,2141.435,"Yes, sir, in the context... in this context."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2188.336,2195.592,"Well, doesn't the description of him as being amongst us suggest a different answer to Justice Kennedy's question?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2195.592,2198.473,"No, sir, I don't think so."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2198.473,2204.865,I mean it's... the argument is irrelevant unless it is assumed that he will at some point also continue to be amongst us.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2204.865,2213.504,"Well, even if you were to assume that he was parole eligible, as apparently the assumption here is, that the jury assumed that, that doesn't mean he's going to be paroled."
1993.92-9059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2228.702,2243.5,"But, I thought you had conceded at the outset in your answer to my first question that if the prosecutor did make an argument about prevention of future crimes, that counsel... defense counsel could respond to that?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2243.5,2252.937,"That he could... that if he argued future crimes against society in general, yes, I think so, but that wasn't done in this case."
1993.92-9059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2252.937,2261.213,"So if... so if we disagree with you in our interpretation of what the jury might fairly infer from the prosecutor's argument, then we must reverse on that basis?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2261.213,2270.79,"No, sir, again I would not concede that reversal is necessary if you find that there was some talk about future dangerousness beyond the penal institutions."
1993.92-9059,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2342.357,2342.868,Mr.--
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2363.24,2368.674,"Well, in, of course, State v. Atkinson, which is the early... the seventies case, that was the rationale."
1993.92-9059,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2383.754,2386.585,Now we're switching to... Lockett is a different issue.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2392.74,2397.562,"--That is correct, Your Honor, the initial reason."
1993.92-9059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.206,2435.828,May I ask a question about the history of this statute?
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2460.063,2462.234,"--Well, I think that's an oversimplification."
1993.92-9059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2471.982,2478.586,"But is it correct that one of the arguments in response was made; well, we will adopt a rule that will preclude the jury from getting this information?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2478.586,2482.797,"I'm sure someone made that argument, but I don't... in my opinion--"
1993.92-9059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2482.797,2485.699,"Because that's what the State supreme court has, in effect, done."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2485.699,2494.875,"--What the State of South Carolina Supreme Court has done is asked the jury not to consider any... not just parole, but any other extraneous sentencing factor."
1993.92-9059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2494.875,2495.176,"Well, I understand."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2502.773,2503.651,That is correct.
1993.92-9059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2503.651,2508.945,"And the reason for it is that they would therefore be less likely to impose the death sentence, isn't that what the history teaches us?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2508.945,2509.245,"No, sir."
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2510.487,2514.52,That history didn't come from supreme court conferences.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2516.091,2517.442,It came from newspaper articles.
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2517.442,2518.161,From newspaper articles.

1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2522.965,2536.103,"Is there any sentence in South Carolina that... would a jury ever be put nowadays to a choice between life with parole and the death penalty, or is the only... is the only choice between--"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2536.103,2539.275,Life with parole and the death penalty?
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.396,2567.682,"--So, if we believe in evenhandedness and say that the jury must be advised when it is life without parole, we would then say that the jury must be advised when it is life with parole?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2567.682,2568.463,If--
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.463,2570.636,And that situation can arise.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2570.636,2583.243,"--In most cases one would... in South Carolina right now you would have to have a prior... a conviction for a violent crime which carries a substantial sentence, in most instances do your time, get out, commit a subsequent crime."
1993.92-9059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2603.496,2615.206,"Well, we have not advanced a theory in this Court that the State would be mandated to advise the jury that the defendant is eligible parole... for parole."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2615.206,2616.035,That is correct.
1993.92-9059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2616.035,2618.786,"We've just said that it'd be permitted, if it chooses."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2618.786,2619.207,That is correct.
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2619.207,2631.596,"Technically, I take it it was error for the trial judge to include in his response to the juror's question that statement about giving the terms their plain and ordinary meaning."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2637.039,2646.806,"Well, the State supreme court in their decision noted that he used terms that are used in State v. Norris, but they found that not to be error, they found that to be appropriate in this case."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2646.806,2653.979,"So they... I take if they weren't retreating from their position, they must have assumed that it didn't amount to a definition?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2653.979,2657.853,"Your Honor... well, I do not assume that."
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2659.773,2661.366,But a definition would have been error.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2671.551,2674.455,This case stands for the proposition it was not error.
1993.92-9059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2676.356,2679.909,"No, I realize that it has in this case."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2698.148,2703.824,"Well, I would answer that by saying that that they had not previously put the two together."
1993.92-9059,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2800.568,2806.841,"I thought there were some limitations, that this particular defendant would not be eligible for furlough?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2806.841,2808.091,Not under State law he would be.
1993.92-9059,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2815.676,2819.237,"But all this, work release, parole, he wouldn't be eligible for that."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2819.237,2820.99,--Work release he would be eligible for.
1993.92-9059,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2820.99,2822.7,"He would be, this defendant?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2822.7,2827.134,He is eligible under State law for work release.
1993.92-9059,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2830.397,2833.379,We're taking law plus regulations together.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2833.379,2837.1,"--He would not be eligible for extended work release, but as I understand it he would be eligible for work release."
1993.92-9059,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2886.941,2895.79,"Well, you can't say ""must"" because, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, most States that have life without parole do inform the jury of that."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2906.756,2914.931,"--Well, I submit, Justice Ginsburg, the... I agree with you, it should not be, it would not be a must."
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2923.977,2934.713,"Her point is that if it must be provided under coercion, under the coercion of some principle, that principle would require that other things besides parole be provided."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2934.713,2935.604,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.604,2936.996,It's a must in that sense.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2936.996,2938.065,That is correct.
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2938.065,2939.948,Only if we're bound by some principle.
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2939.948,2941.047,If you're bound by some principle.
1993.92-9059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.278,2957.249,"Well, how do we know that?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2961.06,2963.574,--Under State v. Torrence we're not allowed--
1993.92-9059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2963.574,2965.314,"No, but so there... that isn't before us."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2968.756,2969.588,--That is correct.
1993.92-9059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.588,2982.594,"So that if that regime were held to be invalid, then presumably they would have the opportunity in the next case to say we ought to have a fair instruction that tells them there are these... some possibilities of work release that are not often invoked, but it is at least a possibility."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2984.816,2988.899,But the State of South Carolina has decided that is less fair.
1993.92-9059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.899,2992.552,"Well, the State of South Carolina has decided that a half truth is better than a whole truth."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,2992.552,3007.062,"Well, but the half truth that the petitioner would have is that he will... and if you look at the appendix, you will note that he speaks in terms of never being eligible... will spend the rest of his life in jail."
1993.92-9059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3011.713,3018.679,"And as Justice Scalia points out, perhaps the correct principle is that both sides should be willing to have the whole truth come up, but that's not your position."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,3018.679,3022.291,--That is not my position... that is not the State of South Carolina's position.
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3026.724,3030.747,"You think you'd do better, maybe, with the whole truth coming out in all the cases."
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,3030.747,3039.062,"I think that if I could get in front of a jury and read this list of a dozen programs that would make him eligible for release, that we would have no more life sentences in the State of South Carolina."
1993.92-9059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3044.135,3060.536,"And taking just parole alone, if I understood you correctly earlier, under recent statutory amendments in South Carolina you think that there are more cases in which the alternative to death will be life with parole than in which it will be life without parole?"
1993.92-9059,1,39423,richard_a_harpootlian,,3060.536,3063.248,"There is no question in my mind about that, no question."
1993.92-9059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3091.635,3093.746,"Thank you, Mr. Harpootlian."
1993.92-9059,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3095.739,3101.323,"Mr. Chief Justice, I rise only to clarify a couple of factual items."
1993.92-9059,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3136.255,3138.085,Let's assume you had gotten what you asked for.
1993.92-9059,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3156.458,3161.942,"Providing those are accurate, I think under the Eighth Amendment, for purposes of this morning, yes."
1993.92-9059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3176.791,3183.456,Well parole may be very speculative too for someone committed... who's committed a horrible crime and sentenced to life imprisonment.
1993.92-9059,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3183.456,3184.177,--Absolutely.
1993.92-9059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3184.177,3185.108,That's very speculative.
1993.92-9059,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3185.108,3185.486,Yes.
1993.92-9059,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3269.804,3271.626,"Thank you, Mr. Bruck."
