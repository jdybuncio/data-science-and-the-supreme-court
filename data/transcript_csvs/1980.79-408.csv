1980.79-408,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.309,We will hear arguments next in City of Milwaukee v. Illinois and Michigan.
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,13.433,16.792,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1980.79-408,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,116.578,120.31,He said that might happen some day.
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,120.31,121.685,He said it might happen.
1980.79-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.051,204.967,"Do you think that Congress in the exercise of its legislative function could say that there shall be neither federal common law in this area, nor federal statutory law, but state law shall govern?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,204.967,219.571,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe that Congress would have that power constitutionally under the federal system that we have, because that would then lead the states to legislate one against the other in an area where there is a paramount federal interest."
1980.79-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.571,226.255,"But, even though Congress said, there is no paramount federal interest?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,226.255,247.121,"Well, whether Congress said so or not, I think this Court has held several times in this type of a controversy between states, either in apportionment of waters or utilization of waters or, I submit, the pollution of waters, this is a paramount federal interest where you have interstate waters."
1980.79-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,247.121,259.507,"Well, but in the cases involving the allocation of waters, it was more or less a question where this Court had to derive some system of law because of its jurisdiction, wasn't it?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,263.35,290.761,"That is correct, Your Honor, but I submit that whether it be state against state or state against citizen, or citizen against state or citizen against citizen, where we are crossing the boundaries and a state has a particular interest, two states have a particular interest in waters crossing the boundary, that the federal interest there is so paramount that Congress could not abdicate under the Constitution."
1980.79-408,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,290.761,304.583,"There you're reading Justice Douglas' statement which you quoted apparently as meaning that as soon as Congress legislated in the area, the general area, automatically that operated as a preemption?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,304.583,308.113,"No, Your Honor, I'm not reading it in that precise way."
1980.79-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.303,411.589,"Do you think that the preemption analysis which would be applied in deciding whether federal statutory law preempted federal common law is the same kind of analysis as the Court has applied in other situations not dealing with water, as to whether a congressional statute preempted a state statute?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,411.589,441.326,"It's the same kind of a preemption, I believe, but here we're dealing, because we're in the same sovereign and the legislature is dealing with something on a policy level, where the courts are dealing with it in the absence of legislation, I think that the legislation of Congress controls the activity and the conduct of the courts in a different way than a total displacement that you would have, congressional act as against state enactment."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.789,626.267,"So that if all of this had taken place in one state, say, in the State of Wisconsin, Wisconsin could have required higher standards either by statute or by the law of nuisance?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,626.267,627.033,Absolutely.
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.122,644.979,"But your argument's going to be, I take it, that resort may not be had to federal common law?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,644.979,646.869,"We don't have to reach that argument, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.82,654.818,"Well, no; no, I mean, in this case, particular case?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,654.818,663.581,In this case we don't have to reach it because of the fact that the discharges are being challenged by Illinois across the state lines and we're in an interstate body of water.
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,663.581,664.205,That's what I mean.
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,680.667,681.167,Yes.
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,691.257,700.769,So that there may not be a resort to a body of federal law that would have been available had the Act not been passed?
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,700.769,701.457,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.079,710.876,I understand that.
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,712.548,712.938,--Right.
1980.79-408,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,731.101,739.863,"You would not suggest, I take it, that Congress could preempt the original jurisdiction of this Court in an area of this kind, would you?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,739.863,741.894,"No, sir, I would not so suggest."
1980.79-408,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,795.608,798.544,Let me pursue the point I was just raising that you responded to.
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,823.378,828.018,I would not question the jurisdiction of this Court to take it.
1980.79-408,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,828.018,832.843,"Well, you might be arguing here on the original jurisdiction case, you mean?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,832.843,833.343,Yes.
1980.79-408,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,833.343,836.53,You might be challenging his findings?
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,836.53,841.137,"But I would challenge the results that came out, whether it be from the--"
1980.79-408,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,841.137,841.746,"The results, but not the power?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,841.746,843.637,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.637,864.909,"Well, you certainly would argue, if it were to your advantage, I take it, that the master appointed in an original jurisdiction case by this Court was obligated to follow an Act of Congress if that Act was applicable, wouldn't you?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,864.909,865.33,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,865.33,867.736,If it applied.
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,875.202,876.731,"That is correct, Your Honor--"
1980.79-408,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,876.731,879.044,"In other words, you'd be making the same argument as you're making here."
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,879.044,879.793,--That is correct.
1980.79-408,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,910.031,911.89,But doesn't it get down to a question of congressional intent?
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,920.807,922.12,"Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly--"
1980.79-408,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,922.12,931.537,"And if they can't say that the statute is to be read that way, then I gather that the common law standards are not displaced?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,931.537,932.069,--That is correct.
1980.79-408,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,961.9,975.896,"Well, it wouldn't have taken Congress very many words to achieve the result you're arguing for, to write into the statute a clear, unequivocal statement, would it?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,975.896,982.752,"It wouldn't have taken any particular expertise or difficulty to do so, but I believe they have done so."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.038,1011.474,"Well, suppose Congress in legislating as to every point source, however, had said,"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1018.988,1027.328,"If Congress had definitely left some pollutants open and some areas where it was not legislating, the courts would have the opportunity to go into that area."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.328,1043.305,"So, if in this case there are some discharges that are not forbidden by the statute or by regulations, may... certainly the state proscribed them, but how about federal common law?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1043.305,1048.413,Saying certain discharges are not covered?
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.639,1082.509,"Are you arguing that the EPA has not only decided that certain discharges are to be forbidden, but no others are to be forbidden?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1082.509,1084.476,"--In essence, yes."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1103.672,1111.357,"Well, is any federal regulation or statute or permit being violated when there is an overflow during a storm?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1111.357,1113.839,"Not in this particular instance, no, sir."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.839,1122.367,"Well, why may not a court insist that those overflows be stopped?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1122.367,1127.365,Because the regulatory agency under the statute has dealt with that particular--
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.365,1132.473,"Well, you're saying they've in a sense decided that no one else should stop the overflows either?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1132.473,1133.425,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1133.425,1144.344,Except that they have authorized these individual states within their own boundaries to adopt more stringent standards?
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1144.344,1144.858,"Oh, absolutely."
1980.79-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.662,1169.568,"Well, that isn't quite right, is it?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1171.958,1174.144,"A higher level; that's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1192.687,1199.966,So Congress has not entirely preempted the lawmaking function with respect to any particular point?
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1199.966,1211.133,"It has clearly not preempted state activity in these areas and has expressly said that the states do have the right to act in this area, and that is Section 510 of the Act."
1980.79-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1211.133,1216.022,Hasn't it also said common law remedies shall survive?
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1216.022,1218.317,"No, it doesn't say common law remedies shall survive."
1980.79-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.202,1239.372,"""Nothing in this section shall restrict any right which any person may have under any statute or common law. """
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1239.372,1241.95,Precisely.
1980.79-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1241.95,1249.634,"Now, if that statute had not been passed and if Illinois had a right under common law without the statute, doesn't this say that right survives?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1249.634,1277.247,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, because, again, at the time of the adoption of the statute 505(e), it said nothing will restrict the right which it had but it doesn't say that that right is going to remain, that is, that the common law is going to stay the law or that statutory law that's in existence at the time of the adoption of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is going to stay in existence."
1980.79-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.974,1303.518,"Because of the absence of ""adequate federal statutory law""."
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1303.518,1304.424,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1306.86,1312.327,"Illinois contends the federal law is still inadequate because it doesn't say, overflows."
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1312.327,1319.387,"--Illinois contends that any examination of the Act, the regulations under it, and the permits will indicate that Illinois is absolutely wrong."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.697,1405.961,Are there any findings to the contrary below?
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1405.961,1408.491,"There are no findings to the contrary, no."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.898,1451.755,"Well, this isn't an argument that these discharges are not being made into the Lake?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1451.755,1453.348,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.348,1456.769,It's just that you claim there's no proof that they were carried into Illinois?
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1456.769,1459.579,It is an argument that pathogens are not in the Lake.
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.579,1463.234,"Yes, but you don't deny that pathogens were discharged into the Lake?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1463.234,1464.328,"Yes, we do."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.573,1474.495,What is a pathogen?
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1474.495,1482.055,"A pathogen is something that could create a disease, either a bacteria or a virus that could create a disease in a human being."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.055,1488.881,"Well, is there evidence of sewage discharges into the Lake?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1488.881,1492.863,There is evidence of treated sewage discharges into the Lake--
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.863,1494.769,How about untreated sewage?
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1494.769,1495.455,"--Some overflows, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1495.455,1496.58,"Well, some overflow."
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1501.499,1503.734,All that is shown is that there is--
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1503.734,1505.123,"Well, is it evidence?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1505.123,1505.764,--It is.
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.764,1508.169,"Well, then, don't say there isn't evidence of it."
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1508.169,1513.402,"Well, what I said is we didn't find a single pathogen in the Lake, Your Honor, and that the reason for this is--"
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.402,1514.401,It seems to me you didn't hunt for them.
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1514.401,1515.276,--Precisely.
1980.79-408,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.885,1521.352,"Well, I know, but there's evidence that raw sewage was discharged into the Lake."
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1521.352,1524.336,We can get it to the rivers and to the Lake in Milwaukee.
1980.79-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1537.345,1545.733,Was there no expert testimony as to pathogens being discharged into the Lake before the district court?
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1545.733,1552.027,Pathogens being discharged into... being in sewage and sewage being discharged to the rivers and some to the Lake?
1980.79-408,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1564.07,1567.911,"How far is Milwaukee from the Illinois border, 50 miles?"
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1567.911,1569.16,Approximately 25.
1980.79-408,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1569.16,1569.739,25 miles.
1980.79-408,0,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,1569.739,1580.671,"And incidentally in that context, Milwaukee draws its own drinking water from intakes within a mile and a half to eight miles of the various discharges that we're talking about."
1980.79-408,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1583.529,1595.806,Mr. Karaganis.
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1595.806,1599.867,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.359,1658.281,What do you think the status of that case is now?
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1658.281,1662.264,"The status of that case, Your Honor, is still good law."
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.542,1676.197,"Well, we're going to get to your second remedy."
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1676.197,1679.664,"If I may, Your Honor, the case has not been overruled by this Court."
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.121,1709.621,So is your... what is your suggestion going to be?
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1713.697,1714.213,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1767.034,1768.191,In a case like this.
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1768.191,1773.128,"Except, Your Honor, that in Ohio, as Ohio v. Wyandotte points out--"
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.128,1776.158,"It saved, certainly saved state law within its own boundaries."
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1776.158,1798.539,"--Except, Your Honor, that since The Salton Sea cases there are a variety of cases where torts across state lines... the examples go back into the 19th century, where torts across state lines, where, if the injury occurs in the victimized state, that state has authority to apply its law and to exercise in personam jurisdiction."
1980.79-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.539,1801.507,But what if it's preempted by Congress?
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1801.507,1802.226,No question.
1980.79-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.114,1824.998,"Do you apply the same type of analysis, preemption analysis, to congressional preemption of federal common law as you do to congressional preemption of state law?"
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1824.998,1825.639,--Yes.
1980.79-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1832.948,1835.212,"Well, how about occupying the field?"
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1835.212,1842.039,"--Your Honor, when you talk about occupying the field, there is a misstatement with respect to the occupation of the field, not only as to the--"
1980.79-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.039,1863.781,"I don't mean as to the facts of this particular case, but I mean, if one were to conclude that Congress in the Water Act of 1977 had occupied the field, so to speak, except as to the specific exceptions, would that be a preemption?"
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1863.781,1868.027,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor, unless they explicitly stated so."
1980.79-408,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1930.972,1942.342,"I gather this argument is, no matter how explicit Congress may have been in the statute and said, no state law, no common law, nothing but this shall govern, you still say you'd be able to--"
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1942.342,1942.81,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1961.147,1970.019,"--In other words, the few words that I suggested to your friend, had they been uttered, might have taken state jurisdiction away?"
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1970.019,1978.749,In this and literally dozens of other regulatory areas where there is currently a concurrent regulatory body of state statutory and common law.
1980.79-408,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1978.749,1986.403,And you say that this exception preserves state jurisdiction even as to discharges into interstate waters?
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1986.403,1989.294,It preserves what existed in common law prior to the statute.
1980.79-408,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1989.294,1989.761,All right.
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,1998.165,2008.614,"Yes, Your Honor, and I might add, when I say state courts... and this is part of the constitutional scheme that Justice Harlan referred to in Ohio v. Wyandotte, we came here, just as Ohio did, as an original action."
1980.79-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.006,2060.471,Even though it's not... even though a state versus individual is not a mandatory part of our original jurisdiction?
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2060.471,2062.235,"--Law applied, Your Honor, yes."
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.867,2144.55,I was under the impression that when you were here before that the Court when it remanded said that the application of federal law in this case was required.
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2144.55,2148.127,"--Excuse me, Your Honor, and this is one of the points we go through in detailed analysis."
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2151.532,2153.36,I'm just asking you about one case.
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2153.36,2153.985,"--Well, okay."
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.985,2154.437,In one--
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2154.437,2156.797,"In that case, that case did not say."
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2168.169,2175.478,"--Well, the case expressly said that the application of federal law was required in this kind of case."
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2175.478,2176.041,"Well, Your Honor--"
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.041,2178.085,Didn't it or not?
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2178.085,2179.022,"--We don't believe it did, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.022,2181.287,"If I can find it, could I read it to you?"
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2181.881,2182.49,Yes.
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2182.49,2184.147,"--Well, Footnote 6 said,"
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2187.691,2198.563,"With all due respect to the Court, Footnote 6 is based on the Lincoln Mills decision, and we've gone back to the Lincoln Mills decision and what Lincoln Mills says is that, as Deitrick v. Greaney and D'Oench, Duhme, and a variety of other cases--"
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.563,2205.293,"Well, you may think it was based on Lincoln Mills, but the text of it came out of interstate waters."
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2205.293,2206.043,--Your Honor--
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.043,2211.573,That footnote was to text that was discussed if interstate waters cases.
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2211.573,2213.119,--With all due respect to the Court--
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.119,2215.524,"Not to the Court, to me."
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2215.524,2216.899,"--To you, Justice White."
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.984,2240.889,He said it was not only because of the nature of the parties in this case.
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2240.889,2246.402,--It was the nature of the federal interest as manifested by about ten statutes.
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.729,2257.664,But you're suggesting to us now that as a result of that case you were told to go back and make a state law claim?
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2257.664,2266.926,"As a result of that case we were told to go back and make a federal law claim, and as a result, Your Honor, of Ohio v. Wyandotte, we also inserted our state law claims."
1980.79-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.204,2277.923,In this kind of case.
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2277.923,2279.999,"--in this kind of case, which has existed for 200 years."
1980.79-408,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2312.658,2318.515,Isn't it possible that that exception should be read as limited to discharges within the four corners of the state itself?
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2322.591,2328.106,"As Mr. Justice Burger suggested, if Congress had wanted to do that, Congress could have said it did, because--"
1980.79-408,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2328.106,2333.947,"There is no question Congress in this whole displacement or preemption or whatever you call it, never gives us the help it ought to give us."
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2333.947,2343.926,"--Your Honor, and what I'm suggesting to you is, as this Court has suggested many times, if Congress wants the Court to treat state law as gone, all it need do is say so."
1980.79-408,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2345.41,2352.049,"No, but my question to you is, whether or not the exception may not be read as limited to discharges within the four corners of the state?"
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2352.049,2359.28,"--We don't believe so, Your Honor, because if it meant that it would have said so, and it meant preexisting common law, which included these kinds of state law remedies."
1980.79-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2426.785,2431.454,Do you think that had anything to do with his decision to resign from the bench?
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2431.454,2437.842,"Your Honor, Judge Fairchild is still there."
1980.79-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.139,2524.807,"Well, Wisconsin's stand in the '59 litigation was that Illinois was just draining Lake Michigan and dumping it all into the Chicago River."
1980.79-408,1,31321,joseph_v_karaganis,,2524.807,2526.573,And down into the Mississippi; exactly.
1980.79-408,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2807.868,2809.835,Very well.
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2811.007,2816.457,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-408,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2874.982,2886.665,"Well, we've held in many cases, have we not, that where Congress has occupied the field, even though it has not expressly said we intend to preempt state law, state law is nonetheless preempted?"
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2886.665,2887.508,State law?
1980.79-408,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3123.601,3137.439,Are you relying on a quote from a single member of the House of Representatives on the floor of the House in reference to another report as being a statement of the will of Congress?
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3137.439,3148.076,"Well, first of all, we have the sponsor in the Senate and Senator Hart in particular who focused on the federal common law nuisance claim and said that the Act would not affect it."
1980.79-408,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3251.27,3258.454,"And why not turn that argument around and say that Congress wanted to be sure to preserve federal common law, knew how to do it, But it didn't do it quite that explicitly in 505(e)?"
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3258.454,3264.389,"--Well, but, it referred to the common law, and may be they're just getting better at preserving it and making it absolutely clear."
1980.79-408,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3341.171,3347.763,"There's regulation against discharging raw sewage into the Lake, isn't there?"
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3347.763,3359.946,"--There is a regulation requiring that all discharges be covered by a permit, but there is no specific standard such as there is for, let's say, what they call biological oxygen demands."
1980.79-408,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3359.946,3361.04,What is there a standard about?
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3361.04,3369.988,"Biological oxygen demand, ph, and some other things which are quantifiable and they are regulated by EPA's regulations."
1980.79-408,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3399.149,3408.755,Is it your position that what the Court did with respect to the pollution standards here is inconsistent with your view of preemption?
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3408.755,3413.721,"Well, we have not taken any position on the remedy in this case."
1980.79-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.721,3414.831,Well I'm asking you to.
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3431.573,3443.662,"Well, we think that as the Court pointed out in Footnote 5 of the Illinois v. Milwaukee decision, that although the federal statute and regulations do not mark the outer bounds of federal common law, they are certainly guidelines."
1980.79-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3443.662,3447.082,"Well, the Court of Appeals did reverse that district court in some respects."
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3447.082,3447.442,That's right.
1980.79-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3452.94,3456.189,Do you think that is inconsistent with your position in--
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3456.189,3458.328,"--No, I don't Your Honor."
1980.79-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3458.328,3471.292,--And you think the Court of Appeals was simply saying that... I suppose they're saying that the proof of nuisance had simply failed.
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3471.292,3483.959,"Or that the remedy was inappropriate to curb that particular kind of nuisance, that equity in applying nuisance law--"
1980.79-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3483.959,3486.379,"Well, they discovered there wasn't any violation."
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3486.379,3493.628,"--Well, I think equity says that you should tailor the remedy to a particular kind of nuisance."
1980.79-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3493.628,3494.11,"No, there... there wasn't any nuisance."
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3494.11,3505.498,"Well, I think they found that there was a nuisance insofar as pathogens were being dumped into large amounts of... a large number of pathogens were being dumped into Lake Michigan and entering Illinois waters."
1980.79-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3505.498,3521.052,"Well, I know, but suppose there had been a lot of pathogens found in Illinois waters or where there was effluent being dumped into the lake, but that the only place that came from was from treated sewage."
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3525.895,3527.097,And the treated sewage was--
1980.79-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3527.097,3532.564,"--Was full of pathogens, but otherwise it absolutely complied with the permit."
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3532.564,3543.232,--I would say in that case that if there was a showing that there was a health risk to Illinois inhabitants that the federal common law of nuisance would allow the judge to impose--
1980.79-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3543.232,3543.748,"Well, that isn't what the Court of Appeals said."
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3543.748,3547.247,"--Well, I think that the Court--"
1980.79-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.247,3553.242,"The Court of Appeals said that the district court was wrong in imposing, higher standards on treated sewage."
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3553.242,3563.552,"--Well, because it didn't believe that the extra limitations that were imposed by the district court were necessary to protect the health of Illinois inhabitants, I take it."
1980.79-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3563.552,3567.536,"You mean, even though it was full of pathogens?"
1980.79-408,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3567.536,3573.846,"Well, but that those limits were sufficient to protect Illinois."
1980.79-408,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3576.235,3579.531,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Zarwell?"
1980.79-408,3,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,3579.531,3582.264,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-408,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3635.368,3642.194,It wasn't because they thought there was any preemption?
1980.79-408,3,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,3642.194,3646.333,"No, it was not a preemption basis."
1980.79-408,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3694.205,3696.158,"Well, it hasn't passed, has it?"
1980.79-408,3,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,3696.158,3697.61,It has not passed.
1980.79-408,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3760.869,3763.773,"Mr. Zarwell, can I stop you on that 511 point?"
1980.79-408,3,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,3763.773,3764.226,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-408,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3764.226,3770.097,My understanding is they are relying on another federal law in the sense of federal common law.
1980.79-408,3,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,3770.097,3775.518,Federal common law; but this... 511 is going to other federal statutes not being--
1980.79-408,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3775.518,3779.61,But your point is that 511 in terms relates only to other federal statutes?
1980.79-408,3,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,3779.61,3780.001,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-408,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3780.001,3780.704,I see.
1980.79-408,3,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,3780.704,3792.122,"Going back to the so-called concession of no preemption being present, the Court of Appeals does make that statement in its decision."
1980.79-408,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3839.508,3852.41,"Mr. Zarwell, your time has expired."
1980.79-408,3,23471,elwin_j_zarwell,,3852.41,3853.832,"Sorry, Your Honor, thank You."
1980.79-408,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3853.832,3855.877,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
