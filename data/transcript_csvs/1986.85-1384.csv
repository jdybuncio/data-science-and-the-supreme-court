1986.85-1384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.289,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 85-1384, William R. Turner v. Leonard Safley."
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,13.891,17.026,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,500.17,502.055,"You don't really mean that, do you?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,508.443,509.393,Yes.
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,509.393,510.811,How would you stop that?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,510.811,527.17,"We... as there is evidence at the trial, we stopped it by attempting to return the mail after we identified that this was a prison letter between the civilian and the insider."
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,527.17,528.356,You censor the letter?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,528.356,529.456,We would not censor the letter.
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,530.372,531.558,What was in it?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,531.558,536.526,"We were permitted by regulations to scan mail coming into our institutions, and we would scan the mail."
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,536.526,541.514,And there's a difference between scanning and looking at it?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,541.514,543.366,"No, no difference between scanning and looking at it."
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,555.589,558.208,Isn't the whole xxx?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,558.208,563.26,We would... we would scan it whenever we felt there was a problem.
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,581.841,587.293,"You only scan those you want to, those who are under your suspicion?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,587.293,590.061,"--The present case, under probable cause, yes."
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,590.061,590.947,That's right.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,592.98,594.532,By the regulation.
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,598.933,602.404,0 xxx.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,602.404,603.02,All right.
1986.85-1384,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,654.553,657.671,May I ask this question along the lines of your argument?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,664.559,665.594,--Yes.
1986.85-1384,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,665.594,672.681,Does it indicate the extent of that mail that was approved?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,672.681,674.533,"Okay, the chief--"
1986.85-1384,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,674.533,679.168,"Does it indicate whether there was a dozen letters approved in a week, or a dozen in a year?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,679.168,685.924,--His testimony... Mr. Engelbrecht's testimony was that 25 percent of requests were approved.
1986.85-1384,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,685.924,686.657,Were approved?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,686.657,689.859,Were approved.
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,724.513,730.834,"Mr. Herschel, does the record tell us what the volume of this inmate-to-inmate mail is?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,730.834,734.802,"We could only speculate on what it would be at that time, since we had never--"
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.802,742.19,"But it tell us what... what it has been at any point in time, attempts to mail?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,742.19,760.001,"--It only tells you that of the mail that was approved by the... by the individual team classification groups, that for example, at Renz, with a population of 350 inmates, that it took them about an hour to approve the mail that had been approved."
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,760.953,762.103,An hour everyday?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,763.471,764.205,--An hour everyday.
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.205,765.321,An hour everyday.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,769.709,770.109,No.
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,770.109,771.892,--whether they read it closely or scan it or what?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,771.892,773.827,"No, it doesn't tell you."
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,789.973,795.942,"One of the things that puzzles me about the case is, I can't get a feel for how much work is really involved here."
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,807.315,818.623,"--The difficulty with our position in the case is, since we had never permitted it, we didn't have an idea except to say that... you know, except that we had 8,000 inmates, and we figured that they would write."
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.642,823.86,"But they might not be writing to inmates in other institutions, regularly, at least."
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,826.062,827.062,--That's the only think we could speculate on at that time.
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.488,844.007,Does her testimony tell us how much there was in Kansas?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,844.007,850.411,No.
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.415,859.6,Let me just ask one other question.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,869.705,877.661,"--It's too much trouble not because we couldn't hire the people to do it, because that's... you can always hire more people."
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.667,924.459,"But you have precisely the same risk that Justice Marshall identified, don't you, in the mail... sending it to a civilian who in turn would pass the same message along to the inmate in the other institution?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,924.459,925.392,--You'd have a better chance--
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.392,927.661,"And the only way to catch that is to go through all mail, isn't it?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,927.661,940.402,"--Well, it's a little bit different in the sense that you can begin to identify, by the patterns of letters coming in, what letters are going in to the same inmate from the same civilian."
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,954.228,958.346,You think that's easier to handle than just looking at the direct inmate correspondence?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,958.346,965.119,"--Yes, we believe it be easier, because we believe it be less... basically, most civilians won't get involved in that kind of a thing."
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.848,996.221,"Doesn't most of your danger of some kind of illegal activity between an inmate... two inmates, one in one institution and one in another, planning some kind of escape or something, wouldn't they almost always have to use a third party to help them with their plans?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,996.221,999.857,Except it's so much easier using the third... it's so much easier--
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,999.857,1002.792,"And if there's a third party involved, they just write to the third party, who in turns writes to them."
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1004.844,1009.815,"--They're going to have to get a third person involved in the thing, in the scheme."
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.123,1027.858,"--Yes, but if you have a potential escape with a third person civilian, obviously, this is not an honorable civilian."
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1027.858,1028.326,--Correct.
1986.85-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1028.326,1029.092,By hypothesis.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1029.092,1030.06,Correct.
1986.85-1384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.0,1040.767,"You can make it harder, is what you're saying, isn't it?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1040.767,1042.286,"Right, we're making it as difficult as possible."
1986.85-1384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1042.286,1043.636,"You can't stop it entirely, but you can make it harder."
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1043.636,1043.935,Right.
1986.85-1384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.935,1047.003,"So they have to... and moreover, it isn't just escape you're worried about, is it?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1049.523,1050.006,Right.
1986.85-1384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1050.006,1052.992,Assassinations in one prison being directed from another.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1052.992,1053.76,And very importantly--
1986.85-1384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1053.76,1056.294,"And that doesn't require a civilian at all, does it?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1056.294,1057.562,--No.
1986.85-1384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1130.674,1134.812,Your mail rules aren't just intended to decrease the volume.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1137.93,1138.447,--Yes.
1986.85-1384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1138.447,1144.418,--but they also decrease what you might say the risk of the mail that has to be reviewed.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1159.511,1161.312,We hope with our--
1986.85-1384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.312,1163.831,"Well, that's the objective of the system, isn't it?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1163.831,1164.147,--Right.
1986.85-1384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.481,1166.147,So it isn't just a reduction in volume.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1172.501,1177.572,--And hopefully we have chosen the people who are going to be the least risk.
1986.85-1384,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1195.784,1207.158,"Mr. Herschel, is the same correspondence rule applied in all of Missouri's prisons?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1207.158,1208.276,"When you say, correspondence--"
1986.85-1384,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1208.276,1214.014,Is the same rule applied in all of Missouri's prisons as in the Renz institution?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1214.014,1218.899,"--At this time, the same... the best interest standard was applied."
1986.85-1384,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1233.59,1235.359,But the general regulation--
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1235.359,1236.142,--Was the same.
1986.85-1384,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.142,1236.961,--applied to all.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1238.844,1239.444,Right.
1986.85-1384,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1239.444,1241.413,--at the Renz institution; is that it?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1242.663,1243.514,More restrictively.
1986.85-1384,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1243.514,1249.534,Do you know what the Federal correspondence rule is for inmates-to-inmates?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1249.534,1260.474,"It's inmates-to-inmates, it's prohibited correspondence unless... and they meet three or four different criteria, and I've forgotten the exact criteria."
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1275.067,1279.788,"Mr. Herschel, could you get to the merit point for a minute?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1279.788,1280.354,Yes.
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1280.354,1282.006,There are two rules involved.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1283.673,1288.776,"Before you would be the December 1st, 1983 one, the one that was in effect at trial."
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1289.459,1290.345,Is that the second one?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1290.345,1291.328,--That was the second one.
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1296.682,1297.915,And that's the one that's before us?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1297.915,1309.223,"And I believe... and that is my... after... I don't believe the other one is before you, because the only issue there would have been damages, that he somehow exceeded his authority and he found no damages against us."
1986.85-1384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.711,1315.444,What is the content of that rule?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1324.55,1325.016,No.
1986.85-1384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.449,1326.932,--Oh.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1326.932,1327.968,--I wasn't clear on that.
1986.85-1384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1349.131,1351.381,"Well, not two civilians who wanted to get married?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1351.381,1352.266,"--Well, of course not."
1986.85-1384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.318,1360.439,Couldn't we take it as the Eighth Circuit construed it?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1360.439,1365.841,--I would say that... the issue before the Eighth Circuit was inmate-to-inmate marriages.
1986.85-1384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.365,1383.019,"Well, could I ask, have your rules been changed to conform to this judgment?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1383.019,1383.969,Yes.
1986.85-1384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.272,1390.708,There was no stay or anything?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1390.708,1396.612,There was an initial stay filed concerning when the initial order came down.
1986.85-1384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.682,1405.818,So the rules now in effect aren't the rules that were invalidated?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1405.818,1406.268,--Right.
1986.85-1384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1407.836,1409.07,"Well, why isn't the case moot?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1409.07,1409.72,--Okay.
1986.85-1384,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.074,1418.792,So you operated... you put them in under compulsion?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1418.792,1428.499,"--We put them in under compulsion, and on the basis of administrative... well, there were some tactical concerns for our administration of our prisons."
1986.85-1384,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1445.643,1448.645,What is the marriage rule now in effect?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1448.645,1456.501,"We basically, unless the... we can... we have a right to counsel inmates."
1986.85-1384,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1466.19,1474.778,"You have... you take the position that you can reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on any marriage ceremony."
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1474.778,1475.564,"Thirty days... right, on the ceremony."
1986.85-1384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1477.814,1481.116,"But now that's the rule that you put in under compulsion, isn't it?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1481.116,1481.884,Right.
1986.85-1384,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1493.174,1499.911,"But before you move to that, I'm looking at some of the findings of fact by the District Court."
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1501.578,1502.113,"No, they're not."
1986.85-1384,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1502.113,1508.767,And they were not found to be clearly erroneous by the Court of Appeals.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1532.382,1536.251,Okay.
1986.85-1384,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1536.251,1539.869,What do you say to that finding of fact?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1550.177,1552.213,"Well, the court found it."
1986.85-1384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1578.411,1583.815,Is he asking... I read that as requiring a case-by-case inquiry.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1583.815,1587.1,"And in fact, the testimony was, we did it."
1986.85-1384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1595.872,1603.995,But if as a matter of law you're not required to make a case-by-case determination to apply those... this finding of fact is meaningless.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1603.995,1606.863,--If we're not required to do that.
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1632.431,1637.382,"Mr. Herschel, how could a marriage hurt the State of Missouri?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1637.382,1639.451,Could hurt the State of Missouri?
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1639.451,1641.301,Yes.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1645.688,1657.077,"There is no harm in marriage unless it affects a fundamental interest, a legitimate penological interest--"
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1657.077,1657.779,Like what?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1657.779,1659.496,--like for example security.
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1660.114,1661.58,How would it affect security?
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1661.58,1661.964,--Okay.
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1687.265,1689.884,"Well, they won't live together."
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1689.884,1697.804,"--The competing... the competing affection... the whole point that most of these people meet, from, say Missouri State Penitentiary and at Renz, which are 30 miles distant."
1986.85-1384,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1733.913,1738.965,"Mr. Herschel, this is a collateral question: Do you permit conjugal visits?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1738.965,1741.366,No.
1986.85-1384,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1755.926,1757.192,I heard what you said.
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1759.528,1762.23,"All right, let me explain it this other way."
1986.85-1384,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1864.444,1868.896,"But if this were an all-male prison, you'd still be making the same argument here, would you not?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1868.896,1879.854,--We would be making the same... we probably wouldn't... it's hard to say... to decide whether or not Mr. Turner would have said the same thing about men.
1986.85-1384,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1885.358,1887.959,"But your rules apply across the board, don't they?"
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1887.959,1891.928,"--And I tried... I hope I didn't make that clear... it be... be the same, it's clear."
1986.85-1384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1914.944,1917.229,"Mr. Herschel, your time has expired."
1986.85-1384,0,27163,henry_thomas_herschel,,1917.229,1918.729,"--Okay, thank you very much."
1986.85-1384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1918.729,1923.55,"We'll hear now from you, Mr. Finch."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1923.55,1927.268,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.698,2000.05,What is that important?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2000.05,2008.822,"--Because, Justice Scalia, in this particular case we have one institution that was violating the department-wide rules."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2008.822,2010.738,"I mean, the rules are good or bad."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2017.844,2019.394,"Well, in fact, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.394,2023.082,I don't see what relevance it has that this... that they may have abused discretion in the past.
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2044.246,2045.312,"--Yes, sir, I think that is."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.312,2061.005,"Well, now, if that can be placed on a parolee, why is correspondence with other convicted criminals while he's in the prison so clearly a violation of a fundamental right?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2061.005,2068.944,"Well, Justice Scalia, I don't know, I'm not aware, of any Supreme Court case recognizing that as an appropriate decision that will stand up."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2077.467,2090.726,"So you would agree, then, that agreeing with you on this would cast doubt on the validity of restrictions upon parolees being in contact with convicted felons?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2090.726,2092.576,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2105.486,2108.854,"That's not the basis on which the Court of Appeals gave you relief, is it?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2112.972,2113.989,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.989,2121.928,So what's the fact that he may have violated his own internal regulations got to do with the issues that are before us?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2121.928,2132.033,The State is arguing that the entire findings of fact of the District Court should be thrown out because the prison administrator should have discretion.
1986.85-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.607,2180.097,"Well, so you say this case comes up in a totally different posture than identical regulations from, say, Kansas, because there you might have had an administrator who didn't violate his own regulations?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2180.097,2180.497,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.497,2184.115,The Eight Circuit certainly didn't treat it that way.
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2184.115,2188.584,"Well, it was argued that... those points were argued to them as well, sir."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.709,2203.077,You mean there's no such thing as good or bad regulations in and of themselves.
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2203.677,2206.445,"No, sir, I'm not... I'm sorry, sir, I'm not arguing that at all."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.92,2220.638,"--Well, but what if the State agrees to replace the administrator?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2223.507,2224.776,"No, we don't."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.894,2233.798,Did... was the lower court's determination limited to this rule as applied by this administrator?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2233.798,2234.632,"--No, sir, it was not."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2234.632,2240.35,"Did it say that the State could adopt the rules as long as it put in a new administrator, or when it got a new administrator?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2240.35,2241.419,"No, sir, it was not."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2241.419,2245.738,"Then, evidently, it didn't rule what you said it ruled."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2248.606,2251.492,"Well, the Court of Appeals focussed on the rule itself."
1986.85-1384,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2260.43,2264.015,But do you need that to win?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2264.015,2265.084,"No, sir."
1986.85-1384,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2265.084,2268.019,Then why are you arguing it?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2268.019,2270.555,"In response to questions, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-1384,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2270.555,2272.538,"No, I think you started this."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2272.538,2275.273,"Well, I made a mistake then."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2358.76,2362.979,"Mr. Finch, I still don't understand how this argument goes to whether the rule is valid."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2392.6,2400.67,"Yes sir, I am, because you give too much... you give too much vagueness when you put in a standard of best interests."
1986.85-1384,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.218,2430.789,So there are some applications of the rule that would surely be valid.
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2430.789,2433.122,--Your Honor--
1986.85-1384,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.122,2445.263,"I mean, vagueness, for it to be invalid for vagueness would require that there are no applications that you could understand."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2445.263,2457.004,"--Well, Justice White, if there is a circumstance where you could stop... validly stop two inmates from writing because of their best interest, there's no evidence of it in the record below."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2465.093,2467.145,"Well, it doesn't just relate to the letter."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2497.312,2500.949,"Justice Scalia, I'm afraid there's no evidence of that in the record of this case."
1986.85-1384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2568.059,2569.942,Let me just be sure I understand one thing.
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2569.942,2570.276,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.276,2580.283,"You, then, do not contend that the Constitution restricts the warden to... the only permissible way to do it would be item-by-item censoring of the mail."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2595.876,2596.293,Your Honor--
1986.85-1384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.293,2604.899,"If they have some reasonable basis for identifying a person as a particularly dangerous inmate, they can say, nobody can correspond with him if he's in a different institution?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2604.899,2621.276,"--Yes, Justice Stevens, to put it in the terms of the Court, of the strict scrutiny test, I think the State would have a compelling State interest, and there may be no least restrictive alternative way of stopping the correspondence which may be harmful between the prison... the gang member at MSP and the gang member at Moberly."
1986.85-1384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2621.276,2630.382,And would you agree that the prison... the warden would have a fairly broad discretion in deciding who belongs in the 7 percent class as opposed to the 93 percent class?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2630.382,2631.599,"Well, I think you're going--"
1986.85-1384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2631.599,2633.434,"You have to have some kind of reason, I suppose."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2633.434,2634.901,--There has to be some kind of reason.
1986.85-1384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.78,2653.848,But do you think you have to wait until you find something in the mail?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2669.941,2672.376,"--I think they could, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2720.69,2732.415,"Well, of course, you're then insisting on a case-by-case and almost letter-by-letter analysis, which the Department says we just don't have the personnel to do."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2745.99,2754.911,"Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, but the opinion in Jones also recognized that inmates do retain those certain fundamental rights."
1986.85-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2771.79,2780.563,"Well, are you saying that it is a fundamental right established by our cases that prisoners have to correspond with other prisoners?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2780.563,2782.848,"--No, sir, I don't think that this Court has ever reached that."
1986.85-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2782.848,2783.948,I don't think it has either.
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2790.102,2798.607,"Because, Justice White, I believe that the fundamental right should be recognized in this case, that prison authorities--"
1986.85-1384,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2798.607,2805.111,So you are arguing that there is a fundamental right of prisoners to correspond with one another?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2805.111,2812.7,"--Yes, that's what I think the Court should adopt in this case, that there are certain core rights, such as the right of a written word--"
1986.85-1384,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.7,2815.236,"Well, is Martinez the closest case for you or not?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2815.236,2817.519,"--Yes, sir, it is; Martinez is clearly the closest."
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2817.519,2829.829,"Why isn't Jones a more appropriate standard in this case for inmate-to-inmate correspondence, just as it was for inmate-to-inmate meetings?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2829.829,2831.962,"Well, there are... there is some--"
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2831.962,2838.249,"Martinez had to do with the rights of noninmates, really."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2845.505,2847.29,"--That is the State's argument, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2951.941,2953.025,"Well, what if the State let--"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2960.713,2962.332,"That's right, Chief Justice... Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2962.332,2968.736,"I would think perhaps if they lose here, then would be the opportunity to go back to the District Court."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2975.823,2979.275,"And in fact, perhaps they may do it at that point, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1384,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2988.131,2989.981,"Counselor, have they had any marriages?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2989.981,2990.681,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1384,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2991.499,2992.049,How many?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2992.049,2993.816,I don't know.
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3002.891,3030.724,"Mr. Finch, what if this were not just a prison rule, but what if it was a statute enacted by the legislature that said, we're adding to all the punishments that we now have on the books in addition to twenty years or whatnot, anyone who's convicted of a crime will not be able to correspond with other inmates of penal institutions?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3038.747,3044.801,"--Well, certainly there's a difference, in that you've got a legislative enactment and not simply a particular prison administrator at one point."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3057.541,3075.051,"You can take a man out of his home, out of his family, prevent him from contact visits with his family, even, all of the other fundamental liberties can be taken away as a punishment for crime, but the ability to correspond with other felons who are in prison is so fundamental that that can't be imposed?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3075.051,3075.836,"--Yes, sir, I would say--"
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3075.836,3076.986,It seems very strange.
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3076.986,3090.345,"--there are certain things, such as communication, the ability to keep open lines, the ability to practice one's central religious beliefs, is something that could not be taken away by State statute."
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3135.974,3150.384,"Well, the Court has accepted, of course, the fact that a convicted felon can be deprived of his liberty, and his opportunity to live with his family."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3162.875,3163.811,--I guess I'll have to answer yes.
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3163.811,3166.763,"Which is a remarkable proposition, I think."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3166.763,3177.968,"Well, the prison system of this country recognizes the importance of this communication for rehabilitation of an inmate."
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3188.476,3201.084,"But the rule itself says that a prison... a prisoner may be granted leave for inmate-to-inmate correspondence if it's determined to be in his best interests, or hers."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3201.084,3202.436,"--Yes, that's right."
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3202.436,3207.721,And we're talking about the validity of the rule facially.
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3212.792,3214.243,Because it is unduly vague.
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3214.243,3215.093,Under your theory.
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3215.093,3229.417,"Ma'am, under my... excuse me, Justice O'Connor, under my theory, it's wrong because it gives too much discretion to prison authorities to deny a letter solely because they don't like the content."
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3249.48,3254.234,So the facial challenge boils down to a vagueness argument?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3254.234,3256.503,"Yes, sir... excuse me, yes, ma'am."
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3314.357,3320.093,Which version of the rule do we have before us on the no marriage?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3320.093,3321.612,"Well, the current rule--"
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3321.612,3326.564,"What is before this Court, do you suppose?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3326.564,3327.03,--The last--
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3327.03,3332.218,"There are three different versions, and I'm not quite clear which one we're addressing."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3332.218,3344.109,"--Justice O'Connor, the last rule before the court... before the trial was a rule that said, an inmate can only be married if he comes up with a compelling reason that the marriage should be allowed."
1986.85-1384,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3344.109,3346.394,Is that the one we have to deal with?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3346.394,3348.68,"Yes, ma'am."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3376.08,3379.115,"Now, your problem with this one is not that it's vague, or is it?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3383.167,3384.186,"Well, Justice Scalia, it is vague--"
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3384.186,3391.94,"Compelling reason is less vague, certainly, than the conditions for allowing prison mail, which were unspecified."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3391.94,3392.357,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3423.928,3434.184,"Well, you might ask the nine of us what constitutes a least onerous alternative, and we might all come up with different answers to that."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3438.92,3440.439,"Yes, sir, it is."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3535.151,3540.203,"Mr. Finch, is it clear... you know, we've said that the right to get married is a fundamental right."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3584.881,3592.451,"Well, Justice Scalia, if you asked the inmates here why they want to get married, they give, in my opinion, a compelling response."
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3599.641,3600.191,But they don't.
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3603.426,3606.295,"Well, for one thing, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3606.295,3611.632,"I mean, couldn't they make that commitment just as well by sending them a fraternity ring?"
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3613.932,3622.054,--I don't think that the religious attributes of a marriage ceremony can be fairly equated with a fraternity ring.
1986.85-1384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3717.516,3721.42,xxx the prison stop them from getting engaged?
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3721.42,3725.038,"To the best of my knowledge, there was not something like that."
1986.85-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3821.118,3823.751,"Your time has expired, Mr. Finch."
1986.85-1384,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,3823.751,3825.068,"--Thank you, sir."
1986.85-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3825.068,3826.484,The case is submitted.
