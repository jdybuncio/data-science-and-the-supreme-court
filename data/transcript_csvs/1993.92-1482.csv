1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.218,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-1482, Eric Weiss v. the United States."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,9.227,11.45,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1482,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,23.835,29.91,"Mr. Morrison, how does it happen to come up so late, rather than back in 1970, for instance?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,29.91,45.401,"--Your Honor, I think that the answer is that this Court's decision in Freytag in 1991 caused a recognition that the Appointments Clause had ramifications beyond what people had considered it before."
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,73.801,80.864,"Well, are you distinguishing between commissions as military officers and commissions as Article III judicial officers?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,80.864,81.465,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.179,104.661,"Well, so, then why do you use the term judicial... a commission as a judicial officer?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,105.773,106.404,No.
1993.92-1482,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,126.797,138.355,"But I had thought, Mr. Morrison, that when a JAG officer in the Army and the Navy, as opposed to the Marine Corps, is confirmed and appointed, he is appointed as a legal officer."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,138.355,139.675,That is correct.
1993.92-1482,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,164.792,170.035,"If your theory were to prevail, would those legal officers be assignable to nonlegal duties?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,170.035,173.327,"I believe they now are in any event, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,173.327,178.423,"Well, but under your theory you have to be appointed to a specific office."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,188.517,217.606,"The principal reason, Your Honor, and this is the heart of our argument, is that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice only certain people, those who are appointed as judges, can perform the major functions that judges perform in the military: presiding over general and, in most cases, special court-martials; deciding on whether evidence will be admitted; ruling on challenges for cause; instructing the jury; ruling on matters of... other matters that come before such as preliminary motions."
1993.92-1482,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,229.266,236.151,"Well, I suppose only a military legal officer can advise with reference to a will or a divorce?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,236.151,237.553,"I don't know that, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,237.553,243.398,"So under your theory, it seems to me, that a legal officer must be confined just to legal duties."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,244.259,249.692,"Your Honor, I don't believe there's any statute governing the military that restricts what legal officers can do."
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,272.706,279.12,"Mr. Morrison, with respect to trial judges, however, would you go back and just help me out on a matter of fact?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,288.416,288.956,No.
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,293.39,294.319,I see.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,294.319,295.641,In special and general court-martials.
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,308.18,316.296,"Now, is it correct that with respect to the two higher grades of court-martial, a judge may not sit alone without the consent of the accused?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,317.015,317.887,--That is correct.
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,317.887,318.538,So that unless the--
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,318.538,319.199,But not the consent of the Government.
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,319.199,319.776,--I'm sorry?
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,319.776,320.527,But not the consent of the Government.
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,321.158,325.16,"But unless, though... unless the accused consents of the finding of guilt or innocence."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,335.388,337.949,Except the last... I agree with it except the last part.
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,369.574,382.08,"So the members of the court, other than the law officer, who decide guilt or innocence would not, under your theory, have to be appointed specially under the Appointments Clause."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,382.08,382.691,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.156,425.49,"Mr. Morrison, am I correct that your germaneness argument is not based on the notion that there is some inherent requirement that you cannot give a single person duties that are so... that are too diverse, but is rather based upon the notion that Congress has not chosen to give this person these sorts of duties?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,440.363,442.803,"I would say that's... that is substantially correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.803,444.042,All right.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,444.833,446.085,With two caveats... may I?
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.683,456.644,--That's correct.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,456.644,457.936,So it's a little stronger than Your Honor hypothesized.
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.936,476.516,"But Congress has also, has it not, made clear since 1968 that any person who is commissioned as an officer in the military forces runs a risk of becoming a judicial officer, may be designated a judicial officer."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,489.596,490.177,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.177,490.808,Why--
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,490.808,501.744,"Under Article 26, only persons who are members of the bar can become a judicial officer, and they must also be certified by the Judge Advocate General of their service in order to become a judicial officer."
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,501.744,502.425,--But that's fine.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,512.131,512.58,Yes.
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,512.58,522.197,"But the fact is that Congress anticipated that the military commission would be enough to authorize that person to be a judicial officer, once the '68 act was in effect."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,540.713,541.622,I do not know.
1993.92-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,580.138,591.387,"Mr. Morrison, you say the only way this could be fixed is to have a fresh appointment in addition to the appointment that the officer already holds."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,618.345,620.226,"As a judicial officer, Your Honor?"
1993.92-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.226,621.307,As a judicial officer.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,621.307,628.38,"Yes, I would say... it's almost in response to Justice Blackmun's remark earlier about why this didn't happen right after 1968."
1993.92-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,645.234,649.347,"But apart from going back to the way it was, evidently Congress thought this was an improvement."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,649.347,650.149,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.229,659.034,"So the only way that Congress could make it better is to have this double appointment, is that it?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,659.034,659.845,--Yes.
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.964,672.775,"Mr. Morrison, I thought you gave me the opposite answer."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,683.692,684.403,"Yes, I think--"
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.403,697.562,"--At least one other solution is for Congress to say, whenever a military officer is commissioned, that officer will be competent to become a judge under... under this 96... 1968 law."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,700.954,703.367,--So long as he has the other legal qualifications.
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.367,704.056,That's right.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,704.056,704.637,And is a member of the bar.
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.637,705.228,Right.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,706.399,708.21,"I think... I think that would be correct, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.21,708.721,--Okay.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,726.933,735.158,"I don't think that that is the scheme that Congress has envisioned, and I perhaps answered your question too hastily."
1993.92-1482,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,750.348,751.858,But they can do that.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,753.861,755.601,"No, Your Honor, they're not certified by the Judge Advocate General."
1993.92-1482,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,755.601,756.642,--Not the latter.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,756.642,757.721,That's a special procedure.
1993.92-1482,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,757.721,758.322,Not the latter.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,758.322,759.274,"And, Your Honor, it's very important."
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.296,778.516,I don't understand your point.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,789.702,791.765,I think I agree with Your Honor's question.
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.765,793.315,Congress can't do that?
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,793.315,797.348,"The breadth of it takes... makes me taken aback a little, but I think that that is correct."
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.348,798.808,Congress... what is correct?
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,810.356,812.299,"I think it could if it did so clearly, yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.299,818.693,"Well, so the only question is whether the 1968 legislation doesn't do that... doesn't do that clearly enough."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,818.693,820.115,But I don't think that that's the scheme... I don't think that's the scheme that Congress set up.
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.097,839.556,Maybe so.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,851.685,852.386,Well--
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.386,854.479,You can expect people to dig ditches and be physicians.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,854.479,863.184,"--There is a further difficulty with that theory, Your Honor, and there is nothing to support the theory that that's what Congress was doing, and the Government has not contended otherwise."
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,877.074,880.396,"Well, doesn't that simply go to the constitutionality of those particular appointments?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,880.396,882.777,"--No, Your Honor, and let me say why I don't believe that's the case."
1993.92-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.777,884.309,You don't think that would be severable?
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,884.309,900.108,"It would be... it might be severable, but I think it goes... it goes to the question about whether... as Justice Scalia has suggested, that what Congress did in 1968 was to say that everyone who is a military officer can be a judge, and we equate the two."
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,908.616,911.778,"Well, that's... that's right, it does not explain that and he was not purporting to explain that."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,920.864,928.487,"No, but I suggest rather like the 13th stroke of the clock, it undermines the theory that this is simply what Congress did in 1968."
1993.92-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,928.487,948.851,"But isn't... wouldn't you... isn't it our obligation to construe this law in the way that would save its constitutionality so that if there is a discrete problem, that that would be put aside and not have that tail of some of these officers possibly being civilians wag the whole dog."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,948.851,951.323,"I don't disagree with that, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.884,987.978,"And you interpret that... you attribute that interpretation to Congress, although it needn't... it need not."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,995.652,996.404,"Well, one--"
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,996.404,1000.227,And you want us to take your interpretation in order to declare the statute unconstitutional?
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1001.298,1001.715,--Because I think it's the--
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.715,1002.456,--We normally do the opposite.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1003.167,1004.737,--It's the most obvious interpretation.
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1035.169,1039.002,--But it's equally clear that Congress did not want a second appointment.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1039.002,1041.095,"No, Your Honor, it's not clear that Congress didn't."
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.762,1042.664,Or they would have provided for it.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1042.664,1045.096,"--Well, only... there's no evidence that they--"
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.096,1056.042,To say that this is just what Congress wanted but they just didn't get around to providing for a separate appointment really doesn't do justice to any theory of enforcing legislation that I know of.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1056.042,1067.552,"--Well, Your Honor, in fairness to the Congress and in recognition of what has happened, the Appointments Clause was largely, not entirely, dormant until this Court's decision in Buckley in 1976."
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1075.016,1078.349,"Well, other... other than that they certainly didn't provide for an appointment by the President."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1078.349,1079.04,Right.
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1084.662,1085.103,"Well, how do you know that?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1086.405,1091.518,"--Well, I've been through the legislative history, Your Honor, and I've never... I've seen no mention of any consideration of the Appointments Clause."
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1095.852,1096.543,I would think not.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1096.83,1098.322,Yes.
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.322,1100.643,"Well, you say they never considered the constitutional ramifications."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1134.055,1136.007,"It's my understanding that they were not, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1136.007,1137.128,Were not.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1137.128,1143.712,"And in any event, I would have to say that all of them had been promoted, which required a separate confirmation, since that time."
1993.92-1482,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1144.613,1145.555,Mr. Morrison--
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1152.277,1152.938,--They do not.
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1185.502,1195.366,"You're assuming, I take it, throughout, Mr. Morrison, that both the... both the judges, as well as the commissioned officers as such, are all inferior officers."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1201.282,1202.222,"No, Your Honor, I do not acknowledge that."
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1203.323,1219.813,"Well, if you don't acknowledge that, do you... is your answer different to that... your germaneness argument, depending on whether we're talking about assigning duties assumed to be germane of a superior office to an inferior officer?"
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1219.813,1231.371,"--Well, since all of the judges here were appointed by the President with the advice and consent... that is, inferior officers can be appointed that way also."
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1231.371,1232.051,"Well, I realize that."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1254.077,1254.708,No.
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1282.726,1284.626,Was this argument pressed below?
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1284.626,1287.188,It wasn't relevant.
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1294.474,1295.345,What difference--
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1296.675,1300.639,"I don't believe so, Your Honor I'm not... I'm not sure."
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1304.061,1312.205,"If we are in doubt on the point of classification, do we owe deference to Congress in the implicit classification that Congress seems to have made."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1312.205,1319.701,"Well, I think that in Morrison against Olson that argument was made, and the Court did not accept it."
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1332.02,1335.032,Does the military context have any bearing on the answer to that question?
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1335.032,1341.067,"--I do not believe so, Your Honor, except insofar as the Congress has an important role in defining the military and establishing offices."
1993.92-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1341.928,1342.799,"Of course, you... excuse me."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1348.012,1349.464,"--No, I don't say it has no bearing at all, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1387.508,1389.05,This is your due process argument.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1389.05,1389.819,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1393.442,1396.904,May I ask you just one further question on the first appointments part?
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1396.904,1397.565,"Sure, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1397.565,1410.072,"You are not urging, as far as I can tell, any separation of powers concern of the type of the legislature encroaching on executive turf."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1424.253,1425.303,I don't view it as a technical violation.
1993.92-1482,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.981,1454.672,"But the loser is the President, I guess."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1454.672,1456.144,Not necessarily.
1993.92-1482,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1458.775,1461.887,"Either the Secretary of Defense or the President is the victim of this scheme, in effect."
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1461.887,1465.451,"--Yes, but we've never... that's never been a question before."
1993.92-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1475.134,1482.18,But one thing that could be done is to have less protection by going back to the old system where we didn't have judicial officers.
1993.92-1482,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1482.18,1485.312,"That is less protection for Appointments Clause purposes, yes, yes."
1993.92-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1488.046,1489.767,"Very well, Mr. Morrison."
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1491.229,1500.733,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1482,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1546.194,1552.218,"Well, General Days, what about these civilian judges that can be appointed?"
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1557.173,1559.913,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-1482,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1566.118,1566.706,Well--
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1566.706,1568.248,Because of resource limitations.
1993.92-1482,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1568.248,1576.083,"--That's fine, but I'm asking whether you can defend it or whether you concede that it fails to meet the Appointments Clause requirements?"
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1576.083,1587.52,"Your Honor, that issue was raised in the Carpenter case, as to whether there could be an appointment of a civilian without going through the requirements imposed by the Appointments Clause."
1993.92-1482,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1587.52,1588.091,Yes.
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1588.792,1596.797,"And the answer is that those judges have to be appointed by a head of department; in that case, the head of the Transportation Department, the Secretary of Transportation."
1993.92-1482,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1596.797,1597.708,Is the provision severable?
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1597.708,1599.2,"I believe it is, yes."
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.391,1604.052,Excuse me.
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1604.593,1605.472,--Yes.
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1605.472,1613.359,"--You're not asserting that the executive branch could, on its own, simply have the head of the department appoint them?"
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1632.761,1633.342,That's correct.
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1633.342,1633.913,You think?
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1633.913,1634.443,The latter.
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1634.443,1635.072,The latter.
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1641.896,1642.657,I do not.
1993.92-1482,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1651.153,1661.579,"So that your... once again, your germaneness argument does not assume that there could be assignment of an inferior office to perform the duties of a superior office?"
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1661.579,1666.163,"No, Justice Souter, I don't believe that that's appropriate."
1993.92-1482,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1667.343,1669.914,"That would... under your view, would that be unconstitutional?"
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1669.914,1672.648,"--That would create Appointments Clause problems, yes."
1993.92-1482,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.132,1749.183,"Well, who could be a convening authority besides an officer?"
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1749.183,1752.125,"An officer, certainly, would have to be a convening officer."
1993.92-1482,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1752.125,1752.896,"Oh, you said it didn't require the person to be an officer."
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1753.915,1756.148,"That's right, be a lawyer, for example."
1993.92-1482,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1761.693,1768.956,"You... General Days, you were going to explain the role of the convening authority who need not be a lawyer, and perhaps you can enlarge on that."
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1768.956,1769.627,That's right.
1993.92-1482,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1783.646,1786.428,A function kind of like a grand jury.
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1787.41,1794.034,"In effect, although there is a procedure, an Article 32 procedure that's more akin to the grand jury."
1993.92-1482,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1808.433,1814.908,"--Well, it's basically a decision whether you have a court-martial or company punishment or captain's mast, which doesn't require the--"
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1814.908,1816.46,"--That's right, in Article 15."
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.922,1881.886,"--Well, one could say... one could say that that's closer to being a juror that being a judge, and one of the footnotes in Mr. Morrison's brief does bring up Justice Jackson's wonderful quotation regarding the word ""quasi"" and you do have to use that throughout your brief, that these are quasi-judicial functions."
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1892.094,1900.468,"That's correct, but I think that the petitioners make the point that there is tremendous authority reposed in a military judge."
1993.92-1482,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1923.045,1923.536,No.
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1928.548,1932.211,"--I understand that, Justice Kennedy, and I certainly agree with that."
1993.92-1482,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2001.948,2006.439,Are there special statutory qualifications for any of those positions you've just mentioned?
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2006.439,2007.34,They are not.
1993.92-1482,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2008.17,2011.161,Isn't that different than this case where there is a special statutory qualification?
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2015.245,2032.515,"--Your Honor, I think that if Congress... if one follows the petitioner's argument, if Congress decided that it was going to set up special qualifications for pilots on nuclear bombers, presumably that would require a new appointment, given the petitioner's theory."
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.71,2049.716,"I certainly think it's easy to say that after 1968, because it was clear on the face of the United States Code that if you were a military officer you might have to do that."
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2054.429,2055.552,That's correct.
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.552,2065.858,"I was... I was exploring with Mr. Morrison the possibility of deciding this case on that... on that narrower ground, but I guess that poses a problem."
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2082.507,2083.279,That may well be the case.
1993.92-1482,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2118.292,2137.726,"--If there is an infirmity with respect to a pre-1968 appointment, for one thing if it wasn't raised and the case is closed, that's... for another it would be a problem, if not moot, on its way to becoming moot, given the distance we've come since 1968."
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2137.726,2140.406,"Indeed, that is... that is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1482,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2142.808,2160.75,"Well, can you say with any confidence that a conviction rendered by a defective court-martial, if it were determined that the court-martial were defective under the Appointments Clause, would not be subject to attack on habeas corpus, even though it had been... you know, concluded on direct appeal many years ago?"
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2160.75,2191.971,"--Your Honor, I think that we would have to look to the de facto officer doctrine and operate on the assumption that those decisions were rendered... those judgments were rendered in the context of a legitimate process, and therefore public policy would justify making those de jure offices occupied by, arguably, de facto officers, final."
1993.92-1482,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2254.644,2258.615,"In other words, we don't have to resolve Medina or Mathews, we just go to Middendorf."
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2258.615,2263.889,"Your Honor, we certainly would find that appropriate."
1993.92-1482,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2318.346,2329.924,"Well, of course, you would acknowledge, I'm sure, that there are concerns when the judge is subject to disciplinary action by superiors, if the judge isn't tough enough or something like that."
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2340.66,2349.156,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, they certainly are serious, and I think they have been taken seriously by the Congress and by the military."
1993.92-1482,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2397.198,2406.425,Would it be unrealistic to say that in a substantial number of cases there is a likelihood that there will be a desire to please the higher command?
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2406.425,2411.297,"No, Your Honor, Justice Kennedy, I don't believe that is appropriate."
1993.92-1482,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2425.198,2431.181,But isn't... isn't that simply a recognition that there... that there is a significant risk of this kind of influence?
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2431.181,2440.017,"--There... I'm not certain about the qualification, but certainly there is some risk, and there have been concerns expressed in Congress and the military about this."
1993.92-1482,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2490.19,2504.281,"General, even if you take it outside the military context, I think what you're describing is a closer approach to insulation than would be true, for example, between the decisions of elected State court judges and the electorate."
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2504.281,2518.88,"--I think that's right, Justice Souter, and it's important to... also, to recognize that when we talk about tenure provided to civilian judges, we're talking about protecting them from the pressures of the political process."
1993.92-1482,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2568.054,2582.312,"There is a certain irony, isn't there, in that after all Congress and the military have done to make the system of military justice more fair and more equitable, say, since the time of the Second World War, this is really the first time it's been challenged?"
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2588.127,2589.629,That's correct.
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2655.986,2659.549,"But you don't really want to rest your case on that, do you?"
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2659.549,2661.209,"--No, I do not want to."
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2661.209,2669.606,"That, in all respect, the military system is... I mean, for example we don't have a right to a jury trial of citizens at large in the military, do we?"
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2669.606,2670.035,"That's correct, or--"
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.035,2675.451,And that's certainly a less significant procedural protection.
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2677.862,2678.92,--It has--
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.92,2681.624,And therefore it conforms with due process because it's always been like that.
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2681.624,2683.424,--That's correct.
1993.92-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2683.424,2685.845,And I suppose you have... you have less rights of privacy.
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2698.665,2699.855,"That's right, Your Honor."
1993.92-1482,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2718.227,2720.808,You also... you made the analogy to the elected judge.
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2729.734,2732.035,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1482,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2748.388,2756.613,"And I know how we tend to look at it from this angle, but I'm not so sure that for a military officer the highest and best calling is that of a judge."
1993.92-1482,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2757.204,2768.76,"--Well, Your Honor, I'm not going to respond directly to that except to say that military officers and JAG officers are interested in having a well-rounded career."
1993.92-1482,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2930.27,2931.722,"Thank you, General Days."
1993.92-1482,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2934.676,2944.441,The Government's basic submission on the Appointments Clause issue is that military judges are no different from military officers.
1993.92-1482,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2984.999,2989.083,"Because it's basically a prospectivity doctrine, and not a doctrine that goes to the merits."

1993.92-1482,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2989.894,2992.044,Because it's basically a prospectivity doctrine.

1993.92-1482,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2992.695,2993.406,Is there... yeah.
