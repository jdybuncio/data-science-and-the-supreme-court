1987.87-5367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,24.448,"Very well, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,24.448,26.733,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.666,158.785,"Before you go on, I guess I have two different versions of the jury form here."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,158.785,162.772,"--I apologize to you, Justice Scalia, there are two different versions."
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.772,164.188,Which is the true version?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,164.188,170.942,The one that was used in this case is quoted in this case is quoted in the brief and is contained in the joint appendix.
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,198.759,199.694,Where is that?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,199.694,202.729,That is in the joint appendix--
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.729,205.014,Page 99.
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,205.014,205.78,"--I believe that is correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-5367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,214.453,215.686,Where is the one that was used in this case?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,215.686,220.707,"--In this case it is in the joint appendix at, I believe--"
1987.87-5367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,220.707,221.924,Fourteen?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,221.924,224.809,"--No, 99 of the joint appendix."
1987.87-5367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,224.809,227.611,And also 14 of the brief?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,227.611,229.296,And 14 is the quote.
1987.87-5367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,229.296,230.33,My gosh?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,230.33,231.915,It is somewhat confusing.
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,274.873,276.508,And the second one was not used in this case?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,276.508,277.608,--The second one was not used in the case.
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.329,282.596,"It was fun, trying to you know--"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,282.596,283.062,I apologize.
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.062,286.548,"""Will the real form please stand up? """
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,286.983,295.922,"Actually, Justice Scalia, when I was looking over this case yesterday, I came to the conclusion that whatever reason we thought for putting that second form in there was probably not good; it is somewhat confusing, and I apologize for that."
1987.87-5367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,295.922,297.422,"Where was ""cryptic"" in here?"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,297.422,305.759,"Yes, Justice White, and I seem to have gotten lost in the ""cryptic"" avenue in this instance, but I think that the forms are, this first form is... and the second one is not real important anyway."
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.159,462.628,Would you go through it for me once more?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,464.18,464.913,"I understand, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,464.913,477.656,"The difference between the state and the court of appeals is that the court of appeals said that if there was disagreement on one mitigating factor, the consequence would be mistrial?"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,477.656,478.056,No.
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.869,507.009,I thought the state court of appeals said the form would be left blank on such a--
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,507.009,520.067,"That was their conclusion... their conclusion was that that particular part of the form would be left blank, and that that juror would know to leave it blank and he would remember that he's entitled in the final analysis to use that mitigating circumstance."
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.434,525.136,"--Wait, what do you mean, ""he would remember""?"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,526.903,527.922,"--Oh, I think he would remember."
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.922,532.457,"--well, because it walks you through it, and in the determination of sentence, it says,"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,548.15,548.586,That's true.
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.586,551.388,"--if one of them was left blank, that means that all of them are not marked ""no""."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,554.188,560.025,"But it presupposes, of course, that you understood in the beginning that you could leave it blank, and that you were entitled on an individual basis."
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,560.025,561.644,You mean your second point is your first point?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,561.644,563.761,"They're related, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.761,565.445,"They're one and the same, it seems to me."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,565.445,574.801,"I don't think so because if you look at the new form, the court of appeals thought it was necessary to add specific language at the end, saying that each individual juror would do this."
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.705,584.74,You can always make somebody that's tolerably good better.
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,590.561,605.253,"I agree with that, but I think just looking at the forms, we don't really have much in terms of making good better, we have here, if you weren't familiar with the statute, I'd be willing to bet that I could show these two to any lawyer and you would never guess that they came from the same state."
1987.87-5367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.782,636.523,"I think you ought to talk about this case as though there hadn't been a new form published and just you are faced, then, with the court of appeals decision that the form that was used in this case was perfectly adequate."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,636.523,639.743,"I said that, Justice White--"
1987.87-5367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,639.743,640.593,"Well, that's your problem."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,640.593,663.942,"--I don't think so, because as I pointed out, one of the problems that I see besides the instructions not directing the jury to do any of these mental gymnastics, the other problem is this language using the same language in the aggravating and the mitigating, yet at the same time saying the juror without being told to do so, is going to have to treat it in a different way, although it's the same language in the aggravating and mitigating."
1987.87-5367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,663.942,675.131,"Mr. Burns, I take it the defendant in this case made no objection to the use of this particular form, and made no objections to the instructions given at the time?"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,675.131,676.166,"That is true, Justice O'Connor."
1987.87-5367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,676.166,686.105,"So for you to prevail, we would have to find that the error amounted to plain error, if it existed at all?"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,686.105,688.538,"I don't think so, Justice O'Connor, because, of course, the court of appeals did not decide it on this basis."
1987.87-5367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,726.311,741.487,"Well, at least we know that, on this... the form that this jury returned, they at least, the jurors indicated they unanimously agreed that none of the... there were no mitigating factors."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,741.487,756.08,"They did, Justice O'Connor, but of course, there is no evidence to show, and they were certainly never told, that if you look at the instructions, it was clear, ""unanimous... yes or no"", they weren't told anything about this possibility, that perhaps if you're not unanimous, you still may retain your individual judgment--"
1987.87-5367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,756.08,766.936,"Well, the fact is, though, we have a situation where they've indicated unanimously that they don't find any of the mitigating circumstances or any at all."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,766.936,768.571,"--Well, we have a form."
1987.87-5367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.24,805.411,Weren't they told several times in the instructions they had to be unanimous on all their findings as to mitigation?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,805.411,816.785,"They were told, but I think that that may cut the other way because I think they would also be told the other thing if the court of appeals' interpretation be correct, you also have to be unanimous on the lack thereof."
1987.87-5367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,833.663,836.698,There is absolutely no indication to support your hypothesis.
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,850.04,857.279,"--The problem, Chief Justice Rehnquist, is of course, our position is under these forms, there is no way they would have any way to communicate that to anyone."
1987.87-5367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.144,890.0,"It's just as likely that there was unanimity, actual unanimity."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,890.0,892.035,"Well, there could have been, Justice White--"
1987.87-5367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,892.035,892.719,"Well, there could have been."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,892.719,893.569,--I think the problem is--
1987.87-5367,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.569,894.235,It's not unusual.
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,894.235,913.615,"--the court of appeals... well, the court of appeals, to be correct, I think, has to be more than a toss of the coin; there has to be some certainty; and if the only certainty it seems to me that you can get is if you have very specific instructions or a form that makes it clear that the jury knows what it is that you are doing."
1987.87-5367,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,940.2,950.907,"I just want to ask you one question before you get to that: if the jury had simply been instructed orally with no form, would your argument be the same?"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,950.907,952.357,I think depending on the instructions--
1987.87-5367,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,952.357,953.775,The instructions would be the same.
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,953.775,955.109,--Then I think it would be the same.
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.747,996.436,"Before you get to the other question, too, in your brief, you list seven potentially mitigating circumstances on page 4."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1001.256,1006.744,"--He did, and there is one other one we also pointed out in our footnote 4, they didn't argue, he argued them, yes."
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1010.129,1025.039,"Do you interpret the jury's finding that there were no mitigating circumstances to mean that they didn't think that these were factually correct, or that if indeed the man had a low I.Q., we don't consider that mitigating?"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1025.039,1027.189,"An interesting question, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.376,1033.661,Did the judge give them any help?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1033.661,1042.333,"--The judge gave the generally set-out routine instructions; he did not specifically say that; he really put it to the jury and said that you consider it, and they do consider it."
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.821,1053.039,Wasn't there evidence in the record that he terminated his education at the sixth grade?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1053.039,1054.658,"--Yes, Justice Stevens, evidence like that."
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.658,1055.808,Was that a disputed fact?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1055.808,1057.677,Most of the factual things were not.
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1064.414,1074.804,"So what they're saying in effect is, these facts are not sufficiently sufficient even to be justified as to be called mitigating, so we don't have to even weigh them, which is quite different, per se."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1074.804,1075.387,"I think so, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.687,1078.839,We find these facts but we think the aggravating circumstances are much more serious?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1078.839,1080.039,"I think so, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-5367,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1087.778,1101.352,"If you please counsel, one more question on this point: I'm not sure I understood your answer to Justice O'Connor's question, when she asked you... when she pointed out to you that there had been no objection below."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1101.352,1104.954,"As I agreed, there certainly has not been."
1987.87-5367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.281,1152.434,You are going to leave to your briefs whatever questions there may be as to whether the introduction of this evidence was a violation of the Eighth Amendment?
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1152.434,1155.403,"--Yes, of course, Chief Justice."
1987.87-5367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1183.406,1186.256,I understood the state to argue it was not a violation of the Eighth Amendment.
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1186.256,1191.66,"Yes, Chief Justice, and obviously we, for the same reasons in Booth, think it is."
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.685,1229.601,I do have one further question.
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1251.466,1253.049,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.199,1299.947,"It would still allow all mitigating circumstances to be taken into account; it would be a state saying if a jury unanimously finds one aggravating circumstance, they are entitled to consider all mitigating circumstances, but if they find a mitigation, once they've unanimously found one of these aggravating circumstances, they have to find it unanimously."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1310.303,1327.764,"It may be... I'm not so sure about that, Justice Scalia, because it may be you could draft the statute, getting around the problem of unanimity, but I think here you'd have a fully open statute, and what I mean by that is, you'd have a situation literally where one juror says, I think this person deserves death; I don't think there are any mitigating factors."
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1353.164,1358.568,"Well, it has to be more than that: you have one juror who thinks there should be Death, and 12 jurors who find the particular aggravating circumstances."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1358.568,1360.518,You do have to find the aggravating as a practical matter.
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1376.161,1396.991,"But you're saying that if one juror finds no mitigating circumstances, nothing that he would regard as mitigating, and 12 agree with him that this was a murder committed in prison or whatever the aggravating factor is, and all eleven think there are mitigating circumstances, then the statute mandates Death, does it not?"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1396.991,1400.126,--It would if interpreted the way Justice Scalia is asking the question.
1987.87-5367,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.126,1401.645,"Well, even under this form it would?"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1401.645,1405.363,"Under this form, as we interpret it, yes."
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.915,1437.568,"I don't know... suppose it only takes one to find a mitigating circumstance, and that's going to be enough?"
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1455.946,1465.386,"You can certainly say that, Justice Scalia, but we draw lines every day, and I suggest the one where one's enough to execute, is probably a line no one really wants to draw."
1987.87-5367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1487.667,1494.071,"Zero versus one against, and you think it should be seven versus five."
1987.87-5367,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1503.461,1519.638,"--I think in the context of the jury system, that we're looking for a jury of 12 people to decide this to say in effect we'll tolerate one saying it is capricious, because if we looked at the jury, and even if we had the seven-five, we're giving some play to the notion that it's the group, it's the jury, deciding it."
1987.87-5367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1535.248,1538.283,"Thank you, Mr. Burns."
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1540.2,1548.222,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1987.87-5367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1604.558,1609.212,Where is that in the materials here?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1612.747,1614.997,"At page 95, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-5367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1614.997,1616.549,--Page 95 of what?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1616.549,1617.532,Of the joint appendix.
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.635,1647.351,What point are you making?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1647.351,1665.882,"The point, Justice White, is that these instructions read by a reasonable juror would have led them to conclude that they must unanimously decide ""yes"" or ""no"" on each one of the mitigating circumstances, and if that is so, then we don't have a Lockett... Eddings problem in this case."
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.385,1683.926,"As I read your brief, and as I seem to have the same notion now, you don't think you need to go through the routine that the court of appeals did to sustain this?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1683.926,1691.58,"I don't think that, with all due respect to Mr. Burns, that his interpretation of what the court of appeals said is correct."
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.774,1717.247,"And if eleven jurors thought there was a mitigating circumstance and one thought not, they had to... the jury had to proceed on the basis that there were no mitigating circumstances?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1717.247,1718.081,--That's not correct.
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.695,1753.252,"So you say that under that instruction, the way it would work out is that there couldn't have been a hold-out juror; there couldn't have been a hold-out juror?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1753.252,1762.275,"There couldn't have been a hold-out juror; the jury would have hung and under the Maryland statute, life imprisonment would have been tendered."
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.275,1765.377,And the tender would have been another proceeding?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1765.377,1765.76,No.
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.168,1805.537,Under the Maryland rules there would have been a hung jury?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1805.537,1805.954,Right.
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.954,1807.57,And life imprisonment?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1807.57,1808.489,And life imprisonment.
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.489,1828.301,"What do you do with the Petitioner's argument when he points out that the form had been used 25 or 30 times and the ""no's"" were filled out in every case all the same, and then when they changed the form, blanks began to occur?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1828.301,1834.973,"Justice Kennedy, the instructions of this court were ""answer every question""."
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.313,1878.835,If somebody felt like leaving something blank under the old form there would just have been a hung jury?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1878.835,1885.822,"Well, they could not reach a conclusion, and therefore decided to leave it blank on the old form, they would have had a hung jury."
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.822,1886.672,And it would have been life imprisonment.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1886.672,1889.024,"That is correct, and indeed there is at least one case--"
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1889.024,1891.576,So that the new form would make it more likely that Death would be imposed?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1891.576,1900.349,--That's exactly the problem that the court of appeals thinks that they were addressing when they set forth in their opinion explaining why the new form came into being.
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.156,1912.589,Anyway.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1912.589,1913.123,Anyway.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.316,1940.641,May I ask you just to be sure... it's kind of hard to keep this complicated case in mind; did Maryland law at the time of this trial require that any finding of a mitigated circumstance be unanimous?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1940.641,1943.176,The Maryland Court of Appeals so-stated.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1943.176,1944.278,In this opinion.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1944.278,1945.045,In this opinion.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.045,1946.278,Had it previously done that?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1948.663,1961.822,"The statute talks about unanimity and the final version and the Maryland Court of Appeals had adopted the form, although there is one minor change between the form that was used in this case and the rule."
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.756,1967.976,"--If the statutes so required, how could they authorize the new form?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1967.976,1992.107,"Well, what they did was under the old arrangement, before the new form came into place, the court of appeals, relying upon the statute, and relying upon their rulemaking authority, adopted a form which mandated unanimity for a no answer on the form."
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.649,2009.303,So there was no statutory requirement that a finding of no mitigating circumstances be unanimous?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2009.303,2017.623,"But Maryland law was by virtue of the rule adopted by the court of appeals, which is a part of Maryland law, that unanimity was required."
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2017.623,2020.075,You mean the rule adopted in this case?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2020.075,2030.049,"No, a rule that was pre-existing this case, because the form itself was adopted by rule in Maryland, and was in place for all the cases that was decided before this."
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2030.049,2034.251,"Was there a rule other than the rule approving of this form, or was that the rule?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2034.251,2034.701,No.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.701,2042.774,"So to the extent the form was ambiguous, or at least as the dissenting justice in the court of appeals thought, that ambiguity would also have existed in the rule?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2042.774,2043.99,That's correct.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2047.492,2051.713,"And so when the adopted a new form, they basically changed the law under your view?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2051.713,2056.534,"When they adopted a new form, they allowed the jury not to get hung up on--"
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.534,2058.467,"I understand, but they did change the law?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2058.467,2060.236,"--That's correct, they did."
1987.87-5367,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2060.236,2078.197,"Mr. Attorney-General, we do recognize, don't we, that nobody at these two tables here, nobody here... two people, agree what those forms mean, yet 12 jury men can easily understand it."
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2080.315,2082.398,"Well, Justice Marshall, I can't agree with you."
1987.87-5367,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2089.671,2092.373,Room for disagreement.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2092.373,2095.408,"--Well, I don't believe so, Justice Marshall."
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.763,2112.6,Do you think that your rationale for affirmance is the same as the court of appeals used?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2112.6,2114.236,I believe it is.
1987.87-5367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.236,2118.238,"Can I ask you, General Monk about perhaps another portion of the form?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2138.902,2139.354,That is correct.
1987.87-5367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.354,2139.97,And they leave it blank.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2165.1,2166.152,That's so.
1987.87-5367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.152,2199.373,"So, if they've left some of those forms blank, by reason of the fact there are only 11 of them that think that they're mitigating, there are really only still in the balancing, they are only going to balance those mitigating circumstances that have been unanimously found, so they would check... and let's assume that, on the basis of those, that a few of them, or there are none of them, they check that ""no"", they don't outweigh the aggravating circumstances."
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2246.318,2251.722,"Justice Scalia, I don't mean to quarrel with your hypothetical, but I don't think that's the way it operates."
1987.87-5367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.722,2252.805,"Okay, tell me why not?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2252.805,2259.058,"For the first reason is, as the judge in this case instructed, he instructed the jury"
1987.87-5367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.401,2275.018,You must be unanimous?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2276.918,2287.958,"--Well, just as a judge instructs them to be unanimous in the guilt or innocence phase: reach a determination; do you agree that the defendant is guilty or not?"
1987.87-5367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.5,2303.385,"You mean they'd come back out and say, we cannot finish section II."
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2306.956,2309.372,"--That is exactly right, and indeed there is one circumstance in the--"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2309.372,2311.741,It would be life imprisonment?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2311.741,2315.026,"--It would be life imprisonment under the Maryland procedure, because they could not reach an unanimous verdict."
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2338.641,2349.866,"Let me just clarify one other thing: I am correct, am I not, that the judge did not specifically tell them what to do if the situation should arise that they were not unanimous on a mitigating circumstance?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2352.918,2359.322,"--He did not, if you're question is, did he instruct them what would happen if they were hung, he did not so-instruct them."
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.322,2371.362,"What about on whether or not there was a particular, six or seven different, mitigating circumstances, but if there was not unanimity on one of the mitigating circumstances, did he tell them what to do there?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2373.648,2374.114,"No, that is correct."
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.43,2402.584,Wouldn't it be better to introduce it to the jury if they answered this way?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2402.584,2403.601,That's exactly right.
1987.87-5367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2420.045,2429.651,"It was Mr. Burns' response that the form didn't give them any opportunity to express, yet if there were, but if there were none, non-unanimity?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2429.651,2455.468,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, it seems to me that they would have... the two possibilities... if they could not agree, they would have come back to the court and said they can't agree, we know at least in one circumstance, that one of the lodgings that was submitted to the Court by the Petitioner, that a jury in fact did hang, and it appears that they hung up on mitigating circumstances, and if they deliberated for 12 hours and a life imprisonment was imposed."
1987.87-5367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2455.468,2461.789,"Well, Mr. Monk, does any jury form in an ordinary case, let's talk about a capital case for a minute."
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2480.434,2485.071,They are not instructed in Maryland that what the possibility of hanging might be.
1987.87-5367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2486.738,2490.123,And isn't that what most states do?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2495.01,2495.66,That's correct.
1987.87-5367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.66,2497.926,You don't want one for the jury to hang.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2497.926,2503.064,And indeed you don't want to encourage a jury to not be able to reach a conclusion to hang.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.266,2514.122,But what is the reason for requiring unanimity when you find you are not agreed that there is a mitigating circumstance?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2520.108,2529.964,"The mitigating circumstances under the state statute are... I mean, there are seven statutorily defined mitigating circumstances, and then another category--"
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2529.964,2530.497,A catch-all.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2530.497,2531.683,--A catch-all for anything else.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2531.683,2532.399,All right.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2532.399,2546.175,"And really the first seven are really factual determinations that the court, the rule, is requiring the jury to make: tell us where you find that there is credible evidence to support whatever the mitigating circumstance is?"
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.018,2567.005,"Yes, but some of the mitigating circumstances on which he relied were not really in dispute factually."
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2585.799,2587.918,"Well, I think you are part wrong, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2610.999,2619.271,"I understand on that one, but on the sixth grade education and the low I.Q. I know they're not one of the enumerated ones."
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2619.271,2620.64,"They are not one of the enumerated ones, and then--"
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.64,2631.178,"But you suggest that no juror, none of the 12 jurors, you are satisfied that none of the 12 jurors... you certainly not saying that none of those facts were correct?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2632.947,2636.566,"--Under number 8, the jury makes a two-part determination, it seems to me."
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.422,2644.938,--Correct.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2644.938,2647.707,Because one through seven are defined to be mitigating.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.326,2661.598,"And so what they're really... because what the facts were essentially undisputed, they are really saying none of us think that a low I.Q. or a sixth grade education has any mitigating value at all?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2661.598,2662.8,That's correct.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.517,2665.669,That is probably what they concluded.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2673.138,2673.521,--Right.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.506,2676.958,That's right.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2676.958,2681.494,"I mean, they affirmatively went to the point to where... this jury, it seems to me--"
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.494,2691.016,Arguably those instructions and those forms said you should answer no to a mitigating circumstance unless you're unanimous that it exists?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2691.016,2694.301,"--Well, Justice White--"
1987.87-5367,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.301,2698.853,"In order to find there is a mitigating circumstance, you must be unanimous?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2698.853,2703.573,"--That's right, and in order to find that there is no mitigating circumstance, you must be unanimous."
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2709.661,2710.811,That he did not tell them.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2710.811,2712.513,"--Well, he did, I believe."
1987.87-5367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2719.416,2726.236,"Well, it certainly could have been a lot clearer."
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2731.557,2732.842,"Well, Justice Scalia, let me--"
1987.87-5367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2732.842,2736.71,"Just to read them, they certainly don't leap out and mean that to me."
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2736.71,2749.535,"--Well, if you look at all of the instructions together, I believe that under California v. Brown, a reasonable juror would have understood the instructions to be read as the court of appeals interpreted them in this case."
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2753.387,2754.871,I shouldn't be interrupting you so much.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2773.066,2773.399,No.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.009,2792.127,"But the jury was hung on the ultimate determination, too?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2792.127,2794.329,"Well, I submit we don't know."
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2796.348,2810.006,"The thing that's unlikely, it seems to me, in the way that things happen in real life, is that they would come to the unanimous conclusion that there should be a Death sentence, but that they should be hung on an intermediate... a mitigating circumstance, and they leave that blank."
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2817.862,2826.534,"--Well, if the jury was unable to reach a determination on each of the questions, then they would be hung and a life sentence under the form--"
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2826.534,2842.877,"Even though they filled out the rest of the form, they said... they said that even one mitigating blank, filled everything else out that would qualify for a capital... for the Death sentence, the judge would then under Maryland law have a duty to impose the life sentence, just because of that one blank in the form?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2842.877,2849.297,--That is the anomalous circumstance that the court of appeals was concerned about and therefore announced a new form to be used in future cases.
1987.87-5367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.297,2868.295,"Counsel, at page 141 of the joint appendix, the majority opinion discusses in the first full paragraph the jury's duty, and as I understand it, if the jury is hung on mitigating, they go ahead on aggravating anyway?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2868.295,2871.997,"Well, the aggravating comes first in the form, Justice Kennedy."
1987.87-5367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2871.997,2879.484,"But it says, if they're hung as to mitigating, they go on in any event to determine the aggravating circumstance?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2879.484,2889.224,"I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy, that passage that you are referring to in 141 is referring to the new procedure, not the form that was in place at the time that this case was decided."
1987.87-5367,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2951.115,2954.917,"The court of appeals didn't rely on that at all, did they?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2954.917,2957.019,The court of appeals did not rely on that.
1987.87-5367,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2957.019,2958.019,It didn't did they?
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2958.019,2958.635,They did not.
1987.87-5367,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3115.987,3120.272,"You were defending that in Booth, weren't you?"
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3120.272,3122.141,"Yes, I was, Justice Blackmun."
1987.87-5367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3154.695,3162.199,That wouldn't be a limitation of the Booth holding was that the particular impact evidence there had to be excluded.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3163.717,3169.871,"The victim impact evidence in Booth included all of those things, Justice Rehnquist."
1987.87-5367,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3169.871,3173.24,It's not often that a lawyer gets to argue the same case twice.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3174.29,3178.31,"It is not, Justice Marshall, and I beg the Court's indulgence."
1987.87-5367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3180.076,3183.695,It's even rarer that the wins the first time and loses the second.
1987.87-5367,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3183.695,3204.259,"--Understanding that, Justice Scalia, let me just make one more point about how this Court might distinguish the decision in that case from this case: this victim was the lowest part of humanity."
1987.87-5367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3274.188,3276.438,"Thank you, Mr. Monk."
1987.87-5367,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3278.64,3300.969,"Initially, I think the crucial problem with the state's position as I now understand it to be, is the court's opinion set forth in the joint appendix at 136... 141, curiously there is not one word about a new law announcing new forms; what the court says is Petitioner has got it all wrong; this is what it's always meant."
1987.87-5367,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3347.864,3365.226,"You can't say that we must accept the Maryland Court of Appeals construction of the form that you were talking about, and yet not accept it for another reason."
1987.87-5367,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3365.226,3372.064,"Justice White, I never said you shouldn't accept the interpretation of what the jury should do."
1987.87-5367,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3398.983,3404.601,"Well, if we're free to do that, why I suppose we're free to accept the state's submission?"
1987.87-5367,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3404.601,3407.32,"I don't think so, Justice White--"
1987.87-5367,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3407.32,3414.576,"Well, I know, because one or the other; but there's nothing to bar us... we're not legally barred."
1987.87-5367,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3414.576,3416.592,--Of course the Supreme Court can do anything.
1987.87-5367,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3416.592,3417.409,"No, it can't."
1987.87-5367,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3428.467,3440.691,"I'm asking... I'm not asking at all to say their construction is wrong; I'm simply saying if this is the correct instruction of this, we get the benefit of these instructions and this sentencing form."
1987.87-5367,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3443.159,3444.178,"Well, they said you did."
1987.87-5367,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3444.178,3446.428,"Well, that's where we disagree with the court."
1987.87-5367,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3457.484,3459.234,Thank you Mr. Monk.
