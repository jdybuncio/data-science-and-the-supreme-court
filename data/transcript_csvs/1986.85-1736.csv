1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,0.0,24.198,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1736,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,126.481,134.42,"Do I understand that you concede liability for a portion of that time, but I take it not collectability in view of the lack of notice?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,134.42,135.653,That is correct.
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,175.642,176.059,May I.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,182.562,186.514,--During the period of time from January of 1979 through March of 1980.
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,186.514,190.05,Does that mean you also concede that you had actual notice of the tax?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,190.05,191.383,"No, we do not concede that."
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.383,193.168,"Well then, how could you be liable under the statute?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,193.168,196.454,"Well, if I could rephrase my answer perhaps just to clarify."
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,220.585,224.787,And therefore it concedes that it had actual knowledge of the deficiency?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,224.787,226.889,"--No, I don't mean to say--"
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,226.889,229.608,"Isn't the notice... there's a scienter requirement in the statute, isn't there?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,229.608,230.708,"--Yes, there is."
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,238.012,239.464,"Well then, you don't concede liability."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,239.464,242.749,"--All right, yes, we don't, in that limited context."
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,242.749,246.051,"Well, because to concede liability you've got to concede scienter, do you not?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,246.051,249.236,"Under 6303(a), yes."
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,249.236,251.019,"All right, so you don't concede liability."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,251.019,251.469,"No, we do not."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,252.302,253.385,Or anything?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,253.385,254.671,We don't concede anything.
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.697,359.034,Can the Government sue the taxpayer or the lender without an assessment?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,361.469,367.54,"--Without an assessment having been made at all, they can do it within a three year period of time."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,367.54,368.492,Only three years.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,368.492,369.225,"Three years, that's right."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,369.225,374.895,"That is, they could haul you into court without you ever knowing until you were served with a complaint?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,374.895,377.097,"Within that three year period, yes."
1986.85-1736,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.782,409.449,We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,431.732,434.367,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.988,469.571,Excuse me.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,474.44,476.242,--That's right.
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.882,490.3,In which case he has no notice.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,490.3,491.084,--That's correct.
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.084,495.703,But you're arguing here that you want notice before you can be sued.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,495.703,496.905,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.542,533.744,"Well, right here you're making a statute of limitations argument."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,548.734,551.353,We are making the argument that we had not received notice.
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.51,567.112,Precluded because of the statute of limitations or just because you weren't liable?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,571.449,577.587,"We argued it in regard to the issue of notice, which was a precondition for the institution of suit."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.17,606.856,After three years.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,606.856,607.456,No.
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.366,624.651,I see what you're saying.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,634.674,635.49,That's correct.
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.49,636.309,Just bring a lawsuit.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,643.045,644.481,Without having provided--
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.481,645.831,--without having provided notice.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,647.297,653.135,"--Well, that's under Section 6303(a), and that of course is the issue which is before the Court."
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,681.469,693.11,"May I ask you, to be sure I understand your colloquy with Justice Scalia, had there never been an assessment in this case at all, would you claim that you were entitled... and say the Government sued you."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,708.769,711.138,"--If there had been no assessment, no."
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,711.138,714.34,You would agree that you could be sued without any notice if there's no assessment?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,714.34,716.673,"Within a three year period of time, that's right, yes."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.673,726.481,"But you're saying that since there was an assessment you cannot be sued, neither within the three year period of time nor, of course, later?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,726.481,742.423,"Nor beyond that, although for the purposes of the facts of this case, of course, all of the period of time that the Government seeks to impose liability on the bank would be beyond the three year period of time, although I understand your point as far as the notice."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,742.423,744.589,Suppose we disagree with you on that.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,762.301,767.419,"Yes, we do, because of the issue of the notice."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.657,775.525,"Well, the notice is crucial, but you never did say the magic words, statute of limitations."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,775.525,784.814,"Well, not to belabor the point, but the reason that we didn't is because we are not requesting any different period of statute of limitations."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,798.807,802.609,So you're saying you did not raise the statute of limitations point?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,802.609,804.044,"No, we didn't raise it in that context, no."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.724,952.324,What's tax?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,952.324,963.865,"That is the unpaid employee withholding tax and the Federal Contribution Insurance Act taxes, which had not been paid by the employer."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.865,967.984,"But this provision about notice applies across the board, doesn't it, not just to this particular--"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,967.984,970.352,"Yes, it applies to each person liable for the tax."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.352,970.886,--Any tax?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,974.304,975.673,"That's my understanding, yes, it would."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.023,984.196,"So you would say, you would think the employer ought to be told what the total assessment is?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,984.196,987.83,"--Yes, we would."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.963,992.282,What information would that give you?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,992.282,996.669,--You mean the lender receiving--
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.669,997.403,"Telling the lender, yes."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,997.403,998.003,--Okay.
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.606,1062.862,"Well, how is the Government supposed to know at the time of an assessment who all the people are that may be liable?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1062.862,1067.064,"--The Government makes this argument, that at present it has no way of knowing that."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.829,1122.031,What if the employer doesn't comply?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1122.031,1124.964,"Well, this gets back to the--"
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.964,1126.766,Then are you off the hook?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1126.766,1132.886,"--I think that if the employer engages in fraud, which I think for the general purpose--"
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.886,1133.838,He just doesn't fill in the blank.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1133.838,1138.806,"--Well then, I think he would be engaging in a fraudulent tax return in that instance."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.806,1140.492,So who pays for that?
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1140.492,1149.431,"Well, at that point I think it would still be the Government's responsibility, because of the statutory requirement."
1986.85-1736,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.668,1163.358,The language of 6303(a) doesn't really square very well with the kind of notice you want given here.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1179.368,1181.92,"That's right, there could be a difference."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1181.92,1184.104,"There would be, wouldn't there?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1184.104,1195.995,"It quite probably could be that situation, because the employer's liability will also include an assessment for the amount of the employer's contribution towards social security contributions."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1224.079,1225.229,That doesn't state the amount.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1225.229,1229.632,"Well, if you put in the amount of the dollars."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.703,1236.719,The lender's liability.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1240.854,1242.304,That is right.
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.304,1247.508,"And if it does refer to liability of the lender, the amount in question has to be the amount of the lender's liability."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1247.508,1262.1,"The type of notice that we are envisioning, though, would serve the purpose, we believe, of placing the lender on notice that under 3505 the Government intends to seek that liability."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.1,1265.202,I have no doubt it would do a whole lot of good for the lender.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1287.881,1318.068,"We would urge that, if in fact the Government feels that it could not give a precise indication of the liability, that the notice function as we have discussed is still worthwhile, and that the notice that can be contained under Section 6303(a) would still provide the basic function of putting the lender on notice of the fact that the Government intends to seek a liability."
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1330.81,1332.36,Or the unpaid tax.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1332.36,1333.026,Pardon?
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1333.026,1334.993,Liable for the unpaid tax.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1334.993,1335.478,Unpaid tax.
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1335.478,1337.878,"Which includes the entire unpaid tax, does it not?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1341.03,1342.399,That is correct.
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1360.427,1362.379,"Well, they're liable for a sum equal to a portion of the tax."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1366.497,1368.699,"--Well, it says that notice of assessment--"
1986.85-1736,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.699,1372.317,The statutory language in 3505(a) and (b) is
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1375.353,1396.349,"--Under 3505(a) it is the amount equal to the unpaid tax liability for funds which are advanced directly, ad under 3505(b) Congress has placed the limitation with regard to 25 percent of those funds in the enumerated situations."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.349,1421.815,"Well, would it satisfy the terms of the notice requirement just to say, we have made an assessment against the employer for his unpaid tax liabilities, and part of this assessment is for withholding tax, and we are notifying you that you are liable for your proper share of that tax?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1422.667,1424.4,"I think it would, really."
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.773,1432.473,You would have to say that.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1434.558,1435.375,--Excuse me?
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1435.375,1442.711,"You have to take that position, because you wouldn't expect the Government to come out with the dollars figure."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1442.711,1443.877,"Not necessarily, no."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1451.448,1465.874,"But if it did that with the employer, you wouldn't suggest that you could satisfy 6303(a) by writing such a letter to the employer saying, you know, we have checked our records and it doesn't seem to me you've paid the right amount of tax, we hereby give you notice of tax deficiency."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1465.874,1467.992,"Well, it would be an assessment."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1555.3,1565.506,"That's a statute of limitations position, that they shouldn't be able to sue beyond three years unless they have given notice."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1570.791,1576.861,"We're saying, yes, under 6303(a) that the filing of the assessment triggers the notice provision."
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1576.861,1583.682,"So you can't make the argument that you've just made, that it's not fair for them to be able to have the benefit of the supplemental three years."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1591.954,1601.893,"If the corollary as far as the facts of our case are concerned, that in this instance the Government wishes to go beyond the three year period without giving the notice--"
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.893,1616.836,"Do you have any cases involving assessment against an employer in which an assessment has been made, but notice has not been given, and the employer is held therefore not subject to suit even within the three year period?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1616.836,1621.288,--At the moment I cannot think of a case.
1986.85-1736,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.288,1624.656,But that's the principle that you're arguing be applied to your client.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1624.656,1625.073,Yes.
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.791,1684.028,"The bank can't really protect itself with its customer, can it, as easily as the Government can?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1684.028,1691.515,"--Well, the Government makes the argument that the bank could have the employer execute, I believe--"
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1691.515,1694.9,"Because this is an ongoing relationship, it happens every month."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1702.505,1705.274,--It does happen perhaps on every month.
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.341,1708.493,And I don't suppose it's automatic.
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1712.445,1715.047,--In some cases it could be.
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1719.749,1719.999,Well--
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1719.999,1721.165,But that could be drawn down.
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.165,1727.586,"--Even with a line of credit, there can be some checks as to what's the status of your withholding tax."
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1727.586,1729.438,That's a possibility.
1986.85-1736,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.358,1742.144,"Well, you'd like to shift that risk to the Government?"
1986.85-1736,0,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,1742.144,1744.345,--We think the risk is already there.
1986.85-1736,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1749.832,1750.582,"Thank you, Mr. Flayhart."
1986.85-1736,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1752.565,1759.771,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1736,2,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,3587.536,3592.49,"We would just like to address two points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1736,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3622.475,3629.013,"It tells him that the Government's about to come and garnish his... you know, attach his property."
1986.85-1736,2,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,3629.013,3635.15,"--That's right, and that the tax is due and the Government agent's going to be there within a period of time."
1986.85-1736,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3635.15,3635.769,Up to that amount.
1986.85-1736,2,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,3640.404,3653.48,"Except for the fact that it also tells the lender that the Government's going to be there up to nine years later, about to do likewise in terms of foisting liability on the lender for these same taxes."
1986.85-1736,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3655.946,3658.282,"Well, that's a different point."
1986.85-1736,2,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,3666.121,3669.656,"Well, we wouldn't quibble with that."
1986.85-1736,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3675.993,3682.297,What statutory provision do you say sets the limitations period against the lender?
1986.85-1736,2,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,3682.297,3685.249,It would be 6501 and 6502.
1986.85-1736,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3685.249,3686.749,6501 and 2.
1986.85-1736,2,35831,martin_a_flayhart,,3686.749,3687.099,Yes.
1986.85-1736,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3691.669,3692.919,"Thank you, Mr. Flayhart."
