1970.29,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.596,"We'll hear arguments in number 29, U.S. Bulk Carriers against Arguelles."
1970.29,0,26145,george_w_sullivan,,42.941,48.537,"We'll do our best Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1970.29,1,28471,i_duke_avnet,,1407.376,1411.246,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1447.723,1449.258,That was no question.
1970.29,1,28471,i_duke_avnet,,1449.258,1457.037,And that the wages should be recoverable “as wages in any claim made before the court.”
1970.29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1607.384,1608.559,Let me ask you this by the way.
1970.29,1,28471,i_duke_avnet,,1608.559,1609.259,"Yes, sir."
1970.29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1609.259,1627.578,"If the six months expiration date comes at the time they are in the foreign court, does the seaman have a right to insist upon the extending the articles until he is at his home port or can the master of this vessel terminate the men in there?"
1970.29,1,28471,i_duke_avnet,,1627.578,1639.725,The usual procedure on a risk for the man to decide whether he want to continue on and then he resigns articles or if he decided he doesn't want to continue on then he is paid off right there and the Captain replaces him with someone else.
1970.29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1639.725,1647.402,"Well, suppose he wants to stay on, but the Captain wants to terminate him and my question is, may he be terminated in a foreign port?"
1970.29,1,28471,i_duke_avnet,,1647.402,1649.346,I would think so.
1970.29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1649.346,1649.493,Sure --
1970.29,1,28471,i_duke_avnet,,1649.493,1652.339,"Because the article says, it's only for six months."
1970.29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1652.339,1657.83,What if the six months period ends when the ship is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean?
1970.29,1,28471,i_duke_avnet,,1657.83,1668.7,"Then of course, it's a practical measure, he would be continued on until they reach the next port and then be paid off of that next port."
1970.29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1819.92,1831.177,I think that you're emphasizing these facts on the theory that this is the kind of the recall sequence that statute was intended to penalize?
1970.29,1,28471,i_duke_avnet,,1831.177,1853.112,"Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice and to answer now Justice Stewart's question it is true that the amount of the overtime, the rate of the overtime is fixed by the collective-bargaining contract, but the remedy Your Honor is given by the statute."
1970.29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1854.018,1856.579,[Voice Overlap] a remedy is also given by the collective-bargaining [Voice Overlap]?
1970.29,1,28471,i_duke_avnet,,1856.579,1857.152,"Yes, sir."
1970.29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1858.063,1859.389,And that's the issue before it.
1970.29,1,28471,i_duke_avnet,,1859.389,1870.065,That's correct sir and the question arises therefore whether the collective-bargaining remedy is a mandatory substitute for the statutory remedy.
1970.29,2,26145,george_w_sullivan,,2238.071,2243.4,"Well, if I may then I would like to say something."
1970.29,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2280.064,2284.466,"But we -- you're not suggesting, we try to re-determine the facts here."
1970.29,2,26145,george_w_sullivan,,2284.466,2294.97,"No, Your Honor, I'm not but they made the certain illusion that it was on the company agent's, a dilatory tactic that he wasn't paid properly in Galveston."
1970.29,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2318.314,2320.299,"Very well, thank you Mr. Sullivan."
