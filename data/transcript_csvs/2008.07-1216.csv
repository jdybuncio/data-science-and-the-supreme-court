2008.07-1216,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.987,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1216, Philip Morris v. Williams."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,8.554,23.615,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We are here today because the Oregon court failed to follow this Court's directions on remand and because the ground it gave is not adequate to show a forfeiture of due process rights."
2008.07-1216,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,67.292,79.083,"Mr. Shapiro, we are dealing with a State supreme court, and our bottom line always reads"
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,99.347,101.699,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-1216,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,125.581,146.644,"But it seems to me the problem with the argument is that to say it's inconsistent with the opinion we implicitly have to say that the Oregon Supreme Court has to confront State law issues in a certain sequence, and that if it does not do so, those issues are waived, as it were, not only by the court but by the party who raised it."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,174.497,184.269,"Well, we don't say that the court can never adopt a State law standard after remand from this Court, but we say that this disposition is inconsistent with--"
2008.07-1216,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,184.269,209.401,"I know you are saying that but why -- why does the disposition that you are asking for not entail what I just said, and that is, in effect you cut off the claim by a party raised before the Oregon Supreme Court, not considered by the Oregon Supreme Court, and you cut off that claim simply because the Oregon Supreme Court chose to approach the issues in the case in a certain sequence?"
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,211.003,224.596,"--Well, because the preservation issue was debated before this Court, and it adopted a specific order here saying on remand now consider the constitutional standard, which is the prohibition on--"
2008.07-1216,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,224.596,227.464,I know the language that you are referring to.
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,227.464,227.931,--Yes.
2008.07-1216,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,227.931,234.118,But referring to that language simply skips over the issue that I am trying to raise.
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,247.843,264.822,"Well, Your Honor, this is very similar to what occurred in the Sullivan case in this Court, where the issue of preservation was debated before this Court at the cert stage in the cert papers, and the Court said: We sub silentio passed on the adequacy of the State ground when we GVR'ed the case."
2008.07-1216,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,264.822,283.551,"Didn't -- did the Court -- I mean, that's -- suppose the -- what is it called -- ""correct in all respects"" had been raised and decided by the Oregon Supreme Court in the first instance."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,311.452,319.824,"Well, that takes us to our second and principal argument, which is that that ground would not be adequate under this Court's criteria for adequacy."
2008.07-1216,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,346.125,348.993,Isn't the place to make that argument in the Oregon Supreme Court?
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,348.993,350.61,"--Well, no."
2008.07-1216,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,352.362,360.135,Wouldn't it have been appropriate to -- to hear the -- the issue that they are raising and for you to make the reply that you have just made?
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,360.135,366.955,"--Your Honor, this Court has said repeatedly that adequacy is a Federal law question for this Court to decide."
2008.07-1216,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,366.955,389.904,"I realize it's a Federal law question, and in approaching that question, I keep asking the question which I think I have now put to you three times and have yet to hear an answer on the merits on: Why is it appropriate for us to have a rule here that cuts off the right of a party that properly raised an issue in the Oregon Supreme Court and has yet to be heard on the merits in the Oregon Supreme Court?"
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,389.904,391.62,"Well, there are two reasons."
2008.07-1216,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,431.731,437.818,Maybe -- maybe this Court insufficiently appreciated the significance of the issue which is now before us.
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,454.495,461.667,"Yes, there is a good reason, because this is -- adequacy is ultimately a Federal question for this Court to decide."
2008.07-1216,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.558,473.108,Excuse me.
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,476.026,482.764,"--Whether or not there was an adequate State ground because of the ""correct in all respects"" rule."
2008.07-1216,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.472,495.338,But the State court hadn't ruled on it at that time.
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,495.338,498.007,"That's correct, and--"
2008.07-1216,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,498.007,501.059,So how do we rule on it as a matter of first impression?
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,501.059,513.718,"--Well, because, Your Honor, the Court considered -- just as it did in Sullivan, it considered these issues in the cert papers and then remanded the case for a different issue to be decided by the lower court."
2008.07-1216,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.003,519.203,Did our opinion decide that -- that question?
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,525.443,525.959,No.
2008.07-1216,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,528.661,535.299,How could we have determined it when the Oregon Supreme Court itself hadn't made any determination?
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,535.299,540.453,"Because the parties debated this extensively in their briefs, just as they did in Sullivan."
2008.07-1216,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.453,546.44,"But we don't decide questions, particularly questions of State law, that may have a Federal check."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,588.684,589.45,Yes.
2008.07-1216,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,610.63,636.164,"I suppose one reason -- one reason to think it may not have been decided is that, unlike the other situations you have discussed, it would not have been a bar to our consideration of this case the last time because, just as you raised the question in your second question presented that whether the award complies with due process, we may have thought there might have been an adequate and independent State ground on a procedural question, but we were going to go ahead."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,642.168,654.376,"--Well, Your Honor, if -- if we're not right about the decision resolving the adequacy issue already, we're happy to turn to it now and address it as we do in our briefs."
2008.07-1216,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,663.998,665.034,I want to ask you about that.
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,686.43,695.869,"Well, the trial judge asked, is there any authority that requires me to give this instruction on harm to nonparties?"
2008.07-1216,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,710.229,719.251,"Where in the record is the portion of the colloquy about the instructions most clearly stated in your view, on your side of that issue?"
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,719.251,720.686,--Let's see.
2008.07-1216,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,749.004,750.04,But that's exactly the point I make.
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,756.776,765.399,"Well, she said she just disagreed with the idea that there should be protection against punishment for harm to nonparties."
2008.07-1216,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,770.184,786.563,"Didn't she also say that she was going to give, and ultimately did give an instruction, to the effect that punitive damages are punitive, they are not for the compensation of this person or any other person, and to -- she then turned to Philip Morris's counsel and said: What about that?"
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,788.831,796.334,"--What he was saying when he said okay was: I understand your ruling, and I'm not going to continue to argue a point that I've already lost."
2008.07-1216,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,798.103,799.503,It doesn't sound like much of an objection.
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,799.503,805.107,"--Well, the -- the State courts both held -- both of the appellate courts held our instruction was rejected."
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,814.898,833.527,"But -- but the -- the problem that I am having at the moment is that they did -- from your point of view, is that they -- the other side listed 28 cases in which they said the Oregon courts have followed this rule of the instruction has to be good as a whole."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,884.909,899.802,The -- the reason we say that those 28 cases did not give us reasonable notice that we had to submit a separate piece of paper or change another paragraph in the instruction request is that none of them dealt with a situation where you have separately numbered requests--
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,899.802,903.456,"Well, I mean -- please, I -- I don't want to appear skeptical, but I am."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,936.511,947.45,"--Well, I -- I think so, because the pattern instruction here told both parties to include all their paragraphs pertaining to punitive damages in one numbered instruction, 34."
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,947.45,950.252,"Well, they have some other handbook that says beware of that."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,950.252,951.021,Yes.
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,951.021,959.19,"Because you are going to run into this rule that says if there's any part of a single instruction that is wrong, goodbye, even if the trial judge never mentioned it."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,959.19,962.328,But that handbook came out in 2006.
2008.07-1216,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,982.223,986.36,"I thought the notion was one issue, one charge."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1000.786,1008.273,"Well, the pattern instructions told us to put every point pertaining to punitive damages in Instruction number 34."
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.444,1014.711,"I mean, it would be pretty odd."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1030.639,1035.675,"--Well, you see, the -- the pattern -- the pattern instruction didn't include the due process point."
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1036.127,1038.71,"True, but you could add that to the pattern."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1038.71,1045.648,"--That's what we tried to do, and the judge invited us while dealing with the other side's instruction to go through this one by one."
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1081.655,1089.511,"I'm not speaking of this from the point of view -- I mean I -- when I read that petition for cert, I thought this is a run-around, and I'm not sure that I think that now."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1116.762,1117.545,Well--
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.545,1120.53,"He knows that rule, because there have been a lot of cases on it."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1134.623,1135.356,--Yes.
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1135.356,1138.408,"Now we send it back, so he says: Okay, now I've got to go to the rest of it."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1138.408,1144.496,"You know, Justice Breyer, this is very similar to what was at issue in the Flowers case which reached this Court."
2008.07-1216,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1156.12,1159.906,But I thought that the whole thing about -- this is the NAACP case you that you're discussing?
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1159.906,1160.523,Yes.
2008.07-1216,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1160.523,1169.379,"--that this was something that the Alabama Supreme Court really sprung at the last minute, that it was not like this rule."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1176.467,1185.889,"Well, what -- what the State argued there was that for 60 years the ""correct in all respects"" rule was in effect in Alabama, and they cited dozens of cases applying it."
2008.07-1216,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.15,1206.486,"There was a basis for questioning the good faith of the court in that case, I think."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1206.486,1207.921,--Well--
2008.07-1216,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1207.921,1209.021,And I don't think that's true here.
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1209.021,1220.646,"--I -- I -- we don't question the good faith of the court, but we say that this is pointless severity, a rule that this Court has applied more recently in Lee v. Kemna where there was no issue of bad faith."
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1230.954,1243.011,"The best you have come up with -- and I think you have researched this pretty thoroughly -- and the best you have come up with to find a case where they didn't apply the rule is that George case, right?"
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1272.947,1279.185,"--Well, there is an earlier case that is interesting, State v. Brown, which comes several years before."
2008.07-1216,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1375.598,1390.072,"She didn't get to the -- the other grounds, because I think it was all about that paragraph and whether that paragraph was adequate under our then precedent."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1403.099,1406.2,"--Well, she did look at the illicit profits point."
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.489,1477.814,"The State interest in the rule in general, I take it, is to require the lawyers, if they are going to object to the instructions that the judge is going to give, to produce an instruction that is a correct instruction of the law."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1480.499,1481.382,"--Oh, yes."
2008.07-1216,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1481.382,1490.621,"And -- and you'd better get it right, because if you don't get it right, you're going to lose your ability to claim that the judge was wrong in refusing to give any part of it."
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1498.01,1513.07,"Well, please recall that in both Osborne and in the Lee case, there was a general State purpose of that kind that supported the rule, but the Court said it was an exorbitant or unnecessarily severe application of the rule."
2008.07-1216,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1545.108,1547.743,"Could you just tell me, well, why was it an exercise in futility?"
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1549.276,1554.297,"Oh, because the judge had ruled as a matter of substantive law that she wasn't going to give this instruction."
2008.07-1216,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1556.166,1557.732,But she said she thought it was already covered.
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1560.968,1564.855,"Well, she -- she said that was all she was going to say about the point."
2008.07-1216,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1575.21,1577.329,And where is this colloquy?
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1586.768,1590.803,"Well, I -- I think if -- if you look at the whole colloquy, that's the gist of it."
2008.07-1216,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1592.772,1594.624,You've made it much clearer than it was.
2008.07-1216,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1594.624,1595.874,--Perhaps ----
2008.07-1216,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1628.345,1629.547,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1634.832,1651.143,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court's constitutional mandate in this case is conditioned in several significant respects, and it invites the discretion and judgment of a State court that's applying it."
2008.07-1216,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1680.563,1685.551,"Well, you don't dispute that it's a Federal question whether that procedure is adequate and independent?"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1685.551,1688.502,"--I do not, but I also submit that it is more than adequate."
2008.07-1216,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.131,1735.899,The problem--
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1735.899,1742.553,I would say the 28 cases are not quite as clear as I suggested.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1747.707,1748.441,Well--
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1748.441,1768.003,"In each instance it seemed as if one of two things was the case: Either (a) where the instruction was in error, it really was the matter brought up in the first place, or the court said, but he gave the essence of the instruction he wanted anyway."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1777.143,1786.166,"--I would look first at Reyes-Camarena, which is a 2000 -- a 2000 decision involving the death penalty."
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1817.618,1831.611,"What -- what you can't tell from that is what was the part of the sympathy instruction that they thought was wrong, and was the part that they thought was wrong really part and parcel of the part that the -- that the appellant was complaining about."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1831.611,1841.067,"Well, the court, though, did cite a prior decision that talked about a sympathy instruction and claimed that this one was no different than that."
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.201,1877.592,"Yes, but that's another -- I remember that, because they said on that one -- some floor covering thing, wasn't it, that they had some liability for bad floors or designing the floors wrong--"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1877.592,1878.092,If--
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1878.092,1884.513,"--If that's the case, what they said was: Don't worry about it because basically he did give the instruction that you wanted, though in a different way--"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1884.513,1884.846,--But--
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1884.846,1886.698,"--and besides that, they added--"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1886.698,1887.265,--And besides that--
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1887.265,1888.315,"--Yes, I know you're right."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1888.315,1889.317,--this was an alternate ground.
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1923.621,1931.077,"Well, in the last one, what I have here is that the court said the so-called requested instruction was never requested at all--"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1931.077,1932.111,--But--
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.111,1932.677,--at all.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1932.677,1934.862,--But I do not believe that that was the ground--
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1934.862,1937.13,What is the -- what is the -- I will go look at that again.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,1978.291,1984.861,"--Well, you know, it's -- it's hard to get my arms around your hypothetical, because I don't know the grounds on which--"
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1984.861,2009.744,"I'm just imagining that what has happened is that the instruction that they have given for the defendant in the death case violates Federal law, and then we send it back, and what happens is that the State court says, oh, it may violate Federal law all right, but it's -- the Federal court is blocked from considering it because there are these two other State grounds that mean that the lawyer--"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2009.744,2010.263,--I understand.
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2010.263,2010.763,--Yes.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2011.029,2031.842,"But -- but the question would be then, why would that be a situation like this, where the trial judge -- contrary to your assumption, Justice Ginsburg -- the trial judge did find that there were other parts of the instruction offered by Philip Morris that were incorrect on the law, and the illicit profits was one of them."
2008.07-1216,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.842,2033.659,Why didn't the trial judge just stop there?
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2036.628,2037.663,Justice--
2008.07-1216,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.663,2042.984,"--once the trial judge found that one of the other instructions was bad, he could have just said, I throw the whole thing out."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2048.119,2050.388,--This is -- this is a process.
2008.07-1216,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2077.205,2083.109,You -- you are acknowledging that the trial court did not apply the rule--
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2083.109,2085.561,The -- it's not a rule of trial procedure.
2008.07-1216,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2087.346,2091.381,"Well, I -- yes, that's exactly right."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2111.378,2125.988,"I believe there's -- there's -- first of all, the trial judge rejected this instruction on multiple grounds and made it clear that she -- the illicit profits request was contrary to the Oregon statute that sets up the criteria."
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2193.715,2209.558,Do we give any weight in the case to the fact that the instruction that the Petitioners now request and the rule had not really been announced clearly as of the time of this trial?
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2216.529,2217.73,I don't think it does.
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2217.73,2223.901,But it does -- but it does in our cause and prejudice jurisprudence.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2225.753,2226.569,I understand.
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2226.569,2234.692,"--we say there is an overarching Federal principle that allows -- because of cause and prejudice, we can consider the Federal issue."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2251.885,2260.64,"Well, here's the reason why I think in the context of this record and -- and this litigant, it is not significant."
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2296.498,2303.669,But the trial judge didn't have the benefit of -- of the ruling that this Court has subsequently made on that point.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2309.723,2313.859,But she -- but that's actually not the same issue that she asked that on.
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2361.708,2366.244,"Well, but I -- it sounds to me like that you are confirming my concerns."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2366.244,2366.744,--No.
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2378.552,2379.018,Oh.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2385.639,2386.122,No.
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2398.096,2406.385,"So your -- your contention is, is that this trial court and the counsel in the case had all the guidance necessary to give the correct instruction--"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2406.385,2407.904,--She seemed to accept--
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2407.904,2408.987,--before -- before we even announced the rule?
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2408.987,2421.145,"--She accepted the point before you announced the rule, and the Oregon Court of Appeals, ruling in the Estate of Schwarz case where they offered that one-sentence instruction, reversed the verdict in part because that instruction, they said, should have been given."
2008.07-1216,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2424.281,2444.177,"To move -- to move from the trial court to the appellate court, if you are correct that there's this routine, clear rule of State procedure, why would the appellate court say, in its head, well, I could rely on that, but I want to decide this complicated, difficult rule of Federal constitutional law instead?"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2444.177,2448.362,"--Well, in fact, the -- the court thought it was relying on it."
2008.07-1216,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2465.074,2476.715,So you think we just made a mistake in going ahead and reaching the Federal procedural rule that we reached because it was barred by this adequate and independent State ground that the Oregon courts had relied upon?
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2476.715,2477.498,--No.
2008.07-1216,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2520.76,2521.877,"Well, then I think your--"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2521.877,2522.377,--But--
2008.07-1216,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2522.377,2524.446,"--I think your answer -- go ahead with your ""but""."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2525.579,2526.564,--But then they went on to say:
2008.07-1216,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2555.667,2556.567,"Well, I'm sorry."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2579.283,2596.744,What was not an adequate and independent State ground was their decision that the Oregon statute which permits you to punish a misconduct in order to deter others from doing that allowed punishment for harm to nonparties.
2008.07-1216,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2624.56,2636.117,"I guess I think it's the more routine practice for a court, if you have a -- again, as you argue -- a clear procedural rule that bars addressing the substantive issue, to go ahead and rely on that."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2657.133,2659.866,I think it was natural for the court to do that.
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.691,2698.108,All right.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2762.116,2764.152,I think the easiest way to look at this--
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2764.152,2764.618,Yes.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2764.618,2780.595,"--is imagine that the statute of limitations, which now bars any such suit in Oregon, were brought today, after this Court's decision in Williams, and imagine that Philip Morris is the defendant, and at the end of the trial they offer their number 34 as it was before saying,"
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2819.22,2822.524,"Well, what they say is -- look at the two errors they found."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2853.076,2860.047,"--I would urge you, Justice Breyer, to look at the original case in 1916, the Sorenson case."
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2895.287,2899.274,"--Sorenson was the agent and the principal, the broker who was selling some land."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2899.274,2899.824,Right.
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2899.824,2918.402,"And I think in that case they also said: By the way, you've got basically the instruction that you wanted, and you overlooked -- no, that was the case where they said: You overlooked in your instruction an important allegation of fact, which allegation was that the guy had been rehired as a broker."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2918.402,2927.424,"And there's a similar distinction that makes Osborne irrelevant, which counsel suggested was a -- an exemplar here."
2008.07-1216,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.688,2952.658,"--Mr. Peck, are you -- are you asserting that our remand order was in error?"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2962.197,2967.085,"And I -- I contend, Your Honor, that the--"
2008.07-1216,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2967.085,2968.051,We didn't say it was in error.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2970.787,2972.703,"--Well, I think--"
2008.07-1216,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.703,2977.357,"If you say it's in error, my next question is going to be--"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2977.357,2980.309,--I think the Oregon Supreme Court read that decision--
2008.07-1216,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2980.309,2984.963,--can -- is it up to a State court to sit in judgment about whether our remand orders are in error or not?
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,2984.963,2999.889,"--Well, I'm prepared to say that the Oregon Supreme Court took that remand order to mean that they had to have in place -- this was a procedural due process decision -- that they had to have a procedure that was fair, outcome neutral, applied--"
2008.07-1216,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2999.889,3002.691,"If that's what they took it to mean, they -- they were just wrong."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3004.224,3005.876,"--Well, if you look--"
2008.07-1216,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3005.876,3006.643,"The opinion concludes,"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3018.868,3019.801,--When considering--
2008.07-1216,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.801,3024.338,"""We remand so that the Oregon Supreme Court can apply the standard we have set forth. """
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3027.374,3029.326,--Your Honor--
2008.07-1216,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.326,3030.559,So it was wrong?
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3030.559,3031.942,"--No, it was not wrong."
2008.07-1216,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3061.109,3063.211,"That's very nice, but that's not what we remanded for."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3063.211,3072.4,"--You did not remand for that, but when this Court decides a constitutional issue of one part, it doesn't necessarily tell the court anything different."
2008.07-1216,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3091.147,3115.179,"The -- the problem that I think we all have is how do we guard, in effect, guard against making constitutional decisions which are simply going to be nullified by some clever device raising a procedural issue or an issue of State law when the case goes back?"
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3152.435,3153.054,I believe there is.
2008.07-1216,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3169.897,3172.116,I -- I see the problem.
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3174.218,3177.836,But we do that all the time in cause and prejudice cases.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3178.969,3179.538,--Yes.
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3179.538,3182.49,--because of the importance of the constitutional right.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3182.49,3189.06,"I understand that, but I think the adequate and independent State law ground provides all the protection."
2008.07-1216,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3205.254,3205.72,--Okay.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3209.808,3210.658,Except--
2008.07-1216,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3210.658,3214.426,--by reviewing the good faith of what the court does on remand.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3214.426,3225.5,"--Well, by -- by accepting that if the rule that has been imposed was invoked properly by the party that invoked it at the right time--"
2008.07-1216,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3225.5,3226.217,Yes.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3226.217,3232.154,"--that it is firmly established and regularly followed, then it should satisfy the Court--"
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3232.154,3234.856,But it -- but it serves very little interest.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3256.288,3257.871,--I suggest that it would be different.
2008.07-1216,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3267.41,3273.648,I excluded the Oregon Supreme Court from my list of -- of participants who would have done something differently.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3273.648,3293.545,"--But -- but -- but the fact of the matter is, if after closing arguments, which was the trigger that Philip Morris urged upon this Court for needing this substantive rule, if that -- if after that Philip Morris's counsel had returned to the judge -- you know, they said a few things that we think would tell the jury to punish for harm to others."
2008.07-1216,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3302.8,3308.137,"There is, of course, another way to protect our constitutional authority in this case."

2008.07-1216,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3353.266,3357.32,I'm not asking you to argue here today the second question presented.
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3357.32,3357.687,--I understand.
2008.07-1216,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3357.687,3387.439,"But if we have some concern, that there's something malodorous about the fact that the Oregon Supreme Court waited until the last minute to come up with this rule that was before it all the time, which was a State court rule that you would expect the State court to be addressing as a matter of course, then -- then we -- we can avoid having to address what we do in a situation, having to characterize the nature of that -- that consideration, simply by saying: Look, we are going to go ahead."
2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3392.827,3396.362,"Well, it's -- it's certainly within this Court's power to do that."

2008.07-1216,1,40209,robert_s_peck,,3453.532,3455.651,I believe we had full and adequate briefing.

2008.07-1216,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3569.193,3576.513,What is -- what is your response to the Chief Justice's suggestion that maybe we should reach the issue of due process on the amount?
2008.07-1216,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3576.513,3587.487,"--Well, we wouldn't oppose that because this is clearly excessive under what the Court said in State Farm: Where there is substantial compensatory damages, one to one is something of a norm."
2008.07-1216,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3587.487,3598.193,"I wasn't asking you to argue it either, but I mean I suppose the procedure the parties would prefer, if we were interested in that, would be for us to grant the second question and then have the normal briefing in consideration."
2008.07-1216,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3598.193,3600.812,"Oh, that -- that -- yes, certainly, that -- that -- that is true."
