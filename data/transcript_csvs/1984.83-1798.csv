1984.83-1798,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,44.936,"Mr. Geller, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,44.936,51.027,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1798,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,394.247,411.787,"Mr. Geller, the Congress enacted amendments to Title I in 1978, and some of the legislative reports in connection with that observed that the supplanting regulations lacked sufficient clarity."
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,417.816,420.471,"--Well, Congress did not amend in any way the supplanting provisions."
1984.83-1798,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,442.493,462.736,"Well, if there were two equally plausible constructions, is it appropriate in your view that we might treat this much like a contractual arrangement and say that we are going to apply the most reasonable interpretation?"
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,462.736,472.387,"--Well, in our view, even if there were two reasonable interpretations, the question would still be was the Secretary's interpretation correct?"
1984.83-1798,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.713,480.087,"In other words, what is the more reasonable or most reasonable?"
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,480.087,480.243,Yes.
1984.83-1798,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,489.037,489.631,Right.
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,489.631,499.532,"In that situation, our submission is that the Secretary's recoupment authority is not in any way limited by the fact that the state may have been acting reasonably."
1984.83-1798,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,512.042,518.993,"Mr. Geller, why was the amount reduced in the determination of how much had been misspend?"
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,518.993,520.024,--The amount--
1984.83-1798,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,520.024,522.477,"From some $700,000 to $300,000."
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,522.477,524.46,"--It was seven hundred... yes, it was reduced by the Secretary of Education--"
1984.83-1798,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,524.46,524.631,Why?
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,524.631,532.425,"--from $700,000 to $300,000 because these readiness classes had a smaller student-teacher ratio than in the regular classes."
1984.83-1798,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,536.674,541.031,Are you saying in effect the Secretary simply conceded he had made a mistake and he--
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,541.031,541.578,"--No, no, not at all."
1984.83-1798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.896,568.942,"--Well there was a mistake in the first place, then, in asking for so much."
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,568.942,571.441,"Well, there wasn't a mistake, there was a different--"
1984.83-1798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.441,572.238,"Well, you did--"
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,572.238,574.455,--different calculation of the--
1984.83-1798,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,574.455,576.689,"--Well, you did ask for that much, $700,000."
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,576.689,576.829,"--Well, the--"
1984.83-1798,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,576.829,578.22,We will go on at 1:00 o'clock.
1984.83-1798,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,589.746,590.822,"Mr. Geller, excuse me."
1984.83-1798,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,602.521,603.24,Yes.
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1743.796,1748.217,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1798,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1800.993,1804.772,"Do you say that these provisions were ambiguous, Mr. Chenoweth?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1804.772,1810.988,"Your Honor, yes we are saying that they are and that they were ambiguous."
1984.83-1798,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1810.988,1813.519,Why not get a clarification then?
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1813.519,1831.152,"I think that is a very, very fair question, but the important point concerning that is that you truly have to believe that there is something wrong with your program, something wrong with the way that you are using the law and getting the funds."
1984.83-1798,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1831.652,1837.978,"Well, maybe it would be a splendid program, a beautiful program, but not authorized by the statute."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1849.645,1869.479,"--Yes, Your Honor, we very much agree with that, but the point, while not being in the abstract, is also that we are simply not only looking at what we believe to be facial ambiguity of this law, but really perhaps more importantly than the facial ambiguity, what is meant by supplant, what is meant by supplementing as seen in that law."
1984.83-1798,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1885.443,1895.173,"Tell me, Mr. Chenoweth, were the details of the readiness program given in the initial application for the grant by the state?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1895.173,1900.561,The details of the program as such were not set out in that application.
1984.83-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.813,1995.056,"Well, Mr. Chenoweth, I think there is a significant difference between this case and Pennhurst in that the argument, as I recall, was... that Pennhurst was all about was had the Congress made a particular thing, a condition of the grant of these funds, and the Court ended up saying no, Congress has to speak unambiguously if it is going to make something a condition."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2000.444,2025.932,"Your Honor, I understand what you are saying, but while the words ""supplant"" are in the law, and Kentucky knew that that was in the law, it is not just simply that that condition was in the law, it is how that condition was applied, and therein is the similarity between this case and Pennhurst because we had not in the Commonwealth been given adequate notification as to what that--"
1984.83-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2025.932,2034.945,"Well, but I think there is a significant difference between saying Congress has to speak unambiguously when it makes a particular requirement a condition of a grant."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2050.438,2066.837,"--Well, Your Honor, we do believe, and it is clear in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that the Court was believing that Kentucky had not had adequate notice of its obligations in the same sense as this Court addressed that in Pennhurst."
1984.83-1798,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.337,2070.462,That's why I don't think I agree with the Sixth Circuit on that point.
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2070.462,2071.773,"--Your Honor, we do--"
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2071.773,2072.227,Mr. Chenoweth--
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2072.227,2072.805,"--Yes, ma'am."
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2072.805,2084.69,"--on the same point, it is a little difficult for me to understand why you contend that the statute and regulations are ambiguous or confusing in any way."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2102.792,2113.819,"Justice O'Connor, we believe that in that provision of the law that you are reading, not only does it talk about children, which is a collective reference, first of all--"
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2113.819,2117.708,"Well, it talks in the regulation about the pupils participating in the project."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2119.223,2128.453,"--The provision of the law while, and the regulation while talking about pupils, it also is talking about project area."
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2177.168,2184.337,"Well, can you point to anything in the language of that regulation which I read from that is ambiguous?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2184.337,2189.85,"Your Honor, simply pointing to that, I cannot point to the provision."
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2226.29,2228.819,"Well, the regulation refers to the child."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2228.819,2236.3,"Your Honor, we believe that it also is talking about the project area, and that you look at those together."
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2259.916,2262.945,Is that an estoppel argument of some kind?
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2262.945,2271.006,"Your Honor, we do not believe that it is an estoppel matter any more than the Solicitor General's office has indicated it to be."
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2339.088,2341.227,How soon did Kentucky find that out?
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2341.227,2344.225,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I--"
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2344.225,2349.739,How soon did Kentucky find out that there was not a meeting of the minds?
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2349.739,2355.611,"--Your Honor, we found that out really as the audit was being completed in 1974."
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.782,2364.64,"The basis of that, but to ask when did you try to get an understanding about it?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2364.64,2366.81,Your Honor--
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2366.81,2370.747,When it became ambiguous to you was in '74?
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2370.747,2373.214,--It was not a matter that at that time--
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2373.214,2375.432,Was that when it was ambiguous?
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2375.432,2377.385,--It was not ambiguous.
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.385,2379.445,Was it beginning to be ambiguous?
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2379.445,2381.147,"Your Honor, the ambiguity--"
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2381.147,2388.176,"My question is, when did you first let anybody know that you considered it to be ambiguous?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2388.176,2394.314,"--Your Honor, the answer to that, and the only answer that I can give to you is that it was not at a particular point in time."
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2397.673,2398.173,About when?
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2398.173,2399.922,"--There's... there's no way really to answer that, Your Honor."
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2399.922,2401.748,"Well, it was a little before today wasn't it?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2401.748,2402.951,Certainly that's true.
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2439.75,2448.059,"Well, then, I misunderstood your original answer, was that in '74 you realized that they were ambiguous."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2448.059,2462.662,"Your Honor, we found out that was so in the sense we were told after the audit that what our program had been doing and the manner in which that program had been developed, that there was a problem with the law as seen by the auditors."
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2496.961,2499.039,"Well, I thought you said there was a problem in '74."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2499.039,2501.647,"But this is... that was after the fact, Your Honor."
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.395,2507.003,'74 is not after the fact of what you are arguing now.
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2507.003,2527.666,"--Your Honor, the important point that we are trying to make here is that we believe we had a program that was consistent with the law, and that we do believe that there is considerable moment in the fact that there were operational review teams that did come in on a yearly basis to Kentucky."
1984.83-1798,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2568.12,2568.932,Aren't you now arguing estoppel?
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2568.932,2571.572,"Your Honor, we are not arguing estoppel."
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2599.06,2628.423,"Well, Mr. Chenoweth, I suppose that the program itself, operationally, in the sense of providing smaller classroom settings for children within an appropriate project area, children who qualified for the aid, is something that the federal government would want to examine in any event, and did, and the question of whether the state had reduced its level of support for those children is a different question, is it not?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2628.423,2638.373,"--Yes, we believe that is a different question, but also is a part of the consideration of the design of that program."
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2646.353,2657.161,"Well, certainly the federal government could have picked up its alleged problem earlier than it did, but do you think that that alone means that no recovery can be had?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2657.161,2693.521,"Not alone, Your Honor, but we do believe importantly in looking at the way the Sixth Circuit in reviewing this issue which we believe is the pertinent issue, and that is what the understanding of the commitments were by Kentucky in the receipt of those Title I funds, that that was a factor, that Kentucky had had the operational people in looking at the design, and they had not been told that there was anything wrong with those programs, and we believe that was a part of the good faith of the Commonwealth concerning these self-contained readiness programs."
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2693.521,2709.906,"Well, good faith is not normally a defense either to the application of an appropriate federal statute or regulation of this type or, if you treated it as a contract, to a defense under a contract theory, is it?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2709.906,2715.202,"As a pure contract theory, no, we would agree with that, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2834.183,2843.587,"You are not now arguing that the mere fact that the state continued to supply the same amount of money would demonstrate that there was no supplanting, are you?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2843.587,2850.397,"Your Honor, we are not saying that any of these matters as a sole factor show the point."
1984.83-1798,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2850.397,2862.282,"For example, if they shifted all the money they... all their first and second grade teachers into the higher grades and reduced the ratios in the higher grades and then financed first and second grade entirely with federal money, you would say that would be a clear violation?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2862.282,2868.093,"Your Honor, I think that that is obviously a different situation, and yes, that would be supplanting--"
1984.83-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3083.458,3084.896,You mean a changed construction.
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,3084.896,3085.473,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1984.83-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.473,3087.8,A change in the construction.
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,3087.8,3089.128,A change in the construction.
1984.83-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.128,3090.425,Was there any change here?
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,3090.425,3094.22,We believe that there was a change in the construction--
1984.83-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.22,3095.923,"Well, not by the secretary."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,3095.923,3103.168,"--Well, there was not an explanation of what the construction of the supplanting law was--"
1984.83-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.168,3110.603,"Well, this may... this... at most here, this was the first time that the construction was ever spelled out."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,3117.538,3119.741,"--Yes, Your Honor, and we believe that--"
1984.83-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.741,3121.661,That's not a change.
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,3121.661,3125.082,"--Well, it certainly is a change from what Kentucky--"
1984.83-1798,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.082,3129.111,"It's from a change, it is a change with respect to what you thought it meant."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,3129.111,3131.533,"--Yes, and we think that that's very important."
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3198.865,3213.016,"Well, now, without looking at a retroactive change at all, just looking at the statute and the regulations as they existed, can't they be enforced in the way in which they were written at the time the grant was made?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,3213.016,3221.464,We do not believe that the interpretation that has been placed upon them by the Secretary in this decision--
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3221.464,3229.882,"Well, as an abstract matter, would you agree they can be applied as they were written when the grant was made, in the abstract?"
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,3231.648,3241.425,"--In the abstract, Justice O'Connor, the pertinent question still has to be what did Kentucky understand its commitments to be under this contract?"
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3308.538,3315.006,"You know, I just really am troubled by your insistence on the repetition of the word ""retroactive""."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,3320.206,3339.73,"--Your Honor, we believe that the Secretary is applying a construction of the statute and his interpretation of the statute and the level by which that was going to be considered, he is applying that retroactively, and only by doing that could there be a recoupment of the expended Title I funds."
1984.83-1798,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3345.507,3358.894,"Well, the agreement itself, of course, if you wanted to treat it as a contract, provides that if the regulatory requirements aren't met, that the federal government may require reimbursement."
1984.83-1798,1,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,3358.894,3385.695,"Yes, Your Honor, but a part of that is going to be that Kentucky had a notice of what those obligations were going to be, and it is our contention that Kentucky did not have adequate notice of those obligations in keeping with Pennhurst, and that therefore it would not be reasonable to have this recoupment of already-expended Title I dollars that would have to be paid for out of Kentucky general tax dollars."
1984.83-1798,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3404.766,3408.717,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Geller?"
1984.83-1798,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3408.717,3411.404,"Unless the Court has any questions, I don't have anything."
1984.83-1798,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3411.404,3416.855,"Let me just ask you one... it is in the brief, I know, but would you state again for me the standard for which you contend?"
1984.83-1798,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3416.855,3419.822,Is the legal standard that the Court--
1984.83-1798,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3419.822,3420.041,Yes.
1984.83-1798,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3420.041,3421.977,--This is a review of an administrative order.
1984.83-1798,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3421.977,3423.164,So it is an arbitrary and capricious?
1984.83-1798,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3423.164,3426.429,"It is more contrary... well, it is the Administrative Procedure Act."
1984.83-1798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3461.571,3471.894,"So you would say the normal rule should be followed that if the Secretary's interpretation of the statute is a reasonable one, we should accept it."
1984.83-1798,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3471.894,3472.863,That is correct.
1984.83-1798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3472.863,3474.518,Even in a grant program.
1984.83-1798,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3474.518,3476.518,Even in a grant program.
1984.83-1798,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3478.767,3483.265,"Well, and even if you didn't, you still would reach the result for which you are--"
1984.83-1798,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3483.265,3486.763,"--Well, because I think, as you correctly stated, there is really no ambiguity here."
1984.83-1798,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3488.028,3488.966,"Thank you, gentlemen."
