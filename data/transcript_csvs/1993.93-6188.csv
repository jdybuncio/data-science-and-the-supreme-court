1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.873,"We'll hear argument next in 93-6188, Roy Heck v. James Humphrey."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,53.948,60.523,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,75.595,82.483,"Let me ask you, if I may, Mr. Rothfeld, about the theory under which your case was brought under 1983."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,91.604,98.461,"It is focused on acts that took place during the course of the investigation leading up to the trial, so it does not focus on any particular trial event."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,100.726,119.421,"And is it logical to say that if your client were to win his case, that still would not, under some sort of collateral estoppel doctrine, vitiate the judgment of conviction?"
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,119.421,124.247,"Well, I think, Your Honor, it quite clearly would not vitiate the judgment of conviction for a number of reasons."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,155.672,156.235,Is this--
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,161.076,168.369,--One claim that's made in this case is that exculpatory evidence or potentially exculpatory evidence was destroyed by law enforcement investigators.
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.507,180.349,"But that really does have a bearing on the trial, doesn't it?"
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,188.142,194.094,"Well, there are a variety of ways in which a damages claim can proceed, apart from the use of the evidence of trial."
1993.93-6188,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,205.12,208.354,Could it be asking for consequential damages for false imprisonment?
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,208.354,208.995,--Well--
1993.93-6188,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,208.995,209.697,Wrongful imprisonment?
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,209.697,214.305,"--There are, I suppose, two types of other damages that could be involved, Justice Souter."
1993.93-6188,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,230.969,233.219,"Well, let's just stick to the first category."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,234.545,236.341,"I think they could claim that, Your Honor."
1993.93-6188,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,236.341,243.996,"Well, if they did claim them, then it really would go to the heart of the lawfulness of the imprisonment and conviction."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,243.996,246.979,"Well, there are several observations, I think, to make in response to that."
1993.93-6188,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,268.813,285.447,"No, but in... if that's the... if the answer turns out to be that there would have been no conviction and there is being a claim... and a claim is being made for consequential damages, then the State, in that case, is faced with the possibility of sitting back and doing nothing and letting the damages pile up or letting the person go."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,285.447,286.509,Well--
1993.93-6188,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,286.509,295.318,"And I suppose if the damages amount to anything in substance, the State is going to say we'd better get this guy out of here before he costs us any more money."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,295.318,307.907,"--Well, that would be a practical decision that the State would have to make, Your Honor, but in terms of whether or not exhaustion is required, which is the question here, I think that the Court has to look at the principles that are served, the policies that are served by the habeas exhaustion requirement."
1993.93-6188,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.907,310.421,"Mr. Rothfeld, what about just looking to normal tort principles."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,372.568,372.897,Well--
1993.93-6188,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.897,373.537,That's just normal tort law.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,373.537,380.269,"--I think, Your Honor... and, first of all, that argument has not been suggested at any point during the course of this litigation, but I think, in any event, that suggestion goes to the merits of the claim."
1993.93-6188,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,387.03,393.028,"Well, it goes... but it goes also to just standard questions of respect for the validity of outstanding judgments."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,398.011,399.541,"--Well, I think--"
1993.93-6188,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,399.541,405.195,And yet you're contending that you can ask for damages for the enforcement of that judgment.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,412.271,414.942,"--Well, let me give you two responses to that, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-6188,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,432.497,434.136,"Well, I suppose... excuse me."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,459.673,475.604,"No, I understand that suggestion, Justice Kennedy, but I think, first of all, there are other claims which are presented in this case, claims for... as we read the complaint, and it is a pro se complaint which is not written artfully, but as we understand it, it asks for nominal damages and punitive damages, as well as this aspect of compensatory damages."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,503.733,505.905,What if it wasn't adjudicated but could have been adjudicated?
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,505.905,519.274,"If it was not adjudicated, Your Honor, the question would be one of collateral estoppel rather than res judicata or the new more fashionable terminology of issue preclusion rather than claim preclusion, because there are actually different parties involved in the litigation."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,530.347,539.064,"Yes, but surely if you claim that there was a destruction of evidence by the State and which violated the Constitution, that could have been raised at trial."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,539.064,550.684,"--That could have been raised at trial, Your Honor, that's true, but if the question is one of issue preclusion, the rule to be followed is... in a case like this, because it's a State judgment which is at issue, one would look to the preclusion law of the State."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,559.133,561.461,And why do you say the parties are different here?
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,561.461,568.66,"The State of Indiana was, of course, the party adverse to petitioner in the criminal case."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,576.72,582.483,"Well, are you so sure that that wouldn't... that that wouldn't be treated as the same parties, for issue preclusion?"
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,582.483,585.748,"I think this is an issue which is debated in the briefs, Your Honor."
1993.93-6188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,593.354,596.665,"Suppose the State is paying the counsel fees, providing counsel."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,601.241,605.285,"--Let me give you several answers to that question, Justice O'Connor."
1993.93-6188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,607.097,608.925,Ginsburg.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,608.925,610.111,"--Oh, excuse me, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-6188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,648.846,650.143,In control of the litigation.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,650.143,653.969,In control of the litigation is one of the factors that the Court has indicated is relevant.
1993.93-6188,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,673.509,676.867,"Of course, you could say the same thing in all the malicious prosecution cases."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,700.076,709.823,"--Well, certainly, to prevail on the merits the petitioner would have to show that his incarceration is unlawful in the sense that he would not have been convicted but for the happening of the constitutional violation--"
1993.93-6188,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.823,714.524,"No, no, in malicious prosecution you don't get into the courthouse."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,732.969,738.294,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that is, again, a question that would go to the merits that would govern this type of litigation."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,738.294,746.916,"Well, I don't think, Mr. Rothfeld, you can separate... you can have this very narrow jurisdictional analysis that you're trying to limit it to, as opposed to the merits."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,755.6,758.677,"Well, I think there are several points, Justice... Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,785.806,791.789,Neither of those cases involved attacks or what could be attacks on judgments of conviction.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,791.789,796.709,"--That's true, Your Honor, but for purposes of the habeas policies, the Court held quite expressly in Preiser--"
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.709,803.674,It didn't... it couldn't have held with respect to judgments of convictions since those were not involved in either of them.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,803.674,825.821,"--No, that is true, Your Honor, but the Court did hold in Preiser that... in response to the argument that actually had been made by the prisoners in that case, that habeas policies were concerned only with judgments of conviction rather than with the length of a sentence, that both concerns were equally close to what the Court called the core of habeas corpus and that that was the basis for the Court's conclusion that exhaustion was necessary, in Preiser."
1993.93-6188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,838.958,855.918,"Well, hasn't every court of appeals that's considered this decided that the State prisoner cannot bring a section 1983 damages action to challenge the constitutionality of the conviction, in effect?"
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,855.918,857.933,"I don't think that's quite true, Justice O'Connor."
1993.93-6188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,859.136,867.352,"They seem to be pretty uniform, and I thought in Tower against Glover, which I don't believe you cited, we reserved the question."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,867.352,873.88,"--Well, the Court reserved the question in Tower, Your Honor, and said it had... didn't have to express an opinion on the subject, which was quite clearly true in Tower."
1993.93-6188,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,921.253,926.329,"Mr. Rothfeld, may I leave theory for a moment and ask you a question about practical effect."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,965.922,970.873,"--As you indicate, Justice Souter, it would turn on the content of the State postconviction rules."
1993.93-6188,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,970.873,971.264,Yeah.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,971.264,978.51,"Clearly, in this case the Seventh Circuit thought that there was a postconviction proceeding that could provide relief of some sort to the petitioner in this case."
1993.93-6188,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,988.304,990.287,It'll be... won't that be true in most cases?
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,992.459,995.567,That probably is the general rule.
1993.93-6188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1013.949,1018.119,What was the... what was the proceeding in this case that was thought to be available by the Seventh Circuit?
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1018.119,1019.915,"Well, the Seventh Circuit didn't identify what it had in mind."
1993.93-6188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1047.451,1050.903,Is there anything that could come up in habeas.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1073.644,1081.282,"That certainly would be true in most cases, because whenever there has been a constitutional violation, there will be at least nominal damages available as a remedy."
1993.93-6188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1097.416,1101.148,"But if you're right, then wouldn't this make a massive change."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1116.361,1120.047,--It would permit a prisoner to go immediately into Federal court.
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.28,1173.275,"Well, Mr. Rothfeld, in Tower, which Justice O'Connor referred to, there is an express statement that we have not decided this point yet, and it also refers to Preiser."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1177.555,1178.914,"--That's true, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.094,1211.525,"So that insofar as holdings are concerned, we really haven't decided this question, that is whether a 1983 damages action which would amount to a collateral challenge to judgment of conviction could proceed?"
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1211.525,1216.523,"Well, I think that in terms... the question should be separated into two parts, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1245.714,1254.711,"Well, you don't agree, then, with the statement in Tower that we have never decided whether 1983 could proceed without exhaustion?"
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1254.711,1261.115,"I think that... I will have to say that I think that that does not take into account the decision in Wolff, which was not cited--"
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.115,1263.989,"Well, why didn't you cite Tower in your brief?"
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1263.989,1270.908,"--I think that all that Tower does, Your Honor, is indicate that the Court is not going to express an opinion on the subject, which was clearly what the Court meant to do in Tower."
1993.93-6188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1307.018,1325.183,"Mr. Roth, under your theory, if you can proceed first in section 1983 suit for damages, I assume the petitioner would not then have any issue preclusion against him if he subsequently sought habeas?"
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1325.183,1326.775,That is correct.
1993.93-6188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1330.195,1331.82,"Well, even if he lost that 1983--"
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1331.82,1332.336,If he loses--
1993.93-6188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1332.336,1338.13,"--He can go right into Federal habeas and make claims all over again, based on the same facts, I assume."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1338.13,1346.33,"--Well, he would have to... before he could go into Federal habeas, he would have to exhaust his State remedies, if any are available, and at that point he would go into Federal court and litigate the question."
1993.93-6188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1354.857,1355.248,Why?
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1358.34,1360.074,"I would think, Your Honor, if the issue is--"
1993.93-6188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1360.074,1365.448,I thought there were cases holding that there isn't any issue preclusion there.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1365.448,1368.071,--In a subsequent habeas.
1993.93-6188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1368.071,1368.274,Uh-hum.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1368.274,1372.991,"In a subsequent Federal habeas action he would, yes, but in a subsequent State post-conviction proceeding... maybe I... I misunderstood your question."
1993.93-6188,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.49,1379.443,I've lost the exchange here.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1385.003,1387.393,--If he exhausts the State remedies--
1993.93-6188,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.393,1388.393,"Yes, and loses."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1388.393,1393.906,"--And loses, I think he would be estopped... and he litigates the question, he would be estopped in a subsequent 1983 action."
1993.93-6188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1413.1,1426.924,"Why shouldn't it work the other way, that if you litigate and lose in 1983 on the same issue, you should lose it... I mean why isn't that Federal adjudication just as good as the State adjudication would have been, if you--"
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1426.924,1427.313,"It is, Your Honor."
1993.93-6188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1428.22,1434.327,--So then you're changing the answer you just gave to Justice O'Connor saying you would be subject to issue preclusion.
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1434.327,1443.541,"--You would be subject to issue... my answer to Justice O'Connor... maybe I've confused the point, but my answer to Justice O'Connor is that in the State proceeding you are subject to issue preclusion."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.251,1472.155,"Well, you say issue of preclusion isn't applied in Federal habeas."
1993.93-6188,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1481.744,1487.539,"I'm referring, Your Honor, to the nonpreclusive effect of a State court judgment."
1993.93-6188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1500.722,1502.253,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1505.298,1508.437,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-6188,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1543.985,1550.295,"Well, that may be true as a general rule, but why should it be true in a Fourth Amendment case when there is a practical matter?"
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1559.855,1568.319,"--We believe that Fourth Amendment issues, assuming that they actually attack the legality of the conviction, should require exhaustion."
1993.93-6188,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1581.032,1588.42,"So in Fourth Amendment cases you're resting it not on the habeas exhaustion requirement, but on an independent rule of comity."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1588.42,1589.982,Exactly.
1993.93-6188,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1619.017,1628.357,"But the rule of comity, in effect, would enact an exhaustion requirement for 1983 which is not required by habeas policy?"
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1628.357,1629.623,That is correct.
1993.93-6188,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1639.385,1660.048,"Well, I'm not concerned about what the States may do, but, I mean, it seems to me that your strongest argument is, as a general rule leaving aside the particular claim involved, that if you don't, in effect, have the rule that you want, you in effect are allowing an end run to be made in the habeas exhaustion rules."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1672.043,1673.23,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-6188,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1673.23,1673.511,Okay.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1686.646,1688.27,That is correct.
1993.93-6188,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1694.111,1695.033,What was my first theory?
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1697.314,1706.795,"--That if a State prisoner can do an end run around section 2254, that that ought not be allowed, and therefore to the extent that 2254--"
1993.93-6188,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1706.795,1709.012,"Yeah, but that doesn't apply here because of Stone."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1709.012,1714.932,"--We believe it does apply here, because... and this is a matter in the record."
1993.93-6188,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1719.446,1720.476,I thought he was.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1720.476,1723.053,"He is not, and let me refer to you to his complaint."
1993.93-6188,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1771.002,1773.376,"Well, that doesn't mean he wouldn't complain about it."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1775.735,1784.622,"That's possible too, but we believe the plain language of this complaint, where he says between July... May and July of 1987, and then he goes on to complain about conduct."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1794.821,1800.46,I'm curious about your statement about being barred by limitations with regard to the second issue in the case.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1808.846,1823.731,"Justice Stevens, in this case Indiana's tolling rule is really quite clear, that where the initiation of an action cannot proceed until another action is completed, that first action is tolled."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.731,1830.807,"Well, then... then you've given us an incorrect answer with respect to these allegations because these are not barred by the limitations."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1830.807,1833.931,"No, I don't believe that's correct."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1834.665,1836.07,You can't have it both ways.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1836.07,1840.599,"--No, we... his section 1983 action would not be tolled."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.193,1843.832,Because it would be tolled.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1843.832,1846.362,This action would be tolled--
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.362,1847.455,Because--
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1847.455,1848.658,"--This action, the 1983 action would be tolled."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1868.744,1873.148,--So he has... I'm a little puzzled.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1881.771,1884.692,That is correct.
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1885.83,1893.016,"But if he had not filed any complaint at all, but waited until he set aside his conviction and then filed a complaint, it would have been tolled."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1893.016,1893.796,--No.
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.448,1910.837,"Well, wouldn't it depend if the search was alleged to have infected his conviction?"
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1920.24,1932.249,"I think there would be in that case, because then the injury... if the search was never introduced... excuse me, if the evidence was never introduced."
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.249,1932.499,Yeah.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1932.499,1934.577,"Then, presumably, the injury--"
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.577,1935.81,Was the search.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1935.81,1938.747,--Would occur in 1986.
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1938.747,1945.995,"Then it would be... it would be... there's no basis for saying that he had to bring a habeas action first, and therefore it would be time barred."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1945.995,1946.791,That's correct.
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.791,1947.509,Okay.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1960.848,1963.269,No.
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.608,1979.027,"Yeah, but you... but you still... don't you argue that the exhaustion requirement applies and that he has to go to habeas first, no?"
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1979.027,1981.199,"Yes, we do, that's correct."
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.199,1983.26,Why is that?
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,1999.098,2002.081,"If he says that in his 1983 action, then he need not exhaust."
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.081,2003.829,"Then he doesn't have to exhaust, okay, right."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2003.829,2006.422,"Because he then is not, by definition, attacking the legality of his conviction."
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.422,2010.796,"Well, what if he doesn't say it, but it's really a close question?"
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2010.796,2011.92,If it's really a close--
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.92,2016.309,"Do we assume that it did infect the conviction, or do we look into the facts?"
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2016.309,2031.46,"--I believe... our position is that if you cannot tell, the burden here should rest on the State prisoner, because of the really quite serious effects that allowing this kind of short circuiting around State judicial remedies would have."
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2041.048,2045.0,What harmful effects?
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2078.55,2100.274,"I believe the harm is this, and that is that if the 1983 court would decide an issue that must be decided in a later proceeding seeking his release, then at that point the State court has been denied the initial opportunity to decide an issue of whether his conviction is proper or not, and it's confined--"
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2100.274,2101.821,"Well, you say... you say that there's issue preclusion."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2106.055,2109.459,"--It is possible that the State court would be denied, would be bound."
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.459,2111.927,"Well, let's decide now whether it does or doesn't, I mean."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2111.927,2113.52,You cannot decide right now.
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.084,2164.249,"I don't... why should we make this prisoner exhaust simply because the State voluntarily chooses to cause itself to be bound by the... I mean if it's an automatic issue preclusion thing, it seems to me you have a strong case."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2178.837,2184.007,We don't believe that's an acceptable answer here for a couple of reasons.
1993.93-6188,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2240.514,2245.982,"Mr. Gutwein, there's one point that you made a little bit earlier, and I wanted to make sure I understood it properly."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2275.454,2287.964,"Let me offer one caveat that exists in every tolling provision, and even in the State provision, and that is that tolling does not apply where the prisoner, in this case, does not act diligently."
1993.93-6188,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2308.83,2315.39,"You know, I bring this up because it's done routinely when States dismiss a case for forum nonconvenience."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2352.423,2354.312,"No objection whatsoever, Your Honor."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.186,2399.841,May I ask a question on that relief.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2423.581,2424.955,"Yes, he could."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.955,2425.69,He could.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2425.69,2429.047,"Because that loss of property would not, in any way, be an attack on the legality of his conviction."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2429.047,2436.997,"Even though the proof... say that the allegations he would prove would, incidentally, also demonstrate that the conviction is improper."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2439.559,2440.106,"Sure, yeah."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2458.412,2464.362,Even though he has one count in his complaint for damages that are totally unrelated to his conviction.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2464.362,2466.971,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2498.192,2500.16,"Well, he could have dependents who could use the money."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2507.611,2507.861,That is true.
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.041,2525.26,Yes.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2548.782,2570.771,"The reason why is because of the potential for short circuiting the State processes in that case; that the value, the comity values that both Congress and this Court have repeatedly emphasized, that it is critical in our judicial system that State courts have the initial opportunity to decide these issues."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.064,2631.779,"What about a case in which he alleges that he was brutalized in obtaining a confession from him, and he wants just damages covering the pain and suffering of going through the beating, and that's all he asks for, but, again, it might show that the confession... you know, the conviction should be--"
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2631.779,2632.029,--Exactly.
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.56,2633.917,"--He'd still have to wait there too, wouldn't he?"
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2633.917,2635.386,"--I believe that's an easier case, that's right."
1993.93-6188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.023,2653.161,"What if he said, nevertheless the confession was true, so I really am guilty, but I still want damages for the beating I took, what about that case?"
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2653.161,2654.347,It would go right to Federal court.
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2661.704,2664.219,Who does he make... who does he give that assurance to?
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2675.948,2679.118,In a variety of manners.
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.395,2690.645,But it was true.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2723.647,2730.44,"In that case, then I believe that he ought to exhaust."
1993.93-6188,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2730.44,2736.47,Isn't it true generally that a judicial admission in one case doesn't carry over to the next?
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2746.185,2751.027,I'm not sure that's the rule.
1993.93-6188,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2864.7,2871.01,"Well, how does that practical consideration transfer into the theory that you want us to adopt in this case?"
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2887.16,2888.674,There are two separate--
1993.93-6188,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2888.674,2889.909,--That is that sweeping?
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2889.909,2896.469,--We don't believe that that's... there are two separate grounds for our theory.
1993.93-6188,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2914.588,2918.382,"Well, I'm wondering if those might not go even beyond attacking the legality of a conviction."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,2938.435,2940.482,"--That is correct, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-6188,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3059.45,3068.993,"You'd have none of those problems if you agreed to stipulate that you won't raise this statute of limitations if the plaintiff ever sues you again on this claim, with reasonable diligence."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,3068.993,3078.754,"--We establish the mortgage... that gets rid of the mortgage problem, but that does not get rid of the fact that Federal courts have to work hard to get rid of these nonmeritorious cases off of its docket."
1993.93-6188,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3079.222,3090.811,"I thought you agreed that that would be all right, that you would stipulate to a dismissal without prejudice, conditioned on your not raising the statute of limitations should the plaintiff come back to court after exhaustion."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,3090.811,3091.202,--That's correct.
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3092.452,3095.341,You'd be happy... you're not stipulating that we have authority to impose it.
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,3095.341,3096.965,"No, that's correct."
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.965,3103.697,"I mean, it's done in forum nonconvenience cases because that is an equitable doctrine, after all."
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,3103.697,3105.134,That's true.
1993.93-6188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3105.134,3108.195,"But you're claiming that you have a right to dismissal without that stipulation, aren't you?"
1993.93-6188,1,35948,matthew_r_gutwein,,3108.195,3111.85,"A 12(b)(6) dismissal, that is correct, we have a right to that dismissal."
1993.93-6188,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3130.046,3131.546,"Thank you, Mr. Gutwein."
1993.93-6188,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3133.748,3136.169,"A couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-6188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3199.408,3205.297,"Well, why not apply kind of an analogy of Rose against Lundy and say that if there's doubt about the thing, dismiss."
1993.93-6188,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3205.297,3208.654,"--Well, I think there's no justification for that, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1993.93-6188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3295.509,3303.288,"It's also an equitable proceeding so that we have... I mean it's a prerogative writ, so we have much more discretion, traditionally, in refusing to grant the petition."
1993.93-6188,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3303.288,3308.879,"--That is also true, Justice Scalia, which is a reason why habeas should be differentiated from section 1983."
1993.93-6188,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3348.316,3358.5,"Is the essence of your argument this is just like the old days when you had a claim at law or a claim for specific relief in equity, you could pick which one you want?"
1993.93-6188,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3358.5,3361.841,"Well, I think that's right, Justice Ginsburg... and I'll get the name right this time."
1993.93-6188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3382.054,3391.611,"But, what if you were to be asked to stipulate that you can proceed if you would agree not to urge any issue preclusion or res judicata in any subsequent habeas?"
1993.93-6188,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3391.611,3397.342,"Since we think that there would not be any such preclusion, I think that that would be fine with the prisoner."
1993.93-6188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3398.937,3400.466,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
