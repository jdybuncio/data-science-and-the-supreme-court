2014.13-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,14.591,"We'll hear argument in Case Number 13895, Alabama Legislative Black Caucus in Alabama -- v. Alabama, and Case 131138, the Alabama Democratic Conference v. Alabama."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,15.343,17.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,62.321,81.299,"So you want, on the one hand -- they obviously had to move new voters into the majority-minority districts because they were all underpopulated, and they need to move enough so that the minorities have an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice, but they can't move too many because that would be packing, correct?"
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,81.299,90.589,"Your Honor, we understand that States are in a bind in this situation as has been true under Title VII and under the Voting Rights Act under Section 2."
2014.13-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,90.589,91.841,So -- but they have to do that.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,98.145,100.263,They don't have to hit a sweet pot -- spot.
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,113.604,125.328,"Well, I thought the Section 5 obligation, gee, it -- it used to require that there that there be no regression in -- in -- in majority black districts."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,131.899,139.155,"Your Honor, Section 5 has always required no retrogression based on the ability to elect under current conditions."
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.155,139.588,Right.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,139.588,142.007,So if there's no racially polarized voting--
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.007,143.957,And -- and they're saying that's all we did.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,163.453,170.274,"--Your Honor, retrogression has never meant merely reproducing racial statistics purely for their own sake."
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.161,183.417,"Oh, you can say that, but it meant you're -- the only way to be sure you're not doing that is maintaining the same -- the same percentage."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,187.985,196.408,"It may be in the first decade or so of the application of Section 5, DOJ employed various kind of practices as you described."
2014.13-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,233.783,234.566,Why is that?
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,235.016,236.818,They reduced districts down to 56 percent.
2014.13-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,236.818,237.668,--Why is that?
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,247.024,254.18,For the reasons that this Court adverted to in Shelby County and the reasons that Alabama rightly celebrates in its briefs.
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.636,273.258,"You realize, I assume, that you're -- you're making the argument that the opponents of black plaintiffs used to make here."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,296.54,297.124,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,313.168,331.53,Suppose -- suppose there are Party A in 2001 takes minorities out of heavily minority districts and puts them into opportunity districts for political purposes.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,334.965,335.532,--Uh-huh.
2014.13-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,335.532,340.303,Party B then gets into power ten years later.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,352.276,352.843,There's no--
2014.13-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,352.843,358.014,And its -- and -- its and we'll stipulate that its motive is simply to help its partisan balance--
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,358.014,358.53,--If they--
2014.13-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,358.53,359.699,--or partisan imbalance.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,359.699,365.686,"--If they do not use racial classifications, if they do not use excessive racial means to do it--"
2014.13-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,365.686,366.053,"No, no, they -- they do."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,371.507,372.374,--Right.
2014.13-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,379.261,381.38,"In both of my hypotheticals, it's partisan."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,383.748,389.735,"If it's purely partisan in motive and they don't use race, then there's no problem."
2014.13-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,389.735,393.353,"No, but -- but they do use race, but it's purely partisan."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,413.417,414.684,"Your Honor, the--"
2014.13-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.684,420.855,"Are you going to tell me -- is it your position, and I think it may be your position, that in the first case it's permitted and the second case it isn't?"
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,420.855,421.773,"--No, Your Honor."
2014.13-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.36,434.847,Was it unjust -- was it unjustified in -- in -- in Case A when they were trying to have more minority opportunity districts?
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,434.847,452.642,"--If they exceeded their obligations under Section 2 and Section 5, if they went beyond the limited leeway this Court has said that States have, if they have the strong basis in evidence that's required, if they properly interpret the Act, that's the legitimate path States have that this Court has marked out."
2014.13-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.642,454.078,Did they do this for partisan purposes?
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,454.078,455.778,Your Honor--
2014.13-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,455.778,463.7,"And I'm asking if Party B can then undo it for partisan purposes, because I sense that there's a one-way ratchet here."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,463.7,466.469,"--I don't think that's correct, Your Honor, and I understand the concern."
2014.13-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,503.658,509.646,"Well, you began by -- by criticizing Alabama for supposedly imposing quotas."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,515.665,516.651,"Your Honor, right--"
2014.13-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,516.651,522.303,"So if you -- if they want to keep it at 70 percent, that's that may be illegitimate in your view."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,532.509,533.642,--We don't have to use the word “ quota ”.
2014.13-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,533.642,534.527,"Well, why did you use it?"
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,534.527,537.146,I actually meant to use the word “ racial targets ”.
2014.13-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,538.879,540.181,You think there's a difference between the two?
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,540.181,546.084,"--Well, there's a lot of rhetorical and inflammatory power in the word “ quota ”."
2014.13-895,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,554.522,559.759,"So that's to Justice Kennedy's question, I thought your answer would be there isn't a one-way ratchet."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,562.361,563.194,If you're use--
2014.13-895,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,563.194,571.4,"Doesn't Cromartie 2 say if you're doing this for political reasons, because many, many African-Americans vote Democrat, all right?"
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,591.83,592.997,"--Yes, you're right."
2014.13-895,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,593.499,593.865,Right.
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.219,601.753,And it's valid in both 13 in both cases.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,603.021,603.238,--If--
2014.13-895,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,603.238,606.823,"--That's not our case because our case, they don't try to defend on that ground."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,606.823,607.09,--Right.
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.172,632.274,You don't -- I thought you agreed with Justice Breyer.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,632.274,633.107,I do--
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.107,639.628,"But now you're saying you cannot use race as a proxy for political affiliation, but that was his hypothetical--"
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,639.628,640.38,--I thought--
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.38,644.765,--that these people were moved because blacks overwhelmingly vote Democrat.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,644.765,645.715,--Your Honor--
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,645.715,648.634,You're saying that's bad if that's the reason they move them.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,650.169,657.84,--I understood Justice Breyer to be describing the situation in which you're moving people because they're Democrats.
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.227,666.861,"No, you're moving them because they're black, and you think blacks will overwhelmingly vote Democrat."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,673.184,682.457,"--Your Honor, in this area, the Court has said that assumptions like that cannot be the basis of the way district lines are drawn or the way people are classified by race."
2014.13-895,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,682.457,684.659,"Mr. Pildes, because -- because your time is running out--"
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,684.659,685.209,Yes.
2014.13-895,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,685.209,690.563,"--there -- is in your presentation, you're saying we are attacking the statewide plan."
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,712.226,728.252,"Your Honor, our claim is that the exact same policy was applied in every black -- majority district, which is we will use racial data to repopulate as close as we can possibly do it to the exact same black percentage."
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.821,734.106,And how -- how are your clients hurt by that?
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,745.564,747.164,Your Honor--
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.164,750.049,I assume that's the harm that -- that you're alleging.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,750.049,766.227,"--Your Honor, we -- the record demonstrates that we have plaintiffs or we have members of the ADC in many of the black majority districts at issue, and that at least is sufficient for us to challenge this policy, at least as applied in those districts."
2014.13-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.227,772.297,I thought the record just showed that you -- you named your plaintiffs by county rather than district.
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,772.297,775.999,But many of the districts are wholly contained within the county.
2014.13-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,783.52,785.122,Are you dependent on your district by district challenge?
2014.13-895,0,56119,richard_pildes,,791.359,796.244,"By statewide, we simply mean a common policy applied to every district in the State."
2014.13-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,798.879,799.713,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,814.472,816.074,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,845.26,847.177,You lost on the dilution claim.
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,847.177,847.712,We did.
2014.13-895,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,861.119,867.857,Did the district court understand you to be asserting a district-specific -- district-specific claims?
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,867.857,872.327,I think it understood us to be challenging each of the districts.
2014.13-895,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,872.327,877.148,Where -- where do you find that in the -- in the opinion of the district court?
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,881.6,900.93,I we -- we -- advanced evidence as to the motive that was a motive common to all the districts and then we advanced -- offered evidence about particular districts to illustrate how that was played out.
2014.13-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,911.636,921.66,"But you mean had specific -- in your proposed findings, you dealt specifically with certain districts and not specifically with others."
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,921.66,937.602,"The specific information dealt with many of the particular districts, but the claim was that all of the districts were the result of a common purpose, that that common -- and that common--"
2014.13-895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.304,942.406,But some of the districts were unchanged.
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,953.379,957.333,--Our -- our clients -- we have members in all the districts.
2014.13-895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.301,965.939,"Was that established in the district court, that you have members in all the districts?"
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,965.939,967.605,--That was the finding of the district court.
2014.13-895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,971.757,974.108,The finding of the district court was that you have -- you have members--
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,974.108,976.06,--I think it said all or virtually all.
2014.13-895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1013.252,1015.369,--I don't understand what you just said.
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1020.339,1020.573,--No.
2014.13-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1042.437,1054.912,And you think it's possible for the State to navigate between not enough minority members in the district and too many minority members in the district without taking race into account.
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1054.912,1057.864,"No, we do -- we do not."
2014.13-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1057.864,1058.964,Race predominantly into account.
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1058.964,1078.445,"But Shaw -- Shaw doesn't say that taking race into account raises a constitutional question in all cases, particularly in -- in the wake of this Court's decision in Easley, which made it clear, finally resolving an issue that had been kicking around for some time, that the fact that race was a factor in drawing a district doesn't trigger strict scrutiny."
2014.13-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1095.823,1103.677,"So -- so they have to navigate between too many and too few, but without race being the predominant consideration."
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1103.677,1111.933,"If race, if -- in terms of the Constitution, if race isn't the predominant purpose and dilution isn't involved, then there's no constitutional claim."
2014.13-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1151.491,1154.36,"Do you think -- what do you think -- well, it's speculative."
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1166.92,1168.053,"--That -- that is not correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1168.053,1170.205,He did preclear the plan that you're challenging today.
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1170.205,1174.007,He also precleared the 2001 plan which did precisely what you described.
2014.13-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1198.555,1199.907,I have a problem.
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1204.109,1204.693,--Yes.
2014.13-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1204.693,1206.911,"Basically, you're saying I don't have a Shaw challenge."
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1206.911,1208.747,I have a Shaw challenge.
2014.13-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1208.747,1209.13,All right.
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1225.189,1226.041,"No, no."
2014.13-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1226.041,1227.141,If a particular district--
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1227.141,1227.458,No.
2014.13-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1227.458,1236.347,"--I mean, if it stayed essentially the same, they didn't move the boundaries much, they obviously -- they don't -- it's an all-white district."
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1257.843,1261.312,Let me say two things in response to that.
2014.13-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1275.588,1277.005,But that wasn't true any--
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1277.005,1277.374,"--Yes, it is."
2014.13-895,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1297.919,1305.591,"Well, explain -- now that you're talking about districts, could I come back to the question I asked at the beginning, so that I understand what we have to decide."
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1367.828,1381.47,"I think in the context of the way the case was litigated and tried and the briefs at the time, it was -- everybody understood the plaintiffs were challenging all of the majority-black districts."
2014.13-895,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1381.47,1383.637,The district court understood that?
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1396.747,1408.122,"We think in the context in which the case was litigated, there was no conceptual difference between challenging all the 36 districts and challenging 36 individual districts."
2014.13-895,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1439.488,1449.029,"And, Mr. Schnapper, isn't it right that after trial, when you submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, in fact, you did reference particular districts?"
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1464.638,1465.705,We did.
2014.13-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1495.258,1510.184,"To get there, we'd have -- you're talking, about, second, we construe the filings of the Black Caucus plaintiffs as arguing that the acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymandering, so we'd have to say that was wrong, they didn't get the complaint right, send it back."
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1586.184,1598.992,"Well, Your Honor, I think with regard to the question of justification, we think it doesn't make any sense, in light of this Court's decision particularly in Shaw 2, to send it back."
2014.13-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1664.101,1671.273,--I'm still having a psychological problem with your point.
2014.13-895,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1718.138,1718.521,Okay.
2014.13-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1747.607,1748.707,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1761.265,1763.283,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1776.527,1778.16,"I don't understand why that's so, General."
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1823.838,1834.813,"--That may be right, Justice Kagan, but it also doesn't prove that race predominated in the Shaw sense with respect to each specific district, and let me try to explain why."
2014.13-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1864.582,1885.929,"Well, I guess I would appreciate specific examples, because it seems to me as sort of a going-in matter that when you say this is the most important thing except for the Reynolds inquiry, this is the most important thing, that necessarily it's going to affect the way you redraw or who you put into the districts."
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1885.929,1886.646,Well--
2014.13-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1886.646,1903.623,"You might not reach the target in every single district, but necessarily you're saying we are prioritizing this race-based this race-based thing, criterion, in a way that's going to affect every judgment we make."
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1903.623,1910.896,"--But the question under Shaw, Your Honor, as we read the Shaw line of cases, is whether that is done in derogation of traditional districting criteria."
2014.13-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1910.896,1911.429,"Well, how can it not be?"
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1923.871,1925.321,"No, that's not necessarily true."
2014.13-895,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2021.7,2023.902,But suppose they did that based on economic data?
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2023.902,2027.021,"--Then I think it would not be a problem, Your Honor."
2014.13-895,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2027.021,2028.588,But it results in the same thing.
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2028.588,2029.04,Right.
2014.13-895,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2089.612,2098.367,And that's true at the outset if you move them by race in order to increase their capacity to influence districts?
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2098.367,2110.942,"--Well, that's a difficult question, Your Honor, but I think if you're -- if you're if you're moving people by race in order to ensure that you're not violating the Voting Rights Act that seems to be one thing."
2014.13-895,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2110.942,2111.608,But then it's a one-way ratchet.
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2111.608,2118.781,"No, I don't think it is a one-way ratchet, Your Honor, because you can move in both directions, just move precincts and not -- and not census blocks."
2014.13-895,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2118.781,2131.172,"General, you say that the district court erred in addressing the claim of racial gerrymandering on a statewide rather than a district-specific basis."
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2140.194,2140.561,Yes.
2014.13-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2201.365,2207.519,But you don't deny that a statewide policy can refer to every district or every majority minority district in the State?
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2207.519,2207.786,--No.
2014.13-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2218.993,2244.544,"But again and I don't want to press it if you've given me your best answer to it -- if a policy says we're going to prioritize this particular criteria, which here was the mistaken understanding of retrogression, if a policy says, we're going to prioritize this over everything else, it seems to me that that's pretty good evidence of a violation."
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2244.544,2251.365,"Only if again -- I guess I am just going to repeat myself, but if it's in derogation of traditional districting criteria 5--"
2014.13-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2251.365,2258.97,"But if the policy says that it's going to prioritize it over everything else, that means it going to be in derogation of tradition districting criteria."
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2258.97,2259.736,--When they conflict--
2014.13-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2259.736,2261.52,Sometimes they might fail.
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2269.759,2277.265,--But the question is 15 let me take a step back because I think it might help to put it in this context.
2014.13-895,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2316.94,2322.244,"And when you do that, will you also tell us what effect, if any, the preclearance should have."
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2322.244,2323.827,Yes.
2014.13-895,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2362.052,2362.987,You asked for a remand.
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2366.789,2367.256,Yes.
2014.13-895,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2367.256,2370.724,"And when they do so, that would not be subject to Section 5, correct?"
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2370.724,2371.291,Certainly correct.
2014.13-895,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2372.724,2374.326,And that's not a concern for you?
2014.13-895,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2374.326,2378.128,"Well, it's not a concern for us."
2014.13-895,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2399.291,2400.141,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2412.618,2415.418,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-895,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2465.584,2483.295,But the other side says it was impermissible for you to preserve the status quo because the opportunity for minority voters in the majority minority districts to participate in the electoral process had improved to the extent that maintaining the status quo would be characterized as packing.
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2483.295,2487.432,"Well, actually, if you look at -- well, two responses to that, Your Honor."
2014.13-895,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2536.263,2553.642,"Is -- is it fair to -- to read the pleadings and and the submission in this case as saying that the State did not defend this plan on the basis that it was for partisan purposes, but that it was to comply with Section 5?"
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2553.642,2554.476,I don't--
2014.13-895,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2554.476,2561.23,"Is that -- is that a fair reading of the A, of the red brief and, B, of what the district court found."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2561.23,2564.765,"--I don't think it's a fair reading of either, Your Honor, and this is the reason why."
2014.13-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2606.608,2613.179,"Are you really saying that that's a pleading requirement, that they have to come in with a plan that meets all the rest of your criteria?"
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2613.179,2615.214,I do not believe that is a pleading requirement.
2014.13-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2664.294,2668.429,"Mr. Brasher, I mean, let me just give you some numbers here from from some of these districts."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2709.255,2711.624,I don't think that shows that for two reasons.
2014.13-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2718.11,2719.027,That was just a coincidence?
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2719.027,2719.795,No.
2014.13-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2728.651,2732.787,"Well, it's 73 percent, and you hit that 73 percent exactly."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2732.787,2734.02,"Well, and that's my point."
2014.13-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2747.88,2758.004,"Well, I think you kind of do actually, because, I mean, you're trying to repopulate these districts, and many of these districts, yes, there are many, many, many African Americans."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2767.876,2770.478,"Well, I'll give you another example of what I mean."
2014.13-895,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2852.829,2855.114,--What about District -- Senate District 26?
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2855.114,2863.97,--Senate District 26 was above 70 percent black in the previous plan and it's above 70 percent black in our plan and in the Black Caucus's plan.
2014.13-895,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2914.819,2926.46,"Well, the Solicitor General just said that if you look at that district, it has a very bizarre shape and the effect of the bizarre shape is to pull in predominantly African-American areas and exclude predominantly white areas."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2927.46,2929.662,"Actually, I respectfully disagree with him about that."
2014.13-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2983.513,2996.555,"Mr. -- Mr. Brasher, I mean, usually in these cases you're looking at these funny-shaped districts and you're trying to figure out from the shape and from other matters whether race has been used instead of traditional districting criteria."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3062.347,3065.615,"--Well, just two quick responses to that, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3073.305,3074.188,But this is much more than that.
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3090.68,3100.288,"--Well, that brings me to my second point, which is that imagine had we done the same thing that the plaintiffs are suggesting, and we had hired a political scientist to tell us that 55 percent should be the target."
2014.13-895,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3111.594,3135.628,"Well, Justice Kagan's question points up the fact that the defenders of this plan did not rely on the fact that it was a political gerrymander and, of course, they said it was the 2 percent call, but the basis was race in order to comply with Section 5."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3135.628,3148.536,"--And my point about that is certainly with respect to specific districts, they were based on partisanship, and so had they challenged specific districts, we would have responded in kind with respect to those specific districts."
2014.13-895,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3168.613,3171.999,Considerable evidence on the Senate District 26.
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3171.999,3179.171,"--Senate District 26 was challenged by the Alabama Democratic Conference, which has now not brought a Shaw claim with respect to district 26."
2014.13-895,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3187.51,3190.545,Let me ask you about this Section 5 mistake.
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3203.62,3213.226,The district court made an express fact-finding here that our goal was to prevent substantial reductions in black population in the preexisting majority black districts.
2014.13-895,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3213.226,3220.898,"And if that's a misunderstanding of what Section 5 requires, then the whole thing is infected by that mistake."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3220.898,3231.703,"Well, I disagree with you respectfully about it being a misunderstanding, because I think in 2006, Congress told us that we could not diminish the ability to elect the black voters in a preexisting majority black district."
2014.13-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3264.175,3268.978,"Mr. Brasher, I guess I don't understand your response to Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3305.837,3310.322,"Well, this is what Justice Souter said in his dissent in Georgia v. Ashcroft."
2014.13-895,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3353.296,3359.116,"Suppose we, I don't know, I want to know what you think about the practicalities of sending this back."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3438.901,3440.485,There are a couple of responses.
2014.13-895,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3443.203,3445.222,I thought it was a lot of trouble to redo a plan.
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3447.324,3448.474,--It is a lot of trouble.
2014.13-895,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3448.474,3458.965,"So my point of my question is you want to go to that lot of trouble before a lot of extra trouble in court proceedings, or do you want to go to that trouble right off the bat and get it over with?"
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3464.601,3471.79,"Well, to respond to that pointed question, this plan was passed after 21 hearings held throughout the State of Alabama."
2014.13-895,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3484.447,3490.268,"Of course you don't, but my question is, is there going to be a defense left that could stop you from having to go back?"
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3490.268,3490.901,--Yes.
2014.13-895,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3490.901,3491.436,What?
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3491.436,3504.594,"I think the United States agrees with me that the question here is whether there was a strong basis in evidence for us to believe at the time that we passed this plan that we had to comply with Section 5, and I think we have that defense, even if we are litigating district by district."
2014.13-895,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3506.11,3508.979,What does it mean to comply with Section 5?
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3532.511,3539.765,"--Well, I don't think so, because I think the district court's decision was premised on the fact that race was not the predominant factor in this plan."
2014.13-895,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3553.341,3560.595,"If that turns out to be wrong, I guess you're still not guilty of using race."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3567.167,3568.334,--That's exactly right.
2014.13-895,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3572.069,3579.658,"If the district court said that race was not the purpose, what in the district court's view was the purpose of the plan?"
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3579.658,3583.794,"--Well, I don't think there's a need for a district court to identify any one specific purpose."
2014.13-895,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3583.794,3585.646,"I'm asking in this case, what do you think?"
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3585.646,3586.129,Yes.
2014.13-895,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3586.129,3594.935,Was it the presumption that they wanted to assure preclearance under Section 5 and for that reason used race?
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3606.892,3608.077,"Well, it was certainly--"
2014.13-895,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3608.077,3609.811,That's a very fine distinction.
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3609.811,3617.231,"--It was certainly a purpose that went into the majority black districts, but it was not the predominant motive in the way these lines were drafted."
2014.13-895,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3617.231,3621.349,Don't you have to use race to comply with Section 5?
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3621.349,3621.766,That's right.
2014.13-895,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3621.766,3624.818,Is there any way to comply with Section 5 without using race?
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3624.818,3625.418,There is not.
2014.13-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3625.418,3628.953,"But you don't have to use race in this way, Mr. Brasher."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3641.012,3643.046,"Well, I respectfully disagree with that."
2014.13-895,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3681.154,3686.308,Could I follow up on Justice Breyer's exploration of what would happen if this was done over?
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3696.731,3697.183,Correct.
2014.13-895,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3700.568,3706.639,And the legislature could do whatever it wants if it's -- if it relies purely on partisanship rather than on race.
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3706.639,3707.589,That is correct.
2014.13-895,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3707.589,3722.498,"And to what degree would or could -- to what degree would the legislature be justified in doing and to what degree would it be required to take into account the degree, if any, to which Section 2 imposes something like a retrogression requirement?"
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3722.498,3724.416,"Well, I think--"
2014.13-895,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3724.416,3725.5,And do we know what that might be?
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3725.5,3738.108,"--I really honestly do not know how Section 2 would necessarily apply in this circumstance because by complying with Section 5 here, we -- we necessarily complied with Section 2 because it's a lesser standard."
2014.13-895,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3746.964,3757.821,"What would happen if you -- if you're -- if on a do-over, the objective was to produce maximum Republican representation in both houses of the legislature."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3770.295,3771.914,--Not necessarily.
2014.13-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3864.341,3870.495,"Mr. Brasher, you're suggesting that there's some necessity for a 2 percent plan, but there is no necessity for a 2 percent plan."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3881.55,3888.206,"--Well, I think it can, and for this reason, is because we're in charge of adopting our race-neutral redistricting criteria."
2014.13-895,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3966.989,3974.162,"You'd look at the you'd look at the complaint, when I look at the complaint, I suspect I'll find something about districts."
2014.13-895,3,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3995.325,4000.545,"Well -- and once again, I don't think -- they may have brought claims with respect to each individual district."
2014.13-895,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4028.297,4028.83,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-895,4,56119,richard_pildes,,4030.999,4033.034,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-895,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4034.117,4035.234,Is he right on that last point?
2014.13-895,4,56119,richard_pildes,,4052.328,4063.136,"--We introduced all of that precinct splitting information below and in our proposed findings of fact, Document Number 196, some of which is reproduced in one of the briefs."
2014.13-895,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4066.938,4071.226,"What other -- besides the statistics, what other evidence did you present?"
2014.13-895,4,56119,richard_pildes,,4071.226,4072.659,"Your Honor, we--"
2014.13-895,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4072.659,4076.211,"I can go back to the Joint Appendix, but I just want a summary of it from you."
2014.13-895,4,56119,richard_pildes,,4076.211,4085.735,"--Your Honor, the key fact we presented, I think, that hasn't been discussed here is that the Alabama Constitution prohibits the splitting of counties."
