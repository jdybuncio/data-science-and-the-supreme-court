1978.77-1051,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,70.082,"We'll hear arguments next in 1051, Givhan against Western Line Consolidated School."
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,74.584,77.686,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1051,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,112.684,118.284,Well isn't it a little bit broader than that Mr. Rubin?
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,131.294,157.508,"No Your Honor, the District Court in this case found that the primer indeed almost the entire reason for the termination of the petitioner's employment was because of her criticism of certain policies and practices of her School District and her school criticism which was expressed to her principle, criticism that the policies and practices were racially discriminatory."
1978.77-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.126,290.545,You mean just have a suggestion box type of thing?
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,300.684,315.434,"Well, what I'm saying is that there may be limits that must be placed upon what the school authorities can do by way barring access."
1978.77-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,320.822,350.409,"Well, why are -- (A) Why must there be limits and (B) why must there be regulations if in a normal course of the teacher-principal relationship the teacher knows that the principal say has a meeting from four to five and she comes up to him at one minute to four and says, Look, this policy that you're enforcing seems to be all bad and I don't think it's consistent with a constitution?"
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,361.52,369.834,I don't think of the -- that it would be and sort of for purposes to this case the Court need not addressed that --
1978.77-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,369.834,382.673,Well -- but don't you get some sense out of the Fifth Circuit's opinion that the reason for the discharge here was that the teacher was more or less bugging the principal rather than the -- for the content of her suggestion?
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,382.673,390.711,Well it's clear from the findings of the District Court here that the petitioner did not harass the principal.
1978.77-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.156,402.448,But we'll deal with the opinion of the Court of the Appeals not with the District Court's opinion.
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,402.448,408.684,But the Court of Appeals did not find that the petitioner harassed the principal.
1978.77-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,408.684,433.035,Well it didn't find that the petitioner harassed but it certainly intimate -- at least I got the intimation of it that the reason for the discharge wasn't these -- so much the communication or the conduct of the communication is just the very unseemly times and demands on the principal's time.
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,433.035,434.473,No Your Honor.
1978.77-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,466.376,481.02,You say it must rise to a level of harassment before one could discharge an employee because the employee insist upon more or less taking up time that the superior wishes to devote to other affairs.
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,481.02,506.827,"Well, I don't want to exclude the possibility that the School District might show some other legitimate interest in the -- in not hearing or not or in precluding the expressions but I don't think I can catalog what those interests might be."
1978.77-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,538.888,540.406,They don't agree the judgment was wrong?
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,540.406,542.613,They do not agree that the judgment was wrong and --
1978.77-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,542.613,552.831,"Well, that isn't unusual to find that the respondents don't entirely defend a -- their reasoning."
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,552.831,564.014,"Well, I thought I ought to address myself to the posture since there hasn't been any debate in this Court on the merits of the certiorari issue."
1978.77-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,567.703,570.406,Who wants to debate on whether you should affirm or reverse?
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,570.406,576.474,"Yes there is, and I intend in one moment to reach that question."
1978.77-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,597.822,607.502,"Well, what if they -- what if we decided they used the wrong standard, why shouldn't we remand and let them deal with it first?"
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,607.502,611.022,To vacate and to remand in light of the respondent's concession?
1978.77-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,611.022,615.634,"No, in light of whatever's standard we thought was applicable."
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,615.634,647.299,"Well, the reason is that we believe that this Court should wrap up this case now because -- and decide the Pickering question, the respondents have asked that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be affirmed on the ground that when the Pickering test is applied the respondents, the petitioners rather expressions should be held unprotected and we've joined with the respondents in asking this Court to decide the issue or to decide it in the petitioner's favor."
1978.77-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.063,696.567,"Mr. Rubin, you represent only Givhan and not (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,696.567,697.335,That's correct.
1978.77-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,697.335,697.643,Is that right?
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,697.643,700.208,That's correct.
1978.77-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.25,761.575,"Well, what if the School District authorizes the principal to say to the teachers, ""Look, I just don't want to hear from you at all, you teach and I'll supervise and that's it."
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,767.229,774.292,"Your Honor, I think there might be a constitutional issue that could be raised under the Pickering test."
1978.77-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.863,777.208,"Well, how would you phrase it?"
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,777.208,795.842,Well its -- it is conceivable that the First Amendment might confirm some free speech right to criticize at least school policies internally rather than being forced to go into a public forum --
1978.77-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.842,801.567,In a free speech duty and the principal to listen?
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,801.567,814.663,"Well, at least a possibly a duty not to discipline the teacher for expressing the view whether he had to listen is I think is another question."
1978.77-1051,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,870.908,880.414,Didn't the notice to this teacher recites what the reasons were for the non-recommendation for rehiring.
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,889.099,899.497,But the District Court's finding Your Honor was that the primary indeed almost the entire reason was her communications to her principal not -- he didn't make a finding with respect to that.
1978.77-1051,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,899.497,901.667,"This is still part of the record, isn't it?"
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,901.667,907.848,Its -- it -- there was a dispute as to whether she refused to administer this -- standardized test.
1978.77-1051,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,927.427,930.754,But the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court?
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,930.754,933.04,The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court with respect to its factual findings.
1978.77-1051,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,933.04,935.091,In that finding?
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,935.091,937.546,Right.
1978.77-1051,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,996.161,1001.305,"The Mt. Healthy case, I refreshed my recollection, I read these briefs some time ago."
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,1004.924,1014.698,The Mt. Healthy case was decided between the briefing of the case in the Court of Appeals and the argument of the case in that Court.
1978.77-1051,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1026.244,1026.492,Yes.
1978.77-1051,0,21420,david_rubin,,1026.492,1028.266,-- under Mt. Healthy.
1978.77-1051,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1056.33,1059.556,Very well Mr. Rubin.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1061.637,1067.89,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1245.418,1258.715,"But in our Roth and Perry cases we held that a teacher could not be denied renewal of her contract for reasons that violated the First Amendment, did we not?"
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1258.715,1264.362,Perry v. Sindermann was a nontenure case.
1978.77-1051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1298.268,1306.12,"But in Roth, the District Court had reserved ruling on the teacher's First Amendment complaint."
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1331.525,1339.173,"As I under -- as I recall the facts of the two cases, both Roth and Sindermann were nontenured cases."
1978.77-1051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1339.173,1340.088,"Well, supposing you have an --"
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1340.088,1341.15,Now in --
1978.77-1051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1341.15,1365.899,"Supposing you have an employee whose clearly understood, who has a contract at will that can be terminated tomorrow by the state employer and the clearly established reason for termination is because he makes a statement on some public issue that offends the employer."
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1373.104,1375.715,I certainly do not.
1978.77-1051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.72,1484.775,"Well, do you mean to say that the -- a grocery merchant can't fire his clerk because the clerk says something about a public issue that the merchant doesn't like?"
1978.77-1051,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1484.775,1487.93,You apply the First Amendment to a private individual?
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1487.93,1494.351,"I think that the same rule applies to a private merchant as it does to a public employee, no more, no less."
1978.77-1051,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1494.351,1498.054,"Well, what earthly authority do you have for that?"
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1498.054,1498.61,Sir?
1978.77-1051,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.61,1505.171,What earthly authority do you have for that under any decided case from this Court?
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1505.171,1513.297,I'm not sure Mr. Justice what the specifics of your question are.
1978.77-1051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1513.297,1522.292,"My question is very specific, and that is do you know of any case from this Court that supports the proposition you just stated?"
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1522.292,1524.021,That there is a difference?
1978.77-1051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1524.021,1529.22,That there's no difference which was what I understood from your proposition.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1529.22,1540.266,I think we must -- misunderstand each other if you will pardon me but I think I agree with the -- exactly to the point that I believe you are making and that is if they are treated alike on the law.
1978.77-1051,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1540.266,1541.666,"Well, quite a point, no, no."
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1541.666,1541.864,Sir?
1978.77-1051,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1541.864,1548.577,It's just -- I understood my Brother here -- Rehnquist to -- in his questions implicitly to be making just the opposite point.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1558.58,1558.825,I don't know of any case --
1978.77-1051,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1558.825,1559.753,-- as a matter of definition.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1559.753,1560.263,-- to that effect.
1978.77-1051,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1560.263,1565.334,"Well, quite a -- well, you don't need any cases just -- you need the constitution of the United States."
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1565.334,1565.387,I agree.
1978.77-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1565.387,1571.03,The First and the Fourteenth Amendment protects us against governmental action not against private action.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1571.03,1571.817,I agree.
1978.77-1051,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1571.817,1572.824,Alright.
1978.77-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1572.824,1579.69,"There's no state action when the grocery clerk is dealt with by his employer, is there?"
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1579.69,1580.04,Well --
1978.77-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1580.04,1582.647,There is state action here.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1582.647,1591.2,There is state action here because the board of trustees and -- which runs this is harmless to state government.
1978.77-1051,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1646.591,1647.445,"Mr. Robertshaw, could I --"
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1647.445,1647.764,Excuse me.
1978.77-1051,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.764,1648.206,-- just ask one question.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1648.206,1650.385,27;28 hard of hearing.
1978.77-1051,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1650.385,1657.65,You say that the decision was not based on what she said but rather the manner in which she said it as I understand you.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1657.65,1658.871,That is absolutely correct --
1978.77-1051,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.871,1658.993,But did not --
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1658.993,1663.276,-- and I think that's what the Judge Smith found when he said she was overly critical.
1978.77-1051,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1663.276,1687.232,But did not the judge say that the -- in page 35A of the certiorari petition that as a finder of fact after hearing all the testimony in reviewing the exhibits he concluded that the primary reason for the School District's failure to renew her contract was her criticism with the policies and factors of the School District.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1689.537,1694.532,"Yes sir, if I may explain my acceptance."
1978.77-1051,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1771.144,1777.733,But did not -- you make precisely this argument to the Court of Appeals and they rejected this very argument.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1777.733,1791.35,I did but you must realize that the rejection of the Fifth Circuit is dictum in view of the fact that they held there was no violation of First Amendment rights.
1978.77-1051,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1800.726,1810.596,Well is it really a dictum because if they were -- if you had prevailed on that argument they would not have had to decide the constitutional issue they decide that argument.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1819.434,1821.098,Yes.
1978.77-1051,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.098,1823.889,So it is really not a dictum in the ordinary sense?
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1823.889,1825.271,No.
1978.77-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1827.689,1831.145,"Counsel, would you stay close to the lecterns so that we don't lose any (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1831.145,1833.294,I apologize.
1978.77-1051,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1877.521,1887.321,"Mr. Robertshaw, let me ask one other question and I don't mean to take too much time but you are not defending the judgment of the Court of Appeals, are you?"
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1890.705,1905.864,I am not defending the judgment of the Court of Appeals to the extent that it holds that private communications between an employee and an employer are not protected by the First Amendment.
1978.77-1051,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1905.864,1915.296,So you are asking us without having filed a cross-petition for certiorari to modify the judgment of the Court of Appeals?
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1915.296,1925.936,"I'm -- no, to be perfectly frank Your Honor, this is my first appearance before this Court."
1978.77-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1953.725,1973.547,So you don't think that -- you don't think that its -- that the Court of Appeals is correct in saying that as of -- that on this record the petitioner should be -- is out of Court.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,1980.078,1986.038,I think in the interest to basic fairness they should be and for this reason.
1978.77-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1994.517,2008.477,Well you don't believe the record that's before us is sufficient for us to make any -- at least you don't insist that we make any determination here based on a new -- on a different standard in the Court of Appeals.
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,2008.477,2010.682,"No, I don't think that the record is sufficient."
1978.77-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2412.501,2419.76,"But the findings are not all in your favor on that score, the findings of the District Court, are they?"
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,2419.76,2424.268,"Well, the evidence is uncontradicted and it's admitted by petitioner."
1978.77-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2426.963,2428.049,"Well the finding, there was a finding --"
1978.77-1051,1,32706,j_robertshaw,,2428.049,2430.367,The finding was that we had a --
1978.77-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2430.367,2435.808,You had dismissed her or fail to renew her primarily because of the First Amendment factor.
