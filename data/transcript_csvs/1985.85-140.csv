1985.85-140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.056,The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Bowers against Hardwick.
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,14.462,16.092,Thank you.
1985.85-140,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,71.988,75.59,"Was there a reason, Mr. Hobbs, that it wasn't presented to the grand jury?"
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,75.59,81.905,"Your Honor, the District Attorney of Fulton County, who would have handled that case--"
1985.85-140,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,81.905,83.435,"That is Atlanta, isn't it?"
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,83.435,84.407,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-140,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,97.286,98.876,Mr. Hobbs?
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,98.876,99.597,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-140,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,99.597,102.629,Is the statute enforced in Georgia?
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,102.629,105.53,"Yes, Your Honor, the statute is enforced in Georgia."
1985.85-140,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,105.53,109.722,How many prosecutions have there been in the last year or five years?
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,109.722,111.905,I could not tell the Court that.
1985.85-140,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,123.543,125.737,"Well, I should have framed my question more specifically."
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,136.122,137.534,It had been enforced.
1985.85-140,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,171.034,177.078,Did you say the last prosecution was in the 30's or 40's?
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,177.078,184.084,The last reported Appellate decision concerning this type of conduct in a private setting.
1985.85-140,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,184.084,188.885,Has it ever been enforced in a marital situation?
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,188.885,190.257,Not to my knowledge.
1985.85-140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.429,202.627,"But, on its face, the statute would permit such a prosecution, would it not?"
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,202.627,203.936,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,389.316,394.432,"Let me just ask, what is your position on the application of the statute to a married couple?"
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,394.432,396.321,--If Your Honor please--
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,396.321,398.292,Could it be constitutionally applied or not?
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,398.292,409.371,--I believe in light of Griswold versus Connecticut that application of the statute to a married couple would make it very problematic for the State of Georgia to--
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,409.371,410.821,Do you think they could or could not?
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,413.804,415.276,--I believe that it would be unconstitutional.
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,415.276,416.676,You think it would be unconstitutional?
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,416.676,418.148,"Yes, sir."
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,418.148,422.028,"And, what is the right that would be protected of the married person in that situation in your view?"
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,422.028,427.632,The right of marital privacy as identified by the Court in Griswold.
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,427.632,437.969,"And, this conduct, though it is traditionally frowned upon as I understand your brief, you would nevertheless be constitutionally protected in the marital setting?"
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,437.969,450.909,"Yes, Your Honor, based upon this Court's findings in Griswold versus Connecticut in which Justice Douglas stated the right of marital intimacy is older than our Bill of Rights."
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.03,454.94,He didn't say anything about this kind of conduct.
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,454.94,456.151,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-140,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,511.978,519.251,Is the record clear as to whether the conduct was with a male or a female?
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,519.251,530.761,"--The record, I believe, Your Honor... The complaint indicated that Mr. Hardwick was arrested for engaging in sodomitic act with another male."
1985.85-140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,530.761,540.926,"Of course, this isn't a review of any conviction, is it?"
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,545.24,547.221,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,656.713,666.798,"It might well, as a practical matter, I suppose, prevent the state from enforcing its law with respect to... Your point is that doesn't make the law invalid."
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,666.798,668.291,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,822.0,827.685,"Mr. Hobbs, when you say ""cohabitation with one's relatives"", you mean living in the same house with them?"
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,827.685,828.876,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.21,894.357,"General Hobbs, can I ask you one question that is prompted by Justice Rehnquist's notion that there are difficulties of enforcement within the home and earlier you had been asked about the extent to which the statute has been enforced."
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,916.472,932.381,"Well, Your Honor, to be quite frank, I do not know what was in the mind of the District Attorney when he decided not to prosecute this case."
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,932.381,935.235,"But, what about the state representative who defended this very lawsuit?"
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,935.235,939.887,In terms of prosecuting Mr. Hardwick?
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.887,949.375,"If they thought there was an important public interest in enforcing the statute, why wouldn't they take his discovery, get him to admit he committed all these acts and then prosecute him?"
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,949.375,957.85,"Because at the time, Your Honor, we relied heavily, almost exclusively on this Court's decision in Doe versus Commonwealth's Attorney."
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.04,982.995,"I can understand why that would win the lawsuit for you, but I find it puzzling as to how that vindicates the public interest that this statute was supposed to serve to stop this kind of conduct."
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,982.995,985.696,"Well, I think--"
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,985.696,990.06,Does the state really have an interest in stopping this kind of conduct?
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,991.871,999.057,--I think that most certainly the state does have an interest in enforcing the statute and in maintaining the statute on our books.
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.491,1009.802,"It would have been very easy in this case, in this instance."
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,1009.802,1013.024,--Perhaps so.
1985.85-140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.024,1016.808,Presented with a silver platter and they declined to go forward.
1985.85-140,0,35974,michael_e_hobbs,,1027.314,1029.026,"I would agree, Your Honor."
1985.85-140,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1282.732,1292.987,Mr. Tribe?
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1292.987,1296.199,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1358.952,1364.223,"Professor Tribe, is there a limiting principle to your argument?"
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1382.215,1383.337,Yes.
1985.85-140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1383.337,1394.354,"You emphasize the home and so would I if I were arguing this case, but what about... Take an easier one, a motel room or the back of an automobile or toilet or wherever."
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1396.575,1399.667,"Justice Powell, I think there are two kinds of limiting principles."
1985.85-140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1402.529,1403.731,To the place?
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1403.731,1405.911,The place where the acts occur.
1985.85-140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1436.552,1438.854,What about incest in the private home?
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1438.854,1443.345,It seems to us that the private home does not shield anything that one might do there.
1985.85-140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1457.834,1460.886,"So, the limiting principle is limited to sodomy."
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1462.148,1462.498,"--No, not quite."
1985.85-140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1621.142,1627.376,I am not sure that you have answered Justice Powell's question about incest in the privacy of the home?
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1627.376,1627.907,Yes.
1985.85-140,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1653.572,1658.357,Suppose it is parent and adult child.
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1662.117,1672.746,"--I doubt, Mr. Chief Justice, that the state would have to assume that just because a woman is over 21, that if her father induces her to have sex, that that has got to be consensual."
1985.85-140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1699.714,1705.067,"Mr. Tribe, your line of reasoning would make the Edmonds Act unconstitutional, would it not?"
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1705.067,1706.597,The Edmonds Act--
1985.85-140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1706.597,1717.975,The Edmonds Act forbade the... the Moral Act forbade polygamy and the Edmonds Act forbade cohabitation by one who is already married.
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1717.975,1726.7,"--No, I think, Justice Rehnquist, that cohabitation by one already married could be punished by the state as a breach of a state sanctioned relationship."
1985.85-140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1770.879,1786.149,"Well, Mr. Tribe, how do you propose that these other situations be analyzed, by some sort of heightened scrutiny as well, and are you suggesting that there is a more compelling state interest or what is it you are saying?"
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1786.149,1791.234,"I think, Justice O'Connor, there are two approaches, either of which would lead to the same result."
1985.85-140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1846.58,1857.836,"Professor Tribe, let's come back to the privacy of the home and part of the question that I asked you and I don't think I gave you an opportunity to answer, would you distinguish the home between the back of an automobile?"
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1857.836,1859.058,"--Certainly, Justice Powell."
1985.85-140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1859.058,1860.708,"And, a public toilet, of course?"
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1860.708,1861.179,Certainly.
1985.85-140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1862.26,1864.922,What about a hotel room overnight?
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1864.922,1875.929,"--We think that a hotel overnight is not entitled to the same degree of protection, but, frankly, I do not know precisely where the line would be drawn."
1985.85-140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1896.081,1901.113,I mentioned something special about a home in Moore also against East Cleveland.
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1914.484,1927.221,"Justice Powell, I have been troubled by parts of the Harlan dissent in Moore which rather casually mentioned homosexuality, and for that matter abortion, in much the same breath."
1985.85-140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.251,1973.023,"Mr. Tribe, can I ask you a little more about your second limiting principle."
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1997.729,2004.232,"I would think, Justice Stevens, first, that if they did that, strict or substantially heightened scrutiny would be required."
1985.85-140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2032.491,2036.063,"What you are saying is that it would implicate your second limiting principle, but not carry the day."
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2036.063,2037.373,"--Exactly, Justice Stevens."
1985.85-140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.373,2041.577,"But, you say there is a parallel between that problem and the one we have before us today."
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2041.577,2042.466,I would say--
1985.85-140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2042.466,2046.389,One could argue that the reason for discouraging it is to encourage marriage.
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2046.389,2062.049,"--If that argument were made on remand, that is,  if the Court were to agree that heightened scrutiny is appropriate, it would certainly be a legitimate argument for the state to advance, unlike the tautology it advances here, we outlaw it because we don't like it, we think it is immoral."
1985.85-140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2183.65,2200.33,"Mr. Tribe, if this evolution is taking place, as you suggest, and you may well be right, why isn't it more proper for this Court to let it be reflected in the majority rule where, you know, states have repealed these statutes."
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2200.33,2207.644,"Justice Rehnquist, we do think that that trend is at least relevant for the question of whether this is self-evidently evil."
1985.85-140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2249.072,2269.276,"But, I thought your argument suggested that 25 years ago, if that is the right time that Justice Harlan wrote his dissent in Poe against Ullman, perhaps these rights wouldn't have... the right that you are arguing for here, the right to commit sodomy, would not have been constitutionally protected, but now they are."
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2272.438,2283.035,I do not think that if this case had been squarely presented before Justice Harlan that he would have decided to draw the line based on which body parts come into contact.
1985.85-140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2296.523,2300.325,Then he just wrote that part of his dissent in a fit of absent-mindedness?
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2300.325,2303.647,"No, I don't think Justice Harlan was capable of fits of absent-mindedness."
1985.85-140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.164,2392.366,"You say it is a facial attack, Mr. Tribe."
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2396.707,2402.423,"Well, I suppose with every facial attack, Justice Rehnquist, there is some definition of the relevant universe."
1985.85-140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2416.743,2420.733,"But, you are saying when applied in the home."
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2427.048,2427.899,--That is correct.
1985.85-140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2441.327,2444.539,"Well, then it is really not a facial attack on the statute I don't think."
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2444.539,2447.07,"If you want to call it something else, that is not a problem."
1985.85-140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.019,2512.493,"Professor, what provision of the Constitution do you rely on or we should rely on to strike down this statute?"
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2512.493,2521.039,"The Liberty Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Justice White, as given further meaning and content by a force of decisions over half a century."
1985.85-140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.051,2526.404,Which cases do you particularly rely on?
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2526.404,2549.288,"--Well, we think with respect to the home dimension we rely heavily on Stanley, where the idea that it was a First Amendment right surely will not wash because, as the Court later held, and, indeed, the very case they cite, 12 200-Foot Reels, there is no right to buy the material, no right to sell it, no right to show it to consenting adults in public, only a right to enjoy it in private."
1985.85-140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.973,2602.252,How do you articulate this right or this process of declaring a... you say is a fundamental right or is it a... how should we go about identifying some new right that should give protection?
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2602.252,2625.078,"Well, Justice White, I think that the method that this Court used in both Griswold and in Roe of looking to tradition in terms of the protection of the place where an act occurs and of looking to a tradition in terms of recognizing autonomous personal control over intimacy is an appropriate process to employ."
1985.85-140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2943.435,2947.579,"Mr. Tribe, I am curious to know, you have referred to Justice White's opinion in Moore v. Cleveland."
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2950.291,2952.891,"Oh, it certainly hurts more than it helps."
1985.85-140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.413,3017.504,Let me ask you one other question which is really about Justice White's opinion which seems to assume that a law that has some impact on liberty must have some utility or... his exact line which is must have a purpose or utility.
1985.85-140,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3017.504,3018.305,That is right.
1985.85-140,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3018.305,3021.828,What is your understanding of the purpose or utility of the law of the state in this case?
