2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.57,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 06-984, Medellin v. Texas."
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,10.606,27.715,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The President and the Senate entered into three treaties, the Optional Protocol, the UN Charter, and the ICJ Statute, by which the United States agreed that it would comply with the ICJ's decision in any case to which it was a party."
2007.06-984,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,58.401,61.703,That's not such an outrageous proposition.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,72.994,74.577,Yes.
2007.06-984,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,75.627,82.183,So there would be the situation that presents the shocking situation you've just described.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,86.885,95.157,"--There would be constitutional... there might be affirmative constitutional constraints on the enforcement of a treaty, but there are none here."
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,95.157,97.276,Who would enforce those constraints?
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,125.843,131.08,"This Court would have a role in reviewing that judgment, and here's... here's the question."
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,141.02,142.02,Even if we determine--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,142.02,142.603,And if that obligation--
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,142.603,146.322,"--Even if we determine, even if we determine that that judgment is based on a legal error?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,146.322,154.578,"--The question... that's the basis of submitting a dispute to a third-party dispute-resolution mechanism, yes."
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,154.578,161.849,"So if the ICJ determined that the officers should each go to jail for 5 years, we would have no basis for reviewing that judgment?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,161.849,166.384,"Well, that would be... well, that would be a... raise a separate obstacle."
2007.06-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,168.919,173.054,Does the ICJ ever issue a judgment of that character?
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,191.248,192.465,--That is correct.
2007.06-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.973,204.842,"Well, I'm still interested in the answer to the Chief Justice's hypothetical."
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,204.842,206.225,"--Well, as I say, there are two--"
2007.06-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,206.225,208.71,"Suppose the court acts beyond, clearly beyond, its jurisdiction?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,208.71,213.698,"--Well, it's... with respect, there's no suggestion here that the court has acted beyond its jurisdiction."
2007.06-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,215.381,216.816,"Could you answer the hypothetical, please."
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,216.816,238.579,"But if the court, itself... if the ICJ, itself, made a determination as to a dispute that is within its jurisdiction and that imposes an obligation that is within this Court's provenance to enforce, that is, that it determines the rights attributable... enforceable within a court of justice, this Court would be enforcing the obligation to comply."
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,247.851,249.118,I'm sorry.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,257.707,264.96,--Because in that situation that may be beyond the Court's... the executive power of the Court.
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,267.829,268.681,The Court doesn't have executive power.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,284.274,292.964,--The... the question here is that the... the Court would be exercising its judicial authority to construe the United States's obligation to comply with the judgment.
2007.06-984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,314.043,314.777,I thought--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,314.777,315.662,It depends on the nature of--
2007.06-984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,315.662,322.149,--I thought the question... and I apologize if I'm not paraphrasing it because I have my own.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,377.57,380.12,--If there were... if an ICJ--
2007.06-984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,380.12,397.031,"If the ICJ were to do something which it had never done, like, say, put everybody in jail for 50 years... I don't know that there is such a thing... but suppose they did, if they did, I guess that might violate something basic in our Constitution, in which case we wouldn't enforce it."
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,397.031,397.364,--That's right and--
2007.06-984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,397.364,397.814,If we took that approach--
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,397.814,398.731,Now--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,398.731,399.197,--If there--
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,399.197,414.457,"--Just to get back, you're conceding, I take it, whether the ICJ has done something like this before or not... and we can debate whether what they've done in this case is precisely that... there is a role for this Court in determining whether or not a judgment of the ICJ should be enforced."
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,414.457,420.194,--There is surely because it's this Court that would be enforcing the obligation to comply.
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,422.694,429.966,"Just enforcing the obligation to comply or, as we have in this case, determining the legal basis for the ICJ determination?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,429.966,440.589,"--There are... there are two different obligations here: There is an obligation under the Vienna Convention itself, and this Court has determined the dispositive effect of that obligation of a matter of U.S. law."
2007.06-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,457.967,465.639,"Suppose in this case the President did the opposite... the same facts only the President said to Texas, do not comply with this judgment."
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,465.639,475.162,"--Well, it... that would... it would be inconsistent with this Court's duty and obligation to comply, to enforce a treaty that the... that the--"
2007.06-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,475.162,475.895,So then the President's--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,475.895,476.447,--If the--
2007.06-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,476.447,477.831,--determination is not conclusive.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,477.831,481.899,"--Well, the President's determination... what the President has determined here is to enforce the treaty."
2007.06-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,482.267,484.584,My hypothetical is he's coming out the other way.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,488.338,488.654,--If--
2007.06-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,488.654,493.29,And I... I think that that's not... not consistent with your earlier position.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,493.29,498.925,"--Oh, if the President here... the... if there's an obligation here to comply and, in the words this Court, it's"
2007.06-984,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,507.031,507.864,Isn't the obligation--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,507.864,508.383,--which essentially--
2007.06-984,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,508.383,530.046,"--Isn't the obligation that the United States undertook when it signed the UN Charter the obligation to undertake to comply with ICJ judgments in accordance with its own constitutional processes, not necessarily that any ICJ decision would be regarded by any court in this country as binding Federal law?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,530.046,533.081,"--Well, it would be... that... that's exactly right."
2007.06-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.402,541.671,If you had a--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,541.671,542.421,It might have obligations--
2007.06-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.421,558.233,"--If you had a treaty on the recognition and enforcement of judgments, mutual recognition and enforcement, then we would enforce the judgment that we agreed to enforce by treaty."
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,581.646,584.348,--That's exactly the effect of the judgment.
2007.06-984,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.348,585.05,It's self-enforcing.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,585.633,586.15,It's--
2007.06-984,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.15,588.835,--I thought you... you think this treaty is self-enforcing.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,592.054,598.358,"--Well, if the... whether or not the treaty obligation is self-executing or self-enforcing goes to the nature of the obligation."
2007.06-984,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,613.45,614.0,May I--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,614.0,614.819,--of a nature to be enforced--
2007.06-984,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.819,615.535,--May ask this question?
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,634.197,639.435,"--Well, in that situation, if it was a judgment rendered in a case to which we had--"
2007.06-984,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,639.435,640.585,In this very case.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,640.585,641.101,--That would be--
2007.06-984,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,641.101,641.868,This very case.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,649.857,654.159,"--In the first instance, yes, the Court would honor that judgment as an obligation to comply."
2007.06-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,655.345,656.028,Then it becomes--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,656.028,657.561,--some constraints that--
2007.06-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,657.561,663.748,"--Then it becomes a penal judgment, and I thought the rule was that no country forces... enforces another country's penal judgment."
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,663.748,667.485,"--Well, that would depend on the... if... how you construed the obligation to comply."
2007.06-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,667.485,668.102,But if we say--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,668.102,668.752,"In this case, we have--"
2007.06-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,668.752,672.354,"--this man goes to jail for 5 years, it seems to me that's a penal judgment."
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,672.354,678.274,"--If that was the nature of the dispute that the United... that is, of course, not the nature of the dispute that the United States--"
2007.06-984,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,678.274,679.226,What if they say--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,679.226,679.743,--But if he--
2007.06-984,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,679.743,681.093,--he goes to jail for no time at all?
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,695.136,700.207,"--Well, the question is, is it binding in the first instance because the... there's an obligation to comply?"
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,727.274,727.957,Is the answer to--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,727.957,728.474,--would be exercising--
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,728.474,735.547,"--Is the answer to either my or Justice Stevens's hypothetical then, yes, we do have to enforce an ICJ judgment of that sort?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,735.547,742.617,--You would enforce an ICJ judgment that did in fact... that was of a nature to be enforced in... in a judicial proceeding.
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,742.617,743.1,But--
2007.06-984,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,743.1,746.854,This is not of a nature to be enforced in a judicial proceeding in Texas.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,764.899,772.635,If the... both the President's determination and the Article 94 obligation which result in the Avena judgment are Federal law.
2007.06-984,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,779.658,790.68,"And... and do you know of any other Federal law that... that interferes in the... in the procedures of State criminal courts, directs them as to what... what procedures they have to have?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,790.68,798.636,"--The Court has... when there's a Federal procedural rule that preempts a State procedural rule, the Court allows that to preempt as a Federal rule all the time."
2007.06-984,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,798.636,799.403,Really?
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,799.403,800.153,That's a function of--
2007.06-984,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.153,800.738,Where?
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,818.533,827.222,--The Federal Government can prescribe rules of decision that preempt Federal rules and require the cases that other... that would not otherwise be heard to be heard.
2007.06-984,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,827.772,868.58,"Well, you're... you're... as I understand it, in order for you to prevail on that point, the only... the only conclusion that has to be drawn, as I understand it, is that the Texas courts have subject matter jurisdiction of this kind of... of order, and that the bar that Texas is asserting is simply, in effect, a procedural bar; and, therefore, in order for this Federal rule to preempt the State bar is not to give the State courts jurisdiction they don't have, but to remove a bar to the exercise of their jurisdiction that State law, absent preemption, would impose; is that correct?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,868.58,869.265,--That's correct.
2007.06-984,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,871.515,872.301,You just--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,872.301,872.601,If I may--
2007.06-984,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,872.601,874.151,--You just said that the Avena decision is Federal law.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,877.669,879.155,"--Well, the Avena decision--"
2007.06-984,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,880.238,879.155,It's not a statute.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,882.273,894.464,"--The Avena decision has the force of Federal law, either by virture of the treaty obligation to comply with it under Article 94-1, or the President's determination under his Article II authority to require... to determine that the United States should comply."
2007.06-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,898.499,899.201,You didn't mention the--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,899.201,900.284,--the instrument by which it must be complied with.
2007.06-984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,900.284,905.438,--You didn't mention the Optional Protocol which is... is where the United States gave its promise.
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,909.407,910.623,"Well, that's right."
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,915.477,918.012,"--Well, why don't... why don't you take 5 extra minutes?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,935.99,944.746,--The relevant Federal law here is the Federal law that says that the United States will comply pursuant to its voluntary choice to submit these... this--
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,944.746,946.948,So we have no--
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,946.948,948.031,--I'm sorry... to the ICJ.
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,948.031,958.839,"--We have no authority to review the judgment itself, even though the judgment will have the effect as Federal law of preempting the State law in this instance?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,958.839,964.458,"Well, you are in effect applying Federal law in the form of the obligation to comply."
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,966.492,978.383,"Excuse me, but your position is not that we are applying the obligation to comply, because we interpreted that in Sanchez-Llamas and came to the exact opposite conclusion as the ICG here."
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,982.252,990.155,"--The operative... it's different because on the one hand, in Sanchez-Llamas, this Court was interpreting the underlying obligation under the treaty."
2007.06-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1000.896,1009.069,Can this court interpret the meaning of the Avena judgment if it's ambiguous?
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1029.565,1042.455,"Wel, in this case, the court would be... a court applying the Avena judgment either by virtue of the Optional Protocol in 94-1 and the President's determination would be in effect applying Federal law."
2007.06-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1043.556,1045.657,Can we interpret the judgment?
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1045.657,1049.544,"--Well, to the extent necessary to apply Federal law in the form of a judgment--"
2007.06-984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1049.544,1052.979,And can the President displace our authority to do that?

2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1064.304,1075.511,"So if he determines that the judgment should not be enforced and this Court determines, based on our construction of the treaty and the judgment that it should be enforced, which determination controls?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1075.511,1083.55,"--This Court... to the extent that this is Federal law, this Court has the ultimate authority to determine whether or not it should be complied with."
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1089.854,1106.316,"Well, if we have the authority to determine whether the treaty should be complied with in the face of a presidential determination, why don't we have the independent authority to determine whether or not it should be complied with at a matter of Federal law without regard to the President's determination?"
2007.06-984,0,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1106.316,1109.95,You have two separate and independent sources of authority here.
2007.06-984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1157.762,1162.5,"Thank you, Mr. Donovan."
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1171.439,1175.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2007.06-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.324,1176.926,You don't agree with the last statement.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1176.926,1182.664,--I don't think I do agree with that and there's a couple of the issues here where we take a slightly different take.
2007.06-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.852,1200.006,"We would have no... according to you, we would have no obligation to enforce this judgment but for the President's action?"
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1200.006,1201.958,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.265,1214.465,"We could decide to go back, too."
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1217.467,1230.561,"--I hope that you wouldn't and we would be up here saying don't, because if you look at Article 94 of the UN Charter as a whole, it has two components and I think it makes clear why the President's intervening role here is important."
2007.06-984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1252.89,1256.009,But that would take an action by somebody in the country.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1256.009,1258.878,"Exactly, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that--"
2007.06-984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1258.878,1260.58,Here that hasn't... that hasn't happened.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1268.852,1271.887,"--Absolutely, and that's why we're supporting Mr. Donovan."
2007.06-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.887,1272.454,Wait a minute.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1282.742,1287.146,"Whether it's an omission or a commission I don't think is the point, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1287.613,1293.3,"I thought that was the point of Justice Ginsburg's comment, that there had been no decision not to comply."
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1296.335,1298.285,--I didn't take that to mean--
2007.06-984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1298.285,1301.287,"If you don't... if you don't comply, you don't comply."
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1320.783,1323.616,"--I agree, i think the omission-commission--"
2007.06-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.616,1328.353,"I know you agree, but it depends on whether it's up to the President to make that call."
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1352.136,1355.005,"--Well, Justice Scalia, let me take that in turn."
2007.06-984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1385.107,1391.278,"What if the President had said, we're going to comply with this judgment, but in a different way than the ICJ determined."
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1404.169,1410.239,It depends exactly what form that would take.
2007.06-984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1413.191,1415.041,It's the same as a memorandum just like... it's a memorandum just like the one we have here.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1415.041,1419.845,--And what does it suggest that is supposed to be done with the end product of that determination?
2007.06-984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1419.845,1428.015,"It says that if there has already been... the State courts are to determine if there's already been a determination of prejudice in the case, and if there has there's to be no further review."
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1439.889,1446.828,"I would say that it wouldn't... I would say that it wouldn't, as you suggest, not fully comply and not fully discharge with our obligation."
2007.06-984,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1472.944,1484.501,"If we agree with you, would the effect be that the President can take any treaty that is ratified on the understanding that it's not self-executing and execute the treaty and give it force under domestic law?"
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1484.501,1489.088,"No, Justice Alito, I don't think the theory would sweep that broadly, and I think that--"
2007.06-984,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1489.088,1489.788,"Well, why would it not?"
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1489.788,1500.563,"--Well, first of all, there's obviously a limiting principle in our theory, which is to say that the President can't take any action pursuant to this which is inconsistent with other constitutional obligations."
2007.06-984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1500.563,1506.534,But he can... he can take action that's inconsistent with the determination of Federal law by this Court?
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1506.534,1508.934,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that's true."
2007.06-984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1508.934,1514.021,I thought we determined in Sanchez-Llamas that the treaty did not mean what the ICJ said it means in this case.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1514.021,1516.39,That's exactly right as to the Vienna Convention.
2007.06-984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1536.553,1543.623,Do you doubt that the judgment here is based on a determination of the Vienna Convention that's exactly the opposite of what we determined last year?
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1543.623,1545.409,"--No doubt at all, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1554.948,1556.217,They were not parties to it.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1569.274,1570.024,Justice Scalia--
2007.06-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.024,1574.344,These people were not parties to the... the countries were parties to the judgment.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1574.344,1579.832,"--Of course the countries were parties, but these 51 individuals' claims were specifically adjudicated."
2007.06-984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1586.069,1590.271,"General, can we just clarify something which I think is important?"
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1625.111,1638.019,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that reflects that self-executing is one of those words that people use to cover a lot of different meanings; and I think in its most correct sense, you're right to say that the Vienna Convention is self-executing."
2007.06-984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1676.044,1684.399,But in Nicaragua the United States took the position from day 1 that the ICJ had no jurisdiction over the case.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1703.111,1711.883,"That's absolutely right, and that gets back to the basic principle of reviewing foreign judgments; and it's not that this Court is disabled from its judicial role."
2007.06-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.057,1736.367,"You're arguing it's just the normal choice of law problem, that even though the judgment's clearly wrong on the matter of international law, if the court had judgment... had jurisdiction to enter the judgment, we must treat it as binding?"
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1736.367,1738.15,"--That's... that's right, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.486,1744.871,That's provided that we regard these individuals as though they're tantamount to the parties to the judgment itself.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1744.871,1753.96,"--I think that's right, and certainly our obligation under that judgment as the executive branch sees it is to these 51 individuals as their claims have been espoused by--"
2007.06-984,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.96,1757.698,"Suppose the President had reached the contrary conclusion, a hypothetical we put earlier."
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1761.4,1764.517,"--Then I'd be on that side of the podium, Your Honor."
2007.06-984,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1771.854,1782.729,"I agree that we should give that determination great weight, but that's something quite different from saying that he can displace the authority of this Court on that issue of law."
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1782.729,1785.68,"--Oh, but the... the President can't displace the role of this Court."
2007.06-984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1827.09,1830.709,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I ask a further... may I ask a further question?"
2007.06-984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1830.709,1831.425,Yes.
2007.06-984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1831.425,1836.279,Let me try one other variation to make sure that I understand your argument.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1867.399,1868.917,"Of course not, Justice Souter."
2007.06-984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1878.873,1879.473,Okay.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1879.473,1887.462,"We don't suggest that we wouldn't comply with a judgment of this Court, accepting Mr. Donovan's first theory that the President's role here is unimportant."
2007.06-984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1887.462,1887.829,So--
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1887.829,1894.699,"--but we do think, we stick to our view that the President's role here makes this an easier case and is in our view dispositive."
2007.06-984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1894.699,1906.424,"--But it does follow then from what you've said that if we take exactly the position that I outlined in my hypo, we could avoid the entire question of presidential authority."
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1906.424,1907.709,You could.
2007.06-984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1920.016,1925.504,That's in effect a judicial version of one of the variants in Justice Jackson's hypo in the Steel case--
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1925.504,1926.37,Exactly.
2007.06-984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1926.37,1928.722,--He's talking about the President and Congress; we're talking about the President and the Court.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1928.722,1929.189,Right.
2007.06-984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1929.189,1929.606,Yes.
2007.06-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.606,1941.664,The President espousing the judgment... Texas takes the position that this memorandum has... has no legal effect; it's a memorandum from the President to the... to his attorney general.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1972.449,1974.801,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think there's two questions there."
2007.06-984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2015.36,2024.132,In none of those cases were we talking about a determination contrary to a legal determination by this Court concerning the scope of powers under the treaty.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2024.132,2025.401,"Well, with respect--"
2007.06-984,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2025.401,2028.686,And in Nash he was being held under Federal custody.
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2030.387,2033.839,"--Well, I don't think Nash is inapplicable, Justice Kennedy; I think it is on all fours."
2007.06-984,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2033.839,2038.625,"Of course, Nash is just a wonderful speech by Marshall anyway; it's not an opinion."
2007.06-984,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2038.625,2042.779,"But it is a wonderful speech, and I really do think you should take a look at that speech."
2007.06-984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2134.439,2135.422,"Thank you, General."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2141.376,2157.237,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The entirety of the United States's argument is predicated on the idea that the President's two-paragraph memorandum is in and of itself binding Federal law."
2007.06-984,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2157.237,2180.501,"Well, that's the... that's the argument, but your brother the Solicitor General has conceded that if we take the position in this case that there is a... a rule of decision that should be respected in this Court and, hence, the subject of a judgment to Texas that, among other things, would suspend Texas's procedural bar law... that that would obviate the question of presidential power."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2180.501,2186.84,"There's no doubt, if the Court decided it on the ground that Avena was a binding judgment, the President's order would be unnecessary."
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2201.683,2219.978,"Maybe you could spend a minute explaining that, because, as I read the Constitution, it says all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State... I guess it means including Texas...--"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2295.459,2297.311,"Certainly, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2309.802,2310.735,I was not talking--
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2310.735,2311.519,"And, with respect--"
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2311.519,2313.004,--about the President's memorandum at the moment.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2331.448,2342.887,"--Justice Breyer, the... the answer to your question is the Avena decision is not a judgment in the sense we recognize judgment in U.S. courts for six separate reasons."
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.887,2346.208,"No, forget whether we recognize it this way as a judgment."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2388.368,2395.188,"Except that when the Senate ratified the Optional Protocol, it made clear that the Optional Protocol was not self-executing."
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.39,2400.007,What are the words that the Senate said?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2423.122,2433.497,--This... this Court has made clear for 200 years the Senate can ratify a treaty and yet leave it not self-executing in the sense that it is not enforceable in U.S. domestic courts.
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2433.497,2442.085,"Oh, and so if they did that, now, will you quote the words or give me the reference where the Senate said: Although we entered into this and although we ratify it, we're not going to do it--"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2442.085,2443.302,Well--
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2443.302,2443.868,--unless you--
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2443.868,2446.704,"--The text of the treaty, itself, is the first place to look."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2453.81,2461.797,"That's after there's a breach, but we... let's stick to the protocol, the Optional Protocol... optional."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2511.147,2515.884,U.S. court.
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2523.004,2525.572,It just means we agree that the case can go before the court.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2525.572,2526.189,--Exactly.
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2526.189,2528.024,And we will be a party before the court.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2542.868,2543.834,"Justice Scalia, I--"
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.834,2544.82,Isn't there some problem there?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2544.82,2555.759,"--I would go further than some doubt, and I would say that if the treaty purported to give the authority to make binding adujudications of Federal law to any tribunal other than this Court, that it would violate Article III of the Constitution."
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2555.759,2556.242,--Fine.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2599.555,2607.358,"There are hundreds of treaty obligations that this nation is committed to that are not self-executing, that don't immediately have force--"

2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2637.857,2638.291,Okay.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2638.291,2644.178,"In those instances, the bodies in question are not making definitive interpretations of what Federal law is."
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2668.523,2668.892,I'm sorry.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2679.314,2680.364,"The treaty is Federal law, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2680.364,2685.085,"--Oh, then I don't understand you because the WTO interprets a treaty."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2694.44,2709.533,"The nature of this treaty, every... every position... the United States State Department at the time it was introduced, the Senate, and every member of the Senate who discussed it, understood that the decisions of the ICJ would not have binding effect in U.S. courts."
2007.06-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2713.421,2715.904,And what you are saying... and this has been the law--
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2715.904,2716.456,"May I ask a question, please?"
2007.06-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2716.456,2717.256,--Go ahead.
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2717.256,2726.579,"It's critical to me to understand the effect of the judgment, and you said there are six reasons why it's not an ordinary judgment."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2732.415,2735.7,"--I would be happy to provide those, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2855.459,2886.278,"Then this is consistent with what you've been explaining to Justice Breyer in your answer, that for 200 years we have had some treaties that are very important, but they're not self-executing; their violation may put us in violation of international law; but it is for us to determine how we are going to comply with the international obligation; and there is no obligation on the part of the State to comply with that law because it's not self-executing."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2886.278,2888.73,"--Justice Kennedy, that is exactly correct."
2007.06-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2888.73,2898.288,"At some point I think in the course of your argument, we may get back to whether the Vienna Convention itself is or is not self-executing."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2918.182,2932.259,"I would agree with the characterization you suggest, which is that the Vienna Convention was self-executing in the sense that it didn't require legislation to go into effect, but it was not self-executing in the sense that it provided judicially cognizable rights."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2983.475,2987.346,"Well, I still... I would like to get back to that Optional Protocol."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3038.128,3058.025,"--Justice Ginsburg, that is correct as a political and diplomatic matter, but in my judgment it speaks volumes that of the 166 nations that signed on to the Vienna Convention and of the 50 nations that signed on to the Optional Protocol, zero... not a single nation... treats ICJ judgments as binding in their domestic courts."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3077.97,3079.688,Do you have a case that says that?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3081.907,3088.128,"--I do not have a case that says that, but neither Petitioner nor their many amici have been able to point to a single instance."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3088.128,3089.728,Maybe it hasn't come up.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3089.728,3098.4,"Given that these treaties are four decades old, that that speaks volumes that no... no nation has accorded binding force to ICJ--"
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3098.4,3111.577,Maybe these other nations have an inquisitorial system where an investigating judge collects a dossier and the fact is noted in the dossier and the investigating judge and the prosecution give it such weight as it's entitled to.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3111.577,3111.994,--Justice--
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3111.994,3113.094,You know that doesn't happen?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3113.094,3119.58,"--Justice Breyer, I... I think you could well be right, but I think that also speaks to the peculiar nature of this."
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3121.465,3122.065,In an--
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3122.065,3125.919,--matters in system like the United States' where habeas allows a second bite at the apple.
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3135.359,3136.225,--Of course it matters.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3194.314,3202.151,But the ICJ's decision... I think your question goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question about the effect of an ICJ decision.
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3245.53,3251.734,"Once again, there is a constitutional problem, is there not, if they are automatically enforceable?"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3251.734,3252.436,Absolutely.
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3252.436,3262.958,That is conferring upon the ICJ the responsibility to decide the meaning of a United States treaty which is United States law.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3262.958,3263.625,And--
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3263.625,3265.744,I'm rather jealous of that power.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3288.609,3289.192,--And that--
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3289.192,3303.552,"That solves the constitutional problem, but in the situation we're talking about here, I don't know on what basis we can allow some international court to decide what is the responsibility of this Court, which is the meaning of the United States law."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3303.552,3305.285,"--Justice Scalia, that's absolutely correct."
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3305.285,3306.987,And how does the WTO differ?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3306.987,3307.854,The imperative--
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3307.854,3310.956,How does the WTO and NAFTA and all our trade agreements differ?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3310.956,3316.51,--The WTO and NAFTA... I mean NAFTA is not a treaty.
2007.06-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3332.721,3337.69,And the United States apparently accepts the verdict of those--
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3337.69,3338.125,Right.
2007.06-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3339.858,3356.92,"--You have three different things that you have to tell us about today: That the President's authority, the effect of the ICJ, and... and the Avena judgment, and ultimately, the force of the Vienna Convention itself."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3378.5,3379.702,And we don't disagree with that.
2007.06-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3379.702,3390.158,"Suppose you have a judge who has control over a defendant who's being held in custody pending trial, and the defendant says I want to see my... my foreign counsel."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3398.664,3406.483,The consequence of the argument that it doesn't create individual rights would mean that that individual defendant could not raise it in that--
2007.06-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3406.483,3407.519,You see where I'm going?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3407.519,3408.085,--Yes.
2007.06-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3417.808,3420.843,"If I thought he did, would I still have to rule against you?"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3420.843,3421.96,"No, not at all."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3444.108,3444.542,But--
2007.06-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3444.542,3455.5,Could I make a distinction between failing to let him see the counsel at all in my hypothetical and a demand that the procedural framework be altered?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3458.118,3459.885,I think that's right.
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3484.334,3485.284,--Mr. Cruz--
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3485.284,3488.388,"Mr. Cruz, could I go back to your discussion of whether this is a judgment or not?"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3503.313,3510.967,"Justice Stevens, I would not, because I do not believe consistent with Article III this Court's authority can be given away by treaty."
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3510.967,3519.74,How is it given away to a treaty if it just says one State court must honor a judgment of a sister State even if it thinks it's dead wrong?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3524.911,3528.529,That is provided by the Constitution.
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3538.653,3539.186,--Are you saying that even--
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3539.186,3542.355,Even if it was agreed by treaty to give it conclusive effect?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3542.355,3551.628,"If the Senate agreed that this was self-executing, then you would have the height of the Presidency and Congress working together."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3562.084,3588.384,"--Then we couldn't have a treaty with another country on the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgment, because the other country might get it wrong, we might disagree with its interpretation of the law, and, therefore, unlike the rest of the world, the United States can't get the advantage of a reciprocal guarantee that our judgments will be respected, and in turn we will respect your judgment."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3588.384,3595.49,"In enforcing foreign judgments, the foreign court is not purporting to make a definitive determination of U.S. law."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3595.49,3604.596,"It may be that if the case turns on a question of U.S. law, and we may think, as many think about the ICJ, that they got that question wrong."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3648.042,3659.498,"Justice Ginsburg, it has been the consistent position of the United States for over four decades from the day this treaty was ratified that the Optional Protocol was not self-executing, was not enforceable in U.S. courts."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3672.173,3686.417,"I thought you said that... oh, you said that this is a matter of goodwill or that most ICJ judgments... ICJ judgments, they're not binding but people comply... nations comply with them as a matter of goodwill?"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3686.417,3688.15,"--Justice Ginsburg, that's exactly correct."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3694.637,3702.259,"What could... other than... I mean, the most logical place to have this go on is the court that rendered the judgment."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3721.238,3726.042,--There are three avenues that the President could have chosen that would have been constitutional.
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3735.481,3736.683,Let's start with the first one.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3743.436,3752.109,--This Court has made clear that the Federal Government cannot expand the jurisdiction of the State courts.
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3752.959,3758.529,But you can have the Federal court overseeing the State court and telling the State what to do?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3768.821,3769.604,"--Well, and--"
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3769.604,3770.821,"--or to say Federal courts, you do it."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3770.821,3772.404,--A corollary--
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3772.404,3779.475,"A lot of people think that's exactly right, that really we expanded Federal habeas jurisdiction quite improperly."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3782.443,3783.979,--It does.
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3796.852,3799.304,Who would be doing the review?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3799.304,3806.244,"Well, if it were a Federal right to review, under Testa versus Katt, both the State and Federal courts would give review."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3817.683,3824.706,A law passed by Congress saying Texas dispense with your procedural bar rules?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3824.706,3840.381,--A law passed by Congress saying in order to give effect to the Avena judgments the 51 Mexican nationals at issue shall be entitled to review and reconsideration of whether there was prejudice from the denial of the Vienna Convention.
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3886.962,3889.898,So what's absent in your view is Congress.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3892.35,3893.083,Absolutely--
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3893.083,3900.956,"--and Texas could have been ordered, but the President doesn't have the authority to do it just on the basis of the ICJ,--"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3900.956,3906.776,"--And Justice Ginsburg, I think a powerful parallel is the decision of this Court last near in Hamdan."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3932.158,3962.594,"--The not self-executing in the position of the State Department, wasn't there... in the parallel proceedings in Oklahoma, wasn't there a letter from the current... the then current legal adviser telling Oklahoma that this is a judgment that's binding on all courts in the United States, State and Federal, and that the President has directed Oklahoma to comply?"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3966.981,3974.318,"This letter was sent out to all affected States, but it is... the United States is quite candid in what they are doing."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4002.987,4004.706,Which... which letter are you quoting?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4005.723,4010.427,"I'm quoting the United States' brief in this proceeding, page 6 of the brief."
2007.06-984,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4036.043,4043.231,"Mr. Cruz, you have frequently emphasized the non-self-executing character of the optional protocol."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4059.658,4069.716,"This Court has the final authority to determine what Federal law is, and so if this Court determines that that's what the treaty requires, then that be federal law."
2007.06-984,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4072.834,4075.37,These treaties including the optional protocol.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4075.37,4079.987,"--In my judgment, if the Court reached that conclusion it would be error."
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4080.454,4082.373,I think you misunderstood.
2007.06-984,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4089.795,4090.395,That's right.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4091.045,4094.597,--In my judgment it would be wholly illegitimate for the Court to do so.
2007.06-984,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4094.597,4095.297,Why?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4095.297,4096.448,Because--
2007.06-984,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4096.448,4101.151,What's the rule... what is the positive rule of international and domestic law that precludes it?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4101.151,4107.424,"--The rule is a constitutional rule, that the President makes treaties the Senate advises and consents."
2007.06-984,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4108.256,4109.024,They've made the treaty.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4114.328,4121.981,"--The limitations the Senate put on are it as much a part of the treaty as the treaty itself, and the consequences--"
2007.06-984,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4121.981,4135.908,"But you're... my point is, my... I'm accepting as premise of the question the limitation which you assert, i.e., non-self-executing; and my question is, may the execution, if you will, be made by this Court?"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4140.395,4146.399,"--If this Court did so, in my judgment it would be usurping the role of Congress."
2007.06-984,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4148.667,4153.87,I don't mean to be disrespectful of your judgment but what do you base it on... tradition?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4153.87,4167.795,"--The essence of the decision by the Senate to say something is non-self-executing is to say if something in this treaty is going to change U.S. domestic law, you have to come back to us."
2007.06-984,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4167.795,4172.948,"You're saying by... by non-self-executing, they mean you have to come back to us?"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4173.466,4174.533,That's exactly what it means.
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4177.667,4181.904,They mean it does not automatically become part of United States law.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4181.904,4182.988,Indeed.
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4182.988,4188.475,"And it follows from that, that you have to change United States law?"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4188.475,4189.341,Exactly.
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4189.341,4194.379,And it is not the function of this Court to change United States law.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4194.379,4194.696,That's precisely correct.
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4194.696,4223.815,"If you assume it is self-executing, just for one second, I'd like to find out... you said that the President was unreasonable in a sense of saying Texas do that over again... I assume the reason he asked Texas to have the hearing is because the ICJ knew... and I guess maybe he knew... that the only hearing they'd had on this subject... as far as I can see; I looked at it, there didn't seem to be any evidence in respect to their finding that there was no prejudice."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4227.95,4229.117,He had two lawyers.
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4229.117,4229.719,He had two lawyers.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4231.602,4235.206,And they vigorously defended him.
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4235.206,4236.49,"Okay, they vigorously defended him."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4236.49,4237.673,The only argument--
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4237.673,4237.992,Fine.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4239.675,4242.294,"--With respect, Justice Breyer, there actually is."
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4242.294,4242.827,There is?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4243.895,4244.861,The evidence there is--
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4244.861,4246.045,I read the whole thing.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4246.045,4248.763,--In our appendix there is an affidavit from the Mexican Consulate.
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4271.713,4300.398,What I'm thinking of is the evidence at the first habeas hearing that led the district judge to reach his conclusion that there was no prejudice and that the procedural default was not excused... it's in that hearing that I didn't see what that finding was based on; and I suppose the reason that the President wanted Texas to do it is it would be easiest for Texas to go back to that.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4300.398,4305.969,"Justice Breyer... it was part of the State court record, and it was the basis for saying there was no prejudice."
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4305.969,4307.052,It was in the first hearing.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4307.052,4308.119,I believe it was.
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4310.104,4313.456,So you think there was no reason for the ICJ to ask the President--
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4313.456,4315.408,It is difficult to explain.
2007.06-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4315.408,4326.799,"Was the basis for the determination of no prejudice the fact that the Petitioner in this case had received full Miranda warnings, which went beyond what the consulate was going to tell him?"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4326.799,4329.399,"That is completely correct, and he waived those in writing."
2007.06-984,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4329.399,4331.634,And he had lived in this country for how long?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4331.634,4333.286,Practically his entire life.
2007.06-984,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4338.088,4340.79,--And what did happen to the lawyers Texas gave him?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4340.79,4352.165,"Both of them vigorously defended him, and in Medellin we devoted several pages of our brief to going through in considerable detail the many motions they filed."
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4356.652,4367.44,"And so they have... the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals didn't adopt a simple solution of the case, to say He got all the protection; that there's no prejudice and therefore there's no treaty violation."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4367.44,4374.696,"--The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals didn't have it as option to say, it would have been easier, one might say, to just go along."
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4386.218,4406.048,"Yes, but that statute really would not have divested... if I understand he Texas law correctly... if you did agree... which you don't, I know... that there was a preexisting Federal obligation to honor judgments of the ICJ, then under Testa v Katt principle and Howlett opinion and others, the Texas court would have had jurisdiction."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4406.048,4412.202,"Although that holding would be, I would suggest, in considerable tension if not directly contrary to Sanchez-Llamas."
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4412.202,4414.821,"Well, but Sanchez-Llamas doesn't deal with the judgment."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4417.289,4419.058,Oregon is as much a part of the United States as Texas.
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4419.058,4423.093,--Then I think the Texas... there would be jurisdiction in the Texas court to entertain this claim.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4426.379,4440.138,"I do not, because it has to be a new claim, and if this were a judgment, the judgment... Plaintiff's Co-Counsel: It would be a new claim based on a new judgment which was after Sanchez... the Chief Justice's opinion in that case."
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4445.423,4479.596,"Well, I'm... you just... for... putting the President's assertion to one side, it seems to me if you did agree... and I know you vigorously don't... that there were a pre-existing Federal obligation... an obligation of the United States to respect the judgment of the ICJ, which is... which we think is wrong as a matter of international law; we have previously construed the treaties to the contrary... but if there were an independent obligation to expect... Federal obligation... respect that judgment, it seems to me that that obligation could be enforced in Federal court."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4479.596,4480.429,"I don't disagree with that, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4480.429,4481.048,You don't.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4481.048,4483.917,If... although I disagree with the premise.
2007.06-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4483.917,4484.15,Yes.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4484.15,4486.2,"But if the premise were true, I don't disagree with the conclusion."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4519.052,4519.902,"--Yes, there is."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4528.658,4533.062,"--I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg, but the United States does not."
2007.06-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4545.287,4549.739,Thank you.
2007.06-984,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4549.739,4556.76,How many parties to Avena... there were 51... are being held in the State of Texas?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4556.76,4557.777,There are 51.
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4568.652,4575.556,"And Oklahoma has taken the opposite position, and they... they did give the review and reconsideration?"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4575.556,4576.206,That's correct.
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4576.206,4578.508,And has any other State acted?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4578.508,4580.876,"Not that we're aware of, no."
2007.06-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4591.082,4601.54,"Well, the fact that they're on... on death row isn't at all significant because the judgment of the ICJ purports to vacate the convictions as well; isn't that correct?"
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4601.54,4610.044,"That's exactly right; and, in fact, in Paragraph 34 of Avena it asserted the authority to annul U.S. criminal convictions."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4613.229,4619.668,I thought the ICJ flatly refused Mexican... Mexico said ICJ annulled the judgment.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4630.023,4633.909,"--Justice Ginsburg, you're correct they did not order the annulment."
2007.06-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4638.846,4639.596,I'm looking at page--
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4639.596,4640.248,--not to in this case.
2007.06-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4640.248,4641.731,--I'm looking at page 186.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4645.45,4646.069,That's correct.
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4676.254,4682.492,"Their very own statute, the statute setting up the ICJ, makes it clear that is not the case."
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4691.514,4694.716,--But they can issue a decision that can be enforced by the Security Council.
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4696.335,4697.568,Has that ever happened?
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4697.568,4706.273,"--It has gone... for example, in the Nicaragua case, there was an effort to take it to the Security Council there."
2007.06-984,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4706.273,4707.607,And the U.S. exercised its veto.
2007.06-984,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4707.607,4708.475,Correct.
2007.06-984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4734.71,4736.81,"Thank you, Mr. Cruz."
2007.06-984,3,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,4741.614,4742.847,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-984,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4886.341,4892.495,"I read the Comegys case, however you say it, to be for the exact opposite proposition."
2007.06-984,3,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,4906.069,4913.575,"But that's because that was not part of what the court had actually decided, or rather that the international adjudication had actually decided."
2007.06-984,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4964.774,4969.578,"Put precisely, it would be making it Federal law and then applying it."
2007.06-984,3,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,4981.886,4984.652,"--That assumes that it is not self-executing, yes."
2007.06-984,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4985.485,4986.285,"Yes, yes, yes."
2007.06-984,3,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,4986.285,4991.653,--when we're talking about self-executing here we're saying what branch is the obligation directed to.
2007.06-984,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5000.426,5006.829,--Then what you are saying if I understand you is that Justice Scalia was wrong when he said that would be making it Federal law.
2007.06-984,3,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,5016.304,5017.437,That's exactly right.
2007.06-984,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5023.891,5025.993,What is the authority... I get back to where I started.
2007.06-984,3,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,5037.634,5043.954,"Well, it's settled that a treaty cannot contravene an affirmative constitutional obligation."
2007.06-984,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5046.906,5051.643,But it can... it can contravene our interpretation of the treaty as a matter of Federal law.
2007.06-984,3,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,5051.643,5053.627,--There are two different treaty obligations.
2007.06-984,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5086.464,5090.018,Do we have the authority to interpret the judgment of the ICJ?
2007.06-984,3,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,5090.018,5093.137,--The courts in enforcing that judgment would.
2007.06-984,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5112.366,5122.157,"So we have the authority to interpret it, we have the authority to construe whether it's carry to the Constitution, but we do not the authority to consider whether it's consistent with Federal law?"
2007.06-984,3,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,5122.157,5127.025,"That's right, because that's the very nature of enforcing a judgment: You do not re-examine the merits."
2007.06-984,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5179.493,5181.521,"Thank you, Mr. Donovan."
2007.06-984,3,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,5181.521,5180.976,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-984,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5180.976,5181.826,The case is submitted.
