1971.70-5344,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.98,"-- hear arguments next in 70-5344, Willis against Prudential."
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,17.097,19.796,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.865,335.702,Could your -- could your client come under any of these?
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,335.702,336.357,"No, sir."
1971.70-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,359.194,362.625,The problem I have is this.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,389.203,390.059,They have declared it.
1971.70-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,435.367,443.825,"Well, are you contending then that conceivably, the application of the new act of Congress could be unconstitutional in some circumstances?"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,443.825,454.821,"My contention is, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that the new statute does not cover the facts of this case except it would exclude the child in this instance."
1971.70-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,492.129,513.472,"Well, it does follow as Mr. -- my brother Rehnquist -- the question suggest then that your ultimate claim is that that statute is unconstitutional or if the -- if the statute had been in existence at the time that your claim arose, you would still be making your constitutional claim and the -- and it would be --"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,513.472,513.527,There is a direct --
1971.70-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.527,517.248,-- an absolute claim if the statute wasn't constitutionally inadequate.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,517.248,517.523,That is correct.
1971.70-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,517.523,518.51,Wouldn't that be true?
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,518.51,526.178,Don't you -- don't you -- I thought that (Inaudible) statute required was some definitive proof of parenthood?
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,526.178,528.54,It -- it requires definitive proof of --
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.54,530.592,(Voice Overlap) making in the -- in this very litigation.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,530.592,531.463,"No, sir."
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.75,533.31,Why?
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,533.31,541.48,Because of the fact that this necessitated something on the -- some action on the part of the father which the father in case had not done.
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.196,545.405,I mean under --
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,545.405,545.541,-- anyone.
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.541,549.917,"-- the new federal statute, it is not enough just to have -- have proof of parenthood?"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,549.917,551.061,"No, sir."
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.96,578.224,"Well, what about the mother?"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,578.224,582.718,The mother's -- the federal statute does not reach the situation of the mother.
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.941,585.013,"Well, for the --"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,585.013,585.324,-- to be done by the father.
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,585.324,586.83,What about the testimony of the mother?
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,587.994,592.565,"That would not suffice at all under the new federal statute, the 1971 Act."
1971.70-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,600.562,603.97,"So that once the father is dead, all chances of coverage --"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,603.97,604.259,That's correct.
1971.70-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,604.259,605.808,-- under that amendment disappear.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,605.808,606.337,That is correct.
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,631.114,650.378,So you could in effect then -- Congress has said that it's not a denial of due process of law to -- for the federal government or for the federal law to distinguish between unacknowledged and acknowledged illegitimates.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,650.378,652.137,"Well, they have not said so expressly but --"
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,652.137,652.24,"Well, it's not her fault."
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,652.24,653.935,-- the necessary effect -- the necessary effect.
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.935,655.527,"In fact, this language didn't make that contention."
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,655.527,656.417,That's right.
1971.70-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,658.923,669.593,"And it is true, Mr. Leverett, isn't it, that once the father had died without having gone through some acknowledgement procedure that your problems of proof do become exacerbated?"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,669.593,683.495,"That is certainly true, but by the same token where there has been an acknowledgement in orally or where there has been as in this case, a written statement agreeing to be responsible for lying-in expenses."
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.658,714.726,"But if you say that the federal law controls this case, where -- and as my brother Stewart says that, where do you find the federal law?"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,714.726,715.088,"No, sir."
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.416,723.402,"It might be so, I -- I just put the federal law does."
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,723.402,724.193,"Alright, sir."
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.993,730.25,How do you construe the word “children” in this insurance policy?
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,730.25,735.113,You construe in the light of the context in which the statutory term appears.
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.394,741.493,(Voice Overlap)
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,741.493,742.451,-- purpose of Congress here.
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.451,749.1,But the statute says the word “children” would not include and acknowledge illegitimates.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,749.1,749.309,No.
1971.70-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.357,783.292,"Well really, it -- it's your position then that the 1971 amendment far from broadening the construction that you contend governed before actually narrowed it."
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,783.292,806.4,"Well, the 1971 amendment is relevant to my case only to the extent that the contention is made that certiorari should be dismissed as improvidently granted because of the fact that since Congress has now solved the problem as to the future, the problem has become one of an isolated character, not meeting the requirements of the Court for certiorari adjudication."
1971.70-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,810.499,818.162,But on -- on the merits of your argument you're arguing that the federal law prior to the 1971 amendment supports recovery by your client.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,818.162,818.929,Correct.
1971.70-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,818.929,823.921,"And then we look at the 1971 amendment and we see that under it, your client could not recover."
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,831.995,832.831,Correct.
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,884.965,885.112,Would you say that --
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,885.112,886.03,Several act --
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,886.03,890.925,-- would you say that Reed against Reed of last term would also support your position?
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,890.925,893.356,"That one, I have not read, sir."
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,893.356,894.922,I suggest you look at it.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,894.922,898.021,"Alright, sir."
1971.70-5344,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1176.482,1180.393,We'll suspend until after lunch counsel.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1180.908,1184.284,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.311,1369.581,What do you do with DeSylva?
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1369.581,1370.796,I'm coming to that now.
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.333,1403.661,"Well, it's not a matter -- wasn't that a question of whether the right to renew a copyright descended to illegitimates as well as legitimate children?"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1403.661,1405.104,"That is correct, sir."
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.224,1495.691,"Well, would -- would you -- if this case came up today, if the serviceman died today, would your beneficiary be covered?"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1495.691,1498.902,"No, sir, because there was no formal acknowledgement."
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1522.858,1528.992,"Well, what could a -- what could an appellate court do when it's -- the question before it is what does the statute mean?"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1538.33,1539.885,"Well, I don't think --"
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1539.885,1546.699,And should the appellate court take the law as it is when the case is decided or -- or what?
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1546.699,1560.408,I don't think you could say that because Congress decided in 1971 that illegitimate children will be included only in four or five different specific categories that it must have meant the same thing in 1965 when it just used the words “child or children.”
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.408,1561.654,"Well, what if it didn't know."
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1566.96,1567.364,Yes.
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1572.117,1572.457,Alright.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1572.457,1572.777,And the last section --
1971.70-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1572.777,1574.104,It's the fact that --
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1574.104,1575.62,"That's right, sir."
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1576.645,1579.962,"Mr. Leverett, let me interrupt you in one respect."
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1588.382,1588.733,In one category.
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1588.733,1589.686,Is it --
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1589.686,1598.985,One category where it deals with next of kin according the laws of the domicile of the serviceman's or rather according to the laws of the serviceman's domicile.
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1607.235,1607.32,"Well, if --"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1607.32,1613.981,-- expressio unius argument that what Congress intended to refer to state law in the SGLI.
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1618.626,1627.016,"In the fifth category, it goes to the executor or administrator of the estate which means it would then descend according to state intestacy law."
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1627.016,1627.893,"That's right, sir."
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1627.893,1628.989,Or under his will.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1628.989,1629.516,"That's right, sir."
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1629.516,1631.641,So there are two --
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1631.641,1631.742,"In that sense, yes."
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1631.742,1635.605,-- category in which it clearly goes under state law.
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1635.605,1639.146,But by expressed reference to state law.
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1740.228,1744.568,Suppose it were 51-to-49 percent would you make the same argument?
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1744.568,1747.27,"Well, they would be certainly be weakened somewhat."
1971.70-5344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1748.868,1751.83,"It is bound to be as differential, isn't it?"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1751.83,1753.008,To some extent.
1971.70-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.147,1786.553,"In this particular case, Mr. Leverett the -- the proceeds of the policy were paid out, were they not?"
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1786.553,1788.297,To the father of the deceased sense.
1971.70-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1788.297,1789.541,Was he Black or White?
1971.70-5344,0,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1789.541,1794.115,He was Black.
1971.70-5344,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1820.393,1823.201,"Thank you, Mr. Leverett."
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,1824.536,1826.616,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1971.70-5344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.269,1883.693,Well the Georgia trial court found that he was.
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,1883.693,1885.58,The Georgia trial court found that he was and the Georgia --
1971.70-5344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.58,1887.608,That was upheld by the Georgia Court of Appeals.
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,1887.608,1889.654,"Yes, sir, it -- it was."
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2150.377,2160.532,"(Voice Overlap) If I ask you please, under the federal Act as amended, a child includes an illegitimate child under certain circumstances."
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2160.532,2161.729,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.729,2166.356,So it's not that the word “child” doesn't ever include illegitimate children.
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2166.356,2167.253,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2168.063,2176.924,And it -- it sets up some standards for approving who -- whether -- whether the child is actually a child.
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2176.924,2180.234,"That -- that's correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.234,2186.19,Has it been denied in this case that this child is a child of the deceased serviceman?
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2186.19,2190.58,"Well, as I pointed out initially it's not clear in our position."
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2204.565,2205.231,Well what if I --
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2205.231,2205.286,Sir.
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.286,2209.044,What if it were admitted?
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2209.044,2215.671,"Well, under the 1971 amendment, I -- I don't know whether they would fall under any of the categories or not --"
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.671,2225.028,"Well, let's assume that they didn't and that an addition, that the -- the aim of the Act is to have a satisfactory proof of whether the --"
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2225.028,2225.525,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.063,2227.27,-- child was a child.
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2227.27,2227.891,Right.
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2229.8,2243.718,Do you think -- and do you think the Act would forbid then making the child in this case a beneficiary under the policy even though the insurance company defendant admitted that he was a child.
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2243.718,2245.869,"Well, now that's -- Mr. Leverett makes that position."
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.762,2272.767,And it wouldn't make a difference even if the defendant conceded it.
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2272.767,2275.038,I don't think so under the meaning of this Act.
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.734,2296.095,And even if under state -- even if under state law this child would be -- with -- well would be treated as a child.

1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2299.957,2300.254,Right.

1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2332.281,2334.306,"But the person down the line, yes, sir."
1971.70-5344,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2396.314,2404.796,"At any time up to the point of his death, he could have changed the beneficiary and made the mother of these children the beneficiary, could he?"
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2404.796,2405.3,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-5344,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2405.382,2406.757,Or the children or both?
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2406.757,2408.421,"Or anyone he wanted to, yes sir."
1971.70-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2409.651,2417.877,Is there anything in the record here that shows the relationship between the deceased serviceman and his father?
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2423.838,2425.609,"Your Honor, I don't think that it does."
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2494.958,2502.913,"And the same -- under the 1971 Act, the same rule would apply if -- if he doesn't make beneficiaries as his children?"

1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.398,2514.0,"Well, the problem here is that he didn't name any beneficiary."
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2514.0,2519.017,"Right, he just checked that block that says to follow in accordance to the precedence set forth in the law."
1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.017,2522.781,"Well, what if he says, “My children?”"

1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2589.852,2594.099,"Well, no, really it doesn't."

1971.70-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.56,2959.171,"So under the 1971 amendment if the -- if the illegitimate child offers proof that he was actually a child of the dead serviceman, the Court just won't hear him?"
1971.70-5344,1,16291,a_felton_jenkins_jr,,2959.171,2959.663,"Yes, sir."
