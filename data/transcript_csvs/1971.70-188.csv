1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,64.022,67.946,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,141.444,143.504,The -- there was a Negro school in the city also.
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,143.504,153.376,"There was one Negro school in the city which had been the old high school or the training school doubling this high school and other school and there-- there's a -- as far as the high school is concerned, it was replaced by new school."
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,158.569,160.573,What part of Virginia is this county (Voice Overlap) --
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,160.573,164.175,Greensville County is on this North Carolina line.
1971.70-188,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,170.752,172.636,"So, it's fairly close to Scotland Neck?"
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,172.636,174.901,"It's quite close to Scotland Neck, yes."
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,244.461,247.496,And if you said it -- say it -- it was a town and it --
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,247.496,247.526,Well --
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,247.526,248.297,-- became a city --
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,248.297,250.101,Became a city while this case was pending.
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,250.101,250.459,Right.
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,251.859,252.067,Which I don't --
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.067,254.981,"Now, that didn't happen automatically just when it reached a certain size (Voice Overlap) --"
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,254.981,256.012,"Well, if they had the (Inaudible)."
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,256.012,257.87,It took action by the --
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,257.87,258.043,But in --
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,258.043,258.296,-- by the --
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,258.296,260.918,-- in the local court to show that reaches a population of 5000.
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.918,263.123,They had to have this population of 5000 but wouldn't they --
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,263.123,268.22,"It really doesn't make a lot of difference because as a town, they could've operated the separate school system if they had wanted to."
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.22,268.878,"Well, they could."
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,268.878,269.663,They could have.
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,273.099,282.023,"Well, but under Virginia law, when a -- when a municipality becomes a city, then it -- then -- then governmentally, it changes, then it's no longer a part of the county."
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,282.023,284.326,"It's not a -- it's in -- politically independent of the county, that is true."
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,284.326,284.973,Right.
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,286.639,289.697,"It's not politically independent, that's correct."
1971.70-188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1048.282,1049.271,Mr. Tucker?
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1049.271,1050.642,"Yes, sir?"
1971.70-188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.642,1055.631,You're saying that the Court of Appeals was operating under a misapprehension here.
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1059.217,1060.951,District Court's findings support of the position.
1971.70-188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1064.944,1069.387,Was there -- was there an express finding as to motivation by the District Court?
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1069.387,1073.049,The District Court found that the -- he found the order is mixed.
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1166.735,1167.453,"Mr. Tucker, are you --"
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1167.453,1167.97,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1167.97,1186.55,I'm not clear whether you're now taking issue with the allocation of students entirely within Emporia or whether you're talking about the indict on the whole school district as it were or was before Emporia was carved out?
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1186.55,1192.213,"Well, I think there's a little difficulty to keep the two separate because one -- one bears on the other anyhow."
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1192.213,1198.453,"Yes, but I -- I -- your -- your last remarks that in the figures you were giving."
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1216.095,1230.512,"I might -- I -- I find it difficult to really think that the figures and vicinities make no difference but, when I look at the entire picture of whatever happens in Emporia to increase the white majority is -- wanted to increase the black majority in the counties."
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1260.3,1263.936,"Well, are you suggesting a reverse flight that is a county flight into the city --"
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1263.936,1264.316,I am suggesting that.
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1264.316,1265.31,-- of white pupils.
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1265.31,1274.739,"That -- that's what would -- would happen and I think the -- I think that's fairly what the -- what the Council meant when it was trying to negotiate with the city, whit -- with this county."
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1274.739,1275.011,"Well, I want (Voice Overlap) --"
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1275.011,1279.335,But to get the buildings and promising the county children they come in on a tuition basis and so forth.
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1279.335,1290.156,Forgive me again so I have it clear in my mind what is the composition of the Emporia schools?
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1290.156,1290.402,I -- I --
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1290.402,1293.059,"Just within Emporia, what is the breakdown?"
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1293.059,1294.297,At present of what the --
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1294.297,1294.326,At the -- at --
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1294.326,1296.015,-- of what the Emporia proposed.
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1296.015,1297.621,-- at the present and what -- what was before it.
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1297.621,1305.912,"At the present, the -- the plan that the plaintiffs proposed and the -- and the District Court approved is in operation and it has been in operation for two and a half years."
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1325.205,1334.183,And what are those figures at present in Emporia -- within the City of Emporia?
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1334.183,1351.644,"I -- as I said that -- that these at the present, the best figures that we have is that the city had 543 white children and 580 Negro children."
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1356.994,1358.04,What's the figure again?
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1358.625,1370.282,"728 white, 1888 black."
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1370.282,1382.166,"But Mr. Tucker, as the situation is now, the two schools in the City of Emporia are serving first grades one, two and three for the whole county (Voice Overlap) --"
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1382.166,1383.23,That's correct.
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1383.23,1391.761,"And what's the percentage of Negro and what's the percentage of white people in that primary school, do you know?"
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1391.761,1394.516,As the record -- though our -- our updated figures which is --
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1394.516,1395.591,"Well, whatever -- whatever the judging --"
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1395.591,1396.072,But the record will show --
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1396.072,1397.497,-- that you will not be exact of course.
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1397.497,1405.842,"The record would show on page 28, 297 of the appendix."
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1416.405,1417.21,Would be about the same?
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1417.21,1421.971,44.9% white and 55.1% Negro.
1971.70-188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1421.971,1425.736,Because some good many children don't go through high school?
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1425.736,1447.905,That -- that's quite a bit of -- we'd like to suggest that the method that the circuit used to -- divine purpose from projection was -- was not a valid method that the only -- the best way we know what people's purpose are -- as what they say the -- the purpose is at the time they're making the decision.
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1555.34,1555.66,We'll --
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1555.66,1556.396,-- was correct --
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1556.396,1563.163,"-- we'll continue there after lunch, Mr. Tucker."
1971.70-188,0,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,1564.052,1567.19,We would to submit -- I'll save the rest of our counter rebuttal.
1971.70-188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1567.19,1571.337,Very well.
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1572.68,1576.581,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1750.977,1758.961,"When you say it automatically became a school district, could the -- had any option about it?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1758.961,1786.387,"There are some provisions in the state statutes of Virginia and under Section 133 of the Constitution of Virginia which with the consent of two governing bodies, two independent governing bodies such as two cities or city in an adjoining county, there may be a joint school board in which both the city and the county as the case might be, would have a representation."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.109,1827.63,"But they -- I take it that under Virginia law, a school district like the Emporia became -- could contract with the adjoining county without joining with it in a joint school board, could contract for educational services to city children."
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1827.63,1828.031,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.89,1849.3,So -- so --
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1849.3,1849.825,-- representation from --
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.825,1856.329,"-- so, you make Emporia since 1965 and then acting in conflict with that statute?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1856.329,1859.56,1967 was when Emporia became a city.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1859.56,1860.269,Alright.Constitute --
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1860.269,1861.403,And at that -- yes.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.397,1877.827,Yes.
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1877.827,1886.273,Because of problems that existed at that time largely having to do with the availability of school buildings.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.205,1931.05,"Now, is that -- that contract has been the subject for litigation in the Virginia Court?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1931.05,1934.762,It is presently before the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.762,1936.083,And there's no decision?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1936.083,1936.696,No decision.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.696,1936.745,What would be --
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1936.745,1938.596,"It has not been argued, the briefs had been filed."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.596,1940.657,What was the decision of the lower court?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1940.657,1948.621,"The lower court said that contracts of this, I'll try to quote, “Contracts of this type are unconstitutional."
1971.70-188,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.621,1974.898,"Mr. Warriner, am I wrong in thinking that the Town of Emporia when it reached the population level did have an option as whether to elect to become a city or not?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,1974.898,1976.261,That is correct.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.902,2025.96,But was there --
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2025.96,2027.027,-- when that law became effective.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.027,2034.241,Was there any allegations in this case or any findings by the District Court that the decision to become a city had anything to do with the school to join?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2034.241,2038.362,"No allegation, no claim and no finding."
1971.70-188,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2071.123,2075.793,The Circuit Court covers or can cover in Virginia more than one county?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2075.793,2076.23,It does.
1971.70-188,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2078.286,2078.342,Right.
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2078.342,2080.987,-- and two cities.
1971.70-188,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2134.74,2138.674,I -- I don't -- I'm not sure I get that.
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2138.674,2144.613,The city school system would be 55% black and 45% white as of this school year.
1971.70-188,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2144.613,2147.73,If what you wanted to prevail should prevail.
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2147.73,2148.027,That's correct.
1971.70-188,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.027,2154.174,"And it would have prevailed, it would be 55% black 45% white in all through or --"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2154.174,2159.747,"All through the city school system because you see, we would have the simplest type of unitary system."
1971.70-188,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2179.295,2189.404,"So, except insofar as it might be affected by drop outs in the higher grades in the high school, that percentage would pretty well carry through from grade one through grade 12?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2189.404,2190.061,That is correct.
1971.70-188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2202.001,2205.236,When did the District Court plan going to effect?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2205.236,2210.581,The District Court plan was to go into effect in the fall of 1969.
1971.70-188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2214.952,2216.657,You've said “was to.”
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2220.153,2220.877,Did it go into effect?
1971.70-188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.181,2221.57,Yes.
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2225.895,2226.363,I'm sorry.
1971.70-188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2226.363,2230.219,It -- it went into effect and the Court of Appeals did not stay the order?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2230.219,2231.405,That's correct.
1971.70-188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.136,2272.599,"Now, you said that if the School Board, the Emporia City plan had gone into effect, it would've been 55:45?"

1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2279.557,2285.13,"In fact, now, the ratio is 66% black, 34% white."
1971.70-188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2285.13,2291.073,That's because of the going outside the city into the county?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2291.073,2292.333,That's -- yes.

1971.70-188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.984,2342.691,"Yes, sir."

1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2389.296,2389.829,"No, sir."
1971.70-188,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2393.612,2395.581,And no city children in the county schools?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2395.581,2396.185,None.

1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2446.895,2447.546,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2461.179,2461.513,"So, you --"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2461.513,2461.834,-- in their ruling.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2461.834,2465.616,-- what kind of a ruling had voting control of the joint board?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2465.616,2474.356,I would suspect in all fairness that the county should have voting control of the joint board because its population is roughly two-to-one that of the city.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.356,2479.388,Did the county give a reason for rejecting the proposal?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2479.388,2481.257,"No, Your Honor, they did not."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.257,2484.542,"Well, anyway, it's not in the record."
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2484.542,2487.125,"It's not in the record and so far as I know, they didn't give a reason."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.446,2571.204,Did the District Court purport to make -- issue any opinion on the legality of the contract arrangements?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2571.204,2572.816,"No, it did not, Your Honor."

1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.107,2597.054,"Well, but how about the money?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2597.054,2603.869,We have to pay -- the order said that we should pay out “proportionate or proper share.”
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2651.391,2654.024,Is the plan has been in operation at all?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2654.024,2659.381,Since June the 25th of 1969 when it was entered by the District Court.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.381,2663.659,As a county that appropriating funds to implement the plan?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2663.659,2665.427,The city has been appropriating funds?
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.427,2666.774,"Well, the county?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2666.774,2667.887,"Oh, yes."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2667.887,2669.224,"I mean, for transportation?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2672.095,2680.504,"Well, it involves bussing of city children out into the county to county schools and the City has had to pay its proportionate share of that."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.504,2688.738,"And -- and readily, City Councils have minutes that they were careful, a county wouldn't seriously implement the plan."
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2688.738,2689.866,That is correct.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2689.866,2691.265,But they are?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2691.265,2697.987,"If Your Honor please, there's a difference between carrying out the mechanics of a plan and carrying out the spirit of a plan."
1971.70-188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2745.929,2751.102,"As I understand, did you tell me that no county stood in obeying the system?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2751.102,2752.137,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2752.137,2758.159,"Well, on -- one of the dissenting opinions says that you have a transfer plan?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2758.159,2758.313,If Your Honor please --
1971.70-188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2758.313,2760.062,That -- is that an error?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,2760.062,2761.277,That is in error.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3056.075,3094.27,"Let's assume that is a part of the District Court's plan, the Court had -- had ordered, I'm not suggesting it had the power to or not suggesting it didn't but suppose it had ordered that the county make available to the city a proportionate share based on students, a proportionate share or representation on the County School Board, and that the money that the city was going to contribute, let's assume was passed in terms of anybody's judgment, would you still be here?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3094.27,3095.707,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.658,3134.103,"Well, it may not have cured it but you offered to do it once."
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3134.103,3134.144,Yes --
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.144,3136.306,You wanted to do it once that was rejected?

1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3139.702,3141.294,Why -- why wouldn't of that argument?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3149.528,3151.992,"Well, we first say it's been withdrawn."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.448,3159.325,And what was -- has changed your mind?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3159.325,3170.084,"The experience that we've had with the county has changed our mind and the case of Green, the (Inaudible) has changed our minds."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.11,3217.249,What's the composition of the County School Board?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3217.249,3218.69,Insofar as race is concerned?
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3218.69,3219.299,Yes.
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3220.123,3225.424,"There are four people on this County -- County School Board, three of them are white and one of them is black."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3225.424,3228.541,And what's the population of the county?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3228.541,3231.043,Population of the county is above 9000.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.043,3232.869,Divided between blacks --
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3232.869,3237.194,"Roughly, 50:50."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.822,3307.518,But do you say that the -- do you say then that the desire to maintain a racial balance in the school acceptable to the white population is not a factor in this case as in -- as it is said to be in the Scotland Neck?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3307.518,3311.062,"If it is a factor in this case, it's a most muted one."
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3315.851,3318.267,"Well, what did the Court of Appeals say about that?"
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3318.267,3321.551,They didn't make any observation on that that I can recall.
1971.70-188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3321.551,3323.172,And how about the District Court?
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3323.172,3324.673,Nor did the District Court.
1971.70-188,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3353.01,3355.063,Are there private schools or --
1971.70-188,1,21715,d_dortch_warriner,,3355.063,3358.89,We have managed to keep them out of our county and city up to now.

1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3371.927,3371.956,That's right.
1971.70-188,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3371.956,3373.645,-- case started?
1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3383.797,3384.904,I think it had.
1971.70-188,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3384.904,3388.371,"Or it had the other -- well, it makes it easier."
1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3426.374,3428.835,"Well, if Your Honor please, I live there."
1971.70-188,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3434.067,3435.048,"Well, but suppose they had --"
1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3435.048,3435.424,But suppose they had --
1971.70-188,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3435.424,3445.743,"-- hypothetical question, would the District Court now have the power to do what it did?"
1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3445.743,3449.759,I think it probably would have had the power.
1971.70-188,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3526.39,3534.942,Do you agree that -- that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals found that race was a factor in the --
1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3534.942,3542.385,The District Court found that the -- that the Emporia's plan of proposal was racially motivated.
1971.70-188,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3553.645,3554.276,And the Court of Appeals --
1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3554.276,3567.387,"On page 307 -- 307 of the appendix, right in the middle of the page, “The Court finds that in a sense, race was a factor into this city's decision to secede.”"
1971.70-188,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3567.387,3574.938,But the Court of Appeals said the record does not intend for -- Emporia chose to become a city in order to prevent or diminish integration.
1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3574.938,3580.515,The Court of Appeals furnished the Board and the District Court's finding that race was a factor.
1971.70-188,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3580.515,3583.506,But that was -- is the decision to become a city.
1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3584.662,3589.325,"Or the decision, this is to become a city, I -- I think it's Immaterial to our consideration here."
1971.70-188,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3589.325,3589.375,You don't say that --

1971.70-188,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3591.723,3592.646,"Yes, alright."
1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3592.646,3597.331,-- is the thing that the District Court was addressing -- which found race as been a motivating factor.
1971.70-188,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3655.196,3669.24,"Mr. Turner -- Mr. Tucker, your reference to the District Court's finding on page 307A, you have a couple words out and I wanted to ask you what they meant."
1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3685.138,3689.188,"Well, my -- well, it's difficult for me to say what Judge Meritt meant."

1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3721.038,3721.265,That's correct.
1971.70-188,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3721.265,3737.332,-- testified that part of the -- part of the desire was to have a quality school system that would hold the -- hold the residents -- the white residents in the public schools rather than deciding to go to private schools.
1971.70-188,2,42185,samuel_w_tucker,,3737.332,3739.455,"I recall that and this is the testimony, sir."
