1989.88-1000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.478,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1000, New York v. Bernard Harris."
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,72.148,75.19,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.256,187.94,Without regard to any other factors?
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,210.193,210.574,"--Yes, sir."
1989.88-1000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,210.574,219.121,"And, therefore, so long as you're not using any evidence that you saw inside the house to prove your case, the arrest itself is okay?"
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,219.121,222.303,"That's... that's precisely... that's my second point, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1989.88-1000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,224.707,227.299,"Well, but just... but just on the first point, to follow-up to the Chief Justice's question."
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,240.166,243.739,"--Well, I believe we get into attenuation."
1989.88-1000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,271.311,279.535,So your first point is that probable cause plus Miranda warnings attenuate without more?
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,279.535,280.676,That's right.
1989.88-1000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.898,283.419,And your second point is what?
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,283.419,293.737,"--My second point is that Payton applies only to evidence seized in the house, and that evidence seized outside the house should not be suppressed under Payton."
1989.88-1000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,293.737,295.658,That's the Solicitor General's argument.
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,304.496,308.97,"Well, if there is a Payton violation, and as you--"
1989.88-1000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,308.97,309.699,"Well, we're assuming there is."
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,309.899,310.28,--Okay.
1989.88-1000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.28,311.712,--isn't that where we start?
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,315.335,320.088,"Well, as you know, my fourth point is that the entry was consensual, and if so, there would be no Payton violation."
1989.88-1000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.088,321.489,"Well, if you're right on that--"
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,321.489,322.26,If you... for the moment--
1989.88-1000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,322.26,324.103,--there's not... then we didn't really need to take the case.
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,324.103,324.253,--Okay.
1989.88-1000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,332.76,333.44,Why?
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,334.231,334.802,That's right.
1989.88-1000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,334.802,336.893,--there was probable cause and they got Miranda warnings.
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,337.323,342.966,"Well, that's an extension that I was not... did not make in my brief."
1989.88-1000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,343.327,343.517,I know.
1989.88-1000,0,37812,peter_d_coddington,,346.101,346.923,--I would... I would certainly adopt that--
1989.88-1000,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1397.665,1414.498,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1616.327,1622.672,Was he... can you tell from the question and answer whether he was referring to search warrants or arrest warrants?
1989.88-1000,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1622.672,1629.645,"The questioning... it was not specific, but in context they were talking about arrest warrants."
1989.88-1000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.022,1642.063,"The police here would have been no better off with an arrest warrant, would they?"
1989.88-1000,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1642.063,1642.203,--Pardon me?
1989.88-1000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.203,1647.469,"The police here would have been no better off with an arrest warrant than with probable cause, would they?"
1989.88-1000,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1647.469,1654.862,They would have been... they would have been better off... they could have lawfully arrested him at home with an arrest warrant.
1989.88-1000,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1676.788,1687.045,But do you think that makes the person arrested somehow more likely to confess than if he were arrested outside his home?
1989.88-1000,2,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1696.281,1704.787,"Well, I... I don't think the... I think they are obviously both... potentially... potentially coercive events."
1989.88-1000,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1724.952,1726.103,Or any more significant?
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1726.103,1726.552,--I'm sorry?
1989.88-1000,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1726.552,1728.295,Or any more significant?
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1728.295,1729.965,Or any more significant.
1989.88-1000,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1731.727,1735.618,"Well, but... but that is the point... that is the point of your case, isn't it?"
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1749.409,1756.713,"--I think this Court's decisions indicate that that's... that's... that rule... that result would obtain, Your Honor."
1989.88-1000,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1756.713,1769.851,"Well, then it is the fact that he was arrested in violation of Payton in his home that establishes the invalidity that you must rely on here, is it not?"
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1769.851,1782.939,The... it's our position that the statement... the statement given later at the station house must be suppressed as a result of the illegal arrest in the home as a result of a Payton violation.
1989.88-1000,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1782.939,1791.216,And why is it that a statement taken at home is deemed to be more coercive than a statement taken someplace else?
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1791.216,1793.529,"Well, I'm not saying that's a per se rule."
1989.88-1000,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1797.463,1799.165,You're... you're not saying it's a per se rule--
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1799.165,1800.144,"--I'm sorry, I--"
1989.88-1000,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1800.144,1804.147,--that a... that a statement taken at home in violation of Payton is... is inadmissible?
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1804.147,1804.678,"--No, no."
1989.88-1000,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.154,1840.295,"Well, suppose there hadn't been any statement taken at the... in the house at all but there was an entry without a warrant, without an arrest warrant."
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1846.2,1847.379,"Yes, I would, Your Honor."
1989.88-1000,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.379,1851.412,You would say it's just the fact that there was an illegal entry that's coercive?
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1851.412,1871.327,"Well, I think in those circumstances the... the... the rule that applies is that a confession obtained through custodial... interrogation after an illegal arrest should be suppressed unless the state shows sufficient attenuation."
1989.88-1000,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1871.327,1872.697,Uh-huh.
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1873.268,1875.051,"That's the Brown rule, Your Honor."
1989.88-1000,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1875.051,1876.47,--v. Illinois rule?
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1876.47,1877.381,And it's--
1989.88-1000,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.381,1885.486,"So we need... you needn't focus on the statement taken at the house at all, as to whether it might contribute to the coerciveness?"
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1885.486,1887.697,"--Well, I think that's not in this case."
1989.88-1000,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1913.307,1930.548,The Solicitor General in a brief filed in this case suggests that we shouldn't... we should limit Brown v. Illinois and its rules on attenuation to circumstances of arrests without probable cause.
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1930.548,1933.55,"Two things about that, Your Honor."
1989.88-1000,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.728,2094.553,"Well, why should that interest us, what the New York Constitution imposes on the New York state police officers?"
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2094.553,2111.716,"--Well, I... it... I think it... it adds... what it does, simply, Your Honor, is it... it... I think it makes more plausible the existence of the custom."
1989.88-1000,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2123.166,2126.417,But you're saying is that it rules out other possible explanations.
1989.88-1000,3,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2126.417,2127.759,It tends to rule out--
1989.88-1000,4,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2826.555,2828.665,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-1000,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.937,2947.109,This isn't really the issue where you say there is a Payton violation and whether it's a product of a policy or not.
1989.88-1000,4,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2947.109,2948.319,Okay.
