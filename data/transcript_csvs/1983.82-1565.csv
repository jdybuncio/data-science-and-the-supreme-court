1983.82-1565,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.051,We'll hear arguments next in Bacchus Imports.
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,38.037,41.129,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,97.728,112.466,"Mr. Easterbrook, would your client have had any complaint if the exceptions for the Hawaiian drink and the pineapple wine were not included in the statute?"
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,112.466,117.579,"You mean if they were administrative exceptions, Your Honor?"
1983.82-1565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.579,118.019,No.
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,120.621,140.294,"An argument was raised in the state court that a tax of 20 percent levied on a base which includes all transportation charges and earlier taxes operates in practice as a discrimination under the principles of Pike against Bruce Church, but that argument is not being pursued in this Court."
1983.82-1565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,206.357,217.154,"Mr. Easterbrook, Paradise and McKesson did not appeal or did not come here, as they, except as Respondents?"
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,217.154,218.205,They did not appeal.
1983.82-1565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,221.468,224.971,Is there a reason for not joining you and your client?
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,224.971,237.086,"I can't speak for them, Your Honor, but McKesson has sent a letter to the Clerk saying that they relied on the Supreme Court's rule that one appeal is enough from a single judgment."
1983.82-1565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,246.613,248.035,"Get a free ride, hmm?"
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,248.035,248.984,Yes.
1983.82-1565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,248.984,249.906,Saves money.
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,252.287,252.748,Yes.
1983.82-1565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,252.748,255.209,Unless your fee award is allocated.
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,255.209,259.683,I'm going to try hard not to talk about fee awards here.
1983.82-1565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,259.683,261.736,But they have filed a brief and hired attorneys.
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,261.736,262.126,They have.
1983.82-1565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,271.711,274.405,The only thing they've saved are the filing fees.
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,274.405,275.755,Hmmm-hmm.
1983.82-1565,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,275.755,293.796,"Mr. Easterbrook, before you get into the three points of the Hawaiian Supreme Court's reasoning, those footnotes that point out that the two products that are exempted are apparently not widely produced throughout the world, o what extent do you contend that all alcoholic beverages are fungible?"
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,293.796,298.909,"We... we say two things about that, Your Honor."
1983.82-1565,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,357.33,364.293,Would your argument be the same if... on behalf of a wholesaler who stocked some of the exempted products?
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,364.293,367.245,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1983.82-1565,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,367.245,371.158,"You'd say even if you carried these products, that you'd still have the same--"
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,371.158,371.549,Yes.
1983.82-1565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,556.448,557.86,--Let me interrupt you.
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,560.252,566.076,--We are seeking a refund of taxes paid and a declaratory order against such discrimination.
1983.82-1565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,566.076,569.518,"If you get the refund, what happens to it?"
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,572.741,583.326,"The... it is passed on, Your Honor, in the sense that every person in business who wants to stay in business must recover all of his costs."
1983.82-1565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,611.344,618.881,Would you be content with just the declaratory judgment in prospective relief?
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,618.881,627.054,"No, Your Honor, we would not, because the declaratory judgment in prospective relief only allows the state to keep the proceeds of the discrimination."
1983.82-1565,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,628.376,635.68,"Well, then it's their... it's their windfall rather than yours, to use the expressions thrown around in the preceding case."
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,635.68,642.665,"--I... I hate to talk about this as windfalls, just as my friend in the preceding case hated to talk about windfalls."
1983.82-1565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,677.738,715.542,"Mr. Easterbrook, if your complaint here were an equal protection claim rather than a Commerce Clause claim and the Court were to agree with your equal protection analysis, that your client was denied equal protection of the law because of these exemptions in the law, typically a mandate from this Court and an opinion of this Court upholding your contention would say, in effect, to the Supreme Court of Hawaii you either don't tax Mr. Easterbrook's clients or you tax the Hawaiian drink and the pineapple wine people."
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,720.865,725.319,"There are two principal reasons for that, Justice Behnquist."
1983.82-1565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.821,752.297,"Well, but I don't think the equal... the equal protection analysis, as I understand it, doesn't depend on any claim that refunds are inappropriate."
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,772.011,784.122,"--Your Honor, we have no doubt... we are expressing no doubt today that for the future it is perfectly adequate for Hawaii to eliminate the exemption and to tax everyone at 20 percent."
1983.82-1565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.499,825.169,"Well, the state might be able to, for the future, as you say, to either tax everybody or not, but it is... this is a past transaction."
1983.82-1565,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,825.169,826.748,"It is, Your Honor."
1983.82-1565,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1523.915,1527.967,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1565,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3177.659,3179.722,"I do, Your Honor."
1983.82-1565,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3289.311,3291.975,Mr.... may I ask this question?
1983.82-1565,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3301.089,3304.823,I think in that event the argument would be much more difficult.
1983.82-1565,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3325.855,3341.246,"I suppose the other side of the coin is if the tax were on all bottled beverages, all beverages sold in a glass bottle or something like that, and then they had an exemption for these two, then everybody who sold Coca-Cola and everything else would get the refund, too."
1983.82-1565,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3341.246,3350.884,We think it would probably be open to the state if it wanted to contradict the category of competition established in the state's own statute to offer and make this kind of proof.
1983.82-1565,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3375.298,3378.07,"And they drink them, and they are drunk because they are alcoholic."
1983.82-1565,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3378.07,3378.891,--Right.
