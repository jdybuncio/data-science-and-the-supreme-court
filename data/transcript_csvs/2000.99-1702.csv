2000.99-1702,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.328,"We'll hear argument 99-1702, the State of Texas, Petitioner, v. Raymond Levi Cobb."
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,25.247,29.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,109.213,150.532,"Mr. Coleman, do I understand from what you just said that if everything had occurred in Walker County, if there had been no moving of Cobb to Odessa, no bail, everything happens in Walker County, and Ridley is appointed to represent Cobb, the Walker County law enforcement personnel never consult Ridley before interrogating Cobb repeatedly, it would still be, in your view, no violation of any Sixth Amendment right; is that correct?"
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,150.532,156.368,"--The fact that the interrogation occurred in Odessa makes no difference, you're exactly right."
2000.99-1702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,166.554,168.935,So what the police did was something they didn't need to do.
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,177.68,178.211,That is correct.
2000.99-1702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,178.211,190.099,"Twice called him and said, is it okay if we question your client, and Ridley said yes both times, but that was something extra the police did they were not required to do, in your view?"
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,190.099,191.041,That's correct.
2000.99-1702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.079,207.362,"But in any event, they did tell him, we're going to talk to your client, is it okay, and he said yes?"
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,207.362,207.783,Yes.
2000.99-1702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,207.783,218.211,"Taking Justice Ginsburg's question a little bit further, suppose you have this situation: the counsel is there, they begin questioning him on the break in."
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,241.696,259.598,"I don't know if it would be a responsible thing to do, but the Court made clear in Davis that until there's been an initiation of criminal proceedings the Sixth Amendment constitutional right to counsel doesn't attach, so it would be poor practice, perhaps malpractice, but not a Sixth Amendment violation."
2000.99-1702,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,259.598,284.295,"Well, a number of courts have come to the conclusion that where the two crimes arise out of the same conduct and are closely related, that you're going to go ahead and apply the Sixth Amendment requirement to the related but yet uncharged crime."
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,288.566,301.897,"I don't think that courts have established any kind of consistent test, but yes, most of the courts that have addressed this issue have said there is this test, although most of them have found that there is, in fact, no violation."
2000.99-1702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,323.111,332.288,"Well, under the hypothetical we were just discussing and the answer you gave to Justice O'Connor, I suppose the police could say, and we're now going to question him about that murder so we want you out of the room."
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,333.169,362.929,"Under Moran that might be constitutionally permissible, but remember, the important aspect of the analysis is what happens in the room, because the defendant does have a Fifth Amendment right to counsel that he needs to be informed about, and he has an opportunity to waive that, so that would only happen if the defendant or suspect has actually waived his Fifth Amendment right to counsel."
2000.99-1702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,362.929,363.199,That's true.
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,377.338,399.363,"I'm actually very anxious, Justice Kennedy, to debunk this idea of abuse or manipulation, because when the police are doing an investigation, and they might be investigating a number of related crimes, once they have enough evidence to convict, admissible evidence to convict on one of them, there's certainly no problem with them bringing that charge."
2000.99-1702,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,450.127,451.196,"Well, that... that isn't the--"
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,451.196,452.027,--there's a real serious risk of manipulation.
2000.99-1702,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,452.027,454.909,"--As I understand it, that isn't the advice that he gave him."
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,467.178,469.269,In September 1995--
2000.99-1702,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,469.269,471.752,"Is... just as a matter of fact, isn't that correct?"
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,471.752,472.331,--Yes.
2000.99-1702,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,472.331,472.722,Okay.
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,472.722,475.116,On two occasions he told the police to go ahead and talk to them.
2000.99-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,483.46,512.159,"Well, the obvious problem is the person is accused, or the police think he kidnapped, murdered and raped a person, or they think he distributed drugs, you know, and my first example could involve three separate crimes, my second example could involve possession, a telephone count, a distribution count, and if there was more than one person a conspiracy, all right?"
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,536.344,539.036,"Not every court, Justice Breyer."
2000.99-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.036,539.707,"Well, I mean most."
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,539.707,542.008,But that--
2000.99-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,542.008,543.009,What's the answer?
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,552.835,563.704,"--I think if you can establish trickery then you create a Fifth Amendment issue, because it is the Fifth Amendment and not the Sixth Amendment that goes primarily to the issue of coercion."
2000.99-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,563.704,564.953,It won't be trickery.
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,590.812,593.303,I don't believe that it is.
2000.99-1702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,618.017,621.309,And the lower courts have all agreed with you.
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,625.133,634.83,"--I don't believe that the fact that there is a factual connection between the crimes makes any constitutional difference, distinction."
2000.99-1702,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,634.83,638.613,"Well, doesn't McNeil say that it's offense specific?"
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,638.613,659.547,"McNeil specifically does say that it's offense specific and that should be interpreted, as I was arguing, to exclude factually related crimes, because factually related crimes are in no better position to receive those kinds of constitutional protections that the Sixth Amendment gives than are unrelated crimes."
2000.99-1702,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.826,755.23,"Mr. Coleman, would it make any difference to you if the other crime about which he's being interrogated is not only factually related but, under the Blockburger test, would be a greater offense of which the offense on which he's indicted is a lesser included offense?"
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,767.549,786.309,"We have argued, and it is our position, that if it is not simply a factually related crime, but the argument is that it is the same crime, then we think that there's a strong argument the Sixth Amendment would, in fact--"
2000.99-1702,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.309,796.026,"Well, it's not quite the same crime, but if he got acquitted on the burglary he'd have to be acquitted on murder in the course of burglary."
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,805.053,810.075,--We would say that this Court's rule would prohibit the introduction of evidence relating to that interrogation.
2000.99-1702,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,810.075,810.736,Why?
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,830.812,868.386,"We think that the Court recognized in Moulton that when the police interrogate suspects they're frequently trying to get evidence about any number of crimes, and one of those might be a previously charged crime, and that is why the Court has very consistently said that the remedy we're going to impose is simply that if you get evidence as to a charged crime for which the Sixth Amendment has attached and been asserted, then we will not allow you admitted at trial but if you have evidence related to other, uncharged crimes, and we would say also factually related uncharged crimes, then you may admit it."
2000.99-1702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,879.221,881.454,"Well, I think it's become even harder."
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,895.053,903.769,"Well, Clanky is the only case we think in which there was actually the same offense, and we think that if the police are still investigating, or they believe--"
2000.99-1702,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,903.769,904.81,"What was the name of the case you said, Clanky?"
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,904.81,906.872,--Clanky v. Illinois.
2000.99-1702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,983.983,987.797,"Mr. Coleman, there are... there's quite a range."
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1023.33,1046.007,"The fact that there is a close relationship cannot overcome the fact that that closely related crime cannot fit within the stated purposes of the Sixth Amendment, and the fact that it would improperly and unnaturally hamstring the police's legitimate efforts to investigate and solve a crime for which no one has been brought to justice."
2000.99-1702,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1046.007,1090.025,"Mr. Coleman, as I understand your argument on why the permissibility of this kind of interrogation for related offenses is not likely to cut back, in effect, on the Sixth Amendment right which has attached, your best argument seems to be that you don't have to recognize a Sixth Amendment right here because there's going to be, as there was in this case, an adequate warning that one doesn't have to speak, and an adequate Fifth Amendment opportunity to get a lawyer, probably the same one, but in any case to get a lawyer prior to the commencement or continuation of any interrogation."
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1097.118,1102.533,"I believe so, and I believe that's exactly what the Court said in Patterson when it indicated--"
2000.99-1702,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1102.533,1102.724,Right.
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1102.724,1112.949,"--that the reason to have counsel at a custodial interrogation for Sixth Amendment purposes is not any stronger than it is for Fifth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment--"
2000.99-1702,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1112.949,1113.27,What about--
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1113.27,1114.101,--test protects them.
2000.99-1702,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1114.101,1114.521,--I'm sorry.
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1155.378,1163.563,"The Court in Patterson made it clear that, as to the charged offense for which the Sixth Amendment has attached, there must be an express waiver, so that is why--"
2000.99-1702,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1163.563,1168.749,So that there would be an exclusion if anything were said about that offense?
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1168.749,1171.57,--If there was no valid waiver for the charged offense.
2000.99-1702,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1175.972,1178.275,And that would be enforceable by the exclusionary rule?
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1178.275,1178.963,Yes.
2000.99-1702,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1178.963,1179.364,Okay.
2000.99-1702,0,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1179.364,1183.288,"If I may, I'd reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal."
2000.99-1702,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1183.288,1184.737,"Very well, Mr. Coleman."
2000.99-1702,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1186.32,1197.146,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1239.184,1239.544,Why?
2000.99-1702,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1276.798,1293.56,"Because the Sixth Amendment, the text of the Sixth Amendment only applies to someone who has been accused in a pending prosecution, and the prosecution is limited by the actual offenses that are charged by the State, and it is only at that time that the right to counsel attaches under the Sixth Amendment."
2000.99-1702,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1293.56,1294.288,So it's purely formal.
2000.99-1702,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1296.251,1296.431,No.
2000.99-1702,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1331.416,1361.393,"Ms. Blatt, you gave the example, or I think your brief indicates that you would support the example that if the crime for which the person is already charged is burglary, and they can't ask him about the homicide at the time of burglary because that would be a greater... that would be the same crime, yes, in that legal sense that we understand for double jeopardy purposes."
2000.99-1702,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1374.252,1385.59,"The same elements test under Blockburger leads to consistent and predictable results, and can be ascertained ahead of time by the police officer, and if he needs to consult with the prosecutor, he can do that."
2000.99-1702,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1396.819,1403.572,"Well, I would think the lay person would understand, it all happened in the same episode, more readily than would understand Blockburger."
2000.99-1702,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1403.572,1404.944,--He may not know that.
2000.99-1702,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.133,1480.443,May I ask this question?
2000.99-1702,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1513.965,1520.65,"--I think to the extent that the... yes, and to the extent that the defense relates to the pending charge."
2000.99-1702,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.65,1524.813,"It has no relation to the pending charge, except it was part of the same bunch of transactions."
2000.99-1702,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1524.813,1540.526,"If he said to his lawyer, I also murdered these two people, I think it would be perfectly clear that the... if the defendant went off and started researching capital sentencing procedures under Texas law he very well might not get paid for that."
2000.99-1702,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1552.352,1560.237,"So he's... the lawyer, the good, conscientious lawyer would say, well, don't talk to me about that because I'm not going to get paid for any advice I give to you on that, on those matters?"
2000.99-1702,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1560.237,1568.342,"No, he certainly will want to talk to his client with respect to the conduct that constituted the offense for which he's been charged, and there might be other things he needs to know about."
2000.99-1702,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.342,1574.058,"But if it doesn't survive the Blockburger test, the fact that it happened at the same time, that wouldn't justify the lawyer spending any time on it?"
2000.99-1702,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1574.058,1589.196,"He will need to spend whatever time is necessary to defend him on the pending charge, but he's certainly free to tell his client, I'm not competent to represent you in a death penalty case and you ought to retain separate counsel for that offense, and moreover, you haven't even been charged with that offense."
2000.99-1702,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1635.627,1645.182,"Workable in court from double jeopardy determinations; workable when you're talking about the police officer, I'm less certain."
2000.99-1702,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1645.182,1684.138,"I think the police officer can certainly ascertain immediately what the pending charge was against the suspect, and if he has any questions about the elements test he can certainly ask a prosecutor, but generally the police can be advised, as this Court recognized in Moulton, that it's okay to approach a suspect that's under indictment about additional crimes, and so the question just simply becomes, what's a separate offense, and that's a lot easier question than, is it possible that the suspect may say something that's so... a court may or may not later deem inextricably intertwined, such that the statements can't be used."
2000.99-1702,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.782,1689.714,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1691.346,1696.218,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1702,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1708.456,1711.988,"Well, but we've said in McNeil that it's offense specific--"
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1711.988,1712.469,"Yes, ma'am."
2000.99-1702,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1712.469,1732.452,"--this Sixth Amendment right, and here there was at the time of the burglary charge no evidence of the murder... the murders, or the defendant's connection with them, so why isn't that a separate offense?"
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1732.452,1753.186,"Your Honor, in looking at the Court's, initially the Fifth Amendment cases on the right of counsel and then the stair stepping and the filling in of the blanks of the various phases where counsel has come in, as we've all had to do in the research for these cases, and we get to McNeil... and we have no problem with McNeil."
2000.99-1702,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.32,1762.893,"Well, how about its statement that Sixth Amendment right is offense specific?"
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1762.893,1764.235,"Your Honor, in--"
2000.99-1702,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.235,1766.896,"You have to go beyond that, don't you?"
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1766.896,1778.363,"--Your Honor, I can... under... in the context of the way, the facts of McNeil, I can see that statement being legitimately and perfectly reasonable, but McNeil--"
2000.99-1702,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1778.363,1780.244,But it's a categorical statement.
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1780.244,1781.766,"--Yes, Your Honor, it is."
2000.99-1702,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.766,1784.637,So you are asking us to go beyond our cases.
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1789.19,1792.252,"No, Your Honor."
2000.99-1702,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.326,1863.168,"Yes, but you can limit any one of our opinions in that respect to say, you know, this happened on a Tuesday and not on a Wednesday, but we employ statements as to what we think the law is and so on in deciding these cases, and it isn't always limited just to the particular facts."
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1863.168,1887.475,"That's true, Your Honor, and... but it just, from our viewpoint, even though McNeil makes sense as to separate and distinct offenses, when you look at Brewer, and Moulton, and the interrelated, intertwined defenses, to us you just simply cannot say, well, the line of Brewer just stopped, because--"
2000.99-1702,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.475,1893.578,"What is your definition of, quote, intertwined, close quote, or interrelated, close quote?"
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1893.578,1908.659,"--In looking at all of these things and trying to make a decision, the simplest and easiest definition we got to is just the related offenses, where those that occur in one single immediate transaction and incident."
2000.99-1702,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1908.659,1909.19,"Well, okay."
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1913.855,1914.175,Okay.
2000.99-1702,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.544,1929.596,And you think this case meets that definition--
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1929.596,1929.907,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-1702,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1929.907,1930.874,--of the same time?
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,1930.874,1931.855,Absolutely.
2000.99-1702,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1931.855,1956.311,"Mr. Greenwood, I think your, sort of your strongest argument is that, if you don't recognize the scope of the right as you argue for it, that the risk that the Sixth Amendment right in the... with respect to the first offense will be infringed is simply too great, and you cannot run that risk, and this is the way to avoid it."
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,2016.901,2036.615,"Initially, Your Honor, one of the concerns that I have is, as the Chief Justice wrote in one of his dissenting opinions, I think in Moulton, correct me if I'm wrong, that there has not been in the past wholesale violation of Sixth Amendment problems by law enforcement."
2000.99-1702,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2055.926,2073.958,"Right, but let's assume we no longer have that regime, but we have the regime that your brother argues for and he says the two safeguards are Miranda in custodial cases, exclusion in noncustodial cases if the interrogation strays into the evidence on the first offense."
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,2073.958,2087.068,"--The immediate, most immediate concern I have is that a statement by this Court that that is permissible will encourage police officers to make those contacts."
2000.99-1702,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2087.068,2088.077,Let's assume that it does.
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,2095.672,2096.181,Absolutely.
2000.99-1702,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2096.181,2097.444,We're all assuming that.
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,2101.387,2108.373,"Under the facts of this case, and because the... and I must preface this just briefly."
2000.99-1702,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2153.022,2163.307,"What about the circumstance of, I didn't know that the word, offense specific, in McNeil, whether it referred to something on paper--"
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,2163.307,2163.618,Right.
2000.99-1702,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2163.618,2176.838,"--namely, the definition of a crime, or something in the world, such as the robber entering the bank, hitting the teller and taking the money, which, of course, could be one of several crimes."
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,2176.838,2177.426,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-1702,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.139,2184.973,"Well, I don't want you just to accept it because maybe what I've just said is wrong."
2000.99-1702,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2184.973,2186.643,"Well, take it, Mr. Greenwood."
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,2187.414,2199.973,"--Your Honor, in dealing with all this, we have looked at the term transaction, because that's a series of acts of conduct which can have one offense or dozens."
2000.99-1702,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.018,2205.218,Mr.--
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,2205.218,2208.992,"--offenses does, and I don't want to get into a semantic battle with you all."
2000.99-1702,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2211.873,2212.835,--It's what we do.
2000.99-1702,2,39366,roy_e_greenwood,,2212.835,2213.105,Right.
2000.99-1702,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.105,2218.699,Can I get back to your description of what was going on here?
2000.99-1702,3,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3138.46,3169.27,"I'd like to very quickly address Justice Stevens' question about the scope of representation and real world fact scenarios that are uncharged, and I think in both of those instances I can go back beyond the cases of this Court and say, those are not criminal prosecutions, and that person has not been accused of those factually related crimes, and the Sixth Amendment by its own text simply does not apply in those types of circumstances."
2000.99-1702,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3182.618,3183.489,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
