1984.84-4,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,63.073,"Mr. Estes, I think you may proceed when you are ready."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,63.073,66.108,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,380.556,386.194,"Well, now, was that issue before the Board of Zoning Appeals in that 1980 appeal?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,386.194,387.246,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,387.246,387.829,It was not.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,387.829,396.768,"The only issue there was whether or not the Planning Commission could apply the amended, updated regulations or whether it had to apply the '73."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,396.768,397.285,And the Commission lost--
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,397.285,397.885,Pardon?
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,397.885,399.201,--The Commission lost--
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,399.201,400.153,That's right.
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,400.153,403.188,"--The Zoning Appeals decided against the Commission, did it not?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,403.188,404.305,"That's right, it did."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,404.305,409.425,Is there any issue in this case whether any other state procedures should have been exhausted?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,409.425,410.742,"Yes, sir, there is."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,422.316,428.97,"Well, why didn't that 1980 appeal to the Zoning Commission satisfy any requirement of exhaustion?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,428.97,436.159,"Because they still have judicial review, Your Honor, in state court in Tennessee."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,440.161,442.98,"Well, you lost in the Board of Zoning Appeals, the Commission did."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,442.98,443.896,"--That's right, you're right."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,443.896,445.312,"Well, then, why didn't you go to a court?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,445.312,453.918,At that time... that was at the time when the prior developer submitted the October 1980 plan to the Planning Commission and it was rejected.
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,468.261,473.229,Even though the Board of Zoning Appeals had said those regulations were no good?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,473.229,477.033,"--No, even though the Zoning... the amended regulations?"
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,477.033,477.467,Yes.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,477.467,478.733,"Yes, that's right, but the--"
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,478.733,480.752,And you still thought that the--
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,480.752,482.437,"--No, no, Your Honor has misunderstood what I meant."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,483.937,487.389,--This is a case one can get easily confused on I might say.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,487.389,487.939,That's right.
1984.84-4,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,506.636,510.188,"We will resume... we will resume there at 1:00 o'clock today, Mr. Estes."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,510.188,510.704,--Thank you.
1984.84-4,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,510.704,533.22,"Mr. Estes, you may continue."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,533.22,536.406,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,581.168,582.97,Did it apply for them?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,582.97,584.653,"--They never applied for them, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,584.653,592.575,"What was it you were saying just before lunch, that something had been submitted to the Court?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,592.575,600.812,"I was saying, Your Honor, that I understood you to ask me why the Planning Commission did not appeal the Board of Zoning Appeals decision."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,600.812,601.847,"Yes, that was the 1980 one."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,601.847,603.114,That was the 1980 submission.
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,603.114,603.631,Yes.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,603.631,604.466,And the--
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,604.466,608.751,"Was there a later submission, that's why I... by Hamilton, or by anybody?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,608.751,612.72,"--Well, that earlier submission was not by Hamilton; it was by the prior developer."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,612.72,613.087,Right.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,613.087,619.143,"About a month after that submission and its turn-down, the Hamilton Bank foreclosed and took over the rest of the property."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,619.143,621.626,And who made the second submission?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,621.626,622.845,"Hamilton Bank, the Respondent."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,622.845,624.195,And it was turned down.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,624.195,625.047,It was turned down.
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,625.047,630.748,"Now, did Hamilton Bank go to the Planning Board... or not the Planning Board, I mean the--"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,630.748,631.7,The Board of Zoning Appeals.
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,631.7,632.266,--Yes.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,632.266,632.932,"No, sir, no, sir."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,632.932,637.651,Would the Board of Zoning Appeals have had jurisdiction entertained?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,637.651,640.67,"According to the State of Tennessee Attorney General's report, no."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,640.67,641.122,No.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,641.738,651.494,"But there are administrative remedies that we say... state administrative remedies that Hamilton Bank could have followed but did not, and the government is prepared I think to argue that more fully."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,651.494,651.978,Yes.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,653.945,680.163,"The subdivision regulations again in the Court of Appeals Appendix at page 932 and 933 provide that in order for a variance to be granted, it must be requested in writing, and that without the application of any conditions shown on the plat which would require a variance, would constitute grounds for disapproval of the plat."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,704.863,706.446,Before you get to that--
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,706.446,706.815,All right.
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,706.815,715.151,--Why is it you say that the failure to ask for a variance ends this case for the bank?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,715.151,734.965,"All right, because I think we can look at the plats, all preliminary plats that were submitted earlier as well as the preliminary plat that the bank submitted in June 1981 which was turned down, and on their face they obviously do not comply with the regulations, any of the regulations, without a variance."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,734.965,736.131,And they never--
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,736.131,741.266,And the subdivision regulations say that that is grounds alone for turning the plat down.
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,741.266,744.868,"--Well, now, what about... this is a 1983 suit, isn't it?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,744.868,745.853,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,745.853,753.574,What about the principle that the plaintiff in a 1983 suit does not have to exhaust various state remedies?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,753.574,762.429,"Well, sir, we take the position that they do in this case under the Fifth Amendment taking analysis."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,762.429,770.268,"On the grounds if there is a remedy there can be no taking, is that it?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,770.268,771.102,"Right, right."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,866.532,869.484,"Well, now, the lower courts now must have rejected all these claims of these."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,869.484,871.784,"I don't think the lower court rejected these claims, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.186,875.955,"Well, you lost anyway."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,875.955,881.275,"--Well, did, but I won at the end of the lower court proceeding, Your Honor, in that they granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict."
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.549,920.066,"Now, is this a recital of the eight objections of the Commission in '81?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,920.066,923.702,"Ties right into them, six... it ties into six of them, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,923.702,924.752,Six of them?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,924.752,925.554,Six of the eight.
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.554,931.124,"Well, how many were considered by the Board of Zoning Appeals in November of 1980?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,931.124,934.576,"Only one question, as far as I recall--"
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,934.576,935.51,Only one of the eight?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,935.51,943.766,"--was considered by the Board of Zoning Appeals, and that is whether or not the Planning Commission had the right to apply the amended regulations or whether it had to apply the 1973 regulations."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,944.882,946.051,And what did they say?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,946.051,948.451,"Well, they said you had to apply the '73 regulations."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,948.451,949.17,And you don't agree with that.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,949.17,952.455,"Well, I don't agree with it and the State of Tennessee's Attorney General didn't agree with it."
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,954.74,959.209,Don't you... what relief do you ask here?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,959.209,959.876,All right.
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.166,974.118,I thought the trial court also enjoined you from applying the later regulations?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,974.118,975.32,That is not before this Court.
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.47,983.407,"Well, if we reinstate the District Court's judgment, you are subject to an injunction not to apply the later regulation."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,983.407,984.007,--That's right.
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,995.279,999.683,"Then if you get what you want, there will be an injunction against you in the District Court."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,999.683,1004.319,"--From applying the seventy... anything, any amended regulation after '73."
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.319,1004.753,Exactly.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1004.753,1005.22,That's right.
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.22,1009.472,"So you are conceding you are not entitled to apply the later regulations, is that it?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1009.472,1013.074,"Well, I think we are forbidden from doing so under that injunction."
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.074,1020.43,"Well, you haven't come up here with a... you seem to want to live with that injunction."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1020.43,1023.048,"I don't necessarily want to live with it, but we are stuck with it."
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.048,1024.498,Why?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1024.498,1034.956,"--Well, that court granted that injunction on state law saying that we were estopped to apply any later regulations to Temple Hills subdivision."
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1034.956,1040.26,"What you did do, you did apply it in turning down this plat."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1040.26,1048.014,"We did, but we say it doesn't matter because as far as this part of the case is concerned, because that plat did not even comply with the '73 regulations."
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1048.014,1048.697,"Well, but that's a factual thing."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1058.555,1059.205,That's right.
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.76,1072.279,"Well, I know, but you turned them down based on the later regulations."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1072.279,1074.997,"That's right, but analysis--"
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.997,1076.599,Now you are enjoined from doing so.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1076.599,1077.149,--That's right.
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.016,1082.003,And you want us to say you were right in the first place based on the '72 regulations.
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1082.003,1083.303,--We were right.
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.827,1097.577,How do we know that?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1097.577,1099.563,--Look on the face of these plats.
1984.84-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.563,1104.466,"I know, that's just an initial piece of factfinding by us you are asking us to perform."
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1104.466,1117.79,"Well, we are saying that as a matter of law the plaintiffs failed to prove a Fifth Amendment taking since they failed to show that they even submitted a plat that complied with the very regulations that they were relying up."
1984.84-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1117.79,1118.976,Did the Court of Appeals rule on that point?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1124.011,1124.478,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1131.015,1131.615,Now you are submitting it here?
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1145.108,1147.325,--I want to reserve about five minutes for rebuttal.
1984.84-4,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.325,1148.542,"Can I ask just one question, if I may?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1148.542,1149.126,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-4,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.126,1156.648,"Do you argue that even if there is a taking under these regulations, that nevertheless there should not be monetary damages?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1157.782,1161.1,We are trying to make the argument a little bit differently.
1984.84-4,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.771,1174.777,"I understand, but do you concede that if there was a taking, that it would not be an adequate remedy just to enjoin enforcement of the regulation?"
1984.84-4,0,39158,robert_l_estes,,1174.777,1182.948,"No, we maintain that there are adequate remedies under Tennessee law as contrary to California law where there may not be adequate remedies."
1984.84-4,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1186.352,1199.159,Mr. Kneedler?
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1199.159,1203.527,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1408.596,1413.983,"And also, I gather, Mr. Kneedler, you say that also precludes any finding of a taking."
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1413.983,1414.516,--That's right.
1984.84-4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1415.916,1416.685,And that's your basic question.
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1416.685,1417.052,--That's right.
1984.84-4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1425.624,1434.211,"Well, what about the argument we just heard that the Attorney General has said it would have done no good to go to the Board of Zoning Appeals?"
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1434.663,1438.948,"Well, that's a question of state law with respect to these other issues."
1984.84-4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1455.409,1456.976,"Well, what do you understand went to the jury?"
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1456.976,1460.694,On the question of... there were--
1984.84-4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1460.694,1463.896,"How were these $350,000 arrived at?"
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1463.896,1465.348,--It's quite difficult to determine.
1984.84-4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1481.125,1482.327,"Well, what were the instructions?"
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1483.344,1490.231,--The only instructions on the question of taking are whether the landowner had been denied the economical... the economic viable use of this property.
1984.84-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.317,1555.09,"--Well, Mr. Kneedler, does the government take a position on whether the Commission was entitled to apply the later regulations?"
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1555.09,1560.327,"Now, that's a question of state law that I think is not of principal interest to us."
1984.84-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1565.548,1572.702,I thought part of the claim or a major part of the claim was that they applied later regulations that really affected the taking.
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1572.702,1578.855,"--Well, in that respect... and it ties in to another one of our points, that the Commission was unauthorized to do that."
1984.84-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1596.031,1604.701,"When would there ever be a taking if the... there wouldn't be a taking if the Commission acted properly, and there isn't a taking if they acted improperly."
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1604.701,1605.32,"--No, we are not suggesting that--"
1984.84-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.32,1608.505,And there isn't a taking because they acted improperly.
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1608.505,1613.541,"--No, we are not suggesting that there can never be a taking if the agency acts properly."
1984.84-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.448,1631.252,"So a commission may just completely disobey a state law and deny the landowner any use of his property, and there still isn't a taking?"
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1631.252,1634.656,There's not... there's not a taking giving rise to the self-executing--
1984.84-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.656,1638.108,Because the... because why?
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1638.108,1639.691,--Because as the--
1984.84-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.691,1641.41,Somebody just booped it.
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1641.41,1642.36,--That's right.
1984.84-4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1644.595,1646.678,"But if he didn't have his taking claim, would he have a due process?"
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1646.678,1648.463,"--He might have a due process claim, and--"
1984.84-4,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1648.463,1651.932,"As one ask, is there a due process claim here?"
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1651.932,1653.701,"--No, not before this Court."
1984.84-4,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1669.46,1678.066,"Well, does the government concede that there could be a taking in the eminent domaine sense where there has been no physical occupancy of the land?"
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1678.066,1680.684,"Yes, yes, we are not arguing that regulations can never constitute a taking."
1984.84-4,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1771.009,1782.249,"Mr. Kneedler, do you take the position that a property owner would have to follow judicial review remedies as well for it to ripen into a taking?"
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1782.249,1784.935,I think that would depend on the particular statutory scheme.
1984.84-4,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1799.528,1801.83,"Well, do you think that's true in this case?"
1984.84-4,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1801.83,1803.997,I think that's less clear.
1984.84-4,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1822.393,1829.047,Mr. Nebel?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,1829.047,1833.868,I thank Your Honor.
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1897.442,1904.262,"Did the instructions that led to that conclusion of the jury, did they define a compensable taking?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,1904.262,1913.284,"Yes, Your Honor, and in fact, the jury was specifically instructed that if there was any economically viable use of the property remaining, then no Fifth Amendment taking could occur."
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1913.284,1916.903,"Have you any suggestion how the jury arrived at $350,000?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,1916.903,1917.52,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1926.192,1926.859,The what costs?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,1926.859,1929.294,"The holding costs, the loss of the use of the money."
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1929.294,1929.711,Yes.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,1929.711,1954.326,"Not the lost interest, not the lost profit that Hamilton could have made by reinvesting that money and loaning it to someone else and charging a higher rate of interest, but specifically, the record reveals that there were $393,000 in damages to Hamilton from loss of use of the money, and that formula came from very reasonable calculation, namely, the cost to Hamilton under the Fed Fund discount rate."
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1970.471,1972.157,And your client was content with that?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,1972.157,1980.477,"Well, Your Honor, we... in light of the injunction that we got with it, we wouldn't have appealed from the District Court decision if there hadn't been a judgment NOV."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1995.82,1996.52,Mr. Nebel?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,1996.52,1997.87,"Yes, Mr. Justice?"
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1997.87,2010.329,What holdings of this Court do you rely on for the proposition that there can be a taking under the eminent domaine clause when there has been no physical occupancy of the land and no effort by the government to condemn?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2010.329,2019.185,"Well, Your Honor, there are, of course, the law in that area is summarized in the San Diego Gas opinion, dissenting opinion by Justice Brennan."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.852,2024.237,"What I was asking you, what holdings of our Court do you rely on?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2024.237,2033.862,"--Well, for example, in Buckelshaus v. Monsanto, last term, this Court found a regulatory taking and found that compensation was the appropriate remedy."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.862,2039.164,But didn't it find that the property value in those particular formulas had been destroyed?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2039.164,2041.866,"Well, that's exactly what happened in this case, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.262,2063.714,"That's what the jury found, wasn't it?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2063.714,2065.131,That's exactly what the jury found.
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.885,2078.307,"Well, do you think the damage was done to your client by the application of the later regulations?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2078.307,2079.307,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.307,2093.233,"And what's your answer to the government that says, well, the Zoning Board, whoever it was, just made a mistake and they shouldn't have applied the later regulations."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2098.202,2104.339,"Well, I would agree with Your Honor's question to the extent that you were stating a proposition, and in that case you would never have a taking."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.993,2121.901,"Well, they... Mr. Kneedler seemed to say that if the state law had actually authorized the application of these later regulations, maybe there would have been a taking, or could have been."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2121.901,2124.253,"--Well, that really goes, I think, to the question of public use."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.621,2134.227,"Well, you do have to answer the claim, though, that there can be a taking that results merely from an error of state law."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2134.227,2136.61,"And Your Honor, the answer--"
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.61,2137.012,Can there be?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2137.012,2138.262,"--Yes, yes."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.262,2139.262,You have to take that position.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2139.262,2139.964,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2139.964,2148.451,"Well, supposing that the government, some government agent, say a federal government agent, goes on my land and occupies it."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2162.81,2165.762,"Well, Your Honor, I will respond to your question."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.114,2167.664,Right.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2167.664,2175.637,"The taking here was authorized by state law, and Your Honor, I didn't mean to imply to your question, Justice White, that we have to find an unauthorized act."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2177.303,2178.27,"No, no, I don't think you answered that way."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2178.27,2178.922,No.
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.922,2197.55,"But you do have to claim that if this taking resulted from the application of the later regulations, you have to... if that's what... you then have to answer the claim that, well, yes, but the application of the later regulations was contrary to state law."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2197.55,2200.768,"Well, that's not true, first all, in this instance, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2200.768,2201.302,Well--
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2201.302,2203.97,"To the extent, to the extent that those--"
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.97,2213.226,"--In my view, you might have two answers to it: one, it was consistent with state law to apply them, but even if it wasn't, there can still be a taking?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2213.226,2231.355,"--That is correct, and that is our position because cases that hold such, the fact that the state acted under color of state law, or the Planning Commission in this case acted under color of state law I think is sufficient to meet that requirement, and of course, that's not what we have here anyhow."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.374,2266.878,Was there a holding below by the lower courts that the application of the later regulations was improper under state law?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2266.878,2270.099,"--Yes, that's the impact of the estoppel verdict, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2315.478,2319.662,"Mr. Nebel, can I ask you to move on to your second point, which is the one that interests me most in the case?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2352.333,2354.019,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2360.839,2377.467,"Can there be... what I am asking you is can there be governmental denial of all viable use of a property owner's property for a period of time that it takes to find out whether it is unlawful or not without there being a compensable taking, in your view, and if so, why isn't that what this case is?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2377.467,2381.086,"--Well, Your Honor, my response to that would be no, and under the--"
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2381.086,2383.121,Because if you always have to pay if you--
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2383.121,2383.571,--If you take.
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2383.571,2386.573,--If you deny total use of the property.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2386.573,2388.423,"That would be our position, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.696,2404.451,"So that any time the government wants to take action that extreme, it litigates at the peril of paying damages for the temporary interference with the property."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2404.451,2406.401,"That's precisely our point, Your Honor, and the fact that--"
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2406.401,2410.771,Has any case suggested that other than Justice Brennan's decision in the San Diego case?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2412.723,2419.627,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that number one, under the concept of equitable loss, yes, Owens v. City of Independence."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.304,2434.821,"Yes, but then the question is the remedy."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2440.375,2448.063,"--No, because number one, the language of the Fifth Amendment is self-executing, where the government takes it, they've got to pay for it."
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2448.713,2451.098,And if it's only temporarily?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2451.098,2452.398,--That's right.
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2452.398,2453.032,They still have to pay.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2453.032,2453.967,That's exactly right.
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2453.967,2455.034,The temporary amount.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2455.034,2461.371,"For the temporary period only, and the facts in this case demonstrate how reasonable that rule is."
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2516.439,2517.208,Could I ask just one other question?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2517.208,2517.724,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.724,2526.647,"Is part of your claim that the application of later regulations was forbidden by the federal Constitution, or were they just forbidden by state law?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2526.647,2537.787,"Well, they were forbidden both by state law and by the federal Constitution to the extent that they were applied without compensation."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.654,2540.573,"No, that isn't--"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2583.064,2585.35,"--Okay, October 2 was the denial of the plat."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.35,2586.1,Right.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2586.1,2587.785,"October 3, a letter from the Planning Commission."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.785,2590.018,This is all 1980.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2590.018,2592.837,All 1980.
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.837,2593.187,Right.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2593.187,2594.772,"And then on November 11, an appeal was taken to the Board of Zoning Appeals."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.622,2676.426,I gather the Board of Zoning Appeals has no enforcement authority at all?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2676.426,2678.962,"--Well, no, no it is not self-enforcing, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.948,2686.448,I see.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2686.448,2699.708,"And of course, it is interesting, as the Court noted, the Board of Zoning Appeals decision in November of 1980 was not appealed by the Planning Commission, and yet they arguing evidently that we should have done more in our case."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.708,2702.041,"Mr. Nebel, can I ask you another one?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2704.243,2705.393,"Go ahead, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2705.393,2708.814,--I had another question following up on the problem that still troubles me somewhat.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2724.157,2729.81,"Well, Your Honor, under the traditional principles of eminent domaine, you can't have a partial taking."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.464,2751.724,"No, but you would say that the part that you are referring to, the east half of this large tract, must be entirely vacant and cannot be used for any commercial or residential purpose whatsoever because of interest in open areas and all that sort of stuff, and you have litigated that and say no, we are entitled to use that."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2759.747,2773.589,"--Well, Your Honor, as to that part of the tract, there would be a denial of economically viable use, but whether or not under those circumstances you would look at the other tract, too, I think it would depend on the facts of the case and whether or not substantial justice required the Court to do that."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2773.589,2779.327,It seems to me that the principle for which you contend could be applied to almost any aspect of zoning regulation.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2790.399,2792.482,"Well, not, no... Your Honor, I disagree with that."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2829.107,2834.326,"When you say the total destruction of value, are you saying that not a single house could have been built on that tract?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2834.326,2835.261,"Well, no, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2845.967,2850.02,"Well, that doesn't sound like a total destruction of the use of the tract."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2850.02,2854.722,"Well, that's why I've tried to proceed from a practical standpoint."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2905.857,2921.701,"And so you say that because of the requirements they imposed for selling lots would have cost $2 1/2 million for 67 lots and you could have only sold the lots for $1 1/2 million, that is a denial of any economic use."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2921.701,2941.947,"That's right, and the testimony at trial, uncontradicted, was that Hamilton because of that was unable to sell the property and because no one was going to pay anything for the right to go in and develop property at a million dollar loss and additionally has pointed out there were no alternative uses for it and... in this particular case."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2962.461,2963.994,Let me ask just one other question.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2963.994,2964.646,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2964.646,2967.848,"As I understand, there was a finding of no substantive due process violation."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2971.133,2974.501,"Yes, and on a procedural due process violation, the Court directed--"
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.501,2975.918,A verdict against.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2975.918,2978.037,"--A verdict against, that's right, and we of course appealed that."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2978.037,2982.624,"We assume that there were total fair procedures all the way through, then, for purposes of analysis."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2982.624,2984.057,"For purposes of analysis, yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2984.057,2987.826,"Well, there's no issue, is there?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2987.826,2988.428,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2988.428,2991.13,The procedural due process issue is not here now.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,2991.13,2991.83,"No, it is not, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3025.434,3028.236,What constitutes the rights that you claim were violated?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3028.236,3034.457,"--We claim denial of equal protection, substantive and procedural due process and a violation of the Fifth Amendment."
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3038.409,3041.794,Do we have anything except the Fifth Amendment claim before us now?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3041.794,3042.394,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3042.394,3042.794,"That's the only one, isn't it?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3042.794,3043.563,That's the only one.
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3043.563,3055.203,"Well, what if your client had lost before the Planning and Zoning Commission on the issues you present and never appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3061.707,3064.409,"In this case I think yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.307,3195.611,"I suppose the existence of the inunction against applying the later regulations but off the running of the damages, is that it?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3195.611,3196.979,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3198.596,3200.015,Damages are not now accruing.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3200.015,3201.081,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.081,3204.65,And so what has happened to the property after all this time?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3204.65,3215.958,"Well, Your Honor, it's not in the record, but to respond to your question, the property... they... and it is interesting to note that development has gone on under 1973 standards, these same standards which they find--"
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.958,3218.06,So you filed a plat that has been approved apparently.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3218.06,3218.66,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3224.63,3225.096,"Yes, I understand."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3225.596,3239.056,"In Ledbetter v. Peach, the Tennessee Supreme Court in interpreting 29-16-123, found that that statute did not apply... and I am quoting again..."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3292.191,3294.227,Let me ask you one other question on this.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3320.794,3324.996,"Well, Your Honor, if you will run that by me one more time again."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3324.996,3332.852,"Well, there used to be... there's not too much of this litigation anymore, but you know, public utility commissions regulate utility rates, electric companies, telephone."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3332.852,3333.352,"Yes, I understand that."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3333.352,3359.919,"And supposing the commission sets a rate level that is so low that on appeal the company is able to persuade the state supreme court that there was a taking without due process of law because the rate was so low they couldn't have any economically viable use of their capital, would, in a case like that... I understand, then of course, the supreme court would say no, you have got to let them charge the higher rate... would the company also be entitled to damages from the commissioners who set the wrong rate?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3359.919,3360.869,"Well, Your Honor, no."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3368.708,3372.56,"Well, the theory of the rate regulation often was that it was a taking without due process."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3372.56,3373.01,--Right.
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3379.481,3386.902,"Well, you have to operate at a loss, just as your... your taking here is not... you know, you could still sell the 67 houses, but your point is you would lose money if you did."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3400.996,3404.198,"Well, our position is not just that it was unprofitable."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3423.325,3424.194,But it really wasn't.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3428.996,3430.431,"--That... well, disabled--"
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3430.431,3434.383,The test really is whether you can make any money out of what you want to do with your property.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3434.383,3439.121,"--The record in this case, Your Honor, is that Hamilton tried to and could not sell it."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3439.787,3441.304,"Well, could not sell it at the price it wanted."
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3443.756,3445.858,"--Well, it could have sold it probably for some nominal value."
1984.84-4,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3445.858,3446.308,Sure.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3446.308,3446.891,But--
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3446.891,3461.701,"Well, is your $2 1/2 million that you say you would have had to pay to meet the requirements of these lots, is that just in expenses over and above what you had already paid for the land, or does that include the basic price that you had paid for the land?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3461.701,3463.867,"--No, that includes additional expenses."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3472.806,3483.03,"Well, but now, does that $2 1/2 million figure include the price you paid for the land as well as the price of putting the requirements on?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3483.03,3484.097,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3491.018,3494.422,And it is those additional improvements that account for all of the $2 1/2 million.
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3494.422,3496.822,"Yes, Your Honor, that's my understanding of our expert's testimony."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.04,3500.842,Did you try the case?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3500.842,3501.459,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3542.753,3546.538,Do the complete instructions to the jury appear in the record?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3546.538,3547.104,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.104,3552.674,And were there any objections on either side to those instructions as they were delivered?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3552.674,3553.793,Not as they were delivered.
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.547,3563.732,No instructions on the law as to what a taking was or anything?
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3563.732,3565.018,There were instructions on--
1984.84-4,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3565.018,3565.901,"I know, but no objections?"
1984.84-4,2,25831,g_t_nebel,,3565.901,3566.701,"--No objections, no, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3566.701,3568.72,Very well.
1984.84-4,3,39158,robert_l_estes,,3571.588,3572.605,All right.
1984.84-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3595.787,3597.387,"Well, all of the instructions appear in the record, I take it."
1984.84-4,3,39158,robert_l_estes,,3597.387,3597.822,"--They do, Your Honor."
1984.84-4,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3597.822,3598.739,So I guess we can find that out.
1984.84-4,3,39158,robert_l_estes,,3598.739,3599.189,They do.
1984.84-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3645.72,3647.12,Your time has expired.
1984.84-4,3,39158,robert_l_estes,,3647.12,0.0,Thank you.
1984.84-4,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3647.703,3648.67,"Thank you, gentlemen."
