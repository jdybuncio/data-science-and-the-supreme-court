2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.28,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 17-387, the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe versus Lundgren. Mr. Hawkins."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,10.28,25.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Respondents sued the tribe to challenge the tribe's title of record to the property at issue."
2017.17-387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,43.92,45.44,Is it -- is it not --
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,45.44,48.8,What did the -- go ahead.
2017.17-387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,48.8,73.76,"Is it not the case that no other political entity would be immune from such a -- from such a quiet title suit, not the United States, not a state of the United States, not a foreign government? So you are claiming a kind of super-sovereign immunity for the tribe that no -- no one else gets."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,73.76,76.84,"Justice Ginsburg, that, in fact, is not the case."
2017.17-387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,83.96,85.84,Because of the adverse possession?
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,85.84,89.2,Correct.
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,89.2,97.64,What -- what are the Lundgrens supposed to do in this situation if they can't bring legal action affecting the tribe?
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,97.64,146.52,"Your Honor, the Lundgrens are in a situation where -- similar to other states that have been confronted with sovereign immunity, for example, in the Pottawatomi case where they were unable to enforce their taxing authority and the tribe -- the Court recognized that sometimes sovereign immunity will lead to results that preclude individuals from being able to sue for relief. That being said, in this instance, it would be helpful for all of the parties to understand their legal standings before they engage in negotiations. It's our anticipation that once this case is removed -- or resolved -- I beg your pardon -- that we would hopefully be able to engage in a negotiation with the Lundgrens."
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,146.52,155.0,"You -- well, you would be in a better position when that negotiation started, wouldn't you, if we have a ruling saying that you can't be sued?"
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,155.0,161.76,"Either way, both parties would be more informed as to what their legal positions were during the negotiations, Your Honor."
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,161.76,177.76,What happens generally if a tribe buys land or -- or thinks it owns land in downtown Tulsa or New York City or any other place off the reservation and they -- they send members of the tribe there and somehow they're in possession of at least part of it.
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,181.56,182.52,"I -- I don't understand the question, Justice."
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,182.52,185.16,"Well, what worries me is if there is sovereign immunity --"
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,185.16,185.64,Uh-huh.
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,185.64,217.16,"-- and if members of the tribe acting for the tribe obtain property, they -- they -- they have a building or an empty lot or somewhere, and they're -- they're there and there's another person who believes he owns the property or the lot, the building, and so there are two different people, the tribe and another group, both of which thinks they own a lot in New York City or Tulsa. How is that dispute resolved? Normally, we resolve it in a court."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,226.28,226.72,Yes.
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,226.72,230.64,"I thought Congress would act, but it hasn't."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,237.76,247.24,"So I understand the Kiowa decision, Your Honor, and, obviously, that -- Congress did not act after that decision, and --"
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,247.24,247.36,No.
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,266.68,285.48,"So the precedent that this Court has recognized in both U.S. v. Alabama and the Minnesota case is that sometimes that will be the reality of sovereign immunity. That being said, by way of example, the fact that states can enforce taxes against tribes have not precluded --"
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,285.48,287.28,I'm not talking about taxes.
2017.17-387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,287.28,295.36,"What -- just -- for Justice Breyer's question, suppose the tribe owns property outside the reservation in Tulsa or New York."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,299.2,301.04,Sovereign immunity applies in that situation --
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,301.04,301.24,All right.
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,301.24,310.92,"-- because the action is against the -- the tribal government's interests, and your holdings in Bay Mills specifically provides that an action against the tribe is barred."
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,311.24,311.84,All right. With respect to --
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,311.84,318.36,"But, there's sovereign immunity -- look, Joe Smith owns an empty lot next door to his house."
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,334.84,352.36,"The tribe members say: No, this is ours. Now how is that dispute -- since that decision that I joined, how is that dispute, kind of dispute which could arise all over the place, how has it been resolved? I can't believe there is no such thing in some form."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,352.36,358.4,"So -- so, again, that is a dispute that would be resolved out of the judicial process."
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,391.44,392.88,"Oh, no, I don't know if they're frivolous."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,394.76,395.52,So -- so if --
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,395.52,399.6,Why doesn't the tribe -- how do you get around sovereign immunity if they are frivolous?
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,399.6,405.04,The -- the threshold issue is whether or not the action is directed against the tribe.
2017.17-387,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,421.36,449.2,"What would happen in -- in this situation? Let's say a state or the federal government wants to construct a highway or maybe it's a pipeline, and there's opposition to this project, so the people who are opposed to the project enlist an Indian tribe to buy a little parcel of land along the route of this highway or this pipeline. That would be the end of the project, would it not?"
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,449.2,451.76,"That potentially would be the end of the project, yes."
2017.17-387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,465.28,465.92,What about the --
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,465.92,467.96,You mentioned Bay Mills a couple of times.
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,488.52,500.4,"I -- in Lewis v. Clarke, you address Footnote 8 in terms of if an action is directed against a tribe, then you made the decision that that action was barred by sovereign immunity."
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,510.52,523.76,"Well, how does that work in the -- yes, an individual action, I remember that from Lewis and Clarke, but how does that work here? Are the Lundgrens supposed to sue anybody from the tribe who goes on to the area that they claim to have adverse possession of?"
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,523.76,529.68,"If they were able to frame the -- the claim properly, Lewis v. Clarke may provide them relief in that instance, yes."
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,529.68,545.8,"So every time somebody from the tribe goes over the barbed wire fence that they say for -- since time immemorial has defined their property, they should sue them? Just have a lawyer there walking down -- along the line every time somebody goes, serve him with process?"
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,545.8,546.48,I understand --
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,546.48,551.4,Is that a valid -- a viable alternative remedy to a quiet title action?
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,551.4,551.84,It is not.
2017.17-387,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,561.44,562.28,"Well, Mr. Hawkins --"
2017.17-387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,562.28,603.36,"Does it make any difference that the -- that the Lundgrens had no notice when they bought the property that there was any tribe in the picture? I could see if the Lundgrens bought the property and a tribe is already there. But why shouldn't the tribe, when it's taking from someone who doesn't have any immunity, step into the shoes of that person and be disabled from asserting sovereign immunity against someone who had no reason to believe that there was an Indian tribe in the picture?"
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,603.36,618.84,"Justice Ginsburg, in -- in -- in the instance where a case had already been started, the tribe would step into litigation and its immunity would not apply because the jurisdiction of the court would have already been asserted over the proceedings."
2017.17-387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,618.84,620.92,"No, I -- I mean there are no proceedings in court."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,620.92,648.72,"But -- but -- but -- but if there is no proceedings that are at issue and the tribe purchases a property, the -- the tribe is exercising the rights that it has to defend its claim against the Lundgrens. Keep in mind the Lundgrens assert that they've had this property for over 40 years, never paying property taxes on it, never taking any action for that period of time to legally establish their claims."
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,654.4,654.92,Well --
2017.17-387,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,654.92,656.44,Counsel --
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,656.44,662.36,-- they -- there -- the trial judge in the state said he had never seen a case of adverse possession clearer than this one.
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,667.56,671.36,"I don't mean to get into the merits of the state case, Your Honor."
2017.17-387,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,681.24,711.88,"Mr. Hawkins, I mean, I guess the question is, what is sovereign immunity and what does it entail? Even beyond the footnote in Bay Mills that the Chief Justice referenced, I think when you look at language of the kind that appears in Bay Mills and in other cases, what -- which says that, you know, if Congress wants to change it, it's up to Congress to change it, but the question is, what is the ""it""? In other words, what's up to Congress to change is deviations from the general law of sovereign immunity."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,745.88,782.92,"So, if you look at the judicial history of the immovable property issue and the -- in particular, as it pertains to the cases involving foreign nations, the Court took action at the guidance of the State Department. And the Court has consistently deferred to the State Department, the political branches, as to whether or not it will exercise jurisdiction or it's prudent to exercise jurisdiction over those foreign sovereigns. So the -- the Court has consistently recognized that immunity is in the hands of the political branches."
2017.17-387,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,817.4,830.52,"Counsel -- counsel, along those lines, do you think you'd have a stronger case if the land had been taken into trust? And the land is purchased, as I understand it, in 2013."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,834.08,845.08,"We were in the process of getting everything ready for taking it into trust, but, first of all, I'm sorry, to answer your question, no, we don't think that it would -- that's not a distinction that makes a difference."
2017.17-387,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,845.08,848.16,Go ahead.
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,853.92,859.16,"Whether the land is in trust or whether it's in fee, immunity travels both on and off reservation."
2017.17-387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,876.24,880.16,"Of course, there the parties consented to deal with the tribe."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,881.52,883.0,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2017.17-387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,883.0,887.16,And they -- and they could have put in the note if they wanted a waiver of sovereign immunity or not.
2017.17-387,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,887.48,889.64,"I guess I'd like an answer to my question, though."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,889.64,890.04,Yes.
2017.17-387,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,890.04,896.92,Why -- why should it make a difference whether it's in trust or not?
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,896.92,899.76,It does -- it does not make a difference as to whether it's in trust or not.
2017.17-387,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,907.28,912.8,"But if -- if it were in trust, then we would treat it as the land of the separate sovereign, right? It would be --"
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,912.8,912.96,So --
2017.17-387,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,912.96,924.72,"-- the tribe's land, just as it might be France, now it's -- it's -- it's titled under the state's laws and is still part of the state."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,928.96,931.76,"No, I -- I -- I think I understand the question, Your Honor."
2017.17-387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,976.32,1012.08,"Counsel, can I just ask a question about the immovable property argument which was just raised in the merits brief here. If you had more time, what more would you argue to us? What more could you show us to prove that you were right that this is not a part of the common law? Your suit -- you made an argument in saying it's a matter of -- of practice, not common law, but what else could you show us if we gave you more time?"
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,1012.08,1036.08,"That is difficult to answer, not being -- not having had the time to go back and look at what the law provides and all of the cases that would be applicable here. But what I would assert is that when you delve into the application of that proposed exception here, it is inherently in conflict with the underlying request that they have made in their original complaint. And their --"
2017.17-387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1036.08,1044.12,"Counsel, I -- I fully accept that they only raise this in their merits brief."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,1051.08,1077.16,"We would like -- we would take the time to look at the application as it relates to other tribes specifically, but also how the state has -- the political branches have been involved in that process and how the U.S. has addressed it. And the -- the reality is that giving context to an exception to sovereign immunity is a very complex matter, and how that applies to tribes is a very complex matter."
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1082.24,1085.12,You had -- you had a month since they filed their brief.
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,1085.12,1089.64,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1089.64,1101.0,"Suppose you just said: Well, the tribe, being of the dignity of a sovereign, has the same kind of immunity as a sovereign nation would have?"
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,1101.0,1102.64,That is -- that is our position.
2017.17-387,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1102.64,1111.52,"Well, I don't know. A sovereign nation, I think since about 1750, there's been an exception for a sovereign nation for immovable property."
2017.17-387,0,62967,david_s_hawkins,,1128.48,1133.32,But that exception has been at the direction of the political branches.
2017.17-387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1154.8,1159.24,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell."
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1159.24,1169.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with Justice Kagan's questions about what is the baseline here about what sovereign immunity entails."
2017.17-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.64,1203.36,"Well, you say it's been made --"
2017.17-387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1203.36,1216.12,"Well, of course, this Court said in the Permanent Mission of India case that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was meant ""to codify the preexisting real property exception to sovereign immunity recognized by international practice."""
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1216.12,1216.6,Correct.
2017.17-387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1223.8,1231.2,And so why doesn't that same principle allow the Court to recognize that there's a limit to sovereign immunity here under the very same principle?
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1231.2,1239.92,"Well, I -- I think that's because it is -- it is up to Congress -- this Court has consistently said it's up to Congress to control and make exceptions to the immunity from suit of Indian tribes."
2017.17-387,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1240.08,1246.16,But I thought that we explained in Kiowa that foreign sovereign immunity actually started as a judicial doctrine.
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1249.8,1266.12,"Well, I think what the Court said there, and I think that that quote was in -- well, I can't remember if it's initially in Verlinden B.V. or Kiowa, but that the -- the initial judicial doctrine was from The Schooner Exchange versus McFaddon, was that it -- it's general immunity from suit."
2017.17-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1267.6,1282.92,"But it doesn't say in the -- in the -- I mean, my law clerk has here, which I guess he got out of the briefs, I don't know, we have Vattel, Cornelius Van Bynkershoek in 1744, as well as Lauterpacht, who's certainly big authority."
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1323.28,1329.56,I'm not -- I'm not sure that any of those sources are talking about sovereign immunity from suit.
2017.17-387,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1340.44,1366.48,"But if you look at two cases, Ms. O'Connell, one is Schooner Exchange, which talks about foreign states, and then the other is this Georgia v. Chattanooga, which is individual states in another state's jurisdiction, I mean, both of those seem to be indicating that there's this long-standing rule that when the prince goes someplace else and buys land there, he's just going to be treated like anybody else."
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1366.48,1366.64,I --
2017.17-387,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1366.64,1383.8,"And it doesn't have much to do with any kind of executive action. It doesn't have much to do with the states all agreeing about something at the Constitutional Convention. It's just a sort of rule that when the prince pops up in some other jurisdiction and buys a piece of land, he's no longer the prince."
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1383.8,1389.48,"That, Justice Kagan, I think is an exception to the general rule of immunity from suit."
2017.17-387,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1401.12,1437.12,"I guess what my point is -- is not whether it should be denominated an exception or not an exception but whether this is the kind of historic, traditional, long-standing rule that we -- we shouldn't expect Congress to have to put in, that it just sort of goes into the doctrine because that is part of the doctrine from long, long ago, which is a very different thing from saying, look, it's up to Congress to really -- to -- to treat -- you know, to -- to -- to start modifying terms of the doctrine that have existed for a long time."
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1437.12,1452.2,"To the contrary, I think that Congress's ability to create a comprehensive exception or solution here and weigh the policy interests on both sides is what should counsel this Court not to begin recognizing judicial exceptions to sovereign immunity from suit in court."
2017.17-387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1452.2,1456.0,"Well, of course, you call it, again, as Justice Kagan's indicated, you call it an exception."
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1459.24,1459.6,Right.
2017.17-387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1460.88,1462.0,So that's just playing with words.
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1462.0,1481.24,"The point I want to make is that, you know, when Congress passed the Quiet Title Act to deal with this exception from immunity from suit for suits against the United States, it made various policy judgments; the suits could only be brought in federal court, it imposed a statute of limitations, it made exceptions for adverse possession claims, for water rights."
2017.17-387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1481.24,1494.0,"Under your view of this case, suppose the tribe, on land that it owns in a state but outside the reservation, puts up a high-rise building in violation of the zoning law."
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1499.84,1506.28,"They're not exempt from the regulatory jurisdiction of the state, if it's just fee land, but the -- the immunity from suit would still attach."
2017.17-387,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1506.28,1529.24,"Ms. O'Connell, I -- I have been hoping to hear from you about what the baseline rule was versus the exceptions. And I'm still hopeful we might get an answer to that question. Why do you -- and what's your best authority for the proposition that the baseline rule of common law was total immunity, including in rem actions? MS. O'CONNELL: I -- I think it's the Federalist Papers, the Hamilton quote from the Federalist Papers."
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1594.68,1596.76,I think that --
2017.17-387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1596.76,1601.4,That's a surprising position for -- for the government to take.
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1601.4,1607.76,That -- that alternative way of resolving the dispute is laid out in this Court's decision in Block versus North Dakota.
2017.17-387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1622.6,1639.96,"So -- so if -- and -- and the tribe, I gather, said they're going to build their own fence right on the line and you're saying the Lundgrens should jump over the fence with a chain saw and start cutting down trees, and when the tribe comes up to them, they're supposed to say: Oh, Ms. O'Connell said I should do this. MS. O'CONNELL: I think the -- well, they probably shouldn't say that. (Laughter.)"
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1639.96,1650.88,"The -- the point that we're trying to make here is that when a suit is dismissed because the sovereign has immunity when a quiet title suit is dismissed in those circumstances, it doesn't mean that the tribe now owns the land."
2017.17-387,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1698.0,1700.84,What difference -- what difference would that make? Let's say the land were in title.
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1703.96,1704.76,If the --
2017.17-387,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1704.76,1705.52,If the land were --
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1705.52,1706.96,If the Secretary took the land into trust?
2017.17-387,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1706.96,1707.2,Yeah.
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1713.32,1720.92,"Well, then the United States would have title to the land and the Lundgrens' claim would have to come under the federal Quiet Title Act against the United States."
2017.17-387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1723.88,1728.4,"So -- so what -- what -- I mean, Kiowa was 20 years ago."
2017.17-387,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1747.56,1749.96,Congress does step in from time to time.
2017.17-387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1781.28,1785.2,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Miller."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,1785.2,1794.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The core attribute of sovereignty is the authority to adjudicate disputes over the ownership of real property within the sovereign's territory."
2017.17-387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1800.24,1811.56,"Mr. Miller, this was -- this is an argument that you have pressed vigorously here, but it has nothing to do with the decision of the Washington Supreme Court."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,1834.96,1874.16,"We -- we are defending the holding of the court below, set out at pages 7A to 11A of the Petition Appendix under the heading ""In Rem Jurisdiction,"" and what the court below said is that the courts of Washington have in rem jurisdiction to resolve disputes over real property within the State of Washington. And I think to -- to understand what that means, you have to look at this court's decision in Shaffer against Heitner, and that explains that the difference between an in rem and an in personam action, it's not about pleading or who the defendant is or how you write the caption, there's a substantive difference and it turns on the source of the court's authority --"
2017.17-387,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1874.16,1880.44,"But, counsel, Justice Ginsburg's question, I -- I really would appreciate an answer to that because it troubles me too."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,1910.2,1915.12,"Well, we -- we agree that, you know, Yakima was a -- a statutory case."
2017.17-387,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1917.04,1919.32,"Okay, all right. That's -- that -- I appreciate that concession."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,1919.32,1927.92,"Yeah, I mean, I -- I -- I would say, however, that Yakima reflects an understanding that there is a difference between control over property and --"
2017.17-387,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1927.92,1928.32,But -- fine.
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,1930.36,1930.8,"Yes, yes."
2017.17-387,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1930.8,1931.32,Okay.
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,1945.72,1958.68,"Well, a couple reasons, Your Honor. First of all, you know, the -- the argument that we are presenting is a response to the argument that Petitioner has presented. So Petitioner's argument in their opening brief, it's very clear and straightforward and it has two parts --"
2017.17-387,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1958.68,1960.0,"No, I -- I understand that."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,1980.56,1983.68,"Well, again, you know, a couple additional reasons."
2017.17-387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2001.56,2002.28,I don't think that --
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2002.28,2002.84,-- concepts that --
2017.17-387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2002.84,2045.44,"-- that's quite true, Mr. Miller, unless -- I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, but I made a little Venn diagram for myself, and it turns out that immovable property and in rem jurisdiction, there's a large sphere of overlap, but there are definitely places where the two do not overlap. So, you know, you have your in rem about land, that's this sphere of overlap, but you can have immovable property that the action is about land and have an in personam suit, that -- tjat would be a typical trespass, something like that. And then, on the other side, you could have an in rem suit that's about movable property or you could have an in rem suit that's about land within the jurisdiction."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2088.6,2104.24,"With -- with respect, Your Honor, I think it is the same categorization and I -- I want to explain why. So, to take the -- the second part of the Venn diagram, it is true in the abstract that in rem jurisdiction can be more than immovable property, you know, in admiralty and bankruptcy and so forth."
2017.17-387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2126.64,2127.68,Even if it's land --
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2127.68,2127.92,-- focused --
2017.17-387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2127.92,2142.48,"-- there's still a question of where is the land, is the land on the reservation or is the land outside the reservation? If the land is on the reservation, I took you to agree with the point that that's the prince's land, and so the prince would be immune from suit."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2142.48,2144.16,"Well, two points on that, Your Honor."
2017.17-387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2172.76,2209.0,"I guess what I'm saying is that it becomes much -- a -- a different question, a more complicated question if you ask about a broad in rem exception or, you know, in some ways the in rem exception is broader, in some ways it's narrower. It just becomes a different question if you ask about in rem exception, one which does take you into this question of: What happens if the land is on the reservation? Then, if you say: Look, under the immovable property rule, if one sovereign owns land in another sovereign's territory, that sovereign is subject to suit there. That's not -- that's not a general in rem question."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2211.68,2225.36,"But -- but, you know, given -- you know, going back to what I said earlier about, you know, under Shaffer, what -- what in rem jurisdiction is, it reflects an exercise of the power of the foreign state over the property."
2017.17-387,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2233.28,2233.8,If you're --
2017.17-387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2233.8,2299.12,"Mr. Miller, it's odd that you bring up Shaffer against Heitner because the whole effort in that case was to say: Yeah, there's an historical understanding why we divided things into in personam and in rem, but this Court said we wanted to make it clear that the notion that things have any rights is fanciful, anything is a claim involving a person, that is, people have rights in things. So Shaffer said in the old style in rem proceedings, you will have to meet -- you'll have to show the same kinds of connections to the lawsuit that you would have to show for in personam. So the whole message, I think, of Shaffer against Heitner is to break down that distinction and say we recognize that litigation is against contending humans or entities and we should not have different connections for in rem versus in personam."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2299.12,2301.8,"Well, that -- we -- we agree with that."
2017.17-387,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2354.0,2365.16,I thought that the -- that Justice Ginsburg's question which started off this line of questioning was essentially this: Suppose there were no such thing as the immovable property exception.
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2380.16,2383.76,"If there were -- I mean, no, it would not."
2017.17-387,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2383.76,2384.12,Okay.
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2384.12,2392.2,"But -- but I -- as I've been explaining, the in rem theory, you know, ultimately refers to the same underlying concepts about the foreign's power."
2017.17-387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2393.4,2398.04,"But Mr. -- this is the way I sort of see what's happened in this case, and, again, you can tell me if I'm wrong."
2017.17-387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2404.52,2408.0,"There is a really good theory here, and I'm going to make that."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2420.56,2433.56,Well -- I -- we -- we took over the case and read the other side's brief and Petitioner's brief says: Tribes should be treated just like other sovereigns and other sovereigns would be immune in this kind of case.
2017.17-387,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2436.4,2442.2,"Well, but you -- that's not quite right, though, because we know the United States would be immune from this suit, right?"
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2442.2,2443.2,"No, Your Honor, because --"
2017.17-387,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2443.2,2450.32,"Well, adverse possession, I think we -- everyone acknowledges that the United States would not be subject to a suit like that."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2472.08,2476.64,"If -- if the land were in trust, the sovereign immunity of the United States would bar the suit."
2017.17-387,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2486.68,2487.08,I -- I understand.
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2487.08,2487.44,So the analogy is --
2017.17-387,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2487.44,2493.72,"But if this were in trust and, therefore, property of the United States, you'd agree sovereign immunity would bar this suit?"
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2493.72,2500.8,"Yes, the -- the Quiet Title Act's exception for trust or restricted Indian lands would -- would bar it."
2017.17-387,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2500.8,2514.08,"I -- as Justice Kagan suggested, you know, you're -- you're a good lawyer, but you're not the one who came up with this the first time in this litigation, were you? I mean, the government raised the immovable property argument in its brief."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2514.08,2516.56,"That's -- that's absolutely right, Your Honor, they did --"
2017.17-387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2516.56,2520.52,Did that happen because you had a conversation with the Solicitor General -- (Laughter.)
2017.17-387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2520.52,2524.12,-- in which the Solicitor General knew which sort of arguments you were going to make?
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2524.12,2527.72,We had a conversation with the Solicitor General. (Laughter.)
2017.17-387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2527.72,2550.32,"Look, sending it back -- sending it back, I think it is a -- we could try to decide it or we could say: Review, not first view, all right? So one of the things -- ways in my mind is this, that reading the words ""immunity from suit"" broadly, extending where not even Canada would dare to go, all right, there's a lot of language in cases that does say that."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2594.12,2610.48,"Well, because what -- what has happened is that there is a conflict in the lower courts, and these issues have been fully ventilated in -- in the lower courts. So the -- the other state high court decision on the same side as Washington, is --"
2017.17-387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2610.48,2614.16,"I'm sorry, I'm actually quite interested in that because I went to look."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2625.36,2639.2,"Well, the -- the other state high court decision on the same side as Washington is the North Dakota decision in Cass County and Joint Water Resources District, and that has a several-paragraph discussion of Georgia against Chattanooga."
2017.17-387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2657.52,2657.76,So --
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2657.76,2657.88,-- but --
2017.17-387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2657.88,2663.76,"-- if we let it go back, it's going to get aired fully and we'll have a split --"
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2663.76,2663.88,"Well, you --"
2017.17-387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2663.88,2664.6,-- according to you.
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2683.8,2685.4,"Well, I mean, because --"
2017.17-387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2685.4,2686.24,-- in that first instance.
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2686.24,2692.4,"-- because you already -- I mean, you already have a split in which these issues have been ventilated in the lower courts."
2017.17-387,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2728.28,2743.04,"What -- what would be -- what's your objection, that -- the tribe has suggested that you wait until the trust proceedings, at which time you'll have an opportunity to object to the government's taking the property in trust because you'd say part of it is ours."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2744.36,2770.36,"Well, we -- we -- we would object, and under the land and trust regulations, the existence of this -- you know, the existence of this encumbrance on -- on the title would -- should preclude taking the land into trust, but if we -- if we succeed, we convince the Secretary not to take the land into trust, that doesn't actually get us anything. We -- we still have the tribe asserting an interest in land that under state law belongs to us."
2017.17-387,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2857.6,2862.52,"Does the record show -- this parcel of land is about an acre, is that correct?"
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2862.52,2863.24,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2017.17-387,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2863.24,2867.16,Does the record show what it's worth?
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2867.16,2885.68,"No, I don't -- I don't believe there's anything in the record on that. The -- as I said earlier, you know, this argument has been presented in response to, you know, the argument that Petitioner made that they should be treated like other sovereigns."
2017.17-387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2918.88,2928.32,"Yeah, I mean, as I said, I -- I think you have a -- a pretty strong, not -- you know, it looks pretty good to me right now. (Laughter.)"
2017.17-387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2928.32,2945.84,"I -- I -- I am a little bit worried about what Justice Sotomayor said, which is, you know -- you know, if we really looked harder, maybe there would be something else that would cut against this theory. I'm a little bit worried that there aren't amici who knew about this theory."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2975.72,2980.84,"Well, I mean, I think the -- the issue was out there."
2017.17-387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3085.92,3115.52,"That might be fair. I mean, I see in terms of fairness between the parties, but we have, you know, a dozen tribes and the National Congress of -- of American Indians and so forth, they all have an interest in this. And they'd have to say squarely why should tribes have more immunity than Canada, Mexico, whatever, and -- and I don't know that they've addressed that squarely."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3120.0,3134.12,"I mean, they -- they -- several -- certainly, Petitioners in their opening brief, as well as several of the -- the non-governmental amici did address that question, and said that tribes should have the same immunity as other sovereigns."
2017.17-387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3137.64,3140.6,That's on your side. But do you think there -- there are also people on their side?
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3140.6,3143.0,"Well, no, I'm -- I'm referring to the people on their side."
2017.17-387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3143.76,3152.88,"They got those squarely in these three amici -- in the three, you know, light green amicus briefs, which I did look at, but I haven't looked at it with that directly in mind."
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3152.88,3163.36,"I -- I don't know that they all did, but we -- we -- we cited a number of them in -- I think it would be early in -- in Section D of -- of our brief, we -- we cite --"
2017.17-387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3163.36,3184.4,"Mr. Miller, I -- I -- you argue forcefully and you argue intelligently, but I don't know why if it was so obvious to everyone, and you didn't author the brief in opposition to certiorari, but if it was so obvious that this was the case, why doesn't the brief mention the immovable property exception?"
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3184.4,3185.28,"Well, I --"
2017.17-387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3185.28,3188.16,It -- you know --
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3188.16,3188.4,It -- it --
2017.17-387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3188.4,3192.04,"-- you say it's obvious, but it obviously isn't obvious --"
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3192.04,3193.52,It doesn't mention it --
2017.17-387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3193.52,3195.04,-- because neither did the court below.
2017.17-387,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,3195.04,3233.76,"Yeah, it doesn't mention it in terms -- I've -- I've cited to you the -- you know, the -- the qualification of the question presented in -- in the brief in opposition that refers to off-reservation land. The passage on page 6 that refers to the -- the sovereign prerogative of the state, which is just a -- I mean, it is not explicit, but it is another way of getting at that concept. I mean, if the -- if the Court has no further questions, we ask that the judgment be affirmed."

Justice Breyer, you asked how have things gone over 20 years and how are these issues addressed? These issues are addressed every day in contracts and in land transactions by the tribe either agreeing to waive voluntarily or negotiating how disputes will be resolved. So there is a mechanism, and that's between the parties who understand their place. Even in this situation, had the Lundgrens offered an opportunity to negotiate in recognition of the tribe's immunity from suit, we would have not -- we would have engaged in that same process here."

2017.17-387,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3318.04,3319.32,How? When you said no.
2017.17-387,3,62967,david_s_hawkins,,3319.32,3324.76,Because they would not have -- they would not have the opportunity to seek the legal relief that they have sought here.
