1987.86-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.64,"We will hear argument next in Number 86-1715, Federal Labor Relations Authority versus Aberdeen Proving Ground, Department of the Army."
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,95.774,109.702,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case arises under Title 7 of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the statutory scheme for labor-management relations in the federal sector."
1987.86-1715,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.455,430.175,"Ms. Peters, this case arose out of one day's work, the decision of the respondent to close down on the day after Thanksgiving in 1981?"
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,430.175,430.455,Yes.
1987.86-1715,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,430.455,433.407,And the union still wants to bargain over that?
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,433.407,452.19,"There has been no compliance that we know of, and certainly even if the bargaining had taken place there is at least a notice posting remedy as well and the employer here continues to resist the notion that an unfair labor practice would be appropriate--"
1987.86-1715,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,452.19,460.456,"So if you win, then there will be some kind of bargaining about that one day in 1981 presumably?"
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,460.456,475.067,"--If we prevail, the merits of the compelling need, the Authority's compelling need determination that there is no compelling need for the agency regulation have not yet been resolved."
1987.86-1715,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,484.023,497.673,"While I have you interrupted, is there some legislative history that indicates that Congress considered and rejected the very position that you are taking today on behalf of the Authority?"
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,497.673,499.254,"No, there is not."
1987.86-1715,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,599.554,624.742,"Now, if a... if the SG is right, then I take it the agency head, that would be the Department of Defense in this case, would have an opportunity to come before the hearing and make the presentation on the compelling need for the particular regulation."
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,625.411,627.474,--The--
1987.86-1715,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,627.474,628.393,Is that right?
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,628.393,636.429,"--Yes, the Section 7117(b) provides that The authority may at its discretion in that appeal procedure hold a hearing."
1987.86-1715,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,665.061,683.371,"Well, if it were just decided in... as part of the unfair labor practice question, then I take it the Department of Defense in this case would not be a party to that and wouldn't be able to appear and argue about the need for its regulation."
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,683.371,689.155,"--Well, sometimes the higher agency level is indeed a party respondent and sometimes not."
1987.86-1715,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.186,719.417,That is purely accidental.
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,721.699,723.101,"Well, it is not accidental."
1987.86-1715,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,727.244,728.215,"I understand, but--"
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,728.215,729.424,--engaged in an unfair labor practice that--
1987.86-1715,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.424,738.02,"--but you can't be assured that when this issue of necessity is raised, the highest level of the agency will have an opportunity to argue to it."
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,738.02,741.954,--I think we can be assured that they will have the opportunity if they wish.
1987.86-1715,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.612,754.523,"That is nice of the Authority, but the Authority wouldn't have to do that if it didn't want to, right?"
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,754.523,759.328,"Well, I would be rather surprised if the Authority wouldn't in these circumstances."
1987.86-1715,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.5,762.84,But the Authority wouldn't have to if it didn't want to.
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,764.23,764.721,"--Well, I--"
1987.86-1715,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,764.721,765.152,Yes or no?
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,765.152,812.612,"--It wouldn't have to if it didn't want to, but then on a petition for review someone would suggest perhaps that it had improperly denied someone access and in any event its views on intervention or taking parts in proceedings it seems to me are fairly liberal, but furthermore, an attorney or labor relations specialist from a higher agency level could assist the people involved in the Authority litigation at the level of bargaining in any fashion that it wished, so really there is... it can't be said that if the higher agency level wishes in some fashion to make its views known, that it would be really precluded from having an opportunity to do so."
1987.86-1715,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.612,818.867,Congress providing explicitly for that in the other section was really doing something that is entirely superfluous.
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,831.118,834.928,"No, I don't think Congress was being silly in any of these provisions."
1987.86-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.302,1155.013,Ms. Peters--
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1155.013,1155.163,--Yes.
1987.86-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1155.163,1194.069,"--As I understand the government's contention is that Section 7117(a)(2), which is reproduced on 3A of your petition for writ of certiorari, when it says that the duty to bargain extends only if the authority is determined under Subsection (b) of this section that no compelling need exists, that that is the only way that a compelling need determination may be made that will influence the bargaining... now, what is your response in terms of just specific statutory provisions to that?"
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1194.069,1194.49,Yes.
1987.86-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1210.581,1212.114,"Even if it says ""only if""?"
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1212.114,1219.909,"Well, only says only, but it seems to me it is only referring to the substantive evaluation of whether there is a compelling need."
1987.86-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1227.665,1236.21,"It doesn't say only if there is a compelling, it says only if the Authority is determined under Subsection (b) of this section that no compelling need exists."
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1236.21,1248.221,"Well, it seems to me that if that word were the governing word in Section 7117, that it would lead to results even beyond those described here, for example."
1987.86-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1248.221,1251.391,"But the word ""only"" is not ordinarily an ambiguous word."
1987.86-1715,0,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1262.1,1264.47,"Well, I think it must be read in context."
1987.86-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1479.536,1483.258,"Thank you, Ms. Peters."
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1485.67,1493.985,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1715,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.99,2324.046,"Mr. Robbins, is the Authority's position or interpretation of the statute entitled to some particular deference?"
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2341.318,2343.171,"It is entitled to deference, Justice White."
1987.86-1715,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.294,2357.208,"Well, of course, the agency that is supposed to determine compelling need has some interest in it, too."
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2362.343,2367.228,"--In this case it is... well, there are two regulations at issue that are parallel and overlapping."
1987.86-1715,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.741,2389.243,But your argument is that there is just not room for the agency's construction?
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2389.243,2390.545,--It is just not... it is not in the ball park.
1987.86-1715,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.326,2435.176,"You are clearly on the SG's plain language team this week, Mr. Robbins."
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2438.209,2445.686,You won't hear Holy Trinity from me this morning.
1987.86-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.686,2445.856,I didn't think so.
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2454.651,2461.406,"Well, I can tell you I think what it means in this case."
1987.86-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.406,2462.999,It means that we pay no attention to them.
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2462.999,2465.469,"No, no, I think it--"
1987.86-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2465.469,2467.491,To what extent should we respect their views?
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2467.491,2506.009,"--I think it means what this Court has said it means in Chevron and Cardoza-Fonseca, which means at least this much, that when the Authority is construing, in the process of construing plain language, and gives in this case what it believes the plain language means, if this Court applying the ordinary canons of statutory construction determines on the contrary that there is a plain meaning to the statute that is contrary to the agency's interpretation, it must go with the statute and not with the agency."
1987.86-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.268,2514.624,"Well, I understand, but does that mean we gave them no deference, or we gave them deference, but having given them deference we still concluded they were wrong?"
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2514.624,2522.068,"I can sign off on the second one without fear of contradiction, I think."
1987.86-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2535.087,2536.96,"Doesn't deference mean, listen, that is all?"
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2536.96,2538.551,"--No, no, I don't think so."
1987.86-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2538.551,2540.03,"Well, what else?"
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2540.03,2560.836,"I think deference means that, for example, if you came to the view that the statute was silent on a particular matter or that there were two fairly available constructions, sure, the implementing agency has the primary call on what the statute means."
1987.86-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2560.836,2565.177,"Well, suppose one construction is yours and one is the agency's."
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2566.549,2572.812,"Well, I don't see it as such a Hobson's Choice."
1987.86-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2575.884,2579.867,"Well, assuming it is a choice, which one should we take?"
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2579.867,2586.902,"--If ours is the one that in your judgment the statute plainly requires, you have got to take hours."
1987.86-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.462,2593.976,And say with all deference we take the opposing position.
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2604.094,2604.745,--Sure.
1987.86-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2604.745,2609.229,But if we don't put that language in there it is wrong?
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2609.229,2610.759,"I am sorry, Justice Marshall?"
1987.86-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2610.759,2615.594,If we don't use in deference language we are in error?
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2615.594,2618.806,"Well, no."
1987.86-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2668.81,2676.297,"But you know, three pretty good judges came to the other conclusion, three excellent judges, I should say, came to the other conclusion in the D.C. Circuit."
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2683.261,2683.752,--No.
1987.86-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.353,2727.806,"No, but they quote the plain language right out at the beginning and say this is the plain language, and then they go right by it."
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2736.805,2737.202,Correct.
1987.86-1715,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2747.089,2750.012,And so the ball bounces.
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2750.012,2767.823,"Well, it is now in this court, and it seems to me that the plain language is all we need, but in this case we can rest on quite a number of other bases as well."
1987.86-1715,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.823,2777.62,"Yes, but if judges are equally divided on whether this is plain language or not, that may be enough to say that it isn't plain at all."
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2777.62,2779.4,"I don't think so, Justice White."
1987.86-1715,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.265,2815.735,"You are saying if we split five to four on whether there is plain language, if five say it is plain language and four say it is not plain language, you say the five have the right answer?"
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2815.735,2818.787,"I would, of course, if it is my answer."
1987.86-1715,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2828.113,2841.712,And yet your office is arguing in another case the mere fact that some other courts had come out another way and that some courts had entered a stay was... do you know the case I am talking about?
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2841.712,2841.852,I do.
1987.86-1715,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.852,2847.658,Was demonstration of the fact that the government's position was a responsible position.
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2864.31,2895.7,"Well, among other things, it seems to me that the EJA statute that we were attempting to argue about in that other case responds to many different concerns, and whether or not attorneys' fees ought to go to the prevailing party doesn't necessarily raise quite the same question as whether Congress meant what it said when it used words like (b)> [""]."
1987.86-1715,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.903,2915.425,"Or a footnote that said, we mean it, or something."
1987.86-1715,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,2915.425,2915.815,Yes.
1987.86-1715,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2972.562,2973.554,"Thank you, Mr. Robbins."
1987.86-1715,2,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2975.928,2978.97,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1715,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3041.363,3042.665,"Ms. Peters, can I ask--"
1987.86-1715,2,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3042.665,3042.845,Yes.
1987.86-1715,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.845,3049.96,--has the Authority ever found no compelling need without holding a hearing?
1987.86-1715,2,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3052.311,3053.522,"Yes, under Section 7117."
1987.86-1715,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3063.059,3064.951,--Has not found a compelling need.
1987.86-1715,2,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3064.951,3065.091,"Yes, that's right."
1987.86-1715,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.091,3068.434,And they are all cases without hearings?
1987.86-1715,2,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3068.434,3073.169,"The ones that are held under the negotiability procedure, yes."
1987.86-1715,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.811,3110.765,"Yes, that is... I had thought that perhaps the agency would only hold a hearing if it was... as many courts might, that they would be, for example, very reluctant to reverse the Court below without full argument, but would be willing to affirm without setting the case for argument."
1987.86-1715,2,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3113.717,3118.121,"No, the Authority makes the compelling need determination, not the issuing agency."
1987.86-1715,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.883,3316.558,"What if the agency who has... what if the Defense Department, at the same time this unfair labor practice proceeding is going on, determines that there is a compelling need for the regulation?"
1987.86-1715,2,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3321.621,3322.873,"Yes, indeed."
1987.86-1715,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.23,3359.99,"Well, the statute says that these compelling need determinations shall be made only in accordance with, with... what is the section?"
1987.86-1715,2,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3359.99,3365.952,Section 7117(a)(2) is the section upon which the respondent principally relies.
1987.86-1715,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.952,3371.167,"Well, what if a determination is made pursuant to that section?"
1987.86-1715,2,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3371.167,3388.948,"Under that section again the Authority applies... the same criteria govern and the same burden is on the employer agency, be it a negotiability determine or an unfair labor practice determination, the same criteria apply, the burden remains upon the employer agency, and the employer agency of course--"
1987.86-1715,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3388.948,3394.373,Could the authority redetermine it in an unfair labor practice proceeding?
1987.86-1715,2,40194,ruth_e_peters,,3394.373,3416.028,"--Well, having once made the determination with respect to a particular regulation as how it fits against a particular proposal, I am not sure that there would be any need to, but of course the executive order addressed the notion of seriatim proceedings and thought that it would be better to put everything in one proceeding, and the Authority has simply continued with that practice."
1987.86-1715,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3416.409,3417.921,"Thank you, Ms. Peters."
