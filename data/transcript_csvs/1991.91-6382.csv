1991.91-6382,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.298,"We'll hear argument now in 91-6382, Robert Wayne Sawyer v. John Whitley, Warden."
1991.91-6382,0,40817,r_neal_walker,,11.888,19.725,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.91-6382,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.031,81.484,"Do you mean he presented those in both the first and the second habeas petitions, ineffective assistance claim?"
1991.91-6382,0,40817,r_neal_walker,,81.484,82.664,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-6382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,92.551,97.514,Were these claims exhausted in the State courts?
1991.91-6382,0,40817,r_neal_walker,,97.514,98.666,"Yes, they have been."
1991.91-6382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,98.666,100.827,On State collateral?
1991.91-6382,0,40817,r_neal_walker,,100.827,102.419,"Yes, on State collateral."
1991.91-6382,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,102.419,105.099,How were they disposed of?
1991.91-6382,0,40817,r_neal_walker,,107.11,108.362,"They were denied on the merits, that's correct."
1991.91-6382,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,1574.578,1580.532,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-6382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.08,1599.814,"When you say at the very least, Ms. Pendergast, I think the Solicitor General here has perhaps taken a narrower position than the Fifth Circuit."
1991.91-6382,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,1602.576,1624.321,"--I do agree with it, because Louisiana narrows the class of persons eligible for the death penalty at the definitional stage, so it really is... the Solicitor General's definition is a workable and acceptable definition to the State of Louisiana, and I propose to defend the Fifth Circuit's definition and allow Mr. Larkin to defend the Solicitor General's definition."
1991.91-6382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1694.214,1701.41,Your view of the State's obligation is just to prove the elements of the crime.
1991.91-6382,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,1701.41,1706.854,"In the guilt phase, and then when we come to the penalty phase we have certain objective factors which are aggravating factors."
1991.91-6382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1706.854,1710.717,"Well, I know, but when does one in Louisiana become eligible for the death penalty?"
1991.91-6382,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,1710.717,1714.211,"Actually, you are tried--"
1991.91-6382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.211,1717.419,When you're proven guilty of a capital offense?
1991.91-6382,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,1717.419,1718.601,--Of the first degree murder.
1991.91-6382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1732.77,1743.359,So you eliminate the necessity to... in defining eligibility you just don't think about whether there's an aggravating circumstance.
1991.91-6382,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,1743.359,1744.959,Then when we go to the--
1991.91-6382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.959,1745.68,Is that right?
1991.91-6382,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,1745.68,1747.242,--In Louisiana?
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2692.527,2705.246,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-6382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.89,2753.377,"But you would agree, though, that something could be to the actual and substantial disadvantage of a defendant without it also necessarily being true that the verdict would more likely than not have been different."
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2753.377,2762.804,"That could, but then you also have to keep in mind the other part of the court's discussion in these cases, which is the cause and prejudice test is stricter than the plain error test."
1991.91-6382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2781.054,2786.32,"More likely than not of a substantial disadvantage, or more likely than not that the result would have been different?"
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2786.32,2789.482,"The latter, Your Honor... more likely than not that the result would have been different."
1991.91-6382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.482,2795.874,"Do you see any problem with applying that analysis when the challenge is to something in the sentencing phase, to an error in the sentencing phase?"
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2795.874,2803.841,"Not on the first Federal habeas petition, Your Honor, but here we think where the second petition is involved that is a wholly inadequate basis."
1991.91-6382,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.52,2857.156,But doesn't succeed in making second Federal habeas any different from first Federal habeas with respect to those particular claims.
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2857.156,2875.538,"--You betcha, that's absolutely right, and we think this Court's decision in Dugger v. Adams is inconsistent with that type of approach, so we think the standard petitioner has adopted clearly is inconsistent with what this Court has already decided in Dugger, and with the approach this Court has followed, and with the policy concerns that have led this Court to adopt the ruling last term in McCleskey."
1991.91-6382,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2880.131,2890.296,"Well, you suggested, I thought, a still different test, one that goes to actual innocence of the substantive offense."
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2890.296,2891.298,--That's right.
1991.91-6382,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2894.881,2904.217,And I'm not sure your test would take into account in any event the differences among the States in capital sentencing structure.
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2918.385,2931.855,"No, Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit didn't, and neither the Eighth and Ninth, so it is in fact our proposal that we are putting forward to you today, because this will affect Federal cases as well as State ones."
1991.91-6382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.732,2947.273,Whether there's a balancing requirement or not?
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2947.273,2949.006,"--Absolutely, which is in a case like Mississippi."
1991.91-6382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2980.337,2983.758,Basically it removes the distinction between capital and noncapital cases.
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2983.758,2988.741,It does it by making sure that what you have is a proportionality test.
1991.91-6382,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3024.574,3032.549,"Well, you say if the Court has before it findings that the defendant was guilty of a capital eligible offense."
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3034.97,3045.008,"If the jury verdict is going to contain with it under the statute the elements of the offense, and in virtually every state, murder, for example, is going to be the capital crime."
1991.91-6382,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3046.738,3063.53,"Well, supposing a defendant comes in on second Federal habeas with some rather convincing showing that a witness was prevented from appearing at the trial and that the witness would have testified that he was 10,000 miles away."
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3063.53,3069.615,"--Well, if he can show he didn't do it, then he's actually innocent of the crime, not just the sentence."
1991.91-6382,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3069.615,3073.846,"Well then, so the jury verdict could be upset on that sort of a showing, I take it?"
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3073.846,3074.728,Absolutely.
1991.91-6382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.006,3090.957,He's not eligible to the death penalty or any other penalty.
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3090.957,3093.989,"--He's not eligible for a fine, for a sentence of imprisonment for any--"
1991.91-6382,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3093.989,3100.624,But he would have to tie the evidence he's relying on to some sort of a constitutional violation.
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3100.624,3101.786,--Correct.
1991.91-6382,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.988,3201.91,I don't know why it has to be extended to take into account the penalty phase at all.
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3201.91,3204.432,"--Well, it could, Your Honor."
1991.91-6382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3230.739,3237.093,"Well, what should be the standard for applying the actual innocence exception in the guilt phase?"
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3244.618,3249.142,"Your Honor, you could in essence flip around what happens at trial."
1991.91-6382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3275.238,3278.099,"Well, what is the Government's position on the proper standard?"
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3278.099,3282.153,"Well, we have not in our brief laid out which of those three approaches to take."
1991.91-6382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.153,3284.655,"A rather important point, isn't it?"
1991.91-6382,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3284.655,3289.367,"It is, but it has not yet in our view ever been dispositive in any case."
1991.91-6382,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3290.569,3293.01,"Thank you, Mr. Larkin."
1991.91-6382,3,40817,r_neal_walker,,3295.171,3313.913,"First, for Justice O'Connor's benefit, the more-likely-than-not standard which we endorse is located on page 3 of our reply brief in Note 1, and also the amicus brief filed on our behalf by the Legal Defense Fund discusses that test extensively beginning on page 40."
1991.91-6382,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3422.097,3424.12,"Thank you, Mr. Walker."
