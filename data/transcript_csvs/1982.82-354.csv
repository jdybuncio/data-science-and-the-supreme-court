1982.82-354,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.915,We will hear arguments first this morning in Motor Vehicles Manufacturing Association against State Farm Mutual and the consolidated case.
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,14.335,17.584,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.82-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,543.358,546.166,"Mr. Lee, may I ask you one question."
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,558.492,566.785,"My answer, Justice Stevens, is yes, they're very close, but I need to modify it in this one way."
1982.82-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,624.385,625.995,About the same?
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,625.995,630.553,"Well, it's always governed by the arbitrary and capricious standard."
1982.82-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,630.553,631.084,I understand that.
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,641.176,651.56,"Yes, except that if in the process of enacting... of considering the regulation in the first place he has information that has come before him, he does have the obligation to take that information into account."
1982.82-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.977,661.087,Wouldn't he in promulgating a regulation have an obligation to take into account--
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,661.087,663.399,"Anything that comes before him, of course."
1982.82-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,663.399,666.005,"--Then you really are saying it's the same standard, I think."
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,666.005,669.724,"I think in the overwhelming majority and maybe always, it will be the same standard, yes."
1982.82-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,669.724,671.518,Do you think he had to make any findings at all?
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,671.518,672.722,Excuse me?
1982.82-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,672.722,674.844,Do you think he had to make any findings at all?
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,680.888,684.92,I would certainly still have defended what he did.
1982.82-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,684.92,686.028,"Well, I understand that, but--"
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,687.951,692.119,Though not under all circumstances will I defend what he did.
1982.82-354,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,716.876,725.374,"On that same point, is the agency required to articulate facts which will rationally support a decision?"
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,725.374,735.852,"I would have to say that if the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in an earlier phase of this very litigation is correct, the answer to that question is no."
1982.82-354,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,762.232,765.964,To articulate facts that rationally support the decision?
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,765.964,770.854,--I think that there is no obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act.
1982.82-354,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,789.049,817.976,"Was it necessary in this instance for the Secretary to consider not only whether the detachable belt option was ineffective, but also whether it would be appropriate to require non-detachable belts or whether it would be appropriate to require the air bag approach, the other options?"
1982.82-354,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,817.976,818.553,The answer is no.
1982.82-354,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,993.075,1004.773,Mr. Cutler.
1982.82-354,1,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,1004.773,1007.382,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.82-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1631.861,1632.472,Your time has--
1982.82-354,1,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,1632.472,1635.642,"--but only succeeded in selling 10,000."
1982.82-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.642,1637.639,"--Your time has expired, counsel."
1982.82-354,1,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,1637.639,1641.999,"If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, the ignition interlock was also one of Ford's better ideas."
1982.82-354,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1641.999,1648.183,Mr. Fitzpatrick.
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,1648.183,1650.387,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1684.667,1686.902,Who is the author of that description?
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,1688.715,1697.524,"The description came from William Nordhaus, who was a witness in the proceeding below, and I think it was also quoted in the Court of Appeals' decision."
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1839.169,1840.464,"--Excuse me, Mr. Fitzpatrick."
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,1854.865,1856.835,"--No, I don't think DOT has done that."
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1869.594,1880.575,"Well, my question goes to whether the same result could be accomplished or a similar result by a 55 mile an hour speed limit enforced."
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,1880.575,1881.37,Clearly not.
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1883.448,1885.039,"When you say ""clearly not"", what study?"
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,1885.039,1889.099,--I don't believe that there is a study that has suggested that.
1982.82-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.114,1931.101,Mr. Fitzpatrick.
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,1931.101,1931.569,Yes.
1982.82-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.569,1942.737,How does the safety and utility of the passive belts that you were describing a moment ago bear on the Secretary's decision to rescind the order about air bags?
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,1942.737,1963.712,"Well, the Secretary decided to rescind the passive restraint standard which permitted compliance by two technologies: either the automatic belt, which has been found to have high usage rates; or an air bag, which the agency itself has concluded is sound and effective."
1982.82-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1973.66,1976.409,"Well, but that's really just arguing with the facts."
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,1976.409,1977.642,"No, I don't believe it is."
1982.82-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2015.611,2023.593,"Well, we're certainly not going to decide in this Court which of three various systems of passive restraints would or wouldn't work."
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2025.028,2032.043,"Well, that's up in the first instance to the Secretary, with the Court of Appeals in the first instance looking to see whether there was appropriate review."
1982.82-354,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.537,2091.051,"Mr. Fitzpatrick, you said that they found that the new belt would not work."
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2095.001,2095.547,That's correct.
1982.82-354,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2095.547,2098.53,They really didn't make a finding on how often it would be detached.
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2098.53,2099.704,That is quite correct.
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2235.348,2238.673,"Well, who established the criteria in the first place in your view?"
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2245.985,2263.553,"Well, Congress clearly stated an obligation that DOT was to promulgate regulations which would lessen the unreasonable risk of health and safety to American motorists."
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2273.582,2281.97,"While you're on that, on the first step that you've just mentioned, is that any more than saying to the agency, do something?"
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2290.26,2303.18,"--Congress imposed... Congress did not... and we want to make this clear... we have not argued that Congress said to the agency, promulgate this passive restraint regulation."
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2332.542,2335.65,You mean they have to prove they have made a mistake?
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2335.65,2337.994,--They don't have to prove that they have to make a mistake.
1982.82-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.304,2383.272,--you say there has to be support for a decision to promulgate in the first instance.
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2398.452,2403.981,"Indeed, they had to justify it twice, in two Courts of Appeals."
1982.82-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2403.981,2404.964,I'm asking you.
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2408.856,2409.262,No.
1982.82-354,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2462.661,2463.129,Mr. Fitzpatrick.
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2463.129,2463.847,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-354,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2463.847,2471.518,"But didn't the Solicitor General say they don't need facts, they can use reasons?"
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2472.969,2476.422,There is... I agree--
1982.82-354,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2476.422,2478.778,I should think so.
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2478.778,2479.156,--in this sense.
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2516.357,2534.787,"Are you saying that if an agency concludes that something that it has tried out and finds that it doesn't work, it can't simply say, this hasn't worked and we're going to write it off and try something else?"
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2536.363,2537.876,Yes.
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2537.876,2539.44,Any more reason than that?
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2539.44,2540.738,"Yes, they do indeed."
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2541.845,2542.953,Where do you find that?
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2542.953,2550.873,"--Among other places, you find it in the Atchison, Topeka proceedings in this Court, the decisions in this Court."
1982.82-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.784,2610.707,You say some support in the record.
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2619.298,2621.906,--We're not suggesting there has to be a trial type record.
1982.82-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2625.81,2627.452,"Well, what record do you mean?"
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2627.452,2630.294,"Well, the record of the informal rulemaking."
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2697.393,2698.781,I've just given you his opinion.
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2698.781,2700.06,--That is his opinion.
1982.82-354,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.673,2745.528,"Well, what if the only difference is between the X and the non-X is that there is a different man making a judgment of the facts?"
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2745.528,2748.839,--But it's the same statute and it's the same APA.
1982.82-354,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2748.839,2752.509,"Same facts, but different views of the facts."
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2763.505,2767.611,"No, you can't do that."
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2797.396,2803.205,You mean Mr. Adams has to prove why Mr. Coleman was wrong before he can change the program?
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,2803.205,2813.111,"In the Pacific Legal Foundation case, it went to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals looked at his reasons and said they were defensible reasons for changing course."
1982.82-354,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3308.785,3311.237,Is that by the record or by what's happened since the rescission?
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,3311.237,3321.575,"Well, I think that... I think that those facts are all either stated in the Solicitor General's brief or are matters of the record."
1982.82-354,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3321.575,3324.605,What's happened since the rescission?
1982.82-354,2,30232,james_f_fitzpatrick,,3326.855,3335.196,"Well, the fact in terms of the agency shutting down the passive program clearly was described in the Court of Appeals' decision."
1982.82-354,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3462.628,3467.279,"Mr. Solicitor General, you have four minutes remaining."
1982.82-354,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3467.279,3482.57,"I think if there's anything that ought to be clear after Mr. Fitzpatrick's argument, it is that we are dealing in an area of uncertainty, an area that ought to be left to the particular abilities and expertise of the administrative agency."
1982.82-354,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3580.377,3583.734,"Mr. Solicitor General, let me interrupt you about the belt that didn't work."
1982.82-354,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3591.183,3592.029,That is correct.
1982.82-354,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3592.029,3599.914,And did the agency even consider the extent to which the belt would be detached as compared with the extent to which people will hook up the belt in the first place?
1982.82-354,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3599.914,3601.243,It considered--
1982.82-354,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3601.243,3602.772,I didn't find it in their report.
1982.82-354,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3602.772,3605.1,"--It considered it to this extent, Justice Stevens."
1982.82-354,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3620.718,3632.556,"Just as a matter of common sense, isn't it perfectly clear that there will be greater seat belt usage if the belt is automatically attached and you have to do something affirmative to detach it, as opposed to the active belt?"
1982.82-354,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3636.133,3638.995,There are two things that are perfectly obvious.
1982.82-354,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3639.79,3640.929,"Well, is that one of them?"
1982.82-354,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3642.82,3645.959,"--That is one of them, that there will be some increase."
1982.82-354,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3647.788,3651.755,"And if you just get one percent increase, you save over 100 lives a year."
1982.82-354,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,3651.755,3675.806,"--If you get one percent increase, you may or may not save, you may or may not save lives a year, because you also have to take into account the additional cost and the impact on public reaction that results from the public perception of ineffective regulation which leads to a more expensive example of federal requirements."
1982.82-354,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3724.316,3725.096,"Thank you, gentlemen."
