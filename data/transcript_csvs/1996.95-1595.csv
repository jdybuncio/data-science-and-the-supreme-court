1996.95-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.946,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1595, Bruce Babbitt v. Marvin K. Youpee, Sr.--"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,10.007,12.329,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,68.245,84.556,"Mr. Feldman, in this case, under the facts of this case, did the disposition of the land in question further fractionalize it or did one person take each interest as a whole?"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,95.954,96.605,That's correct.
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.608,104.169,Right.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,104.169,104.9,--It was small enough--
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,104.9,105.551,Right.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,105.551,106.121,--The decedent--
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.121,109.221,"Does that make a difference, do you think, in our analysis?"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,109.221,111.083,"--No, I don't think it does."
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.328,122.711,But we nevertheless thought it was a taking in that case.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,122.711,123.002,--Right.
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.845,191.915,"Well now, let's talk about the amended version a little."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,221.836,222.857,--Yes.
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.857,223.398,--that applies.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,223.398,239.337,"If I may, if I can take the first passage that you quoted, it's our position that that is ambiguous, and that the... it is true that the any one... incapable of earning $100 in any one of the 5 years could mean in any of the 5 years or in any one--"
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.337,241.941,"Well, that would be the normal reading of it, I suppose."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,241.941,242.528,--Well--
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.528,248.884,"I had a hard time understanding your reading of it, which would read in the word each of the 5 years."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,248.884,257.399,"--No... well, I think any in some circumstances can mean each, especially when it's conjoined with the negative, but let me just abstract from that for a minute."
1996.95-1595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,285.608,286.588,What about timber?
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,286.588,293.863,"Well, and if it can be leased for timber harvest it might be more than a 5-year period that a lease would permit, but still--"
1996.95-1595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,293.863,296.946,Well that's... I asked... you said it's mostly grazing and mineral.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,312.186,313.815,--Right.
1996.95-1595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.736,316.507,But it could be very valuable in that one year.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,316.507,317.007,--That's right.
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.544,327.115,What point does this go to?
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,331.287,331.918,--No.
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.188,335.621,Do we have any law that says that a de minimis taking is not a taking?
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,335.621,345.556,"--No, but it... I think it does go to the fact that Congress more carefully tailored what it did in this statute to just those interests that were causing the serious problem."
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.661,354.063,"Yes, but it doesn't go to the extent of the interest."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,361.097,361.628,--It goes--
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.628,370.464,"I mean, you could have a pretty big chunk of an interest of worthless land and... you know, worthless for anything except perhaps camping on it."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,370.464,381.763,"--Right, but Congress was trying to define a category of land that was really causing the problem, and in the amended version of the act it acted much more closely and precisely to target that particular land."
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.862,430.785,"I must admit, one has to marvel at the prognosticative ability, or else the serendipity of the Congress, that 3 years before our opinion in Hodel it should pass a statute which happens to solve the very things we were troubled with in Hodel."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,430.785,451.571,"Well, I think that in fact the two key things that the Court pointed out in Hodel that it was most concerned about were first that this... taking just one arbitrary year before the decedent died might really result in the escheat of very valuable interest, and secondly that it completely and totally abolished all descent and devise, even in cases where descent and devise might consolidate interests."
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.836,494.267,I don't know that we said in Hodel that there wasn't enough of a need.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,505.515,514.443,"--I think, as I read the... as I read the Court's opinion, what it was speaking of was the complete and total and absolute abrogation of rights of descent and devise."
1996.95-1595,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,580.394,585.888,Doesn't that effectively mean that you can't devise it to the people you are most likely to want to devise it to?
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,603.24,604.842,I actually don't think that's true.
1996.95-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,634.501,635.122,We--
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,635.122,640.846,"So generally it will be other... or at least, very frequently it will be other people who you do have a family tie to, who are--"
1996.95-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,640.846,647.548,"--But you're talking about collateral heirs, a quite distant relationship if you get to the third or fourth generation, aren't you?"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,647.548,649.04,--You might be.
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.836,664.17,"Mr. Feldman, I don't read Hodel as resting upon the total elimination of the ability to devise."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,681.261,683.322,"Right, and--"
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.322,685.744,"And it does virtually that here, too."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,685.744,702.255,"--And the Court... I would say the Court also said in Hodel the difference in this case from the other cases that the Court reaffirmed that have affirmed the authority of the sovereign to set rules of descent and devise, the difference in this case is the fact that descent and devise are completely abolished."
1996.95-1595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,725.591,751.556,"With respect to that, Mr. Feldman, I was trying to think of any other kind of regulation by the sovereign of the right to dispose of property on death that would be comparable to this, and you rely on the large power of the sovereign to regulate the disposition of property on death, and here the regulation says most lineal descendants will not qualify."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,766.356,791.253,"I don't think... there's nothing I can... I can't answer that I can give you an example of any particular statute that does... that restricts the category of lineal devisees so thoroughly, although there may be statutes that give... include... they give an interest to a spouse, for example, over the interests of children, or something like that, that could in some circumstances have that effect, but there have been, and the Court have upheld statutes that have restricted devise to one's children."
1996.95-1595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,806.674,819.83,"But most of them come up as except... in the main, you can devise your property, but there are these exceptions, and here is in the main you can't, unless you come under the exception of somebody who already has a share of that same parcel."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,819.83,827.107,"--And I think you really have to look at the unique character of this property interest, the kinds of property interests that we're talking about in this case."
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,827.107,828.018,Why is it unique?
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,828.018,840.296,"It's unique because these interests are extremely small fractional interests, a kind of fractional interest that very, very rarely exists outside of Indian law, and that the owners may well in fact have abandoned the property."
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,869.914,879.25,It was a nuisance that Congress created by... principally by prohibiting the Indians from deeding this property.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,881.353,882.974,"--Well, I--"
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.974,885.564,Weren't there severe limits on the alienation of it by the Indians?
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,885.564,887.177,--There are limits on the alienation of it--
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.177,898.913,"So Congress gives this property to the Indians, puts these severe limitations on it which creates this problem of fractionalization, and then comes in and says, because of this problem of fractionalization which we've created, we're going to take it away from you."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,898.913,924.54,"--I'm not sure that it's fair, though, to say that Congress created... the process of fractionalization may have been a byproduct of a number of different factors, one among them are the fact that it's not subject to State taxes, and that the Government bears the cost of administering the property, and thereby it doesn't give anybody an incentive to determine whether this is property that they really want, and really want to do something with, or if this is just abandoned property that they're just going to ignore and pass on to the next generation in equal undivided interests."
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,924.54,932.604,"Well, I suppose the Government could purchase these small interests, or take them by eminent domain--"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,932.604,934.886,That's correct.
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,934.886,940.241,"--paying something, and I guess the Government also could help the tribes do just that."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,940.241,960.484,"That's correct, although the magnitude of the problem... you know, each of these interests... in this case some of the interests are an estimated value of $5, or $10, or $15, but the magnitude of the problem over millions of acres of Indian land, where the ownership is highly fractionated, is very, very substantial, and Congress reasonably--"
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,960.484,967.738,But Congress has imposed so many detailed requirements on efforts by the tribes to consolidate.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,970.299,971.26,--I think actually--
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,971.26,971.581,--and make it simpler.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,971.581,991.383,"--Actually, I'm sure there's room for improvement in the statutory schemes here, but in the Indian Land Consolidation Act and some of the other provisions that are right, I think... this is codified at 29 U.S.C. 2206 at 2205, 4, 3... there are some other provisions Congress enacted to enable tribes to take a variety of actions to purchase land or to consolidate interests on the reservation."
1996.95-1595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.964,1009.145,"Mr. Feldman, can I ask you sort of a basic question?"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1028.768,1031.761,"--I'm sorry, that no--"
1996.95-1595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.761,1045.008,"Just, all property owned by any member of the tribe shall escheat to the tribe at death, but would not interfere with the owner's right to dispose of it inter vivos at any time during the 20 years."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1046.481,1056.114,"--I think it would under this Court's decision in Hodel, in fact, at least, and insofar as that was based on prior cases, I think it would violate the Takings Clause on that basis as well."
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1092.229,1104.997,"--Well, does the amended statute prevent descent, I assume without a will, of an interest even where the descent under the circumstances would result in a consolidation?"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1104.997,1110.431,"It doesn't do that, but if you think about it, it would be a very, very rare case where that will happen."
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1110.431,1111.042,It seems to say so.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1111.042,1112.281,It would--
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1112.281,1117.317,It says nothing in this section shall prohibit the devise--
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1117.317,1117.717,--Right.
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1117.717,1120.258,--of such an escheatable fractional interest.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1120.258,1120.579,Right.
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1120.579,1122.309,But if there's an intestate succession--
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1122.309,1126.572,"No, I agree with you, I think that it would prevent any descent, that it's... what it's saying--"
1996.95-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1126.572,1128.173,--Even if it results in a consolidation.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1128.173,1159.244,"--Right, but it will be a very unusual situation where descent would... descent was what caused the problem, and it would be a very unusual situation where that would result in consolidation, because if somebody who has an interest, passes it to his two, three, four, five, six, however many there are children, they're each going to get a smaller part of that, and even if one of them already owns a very small interest in the property, it's going to be very unlikely that it's going to result in... it's almost certain to result in increased fractionation, and so I don't think Congress had to go that far in order to remedy the problem, and indeed--"
1996.95-1595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1159.244,1160.213,What do--
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1160.213,1169.069,"--I was just going to say that I do think, as I was saying before, that the statute should be... would be constitutional at least insofar as it prohibits descent, and if there is a case like that out there--"
1996.95-1595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1169.069,1188.523,"--But Mr. Feldman, isn't that a... I know you asked us to say, at least with respect to descent or further fractionalizing a share by devise, but those people are not before this Court, and we do have these people who were devised shares that were not reduced further by the devise."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1207.314,1213.328,"--Yeah... I'm not suggesting the Court should decide any case that's not before it, but I do think... there's two points."
1996.95-1595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1222.444,1224.714,"Those could be left open, but I don't--"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1224.714,1225.806,--Those at least should be left open--
1996.95-1595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1225.806,1226.096,--And--
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1226.096,1240.436,"--and it may well be that the Court's reasoning, although we don't... reasoning... if it were to reach the conclusion that the statute's unconstitutional as applied here, the Court's reasoning may well make clear that in these other contexts it would be constitutional, albeit those cases themselves would be left for another time."
1996.95-1595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1240.436,1243.378,--May I modify my hypothetical?
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1259.94,1267.254,I think it... I suppose it might depend at least in part on what it is that Congress is intending to accomplish by that.
1996.95-1595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.796,1272.629,Intending to consolidate property interests that are small and fractionated in the--
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1272.629,1272.939,"--Right, but--"
1996.95-1595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1272.939,1275.13,--in the tribe.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1275.13,1290.01,"--Well, insofar as it deals with just very small fractionated interests, our argument is that it would be constitutional, but if a statute like that also applied to, for instance, entire interests in the property, then it's hard to see what it would be trying to accomplish, other than just... it wouldn't be remedying any kind of nuisance--"
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1290.01,1290.48,Well--
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1290.48,1290.761,--for the community.
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.546,1303.099,--You're saying property you don't care enough to will it to anybody goes back to the tribe.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1303.099,1303.83,"Well, I... it's--"
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1303.83,1313.185,"We said in Hodel, Justice O'Connor's opinion said that it may be appropriate to minimize further compounding by abolishing the descent of such interest by rules of intestacy."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1313.185,1314.437,"--Right, and it's possible--"
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.437,1317.229,Thereby forcing the owners to formally designate an heir--
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1317.229,1317.689,--Right.
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.689,1318.511,--to prevent escheat.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1318.511,1322.805,"It's possible that a statute like that would be constitutional and, indeed, there are other contexts--"

1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1325.457,1327.417,--To... it would solve--
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.417,1334.111,"And it would focus especially on these little interests that are so insignificant that, you know, the person doesn't care enough--"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1334.111,1334.642,--I don't--
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1334.642,1336.395,--to even mention in a will.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1336.395,1340.326,"--I don't believe it would... the problem is, I don't believe it would focus on those interests."
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.922,1348.814,Intestate.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1349.144,1349.585,All intestate.
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1349.585,1349.945,--Yes.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1349.945,1350.766,All intestate descent.
1996.95-1595,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.1,1397.667,"Then it seems to me if you haven't gone that far, really... if you said that was okay, I don't know why you can't say we're going to insist on inter vivos action in order to protect the value and the interest."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1426.004,1430.478,Yes I... I can only answer that I think that it may be that you could do that--
1996.95-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.478,1431.017,Well--
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1431.017,1434.45,--but that what Congress did in this case is much more narrowly tailored to dealing with--
1996.95-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.45,1439.762,--A great many wills don't simply set out parcels of property and do nothing else.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1458.645,1458.956,--Right.
1996.95-1595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1469.542,1473.916,Are any of the Indian lands in question here ever subject to partition?
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1481.15,1483.083,"--Under some circumstances, yes."
1996.95-1595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1493.748,1498.821,"And if it does, I suppose that only certain authorized persons at the sale, because it can't be devised to a non-Indian."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1498.821,1500.934,"It can be... right, it can't be."
1996.95-1595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1502.476,1503.888,Or transferred to a non-Indian.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1503.888,1514.114,"--It can be... if an Indian has an ownership interest in a parcel of land and seeks to take it out of trust status, ordinarily if the person is competent the Secretary agrees to that, and then at that point it can be transferred--"
1996.95-1595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1514.114,1520.709,"But who would be the bidder at the partition sale, if there are limited... if there are a limited number of--"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1520.709,1521.18,"--No, I--"
1996.95-1595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1521.18,1521.917,--qualified owners?
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1521.917,1534.757,"--I think... I believe there would be authority even to take it out of trust status, take... to view the, let's say a unanimous application by the owners, to view that as their request to take it out of trust status--"
1996.95-1595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1534.757,1536.289,"Well, but then it wouldn't be partitioned."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1536.289,1538.259,"--Well, they'd sell it and then--"
1996.95-1595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1538.259,1538.64,"If it's unanimous, you don't need partition."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1538.64,1557.302,"--Well, they'd want to sell it and then it would be partitioned, but I do think that partitioning as a practical matter is not really a solution to the problem, because taking a parcel of land, especially with the size of some of these ownership interests involved, and trying to figure out how fairly to divide it up so the economic value of what you're getting is equal to your ownership interest is extraordinary difficult."
1996.95-1595,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1557.302,1560.923,"But that's just what happens in the... I mean, outside of the Indian law, isn't that what happens?"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1560.923,1561.574,"Right, but--"
1996.95-1595,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1561.574,1565.087,"And moreover, hasn't that stopped the proliferation of these interests?"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1575.313,1576.024,--I think--
1996.95-1595,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1576.024,1584.208,"You give people the right to partition, or to ask for it, and the person who owns $5 worth of land says, you know, I'll sell it to him for the $5."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1585.53,1585.91,--Right.
1996.95-1595,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1592.234,1593.745,That's because we've had that system.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1593.745,1603.272,"--The fractions are so small that it gets to be very, very cumbersome to effectively partition, or even to... well, I guess it could be sold, but--"
1996.95-1595,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1603.272,1618.582,"No, I thought... my point is I thought that outside the Indian context we find that we don't have this problem because there are these mechanisms in place, and so if you... why couldn't you, instead of taking the thing away, just put the same mechanisms in place?"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1620.143,1620.834,--But you have--
1996.95-1595,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1620.834,1621.505,I'm just... what the reason is.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1623.825,1624.737,--I think--
1996.95-1595,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1624.737,1625.324,"--or wouldn't happen, or couldn't?"
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1625.324,1639.445,--I think the reasons is because in order to partition... I suppose one reason is that it is thought that you don't want to just dispossess all of these Indians of their land because perhaps some owner of a very small interest doesn't... wants to have it partitioned.
1996.95-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.445,1655.595,"Well, it's one thing, too, for an owner, say, of three-quarters of a tract to buy out fractions from the other quarter, but for someone with 3/100ths interest to start a partition proceeding, you have quite different incentives."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1655.595,1671.065,"That's right, and also the one other thing I'd add is that this land is... the administrative expenses of upkeep of the land are borne by the United States, and it's not subject to State taxes, and therefore you don't have some of the incentives of why owners of land in a non-Indian context that gets fractionated would want to partition it, so you can just deal with those problems."
1996.95-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.065,1678.389,All of this just seems to me to say the Government has created an economic wonderland which has caused this problem.
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1700.946,1717.004,"I suppose the only answer is that because of... it really goes to the whole history of Indian law and all of the purposes that are served by holding the land in trust and maintaining an Indian land base that is a much more complex problem that just saying, let's take the land out of trust or whatever we would have to do and treat this like any other land."
1996.95-1595,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1717.004,1718.657,"No, but let's take one of the mechanisms."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1760.206,1770.092,"There... I suppose that there are partition schemes, there are partition regulations that we cite in our brief that are currently applicable to this land that allow partition in some circumstances."
1996.95-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.247,1795.897,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
1996.95-1595,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1795.897,1796.448,Thank you.
1996.95-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1796.448,1797.76,"Mr. Martell, we'll hear from you."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,1797.76,1802.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.224,1896.814,"Two and 6 acres in each parcel, or total?"
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,1896.814,1915.647,"--When I divided his... the acreage by his interest, in one parcel it was 6 acres, in four other parcels, those were 4-acre tracts, and in three other parcels those tracts were in excess of 2 acres, so a taking even of small land is still a taking."
1996.95-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1968.001,1970.862,"Well, why would that be, Mr. Martell?"
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,1982.33,1984.962,He wasn't dependent on income.
1996.95-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1989.305,1996.36,"Well, but surely it's every... it's no bigger a headache to devise it inter... or to grant it inter vivos than to leave it by will, is it?"
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,1996.36,1998.741,"--Well, it's a tremendous bureaucratic process."
1996.95-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2006.816,2009.417,He would have to go through it if he did it in his lifetime.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2013.952,2016.833,--The third--
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.833,2021.597,Isn't it true that he did consult the Bureau of Indian Affairs in drafting the will?
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2028.842,2029.832,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.921,2054.507,"There's no explanation of that in the record, is there, why they wouldn't have been advised that the devises didn't comply with the statute?"
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2054.507,2055.268,No.
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.313,2062.101,Yes.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2086.918,2087.55,Right.
1996.95-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2087.55,2106.081,"Now, suppose they got that, and their signature on that, it says, if you check B, proceed to page 3 and sign that, and it happened on page 3 and 2 is all the necessary stuff for an inter vivos transfer, i.e., all the necessary stuff for a trust, and you set up the trust, and then at your death it goes to the beneficiary."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2118.679,2126.744,"I don't think it would be a due process problem, but I think there would still be a problem in that the land is not compensated."
1996.95-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.744,2135.282,"Well then, why could a State ever, for example, say traditional dower rights are, the wife got one-third of a life estate in the husband's property."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2150.229,2150.96,I--
1996.95-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2150.96,2153.933,"--giving everybody proper notice, giving everybody plenty of chance?"
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2161.257,2167.442,"--I think the theory is, is that he's being forced to forfeit his land to the tribes."
1996.95-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2167.442,2168.942,Well you have escheat.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2169.323,2169.763,Right.
1996.95-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2169.763,2170.084,--escheat.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2185.292,2194.198,"I think there wouldn't be abandonment if there was an opportunity, if there was a process, you knew about the process, and you chose not to do it."
1996.95-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2197.77,2201.483,It's abandoned.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2201.483,2203.263,But that's... people here don't about the process.
1996.95-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2203.263,2203.664,Yes.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2214.222,2215.522,"Not that I know of, Your Honors."
1996.95-1595,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2218.584,2236.305,"Because, of course, with non-Indian property there are State and local taxes applicable, and if the owner doesn't pay them for a period of time, there are procedures that the State or county can go through to forfeit the property for nonpayment of taxes."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2306.902,2319.419,"--Correct, Your Honor, and I... you know, I would maintain that that's pretty much the essence of it, because Indians take... took this property under the allotment act with the understanding that they would have these rights to--"
1996.95-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2319.419,2325.644,But the Government has a great deal of authority under the Constitution over the affairs of the Indian tribes.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2341.336,2342.445,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.445,2344.127,"Well, you concede that?"
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2363.939,2365.94,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.94,2375.327,"Yes, but it does apply to the entire Indian population, and all Indian lands where there is an interest that is undivided and it meets the statutory formula."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2375.327,2376.188,Right.
1996.95-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.188,2377.848,Maybe we should just talk to each other.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2407.888,2408.709,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.709,2413.382,"You... it's not a class action, or it's not an industry-wide piece of litigation."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2413.382,2413.842,Right.
1996.95-1595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.842,2414.884,You would just have a--
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2444.703,2445.892,Okay.
1996.95-1595,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2482.727,2485.168,"Mr. Martell, what about the first difference?"
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2507.032,2508.574,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2515.569,2524.936,So that significant change turns out still to be undeveloped and unused.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2524.936,2525.807,"Correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.807,2527.707,I gather the tribes don't care.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2540.475,2548.072,I think that the tribes strategically don't care because they get the land by not making an effort.
1996.95-1595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.352,2564.523,"Oh, when I say don't care, I don't mean don't care about the land."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2565.882,2574.771,"--They care about it, but there's such an overwhelming bureaucracy there that it's hard to make headway into it."
1996.95-1595,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2705.403,2717.763,"But would you contest... suppose all... the only limit was, you can give away what you have, but you can't divide it up into further hands."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2731.22,2737.866,"I think it would Your Honor, because his land would not be taken from him, and that's in fact what he did, so--"
1996.95-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2737.866,2758.418,"What if the Government were to put in some sort of a unitization program like the States have put in a lot of oilfields, where the thing is consolidated into certain minimum tracts and you get a percentage from that, but you don't have the right to deal on your own with it any more."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2761.44,2767.675,"--I think it would be permissible, because you'd still have the identifiable property interest."
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.675,2774.77,Would you refresh my recollection on the facts of this case?
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2776.661,2778.36,"He had 10 children, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2778.36,2782.433,"So that if the will were given effect, you would have further fractionalization, then, wouldn't you?"
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2785.286,2787.216,"No, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2807.352,2813.964,"In other words, this decedent left his interests in such a way that there was no further fractionalization--"
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2813.964,2814.706,Correct.
1996.95-1595,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2814.706,2815.837,--of the real property interests.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2815.837,2816.708,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2816.708,2820.689,I don't... would you give me a little more detail?
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2826.432,2829.024,I guess I've confused it by saying he had 10 children.
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2832.747,2836.009,"Oh, so there's one devise to the one child that's at stake here."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2836.009,2840.692,"There's six children here, but each of them had a specific devise that gave them--"
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.692,2842.254,And each in a separate parcel.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2842.254,2842.755,--Correct.
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2842.755,2843.085,I see.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2844.004,2845.336,Sorry to be unclear.
1996.95-1595,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2845.336,2861.154,"And would you clarify for me... this case does not further subdivide the interests, but the Government says even if it did it would be valid."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2868.01,2868.761,Correct.
1996.95-1595,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2868.761,2871.372,--the Government says that would be valid.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2878.736,2882.699,I don't think they can prohibit it unless they pay for it.
1996.95-1595,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2882.699,2884.59,Okay.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2887.883,2891.065,That's--
1996.95-1595,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2891.065,2894.928,Why would there be a payment requirement there?
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2910.388,2913.37,"--I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2913.37,2936.365,"Mr. Martell, I'm surprised, because I thought you told me that you thought it would be a legitimate restriction for the Government to say to Mr. Youpee or anyone else, you can give each parcel that you have to one person, or to that many different people as you have parcels, but you cannot take that one parcel and turn that parcel into two."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2944.519,2946.182,"Correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2946.182,2949.983,And then you seemed to give a different response to Justice O'Connor.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2955.298,2956.428,Okay.
1996.95-1595,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2956.798,2958.831,"And no further division, and that would be okay."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2958.831,2959.061,--I guess I was confused.
1996.95-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2967.066,2979.554,"So I guess that means that a number of applications of this very statute would be permissible, although the one involving your clients would not be, because this statute will prevent that."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,2981.966,2987.849,But I would think it... I guess I'm getting confused.
1996.95-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2996.365,3009.104,There are a lot of... there are statutes in different countries that... and that's what I was... this case differs from the last case in that here there is a set of people whom you can leave the property to and a set to whom you cannot leave it to.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,3010.504,3011.195,Right.
1996.95-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3011.195,3011.886,Okay.
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,3047.71,3055.835,"It seems like most of the State laws that deal with... you know, with forced heirs like that are doing it for the benefit of the family."
1996.95-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3055.835,3058.987,"Right, and here they say, you see the tribe is like your family."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,3060.535,3063.427,But not for the benefit of Mr. Youpee's.
1996.95-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3063.427,3065.73,"No, and that's also true if you don't like your children."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,3097.432,3098.063,Correct.
1996.95-1595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3098.063,3102.524,"Either from a different reservation, or in some cases different tribes, isn't that possible?"
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,3102.524,3102.904,"Right, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3148.124,3158.491,"How large an area is the Fort Peck reservation, and how many of the tribe reside on it?"
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,3158.491,3164.214,It's a... within exterior boundaries it's a million acres.
1996.95-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3170.879,3177.194,"So if it's a family, it's a rather large family."
1996.95-1595,1,40025,rene_a_martell,,3177.194,3178.353,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3182.706,3184.472,"Thank you, Mr. Martell."
