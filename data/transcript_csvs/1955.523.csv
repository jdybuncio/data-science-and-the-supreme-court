1955.523,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.064,"Number 523, Joan Greenway Collins et al., versus American Buslines Incorporated, Respondent Employer."
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,26.753,28.066,May it please the Court.
1955.523,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,598.733,614.908,"Would you mind explaining the subject to mean if -- do tell us, the Arizona compensation awards are greater than the -- than the California award, is that right?"
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,614.908,617.293,"Considerably, yes."
1955.523,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,617.293,623.367,"Then, an insurance for the greater would take care of the lesser."
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,623.367,624.472,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1955.523,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,624.746,626.428,But the -- I don't quite follow it.
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,636.272,639.134,"This is where the added cost would come from, Your Honor."
1955.523,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,665.359,668.878,"Could automatically insured from the State, in the Arizona State fund?"
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,668.878,670.163,I do not believe.
1955.523,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,686.103,689.063,(Voice Overlap) Let me ask you a further question.
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,697.629,702.201,"Your Honor, other than a possible slight increase in cost, I know of none."
1955.523,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,703.324,705.883,That is usually what the matter in insuring cost.
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,705.883,706.325,That's right.
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,719.515,728.661,"But if -- if he insured on the -- solely under California, the employer would be protected in both States and so would the employee."
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,728.661,735.403,"If he -- he would be completely protected, if he insures with any private insurance company which permits him to get general coverage."
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,735.403,738.417,He insured with the fund in California.
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,738.417,747.475,"My impression, Your Honor, is that the California fund also would not permit him to pay an Arizona judgment so that the net effect would be that I -- I --"
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,747.475,756.038,But the -- both the employer and the employee would be protected as the California being the residence of the employee.
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,763.751,767.36,"In accordance with the California law, yes, but he would not be protected as I understand it against ours."
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,767.36,770.079,"Well, what -- but he got the workmen's compensation wherever he went?"
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,770.079,781.659,"He'd either have take workmen's compensation wherever he goes or else do what Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggest and what the interstate carriers would necessarily do, namely, go outside the state funds and take his insurance with somebody big enough to cover all jurisdiction."
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,781.659,786.281,(Voice Overlap) actually wouldn't do that if they could get full protection from California.
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,786.281,787.496,Of course not.
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,788.225,793.384,And they -- they would have the full protection of the California law in an Arizona accident.
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,793.384,800.448,"Now -- now, Your Honor is on that point, but I -- I must -- that I'm unable to answer you as satisfactorily as I wish I could, I am not sure."
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,815.967,816.522,"No, but --"
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,816.522,816.669,Am I correct in that?
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,816.669,821.534,But protect him in California for an accident that took place in Arizona.
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,821.534,825.057,"He would be protected, but only in the amount which California allows."
1955.523,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,825.057,826.26,In the place of his residence --
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,826.26,827.183,Right.
1955.523,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,871.648,880.609,"Would you -- would it trouble you if before you go into our cases, you would stick on your proposition, the propositions of law you're sending to this Court."
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,880.609,903.157,"The proposition of law, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, which we tended to this Court is, that the Constitution of the United States by virtue of its Commerce Clause, puts no limitation on the power of the State of Arizona to give a workmen's compensation award to a driver in interstate commerce who is in fact injured in that State."
1955.523,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,922.167,924.334,But not as a general problem.
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,955.47,959.66,"We can word it in terms of the insurance cost and if that puts it more narrowly, fairly enough."
1955.523,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,971.181,982.855,"All I'm suggesting is if Arizona could constitutionally -- I'm sorry, the right to insurance to cover out of state injury, then the problem wouldn't arise, would it?"
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,982.855,986.166,"If Arizona chose to do that, but I must concede that Arizona has it, so that --"
1955.523,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,986.166,986.885,I understand that.
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,988.761,993.086,"It's an extremely narrow problem, indeed it is."
1955.523,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1461.093,1470.348,I suppose it's the whole concept of burden implied financial burden or at least predominantly involved financial burden.
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1473.323,1488.48,"Mr. Justice, but in your -- in -- in the opinion of the Court in Freeman against Hewitt, for example, the -- you yourself were careful to emphasize the possible greater leniency, which may be allowed to police power regulations."
1955.523,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1653.22,1666.514,"Mr. Frank, did I understand you to say you did not know what the practice in the industry was so far as insuring against liability in all -- all states is concerned with these interstate operations?"
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1666.514,1671.027,"No, I assume that, and indeed, I -- I am acquainted with the general practice."
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1709.525,1713.574,Perhaps you said (Inaudible)
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1719.374,1726.552,This company had sufficient compensation in Arizona so that there is a reasonable basis for claiming against this fund.
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1732.884,1735.263,What did it do with the -- what do you do in the Arizona --
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1735.263,1736.366,What we'll do in Arizona is this.
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1736.366,1739.422,"No, no, do you -- do you take out of policy?"
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1746.285,1758.197,"There is a system of paying into the fund, which Mr. Franks represents, and this is done on a system of assessments and -- and notices and so on."
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1764.843,1769.451,"Well, your -- your view to this -- to this company carry workmen's compensation under the Arizona --"
1955.523,0,30403,john_p_frank,,1769.451,1785.514,"Sufficiently so that there -- no claim has been raised at any time, but that Mrs.Collins is properly proceeding against the Industrial Commission for possible dispute which the Industrial Commission may someday have on American Busline, may bring Mr. Franks back here, but I will not be with it."
1955.523,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1827.399,1831.132,Mr. Franks.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,1831.132,1836.842,May it please the Court.
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2298.374,2305.738,"Because that picture that gave this Court some trouble on your statute first came before us 25 years ago, whenever it was."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,2305.738,2306.772,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2920.506,2922.487,"Now, what -- what is that first conclusion?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,2922.487,2936.242,"The first conclusion was that to impose the Act upon employers in the interstate commerce would constitute an undue burden upon the interstate commerce, if the Court please."
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2936.242,2939.537,"And therefore, it was not covered in your act?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,2939.537,2940.504,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2944.94,2946.678,And that still stands?
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,2946.678,2961.411,"The Court, Mr. Justice Reed, did affirm that conclusion in the instant case but repudiated the other conclusion regarding the regular employment, yes."
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3070.51,3071.567,"Mr. Franks, how --"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3071.567,3071.674,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3071.674,3077.065,How would this constitute double coverage?
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3077.065,3089.932,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, in this way, coverage in the State of California, for instance, involves a payment of premiums to the State of California."
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3127.316,3141.169,What would be the difference between that and public liability insurance that that -- would've had to be carried in each of the states to which a corporation like this operated?
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3141.169,3142.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3148.796,3155.627,"I mean, from the standpoint of coverage, I -- of course, I recognize other differences, but I mean, from a standpoint of double coverage."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3155.627,3156.335,Yes.
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3156.335,3159.374,"They have to comply with the law of the state, I think."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3159.374,3165.119,"If Your -- if Your Honor please, the -- the types of insurance are not written together."
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3167.121,3168.771,Are not written together?
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3168.771,3170.777,That is correct.
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3171.772,3173.604,Do you mean in the practice in the insurance payment?
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3173.604,3175.946,"In the practice of the insurance field, yes, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3175.946,3177.44,Couldn't they agree --
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3177.44,3177.906,I doubt.
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3177.906,3178.736,-- without any great --
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3178.736,3188.653,I doubt that they are such -- there are two divergent fields and aspects.
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3188.653,3193.945,"Do you mean, the difference is between -- the different states are so great that they couldn't write one policy to cover it?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3193.945,3198.586,"That would be one difference, Your Honor, yes, the extended coverage."
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3226.963,3231.329,"There is going to be difference in amount that they'd have to pay, wouldn't it be?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3231.329,3234.697,"One of the differences, if Your Honor please, yes."
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3249.89,3265.551,"But if a man was hurt in -- in California, he wouldn't be subjected -- he wouldn't be subjected then to the -- to -- to the Arizona procedures if he was following the -- living under the California law, would he?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3265.551,3266.433,"No, Your Honor, I wouldn't assume that he would be, no."
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3266.433,3278.343,"And -- and if he was -- and he was injured in Arizona, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't be bothered nor with his company be bothered by the California law, would it?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3278.343,3281.858,"Possibly so, Your Honor, and if they're speaking of the instance --"
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3281.858,3284.265,"Well, then where does the double coverage -- where does the double coverage come in?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3284.265,3294.629,"Well, of course, in this particular case, if Your Honor please, there was no coverage in Arizona on this particular employee."
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3314.853,3318.572,For injuries sustained in different states.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3318.572,3320.043,"Possibly so, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3353.17,3358.006,"But there's nothing to suggest in any discussion that there would be two recoveries, is it?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3358.006,3363.904,"No, Mr. Justice Burton, there is not."
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3395.505,3417.065,"Mr. Counsel, would you call my attention again or -- if you said that the -- the Arizona Court relied partly on the -- on the question of whether or not the party had ensured in California?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3417.065,3436.412,"Yes, Your Honor, that -- I believe Your Honor's reference is to the portion of the opinion that I quoted."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3725.045,3742.656,"May I ask you to elaborate it on me, Mr. Franks, to ask you this, as you state at the outset of the trial, Mr. Franks, and it appears from the brief filed in here, the American Buslines are not here."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3742.656,3742.989,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3742.989,3747.25,They are not here.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3785.764,3787.63,Mr. Justice Frankfurter --
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3787.63,3796.278,"I can think -- think that the decision is on the ground that the Commerce Clause limits (Inaudible), in what position?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3796.278,3804.54,"The -- the State's position, I'm speaking of the -- referring to the State, it would be the Industrial Commission of Arizona."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3808.629,3809.528,Out of its fund.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3809.528,3813.639,"Yes, Your Honor, the employer does not pay."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3817.03,3819.62,That means the depletion of state fund.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3819.62,3827.989,"Yes, Your Honor, in this instance, to the possible amount of $60,000 or $70,000, yes, that is what would be involved."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3827.989,3832.012,And -- and the depletion and --
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3832.012,3833.733,"Without premium, if I may state."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3833.733,3846.418,"That's a burden -- that's a burden upon commerce, how was that in -- how did the burden on commerce with result of the depletion of the fund?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3857.01,3857.13,If --
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3857.13,3859.225,There isn't any --
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3859.225,3870.594,"That is true, Your Honor, but in -- our business, as an insurance underwriter, which we are, we must of course deal with that situation."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3884.44,3909.31,"Well, would it -- I can hear you would object in the Court on -- I think, on the merits.I can hear a ground of due process that you or for the person and the award is paid by the State Department only if the -- if the bus line is -- it's insured in the state fund in this instance."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3909.31,3913.295,"The busline is insured in the state fund in this instance, Your Honor, but --"
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3913.295,3914.484,So long as the -- song long as the --
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3914.484,3914.802,Excuse me.
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3914.802,3922.099,"As long as the busline would get premium into the state fund, you're not, at this, affected."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3937.527,3939.849,"No, Your Honor, that would not be the contention."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3939.849,3946.325,"Well then, how is -- how -- how you in a position to maintain does a burden on the Commerce Clause?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3946.325,3961.331,"Well, if I -- Mr. Justice, if I might make this observation, unfortunately, we are arguing the federal commerce matter for the first time in this case here."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3966.427,3976.114,"I thought the full case turned on throughout that this has involved a burden on commerce, was the alternate below with the carriers, did the carrier push the argument below?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,3976.114,3979.296,"No, Your Honor, the carrier did not appear below."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4021.467,4023.18,Can it be said?
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4037.0,4037.825,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4037.825,4065.895,"I can't quite follow what it was that the company do but suppose this -- a different issue, suppose this Court in finding that there was a federal question, finding that in fact the decision turned on -- on a construction of the Commerce Clause, and suppose this Court should live and the assumed limitation upon the State's power derived from the Commerce Clause --"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4065.895,4066.294,"Yes, sir."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4066.294,4079.206,"-- in this case, this Court would send the case saying that -- that limitation that -- you can think that's a constitutional worry of your mind and you can pray this, as it's been indicated."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4082.565,4083.055,Yes.
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4083.055,4086.81,-- to this position and can -- not inconsistent in what this Court does.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4101.14,4116.76,"Well, if Your Honor please, I would like to be able to say that that were the case in Arizona in the interest of the state fund.However, I'm not sure that I could."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4116.76,4118.852,That's not for this Court to decide.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4118.852,4119.042,I would --
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4119.042,4121.45,"If we have nothing to do with that, that's a purely state (Inaudible)"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4121.45,4122.094,I would certainly --
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4122.094,4123.118,If I wanted to know --
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4123.118,4124.183,-- agree with you whole-heartedly.
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4124.183,4128.154,-- that you thought that was supposed to be on this record.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4128.154,4134.377,"I will have to answer that in this way, if Your Honor please, that I am not sure what the result would be."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4162.312,4187.96,"I dare say there is a quick answer that in my own mind and I had a little struggle with this, where in Arizona's interest claimed there's burden on commerce, it's a rather unusual thing for a state to say what have been -- that we can't do this because there's a burden on commerce to be immediately affect the party basing on claim."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4190.135,4209.473,"Well, Your Honor -- if Your Honor please, to me, the answer here is simply this, that the Courts in Arizona did not seem fit to burden interstate commerce and refused to do so."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4237.52,4237.58,Didn't they find --
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4237.58,4239.384,"Now, I'm afraid that's what happened, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4239.384,4242.567,"If they found reason for their own statute, we wouldn't be here."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4242.567,4243.369,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4243.369,4248.384,"And if we could say that they find reasons on their own statute, we would have to dismiss this case, is that right?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4248.384,4249.632,"That would be correct, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4249.632,4271.598,"But your own suggestion is that a state, any state as a member of the union could say, “We deny that they have power of the State because as a faithful member of the union, we, as our business, affects the Commerce Clause and we have to deny those powers because they want to respect the Commerce Clause.”"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4273.298,4275.388,"Well, not -- not exactly, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4275.589,4277.646,It must be that.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4277.646,4305.52,"My argument would be that when a state feels that due to the peculiar scheme -- scheme perhaps is not a good word, although, it's used in the case, but a peculiar pattern or system of our own acts, our own statute pertaining to the field of workmen's compensation, when we feel they are not applicable to a certain situation then that should end the matter."
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4305.52,4310.534,You can -- you can make that position perfectly easy.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4323.268,4324.043,Yes.
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4374.264,4376.021,We have a suggestion
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4407.863,4412.44,"Well, that might be a -- an entirely correct observation, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4413.167,4425.575,"Well, what -- what happened below, was it not Mr. Franks that the Commission was ordered to dismiss this claim that had been filed with it?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4431.754,4432.951,"Well, that, Mr. --"
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4432.951,4436.61,And that -- and that was on the petition for rehearing.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4436.61,4445.18,"Well, Mr. Justice Reed, the mandate, I don't know whether it's in the record or not."
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4445.18,4446.525,"Well, don't -- don't look for it."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4446.525,4455.939,But the -- the effect of the Supreme Court's decision was to sustain the Industrial Commission of Arizona.
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4456.692,4463.926,And they -- and they had held that these parties were not entitled to recover under the Act of Arizona?
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4463.926,4464.906,That is correct.
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4467.762,4468.391,I understand that.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4468.391,4471.693,"-- on this regularly employed theory, yes."
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4472.478,4474.631,"Now, -- now, it went back to them."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4478.296,4480.422,"If -- when it goes back from here, Your Honor?"
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4480.422,4481.831,Yes.
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4481.831,4488.341,That is -- one of the things that puzzled me is to how it might go back to the Industrial Commission.
1955.523,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4596.554,4607.04,"This is a -- this is an illustration of alert regards by the State, by an alert respect to the Constitution of the United States, isn't that it?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4607.04,4609.682,"That perhaps is true, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15037,sherman_minton,scotus_justice,4622.259,4634.805,"Absent -- this question of commerce, did the Supreme Court of Arizona hold that compensation could be required here to give -- recovered here in Arizona?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4634.805,4639.002,"Seemingly, Mr. Justice Minton, yes, in this case."
1955.523,1,15037,sherman_minton,scotus_justice,4653.724,4663.843,"Well, if that's -- if that's true, then this argument about, as suggested by Justice Frankfurter might -- as the Commerce might fall out as a mere surplusage."
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4663.843,4666.719,"Well, that could possibly be, Your Honor."
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4674.354,4676.685,"How -- how -- before you go on, could --"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4676.685,4677.983,"Yes, Mr. Justice --"
1955.523,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4677.983,4686.339,"How did these people, petitioners here, how -- how do they come under the Workmen's Compensation Act?"
1955.523,1,30300,john_f_franks,,4694.834,4708.364,"If the Court please, if Your Honor please, the Industrial Commission of Arizona is the forum for all processing of industrial claim even where there is all process in the forum."
1955.523,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4863.645,4869.243,Mr. Frank.
1955.523,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4869.243,4878.05,Could I have the petition please on this?
1955.523,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4924.032,4928.725,Do we seriously consider a problem?
1955.523,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4928.725,4928.906,As a matter --
1955.523,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4928.906,4930.594,Should we seriously consider a problem?
1955.523,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4930.594,4941.765,"I would say, Mr. -- Mr. Justice, that -- that I should not have -- have been lied some about it because I know that our justices suffered pretty mildly over this case."
