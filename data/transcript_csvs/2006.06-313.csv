2006.06-313,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,1.311,We'll hear argument--
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,7.823,14.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-313,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,101.988,109.436,"Well, we didn't... haven't applied it to a penalty phase closing argument, but we've certainly applied the general standard to the penalty phase."
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,109.436,110.438,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,131.726,133.617,May I ask one sort of preliminary question.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,142.176,144.157,I think it certainly could be.
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,147.202,150.232,Do you think his argument here contained any misstatements of the law?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,150.232,151.297,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,151.297,151.921,You don't.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,151.921,164.369,"To help answer the question, though, in that context, Donnelly and Darden set down some general considerations that, while not exclusive, help provide the post and beams of the fundamental fairness standard."
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,180.755,196.824,"Well, just on your assumption, to make your hypothetical clear, you, you want us to assume that three or four times at least he violated a constitutional standard?"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,196.824,199.043,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,199.043,201.933,I just want to know what arguendo assumption you are making.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,201.933,215.16,"The assumption is that under the first tier in Donnelly and Darden that the statements were improper in the sense that within the context of the multi-factor kind of considerations, whether or not they were improper, because obviously--"
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,215.16,221.848,"I mean, they'd be improper because they... they were based on an emotional appeal that's improper?"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,221.848,227.578,--It could be improper in the sense that it was a misstatement of evidence.
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,264.063,271.573,Don't you think the argument based on the General Patton analogy told the jurors they had a duty to do what he suggested?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,271.573,273.043,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,273.886,276.245,What is the relevance of that argument otherwise?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,276.245,279.15,I would not... it was not particularly relevant.
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,288.147,293.629,"Do you think if he said in so many words, you have a duty to return the death penalty, that would have been a misstatement of the law?"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,293.629,299.561,"--Yes, a duty to return the death penalty, which certainly is a misstatement of the law."
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.561,300.047,And you don't think this could be so interpreted?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,303.249,304.357,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,304.357,317.443,That passage was in the context of other statements in which I think it's fair to say that he analogized the role of the juror to the role of a soldier who has to have the courage and the duty to kill.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,317.443,326.163,I think a reasonable interpretation of those statements could be that the duty was to make the decision whether or not to impose the death penalty.
2006.06-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.163,326.382,Wait.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,358.899,363.084,It's certainly not improper to make statements based on inferences from the evidence.
2006.06-313,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,363.084,367.378,"Well, do you think the Patton argument has anything to do with the evidence?"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,433.134,434.351,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.27,451.127,I don't understand your concession.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,491.752,500.592,"--And Your Honor, to the extent that I would certainly agree that those arguments based on the strength of the case were not necessarily--"
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.592,507.074,"I suppose your concession about the duty is based on Chief Justice Stone's opinion in Viereck, isn't it?"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,507.074,512.134,"--Well, in the sense that Viereck was not directly--"
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,512.134,514.24,"Which did involve the very word ""duty""."
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,514.24,515.523,--I'm sorry?
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,515.523,521.972,Chief justice Stone's opinion in Viereck talked about telling the jury that they have a duty and condemned that.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,524.004,530.33,"I think the concession is important to get beyond the statements in isolation, because--"
2006.06-313,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,530.33,534.546,It's not just in isolation.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,554.536,556.769,--Yes.
2006.06-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,562.735,566.748,"It is... I agree with you, I agree with you that we should look at the whole picture."
2006.06-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.181,699.632,Who said he was not supposed to do these things?
2006.06-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,699.632,700.915,"--Well, there's a brief--"
2006.06-313,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,700.915,701.617,"I'm sorry, counsel."
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,704.35,711.756,"In Newlon, Your Honor, it was a due process case which the same prosecutor tried, and it was an Eighth Circuit case."
2006.06-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.52,714.143,And is that the law here?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,714.143,714.972,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.972,715.628,--It's not?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,726.905,732.434,"To the extent that Newlon sets out those arguments, no, that's not incorrect."
2006.06-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,755.126,756.144,Was there with the Patton and the goo?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,756.144,761.092,"--There was not an objection... there was an objection to the Patton, but it was overruled."
2006.06-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,761.092,761.544,Was there a curative instruction?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,761.544,762.046,"No, there was not."
2006.06-313,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,762.046,771.371,"Counsel, I'm looking at the quote, the statement, the reference to Patton, and I have to say I don't read it as imposing a duty."
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,798.531,799.389,"There is none, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,809.259,811.587,In Viereck the words were:
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,826.518,828.628,"Well, I would distinguish Viereck on two grounds."
2006.06-313,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,848.808,864.55,But you just... that's a bit inconsistent with your point that Newlon is distinguishable because there were no objections at all and that was the reason for the court saying this goes too far to the prosecutor.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,866.504,872.173,In Newlon the jury was never told to disregard the statements.
2006.06-313,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,875.78,876.732,--Certain statements.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,881.715,882.34,Correct.
2006.06-313,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,899.645,904.239,To that extent the two cases were the same because in Newlon there were no objections either.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,904.239,906.454,No objections at all.
2006.06-313,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,922.995,923.588,Do you think--
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,923.588,925.226,So assuming that the defense attorney was... I'm sorry.
2006.06-313,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,925.226,931.223,--There were two cases cited as involving the same prosecutor?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,933.364,934.066,Correct.
2006.06-313,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,934.066,944.017,And that there was a significant overlap in the three charges in the three cases.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,961.99,970.579,"I would actually... if you compare the three arguments side by side, the prosecutor's statements were tempered in this case."
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,994.835,1008.862,"Could you tell us... as you know, AEDPA has the decisions of settled precedents of the Supreme Court and there's the Supreme Court standard, a very general standard that we can get from Darden and Donnelly, although we didn't reverse there."
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1030.508,1031.615,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1031.615,1033.086,I assume that's what they're going to tell us.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1033.086,1034.646,"No, Your Honor, I would not agree."
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1034.646,1035.286,Why.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1035.286,1045.763,"Clearly, it's not established law by this Court, and this Court has not specifically outlined the kind of post and beam that would result in a reversal in a penalty phase Closing argument."
2006.06-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.763,1046.719,"It says that in the text, doesn't it,"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1049.812,1051.216,"Correct, yes."
2006.06-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1051.216,1064.805,"So those things that are improper for a prosecutor to make in summing up in the guilt phase, are they then proper to say, exactly those things, in a sentencing phase with capital... with... you know, capital sentencing?"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1064.805,1067.881,"Is it the same, the same arguments in the--"
2006.06-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1067.881,1069.613,There are a number of cases--
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1097.915,1099.822,--I think it is fair to say that.
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.35,1114.142,May I ask you this question about your position: We are trying to find cases that clearly establish law by decisions of this Court.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1133.573,1136.151,No.
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.15,1141.632,Even though those cases say in so many words it deprives you of a fair trial.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1141.632,1142.49,No.
2006.06-313,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1151.284,1158.783,"If those direct Federal cases were interpreting the constitutional provisions directly, they would count as established law?"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1158.783,1160.234,"Certainly, yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.13,1295.723,May I go back to my question?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1312.586,1318.743,"There was a habeas petition filed prior to AEDPA, but it was dismissed and he did not appeal from that."
2006.06-313,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1321.257,1326.191,"That was a slip on the District Court's part, wasn't it?"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1344.589,1347.79,"However, Your Honor, he did not appeal from that."
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1347.79,1349.526,"Well, didn't he seek a COA?"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1349.526,1351.588,"Yes, he did."
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1352.79,1355.226,This is a pro se prisoner.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1362.004,1369.408,"--However, the parties have... the respondent has not asserted that argument, that AEDPA does not apply in this case."
2006.06-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1371.893,1374.782,Certainly didn't say it in the brief in opposition.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1379.465,1381.95,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.459,1396.756,May I ask this question before you sit down?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1418.699,1420.262,"--Not directly, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.262,1422.934,"Well, it is either directly... it's either yes or no."
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1422.934,1425.183,I think certainly this Court can use--
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.183,1429.508,That rule can be ignored by State prosecutors?
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1429.508,1433.147,"--Certainly not ignored, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.85,1442.77,"You have a much more limited point, as I understand it."
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.204,1450.53,"Well, it is--"
2006.06-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.53,1454.547,In this area of constitutional violation.
2006.06-313,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1454.547,1459.776,"--Well, the question, I suppose, is whether that is a constitutional rule."
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1471.522,1474.302,Not necessarily not applicable to State prosecutors.
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1483.252,1487.111,Why would it be applicable to State prosecutors if it is not a rule.
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1495.826,1501.59,"--Certainly, it is something that State prosecutors should follow in the sense of what they should say and what they should not say."
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1501.59,1504.48,"But they must follow because it's the law, right?"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1504.48,1510.664,Under the... it is not the law in the sense of fundamental fairness.
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1513.336,1516.147,"Well, where did Chief Justice Stone get it from?"
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1516.147,1517.286,--I'm sorry?
2006.06-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1517.286,1519.283,Where did Chief Justice Stone get it from?
2006.06-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1526.782,1527.468,You can't have it both--
2006.06-313,0,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,1540.647,1545.943,"Well, I would argue that in those cases, it is a supervisory power case."
2006.06-313,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.502,1554.596,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1563.404,1568.232,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: As the former prosecutor's brief makes--"
2006.06-313,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1588.986,1592.956,"Well, I think they overstated the significance of Viereck."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1647.856,1657.039,"I think the historical context is different, but this was set up in this case by informing the jurors that we were involved in a war, in a war on drugs in society."
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1683.388,1687.401,"That was objected to and the objection was sustained, correct?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1687.401,1690.196,"It was objected to, and the objection was sustained."
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.569,1693.243,And a curative instruction given.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1693.243,1694.226,--I agree with that.
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1716.952,1717.95,"Which in that case,--"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1728.413,1734.13,"--The decision that was violated was the rule of Darden, Donnelly, and Romano, which is that--"
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1734.13,1737.222,"Well, pick which one do you think is the most directly applicable."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1737.222,1738.519,"--Well, I think Darden established the rule."
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1746.545,1747.08,It's not Romano.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1751.139,1764.386,"--Yes, but logically, if you have established a rule for closing arguments, you established it, you then say it is applicable to the penalty phase for the admission of evidence, it would be completely illogical to say it didn't govern penalty phase closing arguments."
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1764.386,1785.202,"My point is simply the level of generality at which the guiding principles were articulated, which helps when you're applying it, but in determining... it is the point Judge Bowman in dissent that when you don't have a case that's close, that you have more leeway in terms of the deference to the Court, because it's not a clearly established precedent of the Supreme Court."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1794.482,1797.793,"That is what this Court's decisions say, Chief Justice Roberts."
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1838.34,1840.305,"What do you mean, how do you it failed to consider?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1844.385,1846.054,Well--
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.054,1850.004,Did they refuse to accept argument on those points?
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1850.004,1852.239,--No.
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.936,1869.653,"If they did consider it, you mean they did not respond to that argument in their opinion."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1869.653,1871.014,--They did not refer to it in their opinion.
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.014,1874.621,You don't know for sure that they didn't consider it.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1881.414,1885.146,He also raised the point about this is bigger than William Weaver.
2006.06-313,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1893.269,1894.833,"Well, why is that improper?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1907.577,1912.088,--I don't think this can properly be considered a deterrence argument.
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1928.24,1939.221,"Well, could a prosecutor say, one of the factors you must take into account when you begin to deliberate is the deterrent purpose of the death penalty?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1943.546,1944.622,--Uh-huh.
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1944.622,1945.187,To teach us.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1945.905,1947.059,I think he could say that.
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1947.059,1951.949,So then now we have the principle that you can talk about deterrence.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,1953.711,1957.51,"No, my point is I don't believe this is really a deterrence argument."
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.096,1974.547,"--As I recall, he didn't just say it is bigger than Weaver."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2002.958,2012.219,I think the import of this argument is you should give the person the death penalty even if you're not sure he deserves it in order to further the deterrent function of the death penalty.
2006.06-313,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2012.219,2032.914,"No, but you're... you're saying look, he can make a general statement that we have a death penalty in part for its deterrent function, but he cannot make the argument that you ought to apply the death penalty in this case solely for deterrent reasons, i.e., reasons unanchored in the culpability of this particular defendant."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2032.914,2033.616,That's correct.
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.221,2036.549,Where?
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2060.226,2067.148,--I think that us the logical inference from the six or seven times he says... in variety of... he says this is bigger than William Weaver.
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.764,2093.435,"If you let a person who is as guilty as William Weaver go, you're affecting not just William Weaver, you're affecting the whole war on drugs, you're affecting the... what's wrong with that?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2117.659,2120.923,"--Of course, he does actually say kill him now at another point in there."
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2131.635,2134.853,"What do you think, go on and on... suppose he'd mentioned deterrence six times?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2134.853,2144.32,"--I think as long as it is a blanket sort of statement, that one purpose of the death penalty is deterrence, that would probably be consistent with this Court's decisions."
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2144.32,2144.835,Right.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2144.835,2153.16,"That's not what is happening here, Justice Kennedy, especially when it is tied in to that, to send a message and then he also goes on to talk about the consequences."
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2197.502,2201.467,So Judge... Judge Bowman would be an unreasonable prosecutor?
2006.06-313,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2206.622,2216.914,I thought Judge Bowman said were it not for AEDPA this case might come out... in his view this case might have come out differently.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2216.914,2218.369,--Judge Bowman--
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2218.369,2221.145,The standard is unreasonable in light of clearly established law.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2221.145,2222.146,--Judge Bowman did say that.
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2237.935,2249.603,"Well no, he specifically recognized there was nothing on all fours and that there these other generally applicable decisions and he thought the state courts had broad... a broader range when there was no decision on all fours."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2249.603,2253.491,"--Well, if I'm... I'm sorry--"
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2253.491,2256.775,I'm reading at the bottom of page 820 in the petition appendix.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2256.775,2258.397,"--Well, if I'm wrong about that, I'm wrong."
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2302.347,2305.252,You have this only in a footnote in your reply brief.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2306.629,2308.501,--It was not raised in the BIO.
2006.06-313,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2315.201,2327.418,"Can I ask you, where... one of the passages that I thought went a little far where is he says to the jury, the one thing you've have got to into your head; this is far more important than William Weaver."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2375.523,2379.114,Okay.
2006.06-313,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2446.103,2446.758,You were talking--
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.758,2455.428,"Even... even the Supreme Court cases going to the other points, they didn't... did any of them involve a separate penalty phase?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2463.249,2463.893,Well--
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.893,2471.996,"So that, so that when the prosecutor was urging particular action, he was urging the jury to find a person guilty."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2526.055,2544.111,"--Well, I think that, I don't see any reason why a principle which this Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that a prosecutor is not supposed to leverage his opinion and the prestige of his office behind a particular outcome, would apply any less at the penalty phase of a capital trial than at the guilt phase of a capital trial."
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.111,2544.688,That's different.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2624.515,2627.528,"Well, I disagree with that, and to this extent."
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2660.483,2661.86,To... to send a message?
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2661.86,2663.295,To send a message.
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2667.745,2674.244,"What the defense lawyer said to the jury in his closing was if you vote for life, you are sending a message."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2677.461,2678.319,Yes.
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2678.319,2683.864,"How was that message... a different message, I guess, but he can say send a message, but the prosecutor can't?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2683.864,2684.332,No.
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2700.153,2703.452,"So if the prosecution had not opened the door, that would have been improper?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2708.651,2711.804,I think that would have been completely within the trial court's discretion.
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2711.804,2728.86,"You... you think the trial court could tell the defense counsel that the defense counsel cannot argue to the jury, ladies and gentlemen there is nothing more precious than life and that's what we're asking you to decide here and we want you to assert the values of this community that we value life?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2729.988,2730.596,Maybe.
2006.06-313,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2738.984,2754.07,"--Suppose that you said explicitly, the prosecutor... which he didn't say... but you're arguing basically, it is a fair, sort of an implication, suppose he said there are a lot of drug dealers around, and he's one of them."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2789.181,2789.946,Of course.
2006.06-313,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2789.946,2790.71,Yes.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2795.335,2803.5,I think it would... there you would easily just look to this Court's Eighth Amendment decisions which say--
2006.06-313,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2803.5,2806.577,You don't find any one where anybody ever had an argument like that.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2806.577,2807.579,--Right.
2006.06-313,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2810.765,2811.155,Ah.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2823.508,2829.631,"--Well, I think, you know, at some point, right, you can say well, you don't have a case on point because no one has said anything so outrageous."
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.345,2842.733,"The question has been switched here, Counsel."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2885.576,2887.37,"--Well, let me tackle that head-on."
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2965.042,2967.728,Your recital was not a complete picture of the case.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2973.211,2974.412,I believe there were six.
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2974.412,2975.258,Six.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,2984.3,2985.501,I agree.
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.963,3008.837,"Well, serve him right?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3010.65,3012.319,--I'm not suggesting it serves him right.
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3029.734,3034.468,What do you... what should a prosecutor's closing... penalty phase argument look like?
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3037.825,3040.727,I think in general they stick to the evidence.
2006.06-313,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3065.36,3068.842,Do you think moral culpability is the only factor that can be mentioned?
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3072.73,3080.088,"I don't think it's the only factor, but I was responding to the question of what should a prosecutor do and in fact what most prosecutors do in most cases."
2006.06-313,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3080.088,3092.8,"Can a prosecutor say that killing a witness is something that needs to be deterred and therefore it's important, it's appropriate to impose the death penalty here in order to send a message of deterrence?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3094.099,3096.657,I think something probably like that would be.
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3114.166,3127.257,"Is part of moral culpability that you take moral instruction from thieves murderers on the street, as opposed to those higher standards for which society seeks to aspire?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3129.098,3130.13,I'm sorry.
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3130.645,3136.768,Is it moral culpability for you to take as an example for your behavior the criminal population?
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3136.768,3142.453,--I still... I'm not trying to be thick.
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3142.453,3144.013,You're talking about moral culpability.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3160.991,3163.834,It might be part of the picture of what this person is like.
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3163.834,3166.006,"Well then, isn't it relevant what's happening on the streets, etcetera?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3166.006,3176.722,I don't think it's proper to say if you don't give this person death then all these other things which are bad for society are going to happen.
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3176.722,3180.921,"Of course, the defense argument was not focused on Weaver either."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3195.868,3200.696,But there's beyond and there's way beyond and there's beyond the pale.
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3211.408,3216.095,"--How do you answer the argument, fight for life, always fight for life?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3225.528,3230.371,"You could answer it that, look at what this person did."
2006.06-313,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3241.208,3245.271,"Mr. Blume, before your time is up, I want to ask you one other question."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3266.496,3269.121,You're talking about on the basis that he filed before the act?
2006.06-313,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3269.121,3270.993,Two days before the act.
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3270.993,3271.807,He filed before the act.
2006.06-313,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3275.913,3278.211,"No, I mean in this proceeding."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3278.211,3281.272,--It was argued in his initial habeas.
2006.06-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.561,3300.435,And was that this habeas?
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3302.761,3303.919,It was the same habeas proceeding.
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3319.366,3324.38,"If the Eighth Circuit had had Lawrence in front it, it would have ruled differently?"
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3328.393,3331.751,"I believe that... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt."
2006.06-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3338.466,3340.763,Under Lawrence the Eighth Circuit would have been wrong?
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3340.763,3342.684,--Yes.
2006.06-313,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3342.684,3348.931,"And if Lawrence had gone the other way, then it also... then it would be right."
2006.06-313,1,29334,john_h_blume,,3354.446,3356.789,Yes.
2006.06-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3368.972,3370.345,"Thank you, Mr. Blume."
2006.06-313,2,16973,andrea_k_spillars,,3373.156,3374.233,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2006.06-313,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3487.774,3488.476,"Thank you, counsel."
