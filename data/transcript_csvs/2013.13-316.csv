2013.13-316,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.07,"We'll hear argument this morning in case 13-316, Loughrin v. United States."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,7.52,11.556,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-316,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,54.901,56.67,"If it's -- if it's the words Congress used,"
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,65.108,73.629,"--Well, the problem is there is an ambiguity in Subsection 2 about to whom the false representation must be directed."
2013.13-316,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,102.649,112.173,"Well, but the breadth is confined -- given the development of the banking system, it may not seem as significant a limitation today as in years past."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,133.087,134.887,That's true.
2013.13-316,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,141.693,144.894,"How about in this case, and that's where I'm having difficulty."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,164.639,170.126,"--So that's a question about, I think, whether intent to defraud a bank could be satisfied in a case like this."
2013.13-316,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,196.31,197.779,How would that -- how would that work?
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,211.52,214.222,So that gets the -- we have two theories.
2013.13-316,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,222.928,224.696,Why would it not matter?
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,224.696,228.981,"--Because under the government -- it doesn't matter under the government's view or ours, so--"
2013.13-316,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,228.981,229.664,"No, under your view."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,239.956,248.128,"--Under our view, all the government has to show is that the defendant intended to deceive a bank in order to obtain property that is owned by or in the custody of a bank."
2013.13-316,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.53,262.303,"I think on anybody's theory, you -- you have to show that -- that the monies, funds, credits, assets, securities or other property was owned by or under the custody or control of the financial institution."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,262.303,262.805,--That's right.
2013.13-316,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,262.805,263.822,Doesn't either side have to prove that?
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,263.822,264.522,That's correct.
2013.13-316,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.956,272.174,But -- but the jury has to be instructed that the money's coming out of the bank.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,272.174,273.391,That's correct.
2013.13-316,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,284.232,289.72,Two of the -- two of the six checks involved were paid by the drawing bank.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,290.553,291.336,That is correct.
2013.13-316,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,311.816,325.826,"I think you have a -- you have a credible textual argument, but you run into the problem that your interpretation makes Section -- Subsection 1 surplusage."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,328.345,340.236,"I don't know that we do, but the Tenth Circuit's interpretation doesn't either, because under the Tenth Circuit's interpretation, one is rendered surplusage because any prosecution that could be brought under (1) could also be brought under (2)."
2013.13-316,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,345.64,353.659,"Well, under the alternative, there is certainly overlap, but (2) reaches a much broader category or it reaches a broader category."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,354.845,356.078,"No, that's true."
2013.13-316,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,356.745,359.38,Representation doesn't have to be made to the bank under (2).
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,378.944,381.229,"--Well, I have two things to say to that."
2013.13-316,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,399.457,400.774,It doesn't have the two subparts.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,410.998,415.984,"Well, that's the same way that this Court has repeatedly read the two parallel clauses of the bank fraud statute."
2013.13-316,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,422.473,433.278,What this Court did after the -- after -- or before this statute -- this statute was passed before the Court's interpretation of the mail fraud statute.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,433.278,434.111,--That's right.
2013.13-316,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,434.111,441.801,Every court that had looked at it at the time the statute was passed had determined there were two separate provisions.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,450.89,460.931,"I think what Congress would have intended is simply that when it uses the identical -- materially identical language and structure in two statutes, that they would have the same meaning as determined by this Court."
2013.13-316,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,484.044,494.236,"But it's not identical because in the bank court statute, Congress broke out and separately numbered (1) and (2) and they didn't do that in the mail fraud."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,494.236,496.621,"Now, I understand that."
2013.13-316,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,523.255,531.275,"One understanding of what led to this statute is this Court's decision in Maze, which actually seems on all fours with this case, right?"
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,553.707,556.592,"Well, I guess I have to just dispute the premise."
2013.13-316,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,678.038,680.407,Why -- why is that?
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,683.275,685.059,"Well, because I think Congress--"
2013.13-316,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.059,689.513,I agree with you that the disparity in -- in punishment is quite substantial.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,689.513,690.313,--Yeah.
2013.13-316,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,726.119,742.731,It does -- it does seem to me that this case can be distinguished from the example you gave in your yellow brief of the person that sells a magazine subscription and he gets the check and he never intends to deliver the magazines.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,748.218,749.135,--Yes.
2013.13-316,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,749.135,749.668,And must.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,750.452,751.454,That's correct.
2013.13-316,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,752.037,754.022,And that's quite different than this case.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,754.022,761.692,--So the question is how to get rid of those cases while preserving the government's ability to prosecute.
2013.13-316,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,761.692,765.663,"Well, you can do so, I suppose, through the government's proposed fallback position."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,765.663,766.113,Yes.
2013.13-316,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,766.113,768.865,--at page 40 of its brief which talks about a risk of loss.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,768.865,776.469,So there are -- there are several things wrong with the government's fallback position and it leads in most cases to the same result as intent to defraud.
2013.13-316,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,836.776,838.392,"Well, could I ask you this question?"
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,884.173,884.706,That's right.
2013.13-316,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.443,917.812,"Well, why doesn't that principle cover most of the cases you're worried about?"
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,917.812,931.821,"Well, it doesn't cover the cases like Rodriguez, because the government can argue there that -- so, I don't know if I've finished the description of Rodriguez, but in that case, a bookkeeper submitted false invoices to her employer."
2013.13-316,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.99,963.275,Why -- why wouldn't your view have enabled you to win this case?
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,963.275,965.258,--It would -- it should have.
2013.13-316,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.231,977.366,"So if we think that was wrong, there's a lot less to this case than meets the eye."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,977.366,979.985,--There is -- that could be the end of this case.
2013.13-316,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1023.329,1024.681,What's the theory behind that?
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1031.518,1036.489,"--Well, I think the theory is that the use of an altered check shows intent to deceive the bank."
2013.13-316,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1047.794,1052.598,"Usually there won't be evidence, direct evidence of the defendant's intent."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1102.964,1106.249,"Well, I think that there is and maybe I'm not explaining it very well."
2013.13-316,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.583,1140.57,Doesn't -- doesn't that U.C.C. question arise anyway under the requirement that you have to -- you have to obtain bank property?
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1140.57,1143.622,--It -- it potentially does if you're willing to--
2013.13-316,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.622,1148.509,Doesn't it require you to ultimately decide who's -- who's going to be stuck with the -- with the empty bag?
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1148.509,1161.251,--It -- it potentially could if you're willing to say that somebody who obtains property from Target potentially is obtaining bank property because of reasons relating to the U.C.C. We don't think you even need to go that far.
2013.13-316,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.256,1172.939,I understand that.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1174.791,1175.558,Yes.
2013.13-316,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.558,1181.478,"--of how these third-party cases ought to -- ought to be resolved, you have to get into the U.C.C., don't you."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1181.478,1183.68,I don't know.
2013.13-316,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1217.42,1226.526,"How does it work -- how does it work if you have Mr. Crook, Mr. Crook has a bank account at Bank of America, he has $32 in it."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1250.974,1251.541,--No.
2013.13-316,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1254.676,1255.895,It wouldn't fall within the statute at all.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1259.764,1262.632,--We don't have this Court's cases.
2013.13-316,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1263.066,1263.582,"No, no."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1281.611,1285.413,--So the government has brought those kinds of not-sufficient-funds cases.
2013.13-316,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1309.961,1310.711,It wouldn't matter.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1326.304,1326.906,But--
2013.13-316,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1326.906,1328.906,"So therefore, you have the requisite intent."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1345.201,1348.669,"--Well, if -- if I can quibble with that last piece of the sentence."
2013.13-316,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1354.657,1355.14,All right.
2013.13-316,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1355.807,1357.092,That's certainly been my experience.
2013.13-316,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1358.959,1362.413,--Try two -- two different paths here.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1373.335,1374.237,--Sure.
2013.13-316,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1374.237,1379.789,Mr. Crook believes that the bank will honor his check when Mr. Smith presents it.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1397.334,1403.74,So the state of the law -- and there's only a handful of these not-sufficient-fund cases is that most of the circuits have said they do not fall within the statute.
2013.13-316,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1417.845,1418.731,What is the thinking of those courts?
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1418.731,1419.347,--What's that?
2013.13-316,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1419.347,1420.883,What's the thinking of those courts?
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1422.483,1427.037,So the rationale is that in a case where you submit -- I guess they have two.
2013.13-316,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1436.993,1445.931,"And the courts don't hold this way, but hold, as the court did below, that it's an intent to deceive anyone so long as the scheme is--"
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1445.931,1447.716,--Yeah.
2013.13-316,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.976,1471.649,"You come back to those general statements, you do have the language of the statutes which favors you this question."
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1501.935,1502.601,That's right.
2013.13-316,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1502.601,1507.839,Whether it's money that the bank itself owns or whether it's money of which the bank has custody.
2013.13-316,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1512.643,1524.366,"I think what courts have said is that those kinds of schemes are directed at victimizing the third party, not a bank, and that leaves to the States their traditional authority to prosecute bad check cases, which I don't think should be troublesome."
2013.13-316,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1526.666,1527.152,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1532.387,1535.406,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1582.22,1586.357,"But, Mr. Yang, your interpretation of the statute goes far beyond Maze."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1616.543,1618.995,That is correct.
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1641.259,1643.211,"And it's just a little bit peculiar, right?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1655.268,1676.599,"--Well, we think that the text suggests that what Congress was doing was enacting a broad prophylactic, because what Congress was addressing, remember, were situations where this Court had construed narrowly statutes which addressed situations like this where banks were the inherent second-line victims, and so what Congress wanted to avoid is--"
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1676.599,1677.399,But here the bank is not the victim.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1684.105,1684.571,--That's exactly right.
2013.13-316,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1708.07,1716.926,"But in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, the bank didn't have to refund the money."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1736.905,1741.791,"--We think that that is the interpretation reflected in the text, for the following reason."
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.609,1801.513,"You do indeed, but you extend Federal law enormously into the kind of stuff that we've usually left to the States."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1801.513,1803.448,--I'm not sure that that's actually true.
2013.13-316,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1829.88,1843.423,"If I have it right, I just want to be sure, in my Crook case, which you may or may not remember, you're reading the word ‶ obtained ″ to mean whoever knowingly executes a scheme or artifice to obtain."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1848.477,1849.377,--That's correct because--
2013.13-316,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1849.377,1852.612,And that has been -- and that has been pretty much the universal--
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1852.612,1855.147,--Understanding of obtain.
2013.13-316,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.83,1856.63,"--Okay, okay, okay."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1858.832,1861.634,--That's just the uniform understanding of the dictionary as well as this Court's cases.
2013.13-316,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1861.634,1864.77,"--Fine, fine, fine, then is the way you see the statute."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1864.77,1865.605,That's correct.
2013.13-316,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1865.605,1875.061,"That Mr. Crook goes to Mr. Smith and says, dear Mr. Smith, here is my check for $50,000, knowing he only has $3 in his account."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1905.847,1907.365,Partially correct.
2013.13-316,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1907.365,1908.049,All right.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1908.049,1908.815,I would--
2013.13-316,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1908.815,1926.677,"There's also Justice Scalia's point which is an important matter to me, and that is that there also is the case when Mr. Crook doesn't know how the banking system works at all and he has no idea that the bank will, in fact, give any money or whether it will give any money."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1927.177,1929.113,--I have at least two responses.
2013.13-316,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1930.213,1931.147,It doesn't need a response.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1932.43,1935.449,"--Well, two explanations about that one."
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.449,1936.618,Give an explanation rather than a response.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1936.618,1939.736,I will give an explanation that will be connected to the question.
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1968.254,1980.561,"--So what do you do with the case, the second part of the hypothetical that Justice Breyer didn't repeat where the person knows the bank is not going to pay a cent because there's no money in this account."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1980.561,1982.413,--I think that--
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1982.413,1990.336,And so there is no part of the scheme to obtain funds from the bank because they know that the bank won't pay it.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1990.336,1994.305,"--Well, they may -- they may suspect that the bank may not pay it."
2013.13-316,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2011.515,2013.883,Answer -- what's the answer to Justice Sotomayor's question?
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2013.883,2014.55,"--Well, it depends on--"
2013.13-316,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.55,2023.924,The crook is not too bright and Mr. Crook doesn't even know what a bank is and all he knows is he's can get $500 from this other not-genius Mr. Smith.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2031.828,2051.342,"--I think it would be very hard for the government to prove that your inept bank -- that thief had a scheme to obtain money or property from the bank, but the government might be able to prove it circumstantially because, just as Justice Alito explained, you rarely have insight into the heart of hearts of criminals."
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2053.543,2057.828,"In what case, what Federal statute criminalizes a con game?"
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.828,2059.947,Criminalizes what?
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2060.38,2060.897,A con game.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2079.092,2083.813,I'm not sure exactly what you mean by a con game the there are plenty of Federal statutes that address--
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2083.813,2088.7,"Well, somebody says I'm going to paint your house and takes a check for $100 and doesn't paint the house."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2088.7,2101.94,"--Well, the answer is that Congress has addressed false statements, schemes to defraud, schemes to obtain money or property through all kinds of various statutes, mail fraud, wire fraud, false statements, bank fraud."
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2110.13,2112.982,"--And that would be one of them, if you -- if you accept a check, right?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2122.004,2128.092,--The government would have to prove that the scheme was intended to obtain money or property from the bank.
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2130.36,2131.577,"And what does that mean, Mr. Yang?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2151.807,2154.825,--I think we kind of mean both.
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2193.867,2203.656,"Well, I think this does go back to Justice Alito's question, because the person can say -- the defendant here could have said, I really don't care whether the bank ends up paying Target."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2217.15,2218.066,Right.
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2236.379,2239.331,"No, but -- so you're saying that my person -- forget the other examples."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2254.691,2259.66,"Has -- yes, by the virtue of the scheme."
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.878,2261.294,But wait.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2270.117,2270.667,--Right.
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2270.667,2273.986,He just intends the bank property be given to somebody.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2273.986,2275.771,To be transferred per his direction.
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.771,2276.538,Yes.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2276.538,2278.806,"Yes, that's exactly right."
2013.13-316,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2278.806,2284.377,And -- and you've been slipping back into the hypotheticals where the bank is going to bear the loss.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2300.403,2303.088,"And -- and for good reason, for multiple reasons."
2013.13-316,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2309.492,2314.313,So you have federalized every fraudulent transaction in the economy whenever a check is involved.
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.313,2315.196,Absolutely.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2315.196,2317.098,--Not whenever a check is involved.
2013.13-316,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2324.519,2330.256,"Well, I mean, I can think about it tonight, but I'd like an example of a check where the money doesn't come from a bank."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2330.256,2333.96,"--Well, in the check context, I think there is none."
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2346.267,2348.967,Can I just make sure I -- I understand your -- your answer to my question.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2372.917,2382.623,"By virtue -- yes, we would say that by virtue of the scheme -- remember, he's not just walking in and saying, you know, I'll pay you tomorrow if you give me a hamburger today."
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.914,2396.533,But he's -- he's not obtaining the bank's money.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2411.157,2422.181,"--Well, this -- this Court has long recognized that the word ‶ obtain ″ not only means that you obtain it for yourself, but you can obtain something by directing the transfer of -- of property to someone else."
2013.13-316,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2425.0,2434.925,"Mr. Yang, before you finish, Mr. Russell pointed out -- and I think Justice Sotomayor -- that there is Section 513."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2452.034,2458.188,"--Well, I think the answer is that has not been decided."
2013.13-316,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2502.2,2506.004,And is it -- is it true that there's a 2-year mandatory minimum?
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2506.004,2508.154,Not for bank fraud.
2013.13-316,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.575,2514.291,"Under this statute, is there -- is there a mandatory minimum?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2514.291,2514.61,--No.
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2536.89,2549.014,"Mr. Yang, if we are concerned about federalizing every case involving a check, okay, you -- your brief does give us an alternative."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2549.014,2549.498,Yes.
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2549.498,2553.835,"My problem is, I can't locate that alternative in the language of the statute."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2553.835,2554.385,"Well, I think--"
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2554.385,2556.187,So are you asking us just to make it up?
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2557.97,2561.339,--We're not asking you actually to -- to make that interpretation.
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2572.713,2573.213,"No, no, no."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2576.767,2577.333,--I will.
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2620.21,2622.229,"So far I'm with you, but you haven't answered my question."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2622.229,2635.556,"--But the way it is in that context, the reason that the bank is the victim of the scheme is because the fraudulent method is actually transferred to the bank as an inherent part of the scheme itself."
2013.13-316,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2636.772,2647.53,"I -- I agree that that interpretation substantially narrows the statute because the altered check, the bank is going to be certainly at risk of loss."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2661.371,2662.639,--No.
2013.13-316,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2663.923,2669.293,"I mean, what -- what case do you -- what case do you want me to cite if I adopt your alternate -- your fallback position?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2669.293,2681.518,"--I don't think we are relying on the idea that the -- what the Court is -- would be doing is construing the statute in light of, presumably, some good reason to reject what we think is what the statute normally says."
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2681.518,2682.787,Why don't you try the rule of--
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2682.787,2691.975,We think that the rule of lenity doesn't apply for the reasons that we said on our broader argument.
2013.13-316,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2696.194,2705.216,"Does the rule of lenity provide a precedent for us to adopt the narrowing interpretation, your fallback position?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2705.216,2715.189,"I think just in any context where you might have constitutional doubt, the Court sometimes, you know, construes a statute in a way that it might not otherwise do."
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.678,2778.264,"--If -- if we adopt your fallback position, does (2) do anything that (1) doesn't do?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2787.537,2792.008,"--Both clauses, actually, under our fallback or our main position cover things that the others will not."
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2852.397,2857.616,"Which part of the statute are you interpreting with this limiting principle, the ‶ obtain ″ part?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2857.616,2858.65,‶ By means of ″.
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2858.65,2860.235,‶ By means of ″.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2860.235,2871.876,"By means of the false or fraudulent pretenses in this, understanding these false or fraudulent pretenses to be ones which are directed to the bank as an inherent consequence of the scheme itself."
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2871.876,2881.166,"Mr. Yang, your first order argument, which is, you know, the natural way one would read a statute that says ‶ (1) of (2) ″, is to interpret it as meaning two different things."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2881.166,2881.682,Yes.
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2881.682,2891.438,"But that requires us to read it differently from the way we read the exact same words, without the numbers, but the exact same words in McNally."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2915.387,2916.155,Right.
2013.13-316,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2948.71,2951.412,I take your point that the words on the page look very good for you.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2959.516,2960.434,"--No, no."
2013.13-316,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3081.38,3093.271,"Is the government still taking the position that it took in the district court, that 1344(1) also covers this case?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3093.271,3102.893,"Well, we disagree with the court of appeals precedent which says you need a risk of loss under clause 1."
2013.13-316,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3108.88,3123.707,"Along those lines, if we were to agree that under sub (2) it was necessary to show an intent to defraud the bank, what would the government have to prove in an altered check case?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3123.707,3127.359,"Well, I guess you've--"
2013.13-316,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3127.359,3134.346,Or what would you have had to prove under sub (1) if this case could properly be prosecuted under sub (1)?
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3134.346,3151.724,"--Well, you'd have to show that the scheme was actually intended to obtain, to deceive the bank, as well as obtain its property, as opposed to a -- and that intent difference can be significant in cases."
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3152.893,3155.761,"Well, how can that intent difference be significant?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3172.388,3175.323,--We certainly would probably rely on the same types of evidence.
2013.13-316,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3182.162,3192.884,What I'm getting at is would this require delving into the defendant's knowledge of the legal relationship between the merchant here and the bank?
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3192.884,3205.794,"I think it inevitable is going to come to that, and you're going to throw to juries these questions of, like, you know, despite the fact that the defendant has used a check, did the defendant really know what a check was or did the defendant -- what is a check--"
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3205.794,3209.08,"Well, why isn't that the same under the intent to obtain bank property?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3216.917,3220.287,"--Well, the scheme would be to obtain."
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3228.557,3233.711,"But even on the obtain property lane, it's obtain property from the bank, isn't it?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3233.711,3236.063,--Not obtain property from the bank.
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3238.515,3239.399,"Well, in the custody of the bank?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3239.399,3240.951,--It doesn't have to be in the custody of the bank.
2013.13-316,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3260.096,3263.897,"No, but in a case like this, wouldn't the difficulties of proof be the same?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3287.932,3291.567,I'm not quite -- I don't think that's quite right.
2013.13-316,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3303.874,3312.297,"Doesn't the answer depend on from whom -- for whom the money, either owned or under -- in the custody of the bank has to be obtained?"
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3338.115,3343.6,--May I just -- I would just qualify that by saying that the defendant is obtaining the money.
2013.13-316,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3346.97,3347.253,Right.
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3347.72,3348.353,Excuse me.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3355.657,3360.044,--It has to -- the scheme has to contemplate that.
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3360.044,3360.711,Exactly.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3360.711,3362.663,The scheme has to contemplate that.
2013.13-316,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3362.663,3371.186,"And if it's a scheme that -- that's making alterations that no reasonable person would expect the bank to honor, it seems to me you're out of luck."
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3371.186,3374.554,"Well, I don't -- if I might respond, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.13-316,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3374.554,3375.304,Sure.
2013.13-316,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3375.304,3378.34,The -- I don't think that actually plays out in fact.
2013.13-316,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3403.071,3404.388,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.13-316,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3406.023,3410.408,Thank you.
2013.13-316,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3418.081,3422.216,Mr. Yang said it wasn't -- wasn't -- the scope of 513 wasn't clear.
2013.13-316,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3422.216,3425.601,I don't think that that's correct.
2013.13-316,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3496.097,3505.453,Could you please tell me why -- what your objections are to the ‶ by means of limiting principle ″ the government gives as an alternative?
2013.13-316,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3505.453,3507.321,--So there's -- there's several objections.
2013.13-316,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3551.933,3560.539,"Well, I think it does a lot of work because it -- it takes out of the equation schemes to defraud where the bank is not going to be liable."
2013.13-316,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3560.539,3560.906,Right.
2013.13-316,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3592.244,3608.37,"But I don't understand how, if the falsehood is made to Target, who gives the person the DVD off the shelf, how you prove that that's an intent to defraud the bank as opposed to defraud Target."
2013.13-316,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3608.37,3609.972,"--Well, so there's the--"
2013.13-316,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3609.972,3612.824,So what's the charge you give to the jury to get to that?
2013.13-316,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3616.21,3628.251,"--You say that they have to show that the defendant intended to deceive a bank, and the government can argue -- and the government has successfully argued in many cases that use of an altered check shows that the defendant intended to deceive a bank."
2013.13-316,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3675.481,3680.552,"Your textual hook is that there -- that the representation has to be made to the bank, right?"
2013.13-316,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3682.918,3683.418,That's correct.
2013.13-316,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3683.418,3686.254,"But that's different from an intent to defraud the bank, isn't it?"
2013.13-316,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3686.254,3688.922,"I think -- well, that's the first half."
2013.13-316,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3710.672,3715.206,But where is the textual silence about -- where do you get intent to deceive the bank into this?
2013.13-316,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3715.206,3719.177,"I think that's what -- I get it from this Court's decision, for example, in McNally where it said--"
2013.13-316,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3719.177,3720.21,Where do you get it the from the text?
2013.13-316,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3730.901,3731.318,--Right.
2013.13-316,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3731.318,3735.203,I don't see how you get from there to defrauding the bank.
2013.13-316,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3735.203,3747.861,"So if you read it to mean that you have to direct the false statement to the bank, that is the first half of what McNally said intent to deceive a bank -- or intent to defraud a bank is, you have to intend to deceive a bank."
2013.13-316,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3754.433,3755.699,"Thank you, counsel."
