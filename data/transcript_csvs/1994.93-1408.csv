1994.93-1408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.141,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-1408, New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield v. Travelers Insurance Company, and the consolidated cases."
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,15.426,18.128,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,129.864,142.941,"Ms. Smith, New York's scheme applies to hospitalizations that are covered by ERISA plans as well as those that aren't."
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,142.941,144.358,"Yes, Your Honor, they--"
1994.93-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.358,146.993,It's a law of general applicability.
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,146.993,147.36,--Yes.
1994.93-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.012,153.714,"What percentage of the patients in New York are covered by ERISA plans, would you think?"
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,153.714,155.416,"--Your Honor, there's nothing in the record."
1994.93-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.653,167.89,And what if the effect of New York's law were to sweep in only people covered by ERISA plans?
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,171.091,184.785,"--Your Honor, if somehow New York's law had a disproportionate impact on ERISA plans, in other words somehow ERISA plans were singled out or treated differently from other purchasers of hospital services, then that would be a different case."
1994.93-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.993,199.695,"Now, some ERISA plans are self-insured, I believe."
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,199.695,200.978,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.978,206.265,Do you think this law can be applied to ERISA plans that are self-insured?
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,206.265,207.051,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.051,209.434,"It's a very direct effect, is it not?"
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,209.434,221.893,"Your Honor, the effect on ERISA plans that are self-insured is that it may raise their hospital bills over what they would have been if the law was exactly the same but the payor differentials were taken out."
1994.93-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,223.143,224.928,"Well, it does even more than that."
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,234.034,235.201,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.986,239.003,They can't be?
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,239.003,239.522,--They can't be.
1994.93-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.531,268.505,"Ms. Smith, one way New York could have achieved the purpose it has in mind here is simply to require everyone to purchase health insurance, if at all, from the Blues and from no other... from no commercial insurance company."
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,279.413,294.572,"Your Honor, if the marketplace was such that there were... that would be... if the marketplace was such that there were many other insurers out there, and that New York made a rule that said all small groups must go to Blue Cross, that would relate to ERISA plans."
1994.93-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.374,299.41,"Yes, well, you know what the next question is going to be."
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,309.599,310.099,Your Honor--
1994.93-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.099,311.884,--which is effectively a prohibition.
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,311.884,312.534,--You--
1994.93-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.534,314.153,"Would that be bad, too?"
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,314.153,318.855,--You pay a surcharge if you do go with Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
1994.93-1408,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.211,326.078,"No, but you're jumping ahead of me."
1994.93-1408,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,337.285,339.001,"--No, that would not relate to ERISA plans."
1994.93-1408,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1186.217,1197.025,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1249.391,1251.243,Why is that?
1994.93-1408,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1269.204,1282.214,"--Yes, in the sense that an... so in the sense that an employee benefit purchase... purchases health insurance, there is a transaction between them, but that does not make the State law relate to the ERISA plan--"
1994.93-1408,2,19581,craig_p_murphy,,1769.864,1773.332,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1408,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1862.374,1867.528,"Well, I suppose regulating wage rates has a remote connection."
1994.93-1408,2,19581,craig_p_murphy,,1869.378,1870.562,"I'm sorry, regulating--"
1994.93-1408,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1870.562,1875.931,I suppose a law regulating wage rates which would affect hospital charges would have that kind of a connection.
1994.93-1408,2,19581,craig_p_murphy,,1875.931,1880.001,"--Your Honor, in the end, what this Court has to--"
1994.93-1408,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1880.001,1881.001,"No, but you wouldn't argue in that case--"
1994.93-1408,2,19581,craig_p_murphy,,1881.001,1881.685,--Of course not.
1994.93-1408,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1881.685,1882.203,--that it's preemption.
1994.93-1408,2,19581,craig_p_murphy,,1882.203,1883.17,And let me explain why.
1994.93-1408,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1883.17,1885.405,And how do you... tell us how you want us to draw the line.
1994.93-1408,2,19581,craig_p_murphy,,1885.405,1885.922,Okay.
1994.93-1408,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1910.355,1913.057,How about the taxes imposed on the hospitals--
1994.93-1408,2,19581,craig_p_murphy,,1913.057,1914.306,"--Well, if you're talking--"
1994.93-1408,3,27327,harold_n_iselin,,2916.488,2923.527,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1408,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3014.586,3016.952,And that's different from the other surcharges?
1994.93-1408,3,27327,harold_n_iselin,,3016.952,3020.905,"That is different from both other surcharges, both of which go to the hospitals."
1994.93-1408,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3118.986,3151.124,"Mr. Iselin, maybe I misperceive it, but isn't there a big difference between the first... what we heard from the commercial insurers, the attempt to influence the ERISA plans' choice... here, the effort is not to affect the ERISA plan's choice, but to get the HMO's to do something, to get the HMO's to service a larger number of Medicaid patients, and if the HMO's respond that way, that's it."
1994.93-1408,3,27327,harold_n_iselin,,3157.444,3187.797,"Well, Your Honor, the purpose, the stated purpose of the statutes may be somewhat different, but the effect is identical, because both sets of cases have the State imposing surcharges that are interfering with the decisions ERISA plans want to make as to how best to provide health care, and one of the things, again, that the statute itself talks about, is delivering hospital, medical, or surgical benefits through the purchase of insurance or otherwise."
1994.93-1408,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3208.644,3221.47,"Which... so you're saying, because there's an impact on ERISA plans, New York simply cannot regulate the HMO's to require them to take on more Medicaid patients?"
1994.93-1408,3,27327,harold_n_iselin,,3221.47,3230.409,"They can't regulate them in a way that would... that would relate to, and that would... relate to ERISA plans and interfere with the choice ERISA plans make."
1994.93-1408,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3230.409,3242.3,"Can't require them to take on more Medicaid patients, or impel them to or induce them to, as long as they have... as they're used by ERISA plans."
1994.93-1408,3,27327,harold_n_iselin,,3243.884,3261.012,"That they can't require them, again, in a manner that would interfere with the choices or the quality of care that's provided by the HMO, which could also happen if the State required HMO's to enroll Medicaid recipients in a manner that overburdened the delivery system of the HMO, which can--"
1994.93-1408,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3261.012,3266.165,"Well, to some extent could it directly mandate that HMO's take on a different class of patients?"
1994.93-1408,3,27327,harold_n_iselin,,3266.165,3270.284,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe it could, for the reason--"
1994.93-1408,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3270.284,3271.486,The equivalent of open enrollment--
1994.93-1408,3,27327,harold_n_iselin,,3271.486,3291.817,"--Well, I think they could require open enrollment, but open enrollment is very different from what the State has done here with targets, and I think any system that relies on targets and compels HMO's to take Medicaid recipients in that manner is problematic, because again, HMO's have a limited capacity to deliver care."
1994.93-1408,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3292.35,3306.124,"--The effect of your argument is that the HMO's, by virtue of the relating-to-ERISA-plan language, really escape virtually all the regulation on the subjects that we're talking about, whereas the insurance companies would not."
1994.93-1408,3,27327,harold_n_iselin,,3306.124,3327.656,"--No, Your Honor, because what we have here for HMO's is the Federal HMO Act, and the Federal HMO Act on many of these issues acts as a sort of HMO savings clause because it specifically authorized States to conduct regulation of HMO's in many aspects similar to what we talked about earlier, community rating being one very good example."
1994.93-1408,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3493.881,3494.964,"Thank you, Mr. Iselin."
