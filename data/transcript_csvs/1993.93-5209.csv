1993.93-5209,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.996,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-5209, Darren Custis v. United States."
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,54.385,57.868,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-5209,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.333,165.527,"Ms. French, to what extent do you think our decisions in Federal habeas, where a State defendant is raising a constitutional claim such as the Boykin type claim, the Parke v. Raley case, to what extent are those either informative or controlling in this context?"
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,165.527,169.338,--I think that some of those cases can be informative.
1993.93-5209,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,182.521,200.669,"Do you think this is... we're dealing here with the question of the intent of Congress, or whether, regardless of congressional intent, it simply couldn't authorize these priors to be considered without having satisfied itself in some way that there was no constitutional violation in connection with them?"
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,200.669,206.152,I think our primary argument is that the Constitution requires that these claims be considered.
1993.93-5209,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,218.866,227.05,"Well, if you're going to make any challenge based on statutory construction, really, logically that ought to be your first line."
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,233.375,246.23,"That's true, Your Honor, and our position on the statute is that at the time it was enacted, it was enacted against a backdrop of decisions including this Court's decisions in Burgett v. Texas and United States v. Tucker."
1993.93-5209,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,300.598,305.408,"Do you think that makes much sense, that line of reasoning?"
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,305.408,330.101,"I think it does, Your Honor, because if you look at the opinion of the court of appeals and of the district court in this case, essentially what those courts held is that it simply does not matter if the defendant... if the defendant's prior conviction resulted from a constitutional violation, and therefore they would require that the district court ignore any constitutional violations that took place."
1993.93-5209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,356.45,371.1,"Ms. French, why isn't it reasonable to say, yes you can attack convictions on the grounds that you're asserting, but you must do so where they are rendered, not concern another forum many years later that doesn't have the record."
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,394.09,400.713,"Your Honor, Congress has not actually said that, but the problem with it... there are a number of problems."
1993.93-5209,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,438.698,458.269,"Would you clarify this, because it may be relevant: whether under Maryland law any or all of the claims your client now wishes to make could have been litigated, either on direct review in Maryland, or on some kind of postconviction review?"
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,458.269,478.651,"--The ineffective assistance of counsel claims are not generally reviewable on direct appeal in Maryland, and that's because the record is not normally developed enough for the court of appeals to review that violation, and the same is true as to the claim of an unknowing and involuntary plea."
1993.93-5209,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.145,500.657,Did you challenge both prior convictions on the basis of ineffective assistance?
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,501.017,502.017,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-5209,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,502.017,511.326,"--Now, could he have obtained Federal habeas review of these claims?"
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,511.326,519.071,"Your Honor, I think there are two different kinds of Federal habeas review that you might be referring to."
1993.93-5209,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,519.071,524.006,"Well, he was still on probation, so for purposes of being in custody."
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,524.006,535.689,"He could have pursued a 2254 petition, and he would have to be in custody to bring that petition."
1993.93-5209,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,544.203,548.404,"But if there were no State remedy, then there's no exhaustion problem, right?"
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,548.404,550.59,"--That's true, so that would have been--"
1993.93-5209,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,550.59,551.356,You can't have it both ways.
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,554.12,554.933,--That's right.
1993.93-5209,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,554.933,558.212,So presumably Federal habeas could have been used.
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,558.212,562.023,"As to the 1985 conviction, I think that's true."
1993.93-5209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,573.628,582.702,Why should we choose Burgett-Tucker reasoning rather than Lewis reasoning to construe the congressional silence?
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,582.702,590.168,"Your Honor, Lewis did not deal with a sentencing enhancement statute, and it specifically reaffirmed Burgett and Tucker."
1993.93-5209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,616.548,636.665,"Couldn't we take the position that just as it may be appropriate, or may have been appropriate for Congress to identify kind of a high risk class, as in Lewis, it would also be appropriate for Congress to identify a very high risk class by reference to three convictions and violent offenses?"
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,636.665,642.521,"Congress could have done that, but I don't think they did that in this instance."
1993.93-5209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,642.521,643.13,Why not?
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,643.13,654.798,"Well, once the defendant has been convicted under section 922(g), then he's already been classified, and he's been shown to be guilty of that offense."
1993.93-5209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,657.093,672.275,"No, but Congress could simply say we want a further classification, and in effect he's on notice that if there are three convictions that satisfy the other criteria for the convictions, he's facing this significantly enhanced penalty."
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,673.634,683.911,"--Your Honor, that's true, but the statutory history, the legislative history shows that Congress' purpose in enacting section 924(e) was actually incapacitation."
1993.93-5209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,704.278,725.175,"Why don't we infer that Congress meant you give the prior conviction the same faith and credit it had in the jurisdiction where it was rendered if you want to get it upset there, but unless and until you do, then this is... the conviction of the State of Maryland is in effect the conviction for all of the United States?"
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,725.175,730.783,"Your Honor, there are a few reasons why that... those principles aren't applicable here."
1993.93-5209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,785.043,788.791,"But if there's a constitutional infirmity, it's got to be where it was rendered."
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,805.049,809.094,"Well, Your Honor, I don't know if you could say it's good in Maryland."
1993.93-5209,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,879.363,888.625,"Well, is Burgett limited to the situation where the conviction is void?"
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,897.481,897.762,I don't think so.
1993.93-5209,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,969.497,986.445,"Well, certainly in Federal habeas law, if you look at Johnson v. Zerbst, which is one of the earliest Federal habeas... where the Court says that where there was no appointment of counsel that was an actual lack of jurisdiction in the Court, and I don't think we've ever said that about other constitutional violations."
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,993.722,1009.685,"That's true, but I don't think that... I think that when the term void was used in Burgett v. Texas, actually I believe what it meant was voidable, because the conviction itself would still be in existence, and in fact in that case it was."
1993.93-5209,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1145.349,1162.749,The fact that a court were to determine that the introduction of a coerced confession was not harmless error would not necessarily be on the basis of the fact that the coerced confession made the conviction unreliable.
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,1179.431,1214.542,"I think that could be true in some cases, but certainly in a lot of cases it would also indicate that the resulting conviction cannot be relied upon as an indicator of guilt, and that's because generally coerced confessions are not considered reliable in and of themselves, so I would agree there may be some instances where it would not go to reliability, but I think in most instances it would, and the claim should not be barred as a threshold matter from consideration in Federal sentencing proceedings."
1993.93-5209,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1237.938,1244.763,You're suggesting that a Boykin violation or a denial of effective assistance of counsel are structural defects?
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,1244.763,1246.622,"Your Honor, I'm... yes."
1993.93-5209,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1276.391,1282.296,That's a very substantial extension of what we've had to say about structural defects.
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,1282.296,1287.575,"Well, Your Honor, we're not advocating that that test should apply by itself."
1993.93-5209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.172,1323.7,"Ms. French, that wasn't my understanding of what we meant by structural."
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,1373.15,1375.586,"No, Your Honor, that's not what I intended to say."
1993.93-5209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.794,1404.215,"Well, it... attorney in... it isn't enough to show you had an incompetent attorney."
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,1435.857,1459.519,"Well, that's true, but I think that in addition to showing that the attorney's performance fell below those minimal standards, the defendant also has to show prejudice resulting from that, and if the defendant is able to make out that claim, a meritorious ineffective assistance claim, then he has shown that the result of the proceeding is unreliable."
1993.93-5209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.368,1492.63,Are you using prejudice as synonymous with harm?
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,1506.984,1513.716,"Well, Your Honor, I think if you've met the prejudice prong of Strickland--"
1993.93-5209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.716,1514.373,Then there can't--
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,1514.373,1515.107,--then you have shown harm.
1993.93-5209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.107,1516.481,--Then there can't be harmless error.
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,1516.481,1517.824,I don't believe so.
1993.93-5209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.589,1522.462,So then there's no such thing as harmless error for ineffective assistance of counsel.
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,1522.462,1524.009,That would be our position.
1993.93-5209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1529.741,1556.168,"Do you think it's not a proper interpretation of the statute to say that things that are obvious on the face of it, like no counsel, you can use to attack a prior conviction, but where you would sidetrack the sentencing forum into an entire hearing and investigation, another kind of trial-type episode, that's not what Congress wanted?"
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,1556.168,1564.602,"Your Honor, I don't think there's any suggestion that Congress intended to limit claims based on the factual inquiry required."
1993.93-5209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1576.722,1598.76,"But I thought those were cases where the absence of counsel was something... you had counsel or you didn't have counsel, whether counsel is effective or the knowledge the defendant had may require an investigation, at least a transcript, perhaps calling witnesses, quite different from did you have counsel or didn't you have counsel."
1993.93-5209,0,35813,mary_french,,1598.76,1617.393,"--I think sometimes it would require more of an inquiry, but other times it might be a similar inquiry, because in the case of a Gideon violation there's always the question of whether there was a valid waiver, and that can go into a number of factors about the defendant and the proceeding, and so I don't think they can always be distinguished on that basis."
1993.93-5209,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.5,1624.172,"Very well, Ms. French."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1625.015,1630.451,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1769.691,1773.956,"Mr. Bryson, isn't it probable that most of these cases are going to be challenges to guilty pleas?"
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1773.956,1774.3,Yes.
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1774.3,1779.921,"Because there are so many of them, so the real question is, can you expect the defendant to immediately appeal from a guilty plea?"
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1779.921,1803.444,"Well, Your Honor, a lot of defendants do appeal from guilty pleas, particularly if they don't like the sentence, but the real question is, if something has gone terribly wrong, at least you can expect the defendant either to appeal immediately or to come back with a State habeas or Federal habeas action challenging the guilty plea at some point if he's dissatisfied with the disposition."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1831.916,1832.15,That's right.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1851.644,1852.408,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1870.041,1871.416,Unless it's structural.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1871.416,1872.946,"Unless it's structural, that's right."
1993.93-5209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.946,1873.868,Why structural?
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1873.868,1874.571,Well--
1993.93-5209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.571,1883.411,"Why do you pick that as the test for your exception, rather than unless it goes to the court's jurisdiction, or something of that sort?"
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1883.411,1885.082,"--Well, I think it's essentially the same thing."
1993.93-5209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.872,1948.806,"Well, but what about a nonstructural error which can be clearly shown to have been harmful?"
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1948.806,1950.54,"Well, Your Honor--"
1993.93-5209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.54,1953.711,That's certainly not worthy of reliance.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1953.711,1981.092,"--Well, it may be that there are many things that happen during the course of a trial or in the guilty plea proceeding that would... if you examined the record would give you confidence, or erode confidence in the reliability of the ultimate judgment, but the problem is that you impose at the sentencing proceeding an enormous cost on the system if you say you must search each of these records for something that would indicate lack of reliability."
1993.93-5209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.636,1991.882,"Well, but that's my basic problem with choosing the structural test, because in order to decide whether there's been a structural violation you're going to have to search the record."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1995.788,1999.723,"Your Honor, we are... and in this respect we adopt the Fourth Circuit's view."
1993.93-5209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.934,2021.246,I'm glad to hear that.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2026.135,2026.885,That's correct.
1993.93-5209,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2033.336,2043.363,"Mr. Bryson, are you taking this Court's precedent and trying to make sense of it, and that's how you get to this label, structural, that you put on it?"
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2043.363,2050.594,"--Well, Your Honor, we're taking Burgett and trying to extrapolate from Burgett the principle for which we think it stands."
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2084.063,2117.254,"Couldn't Congress have followed a different assumption, because when Congress legislated, you not only had Burgett, you had Lewis, and why isn't it reasonable to suppose that Congress assumed that under our precedent it would be appropriate to overlook a constitutional defect only for the purpose of defining a class subject to a primary conduct rule, i.e., don't buy a gun, but that otherwise a conviction, a predicate conviction could be attacked just as the way it was attacked in Burgett or was attacked in Tucker."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2117.254,2129.483,"Your Honor, I don't think... I have not been talking and I don't think that the petitioner is relying principally on what Congress did, the Armed Career Criminal Act, here."
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2141.294,2144.573,Then why do you concede a Burgett challenge?
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2144.573,2159.925,"--Well, because we think that the Constitution, by its own force, requires... because of what this Court said in Burgett requires that you consider a challenge to a conviction which was uncounseled."
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2159.925,2161.691,If we do not reach that specific--
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2161.691,2162.3,That is not a statutory question.
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2162.3,2162.659,--I'm sorry?
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2162.659,2165.267,"That is not, in our view, a statutory construction issue."
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2167.502,2179.044,"If this Court in Lewis had not expressly reserved Burgett, then I assume you would be arguing that there was no reason whatever to make an exception."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2179.044,2186.854,"Well, if this Court in Lewis had effectively overruled Burgett, then--"
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2186.854,2202.909,"Or had provided an equally legitimate motive analysis without expressly reserving the Burgett and I guess the Tucker outcomes, you would argue for a Lewis analysis and say that that in fact... a constitutional analysis and say that that was in fact the only one that was consistent with the congressional intent."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2202.909,2204.268,--I expect that we would.
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2215.045,2215.232,Yes.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2216.67,2223.105,"--Well, but I think that it's important, Your Honor, because as we read the state of the law now, Burgett is still good law."
1993.93-5209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.305,2242.784,"--Mr. Bryson, what would you propose, structural in the sense of obvious structural... I wish we'd get another word so we don't confuse it with our harmless error jurisdiction, but whatever you want to call it... obvious structural, hyphenated."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2258.091,2259.34,"Your Honor, what we--"
1993.93-5209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.34,2266.385,"--and it seems to me the constitutional test is whether the trial was fundamentally vitiated, so I can understand jurisdiction."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2279.988,2283.595,"--Well, for these purposes, Your Honor, one very important consideration to bear in mind."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2335.153,2337.824,"Well, but Mr. Bryson, not only may be prejudicial, must be prejudicial--"
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2337.824,2338.042,Yes.
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2338.042,2344.648,"--or there's no such claim, so it really is a contradiction in terms to talk about a harmless error violation of the right to counsel."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2344.648,2345.741,I would agree with that.
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2345.741,2347.397,Now... but let me just ask one other question.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2369.545,2374.294,"Well, Your Honor, it is hard to bring empirical support to the Court."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.713,2380.354,Because in all these cases the burden is on the defendant--
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2380.354,2380.838,--That's right.
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.838,2384.898,--to make out a strong case that would persuade the sentencing judge.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2384.898,2386.663,"That's right, the burden is on the defendant."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2438.845,2441.313,"Well, but they're also quite difficult to put forward."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2441.313,2443.968,"--Well, it isn't that hard to, Your Honor, because consider this case."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.207,2468.207,"Well, but here the transcript supports it, too."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2468.207,2468.77,"--Well, your--"
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.77,2471.394,It doesn't happen every day that the transcript actually recites those facts.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2471.394,2485.06,"--Well, but Your Honor, that I think is a perfect demonstration of why it is that this is a potential... a real potential sinkhole for district courts to get into."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2489.45,2490.246,Sure.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2490.246,2514.032,"--Because what went on here is, the defendant was asked by the judge, has your lawyer told you... and I can't remember the exact words, but something like, about the defense you have in this case, which sounds like the judge is asking, have you been informed that you have a way out here, and not surprisingly the defendant said no, and then the judge pursues that a little bit--"
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2514.032,2520.155,"--and then he talks to his lawyer again, and comes back and says he's satisfied, so I think on this transcript you might well win."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2520.155,2525.373,"--That's right, and something else happens which I think is very important here, and again it pertains to how much work it is."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.373,2526.872,"But the thing that troubles me is, they shouldn't even read these transcripts."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2526.872,2528.028,"That's right, Your Honor, because--"
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2528.028,2528.699,When... when--
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2528.699,2531.573,--time and time again the pattern's going to be the pattern that we find here.
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2531.573,2538.227,"--They should read presentence reports, they should read all sorts of material at the sentencing proceedings, but not spend 15 minutes reading the transcript of the prior guilty plea proceeding."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2538.227,2540.008,"Well, Your Honor, I... it is--"
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.008,2541.445,That doesn't strike me as an enormous burden.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2542.679,2549.409,"--Your Honor, one of the problems is that in many, many of these cases there will not be a transcript of the prior proceeding."
1993.93-5209,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2610.275,2621.974,"--In this particular case, in the places where the convictions were originally entered, it was too late to seek any further remedy."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2645.715,2646.449,"Your Honor, it's not clear."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.446,2693.383,I take it you wouldn't want us to decide the case on that ground.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2693.383,2693.633,No.
1993.93-5209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2694.413,2697.256,It's okay so long as the... it was still open.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2697.256,2698.162,That's right.
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.59,2723.714,"Well, you would agree, would you not, that ineffective assistance of counsel is closely allied to the deprivation of counsel."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2725.276,2728.134,"--It comes from the same basic source, of course."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2728.134,2731.82,"And it requires the same showing, that you were prejudiced by not having a lawyer."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2731.82,2734.757,"I don't think it requires the same showing, Your Honor."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.553,2737.787,Yes.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2737.787,2741.067,The denial of counsel doesn't require any showing of prejudice.
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2742.004,2743.566,You presume prejudice in that situation.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2743.566,2744.16,"--Well, conclusively."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.16,2747.345,But you have the additional burden in the other case that you must show the actual prejudice.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2747.345,2750.921,"Yes, and that is a huge difference, because what it means in practice--"
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2750.921,2751.983,"If you show it, is there any difference?"
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2751.983,2752.5,"--Yes, I think so."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2752.5,2752.78,Oh.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2752.78,2753.841,And the difference is this--
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2753.841,2756.247,Haven't we taken the position in Strickland that there wasn't?
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2758.387,2784.346,"--Your Honor, what you said in Strickland is that the ineffective assistance of counsel, if you are effectively denied effective assistance of counsel, that constitutes a violation of your right to counsel, there's no question about that, but it is very different, and in a practical sense I think it's important to focus on the difference, between saying you had no lawyer and saying that while you had a lawyer, your lawyer made several critical mistakes in the course of a trial."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2786.986,2789.313,Several critical mistakes that caused you significant prejudice.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2789.313,2789.828,--Exactly.
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2792.842,2809.773,"If I had had no lawyer, assuming the court was aware of my right to one and I hadn't waived, I would have a right to competent counsel, so in a funny kind of way you could argue I would have been better off to be standing there alone than to be standing there with incompetent counsel on your view of what I can attack later."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2809.773,2845.821,"Well, Your Honor, you... in a sense you would be better off in that you would have a claim that would be cognizable which you wouldn't have had otherwise, but there's... to return to the question of whether there is anything to the distinction between ineffective assistance and complete denial of counsel, and this case again is a perfect demonstration of the great difference, this 1985 proceeding, which is the one in which the ineffectiveness claim is being raised, was... frankly it was a very well run guilty plea proceeding."
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2907.624,2912.543,"But what it all boils down to, isn't it, is what Justice Stevens said a little while ago, the Government's probably going to win this one."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2912.543,2913.418,--That--
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2913.418,2917.339,It's not a case that illustrates that a denial of counsel in fact is not quite so bad.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2917.339,2926.242,"--Well, Your Honor, what it does illustrate, again, I think is how difficult it is to determine whether in fact there was in a case like this an ineffective counsel."
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2926.242,2928.054,"Oh, it may be difficult or it may not."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2938.799,2953.683,"Well, I think the reason comes down to, if you want to put it this way, it comes down to the fact that we've got a due process question here and we're distinguishing between two classes of violations based on the... if you want to call it administrative convenience."
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2959.696,2965.522,"But your answer... and I think, you know, it may be the right answer, but your answer is basically a confession and avoidance answer."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2972.957,2973.926,"Well, I think it's--"
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2973.926,2975.3,"--and that's what we'd have to say, isn't it?"
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2975.3,2979.907,--I think the principled basis is found in the practical distinction.
1993.93-5209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2983.592,2985.779,"You're a good common law lawyer, Mr. Bryson."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2999.337,3001.555,"Well, Your Honor, it's complicated."
1993.93-5209,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3002.477,3003.819,The sentencing enhancement.
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3003.819,3008.333,--There are several circuits... there are several different balls in the air here.
1993.93-5209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3075.104,3091.206,"On this question of the distinction between denial of counsel altogether and their getting an incompetent counsel, do you agree with the Fourth Circuit that so long as the lawyer is present and is physically breathing that's about all you need?"
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3091.206,3095.658,"Well, Your Honor, I think that's... the short answer is yes, I think that's right."
1993.93-5209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3107.434,3113.978,"If we were writing the opinion, would you suggest that we acknowledge the possibility of gross incompetence?"
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3113.978,3117.585,"No, Your Honor, I don't think it's a question of how incompetent."
1993.93-5209,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3153.383,3164.785,"Mr. Bryson, supposing the district court in this case took all these convictions into consideration, as the court of appeals said it could, and the defendant is then sent to prison for a number of years."
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3171.361,3198.069,"Your Honor, our reading of Malang is that he could not, that those convictions he would not be in custody on those prior convictions, although there's language at the end of Malang that leaves open the question of just how you can challenge conviction A when you have been... when that has been used to enhance your sentence for conviction B."
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3220.42,3221.497,Did he succeed on any of his challenges?
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3221.497,3230.697,"--He actually got a long opinion out of the court of appeals in which there was a split opinion as to whether he should have been granted relief or not, but the--"
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3230.697,3231.4,On 17?
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3231.4,3235.132,"--The point is that the mischief here... well, a number of them were not violent crimes--"
1993.93-5209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.132,3235.773,"He had to win on 15 in order to get under the three, didn't he?"
1993.93-5209,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3235.773,3243.816,"--He managed to knock a number out on the ground that they were not violent crimes, others on other grounds and so forth, but he got down to a small number and attacked those on constitutional grounds."
1993.93-5209,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3304.776,3306.837,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
1993.93-5209,2,35813,mary_french,,3309.056,3323.815,"I'd just like to briefly point out that the court of appeals decisions are cited on pages 13 and 14 of our brief, and there are eight circuits that have uniformly allowed challenges under the ACCA."
1993.93-5209,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3355.083,3370.687,"What about the infirmity of the conviction for purposes of impeachment or, as Mr. Bryson just brought up, talking about probation, these other contexts, where it would be to a defendant's advantage to show that a prior conviction was infirm?"
1993.93-5209,2,35813,mary_french,,3370.687,3377.824,A Federal court's decision not to rely on the prior conviction for a sentencing enhancement would have no impact on those proceedings.
1993.93-5209,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3382.619,3389.039,"But if it's open in the one case, why shouldn't it be open in the other to say, you can't use that conviction to impeach me, it's an invalid conviction?"
1993.93-5209,2,35813,mary_french,,3389.039,3397.738,"Your Honor, I think because that would not be such a direct consequence of the prior conviction as use of it would be in Federal sentencing."
1993.93-5209,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3397.738,3402.752,Wouldn't it depend on whether we decide it on a constitutional ground or a statutory construction ground?
1993.93-5209,2,35813,mary_french,,3402.752,3415.403,"It could depend in part on that, but I also think that the decisions in Burgett and Tucker are limited to enhanced sentencing and do not address other collateral uses of prior convictions."
1993.93-5209,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3415.403,3417.214,Do you think Lewis speaks to that problem?
1993.93-5209,2,35813,mary_french,,3417.214,3423.743,"Your Honor, I don't believe that Lewis does speak to that."
1993.93-5209,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3425.555,3427.929,"Thank you, Ms. French."
