1995.95-5207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.177,"We have another case coming up that we're going to hear right now, and that case is Number 95-5207, Cooper v. Oklahoma."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,10.629,13.941,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.95-5207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,71.237,78.893,"Well, if the evidence was so overwhelming, as you describe it, Mr. Ravitz, one would think that it met even a clear and convincing test."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,78.893,105.42,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that goes exactly to the crux of this argument, that when people look at a clear and convincing test, they take it as such a high burden that despite this type of evidence they can legitimately conclude, using this burden of proof, or this standard of proof, and say, as a matter of law, despite all this evidence, this person is still competent to stand trial."
1995.95-5207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,105.42,107.681,"What do you mean, as a matter of law?"
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,114.125,114.977,Absolutely.
1995.95-5207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.977,126.254,"And so, if you say... you say as a matter of law, the trier of fact is free to disbelieve witnesses, so I don't see where you get as a matter of law coming out of this."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,126.254,131.868,"What we're saying is that the competency standard, the clear and convincing standard is a standard of law."
1995.95-5207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,166.69,171.124,"Well, to say... the supreme court of Oklahoma didn't use the word unmistakable, did it?"
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,171.124,173.355,The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals--
1995.95-5207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,173.355,176.798,Is that the one that decided... did it use the word unmistakable?
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,176.798,180.569,--They said there was no evidence from the record that unmistakable was used.
1995.95-5207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.178,210.768,"Well, the clear and convincing evidence standard is intermediate as I've understood it and as I think our opinions... between the preponderance of the evidence standard which obtains in most civil cases, and beyond a reasonable doubt, which is what you have to find guilt by."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,223.668,233.362,I think we have to look at the fundamental liberty interest involved in an incompetent individual being placed on trial.
1995.95-5207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,251.905,253.778,"We can hear you pretty well, Mr.--"
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,253.778,254.327,I'm sorry.
1995.95-5207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.196,303.711,--Do you rely on historical practice in this case?
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,314.867,323.923,"--Justice O'Connor, historically at common law there was no question that this was... there was a preponderance standard."
1995.95-5207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.328,333.758,"How recently did they adopt that, would you remind me?"
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,333.758,335.34,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-5207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.788,351.151,Why did Addington cause them to adopt it?
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,351.151,363.398,"Well, I think that the court, or the Oklahoma legislators and the legislators of Connecticut misunderstood what this Court said in Addington."
1995.95-5207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.23,386.465,"Well, it's certainly convenient to combine the two, so that if the person can't be tried he can be put away."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,388.585,389.546,"Well, there--"
1995.95-5207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.546,392.836,"If there is a clear and convincing indication, two things happen."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,402.043,413.132,"--There's no problem... we don't dispute the State's right to, at a competency determination, have the fact-finder make a determination of whether the individual is clear and convincingly dangerous."
1995.95-5207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,434.554,453.858,But I guess the reason States are now experimenting with requiring a higher standard of proof of competency is because of Addington's requirement that to civilly commit someone the proof must be by clear and convincing evidence of dangerousness to self or others and of mental illness.
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,453.858,464.435,"The standards involved with regard to commitment, Justice O'Connor, are totally different than the standards involved in the competency determination."
1995.95-5207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.212,496.755,"But that is what's driving the States to adopt a different standard on competency, I suppose, the hope that they won't have someone found to be incompetent in a criminal case and then... for mental disability, and yet not be able to commit them for civil treatment."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,496.755,505.301,"--I'm not saying it's not what may have caused the State to do that, but you're... as what I said in my reply brief, you're comparing apples to oranges."
1995.95-5207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.332,523.994,But isn't--
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,545.758,560.749,"That is correct, but again, that doesn't go into effect until the trial court has determined that after a period of time the individual who is being treated can no longer be continually treated."
1995.95-5207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,560.749,570.964,"But in either case there is a presumption of competency that most jurisdictions, if not all jurisdictions, recognize, I take it."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,570.964,572.637,"That is correct, Justice--"
1995.95-5207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,572.637,597.782,"And Addington said that presumption of competency is sufficiently valid that we're going to require clear and convincing evidence to overcome it, and it seems to me that's all that Oklahoma is saying here, is that we are giving... we are giving substance, we are giving recognition, we are giving force to the presumption of competency."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,612.532,626.662,"--Well, I think the presumption of competency and the State interest is adequately protected where... in what Medina did, where the defense must come forward with all evidence."
1995.95-5207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,674.892,685.691,The Court of Criminal Appeals mentioned what it thought was a propensity of some defendants to malinger in this area as a justification for the clear and convincing standard.
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,686.981,700.539,"First of all, if the court concludes, Mr. Chief Justice, that as a matter of fact the individual is malingering, the court's going to conclude that the defendant hasn't met his burden of proof under a preponderance."
1995.95-5207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,700.539,730.268,"Yes, but it's quite possible that a... the trial judge may feel, I can't say for sure that this person is malingering, but if I had to do it by a preponderance standard, I would have to say he's incompetent, but clear and convincing, I can say I think he's competent, and can't a State court adopt a rule of burden of proof to adjust for that sort of thing, the possibility of malingering, even though it's not... you can't show it in a particular case?"
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,730.268,737.544,Raising the standard of proof does not facilitate a more accurate finding of malingering.
1995.95-5207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,819.157,822.559,"Well, you're basing your argument on the Due Process Clause?"
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,822.559,825.642,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1995.95-5207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,825.642,829.244,Are you not pressing any Eighth Amendment claim here?
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,829.244,830.423,I think--
1995.95-5207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,830.423,833.367,"There's some language in your brief, but I thought it ought to be clear."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,836.379,839.161,--I think this Court has recognized that--
1995.95-5207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,839.161,840.231,Yes or no?
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,840.231,853.68,"--Yes, we are following the Due Process Clause, but this Court has applied heightened levels of due process in situations where the death penalty was involved."
1995.95-5207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,868.951,873.252,So you're not making a general argument applicable to all criminal defendants.
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,878.024,887.621,"No, my argument is addressed to every... is addressed to all cases, but if this Court chose to divide the two situations they would have ample opportunities to do this."
1995.95-5207,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,901.173,905.944,What about the standard in the State for not guilty by reason of insanity?
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,915.08,922.654,"I may be wrong, Justice Ginsburg, but I believe it's a preponderance standard."
1995.95-5207,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,922.654,924.136,Just a preponderance.
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,924.136,925.095,Yes.
1995.95-5207,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,925.095,928.819,So could the State have a higher standard?
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,935.563,939.277,"Oh, yes."
1995.95-5207,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,941.438,942.8,Even beyond a reasonable doubt?
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,942.8,948.87,--This Court in Leland recognized... proved the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.
1995.95-5207,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,952.553,963.861,"Then how do you... that also involves the same kind of fundamental right, doesn't it, not to be convicted of a crime when one is not able to form the mental state necessary?"
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,963.861,970.436,This Court has never recognized that insanity defense was a fundamental right.
1995.95-5207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.471,1030.367,"If you're going to talk about, you know, realities, you know, I think the history is with you."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1064.627,1082.428,"--As early as 1790, Justice Scalia, in Ley's Case, which is cited in our brief, the judge remanded the individual to a surgeon to have the surgeon look at him, so we've had people looking at competency for over 200 years on that particular theme."
1995.95-5207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1085.781,1087.083,A surgeon is not a psychiatrist.
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1087.083,1091.184,"--That's correct, but probably in 1790 that was probably the best we could do."
1995.95-5207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1091.184,1091.685,"Yes, right."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1091.685,1094.386,"But I think when we look at that, let's look at the experts."
1995.95-5207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.771,1129.549,"Well, it's more than coming forward."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1129.549,1130.21,"--with doctors, with--"
1995.95-5207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.21,1130.911,It's more than coming forward.
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1135.544,1137.654,--I have to convince that fact-finder.
1995.95-5207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1146.122,1149.054,You know this area of the law better than I do.
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1169.576,1170.155,If--
1995.95-5207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.155,1171.647,"If he recovered, you could try him, if not, not."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1172.609,1174.9,--I think clearly under Dusky that person could not be tried.
1995.95-5207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1174.9,1175.691,It's Dusky.
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1175.691,1179.593,"Well now, Dusky just establishes the standard, but an interpretation--"
1995.95-5207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1179.593,1184.725,"But I mean, is it clear that a person who is in a coma cannot be brought to trial?"
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1184.725,1186.157,--If that person cannot--
1995.95-5207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1186.157,1187.607,Can't understand what's going on.
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1187.607,1189.13,--Then that person cannot be brought to trial.
1995.95-5207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1189.13,1189.55,It has nothing to do with psychiatry.
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1189.55,1190.919,That person cannot be brought to trial.
1995.95-5207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1190.919,1196.164,"And the law that says that is, the case that says that?"
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1197.343,1202.366,"Well, Dusky establishes the two-prong test for determining competency."
1995.95-5207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1209.342,1210.794,"And he couldn't assist the lawyer, okay."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1210.794,1213.045,--Then you can't... assist--
1995.95-5207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1213.045,1215.996,"I mean, it seems to me possibly that this... well, I'll ask your opponent."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1224.351,1225.563,--That's correct.
1995.95-5207,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.563,1225.903,All right.
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1225.903,1242.854,"The picture that the fact-finder gets with regards to a preponderance standard is the most accurate picture, because the defendant must come forward with all sorts of evidence to prove his incompetency."
1995.95-5207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1242.854,1244.584,"Mr. Edmondson, may I ask you--"
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1266.219,1277.556,"Well, obviously I think this Court would follow... Medina was a five-member majority, so I think this Court is bound to follow Medina."
1995.95-5207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1281.89,1285.801,"But you would follow a Patterson approach, and then your emphasis would be on history, I gather, rather than on basic fairness."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1285.801,1295.619,"I think when you look at basic fairness, Justice Stevens, it's just as compelling as history, maybe even more compelling than history, because basic fairness--"
1995.95-5207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.619,1296.47,How could it be more compelling than history?
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1305.666,1308.746,"--That's correct, but fairness is just as compelling."
1995.95-5207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.746,1311.149,"Mr. Ravitz, you need both, don't you?"
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1341.08,1343.32,"Yes, but I think we have to realize what--"
1995.95-5207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.32,1363.114,"You wouldn't if the history was the other way, if the history showed that... you know, that there had never been a right to a preponderance of the evidence claim, then you lose without any further inquiry, but having established that there was historically, you still have to show that it's so essential to our form of ordered liberty that it can't be changed."
1995.95-5207,0,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1363.114,1402.0,"--What we have to do is look at the impact of this standard on the fundamental constitutional right not to be tried while incompetent, and if we look at the impact, what we're saying is, we're going to have a group of individuals who are now more than likely incompetent, who are going to go on trial for their life, who are going to have an opportunity to get before a judge and waive the guiding hand of counsel, are going to go before a judge and plead guilty, make decisions on whether to... not to testify, or, too, to testify, and that's the risk that we take, and what interest does the State have?"
1995.95-5207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.462,1420.961,"Very well, Mr. Ravitz."
1995.95-5207,1,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1423.034,1429.025,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-5207,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1508.039,1511.629,Was an insanity defense made in this case?
1995.95-5207,1,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1511.629,1513.993,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1995.95-5207,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1534.877,1543.022,And the statute has been changed since this case was tried on the clear and convincing standard?
1995.95-5207,1,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1544.111,1546.194,The uniform jury instruction--
1995.95-5207,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1546.194,1549.367,It used to say it had to be unmistakable proof.
1995.95-5207,1,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1549.367,1561.204,"--The uniform... it was clear unmistakable and convincing in the uniform jury instruction, which may well have come into play had there been a jury trial on the issue of competency."
1995.95-5207,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1581.747,1588.64,"Now, there wouldn't be a jury trial in Oklahoma on the decision of competency made by the trial judge?"
1995.95-5207,1,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1588.64,1593.123,"Yes, ma'am, there is a right to demand a jury trial at two stages--"
1995.95-5207,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1593.123,1593.724,On that question.
1995.95-5207,1,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1593.724,1605.473,"--On two stages in the competency proceedings under 1175.1, and that's why I stress, Justice O'Connor, that the burden of proof has to be examined in the context of the entire system."
1995.95-5207,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.473,1609.547,1175 is... that's your civil commitment statute--
1995.95-5207,1,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1609.987,1612.178,"No, on the competency proceeding."
1995.95-5207,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1613.46,1625.217,"In the criminal case, would you explain exactly how the Oklahoma system works if a defendant says through counsel I want to challenge this defendant's competence to stand trial?"
1995.95-5207,1,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1625.217,1625.638,--Certainly.
1995.95-5207,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1689.331,1699.586,But then who makes the determination of whether the defendant is competent or not after the application is accepted and the examination is conducted?
1995.95-5207,2,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,1699.586,1711.485,"By the statute at both provisions on the determination on the application and on the post examination competency hearing, the issues reserved for the judge are then reserved for the jury, and the jury will make those findings."
1995.95-5207,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1711.485,1712.967,May I just ask you to clarify one thing?
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1731.017,1733.058,He has the right to demand a jury trial.
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.058,1736.401,Is that ever done as a matter of practice in criminal trials in Oklahoma?
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1736.401,1740.614,"Justice Stevens, it's common on the post examination competency hearing."
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1742.057,1742.224,No.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1750.261,1751.742,--Yes.
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.742,1752.262,It is.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1752.262,1754.223,On the post examination competency hearing.
1995.95-5207,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1765.091,1772.624,"Okay, the post examination, does it first go to a judge and he... because here, I gather, it didn't go to a jury."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1772.624,1773.576,That is correct.
1995.95-5207,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.576,1776.989,"So here, at first the judge makes the determination?"
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1776.989,1794.541,"Mr. Chief Justice, the matter... when the examination is completed and a report is made back to the court, the matter is set for post examination competency hearing, and then the question is asked, do you demand a jury trial, and in this case--"
1995.95-5207,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.541,1796.341,Here a jury trial was not demanded.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1796.341,1796.912,--That is correct.
1995.95-5207,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1796.912,1798.241,But could have been had.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1798.241,1798.862,"Yes, sir."
1995.95-5207,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.862,1802.585,"And so in this case the judge made it in a bench trial, on effect."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1802.585,1803.477,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-5207,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1803.477,1807.527,And the jury trial obviously would precede the trial on the charges.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1807.527,1810.019,"It would not be the same jury, Justice Kennedy."
1995.95-5207,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1810.019,1811.581,Actually a different jury.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1811.581,1828.892,"Yes, sir, a different jury, because under Oklahoma statutes nothing that is said by the accused in the context of a post examination competency hearing can be used against the accused in any proceeding whatsoever, and so the same jury categorically could not hear that evidence."
1995.95-5207,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1828.892,1832.996,"And whether or not it's for the jury or the trial judge it's clear and convincing, that's the standard."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1832.996,1834.776,That is correct.
1995.95-5207,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.776,1855.028,"General Edmondson, I must say, what Oklahoma has done with respect to the defense of insanity on the merits at trial casts a great deal of doubt in my mind concerning the necessity of the standard that Oklahoma has adopted with respect to sanity to stand trial."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1895.584,1920.222,"Justice Scalia, to some extent that emphasizes the risk that Oklahoma feels on a determination of present competency, where the incentive to malinger or to create symptoms is much greater, in our estimation, than the prescience of the defendant to try to create those kinds of manifestations at the time he's committing an offense."
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1920.222,1926.906,"But that doesn't make sense, because the burden on the State, if you lose on the insanity issue he walks."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1931.278,1932.6,"No, Justice Stevens."
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.792,1938.103,"Well, at least he's acquitted of the crime."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1938.103,1939.355,--That is correct.
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1939.355,1955.655,"I mean, he doesn't have the criminal... whereas in this case it's only a temporary delay in the trial, and you can in the meantime medicate him, and treat him to try and restore his competency, so it seems to me the cost of losing on the insanity is much heavier for the State than the cost of a temporary delay in the trial, in this proceeding."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,1955.655,1976.838,"The cost may be heavier, Your Honor, but we feel that the ability to prove present sanity at the time of the commission of the offense, when the defendant will not contemporaneously be trying to manifest symptoms of incompetence, but will simply be carrying out the commission of an offense, is a manageable burden for the State of Oklahoma."
1995.95-5207,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.787,2015.393,"Can I ask you to get... because it's right on the merits, and I want to be sure you do address what I take it to be their, in my mind strong argument... or the strongest argument they make, in my mind, is, one is the history is against you, but the other thing they say is, leaving the history aside, imagine you had a certain number of people who are in comas, and some of them are faking, and some of them are not."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2086.491,2090.681,"Justice Breyer, of course, it's easier to respond to the coma argument because they very--"
1995.95-5207,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.681,2100.919,"I use the coma because I want to get away from the all kinds of other issues of the earlier insanity defense, et cetera, but you can respond in terms of the insanity."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2100.919,2101.56,--Thank you.
1995.95-5207,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2105.003,2106.123,I just did that for illustration.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2106.123,2118.943,"--In terms of the allocation of the risk of error, which I believe is the direction that we're heading in, I again point to the entire context of Oklahoma system rather than simply the burden of proof."
1995.95-5207,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2132.469,2133.471,He says there are a lot of good things.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2187.287,2198.033,"--I would like to respond first of all if I could, Justice Breyer, to the allegation that assigning a preponderance of the evidence is the uniform or even the overwhelming practice of the States."
1995.95-5207,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2210.511,2214.352,"Some of those States that do something different in fact put the burden on the State, don't they?"
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2214.352,2215.013,--Yes.
1995.95-5207,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.013,2218.205,So in fact it's not just 25 to 25.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2221.588,2226.19,"Justice Souter, there are 25 that use the preponderance of the evidence."
1995.95-5207,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2236.548,2249.826,"But I'm just saying that if there are 25 States that put the burden on the defendant to prove by a preponderance, and there are 25 who do not, some of the 25 who do not in fact place a burden not on the defendant at all, but upon the State."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2259.122,2262.294,--That is exactly the point I was attempting to make.
1995.95-5207,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2274.483,2284.31,"But it is accurate, isn't it, that of the States that place the burden on the defendant, only four place that burden to a degree of clear and convincing."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2286.111,2297.868,"That is correct, Justice Souter, except Oklahoma does not place it on the defendant, Oklahoma places it on the party that raises it, and there could be instances where the State of Oklahoma--"
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.868,2305.423,"But if a party other than the defendant raises the question and wants to commit the defendant, must that party prove more than incompetence?"
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2308.746,2309.936,--That is correct.
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2309.936,2314.909,But the defendant need not prove the danger of that kind in order to establish incompetence to stand trial.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2314.909,2315.96,That is correct also.
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2315.96,2323.276,"So that if the defendant carries his burden, even under the clear and convincing standard, he will not necessarily receive civil commitment, will he?"
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2323.276,2324.566,Not necessarily.
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.566,2325.757,Because there are different issues in the case.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2325.757,2360.549,"But interestingly, in Oklahoma's statute we incorporate in title 22, our criminal provisions, the provisions out of title 43 on involuntary commitment and, at the post examination competency hearing stage, if the jury or the judge determines that this individual is incompetent, is not capable of regaining competence within the foreseeable future, and is a person who is mentally ill as defined under title 43 and is dangerous, then that same hearing can result in the civil commitment under a clear and convincing evidence standard mandated by Addington."
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2360.549,2373.816,"Yes, but the issues are sufficiently different that you could not say that in the routine case of the criminal defendant seeking to establish his own incompetence, if he prevails at the hearing he will not necessarily be civilly committed."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2373.816,2377.249,"I certainly would not say that that would be a routine decision, Justice Stevens."
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.663,2402.139,"But of course, the unable to be restored element of it, he would be trying to prove that himself, would he?"
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2406.881,2409.783,If... he would not be required to do that.
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2409.783,2410.935,And certainly the State wouldn't be trying to prove that.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2410.935,2416.928,"If I were facing a potential trial in a capital case, I would be trying to prove that."
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.879,2423.58,Because then you'd be permanently civilly committed.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2423.58,2426.653,"Because... no, not under the rulings of this Court."
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2432.258,2435.031,"But as soon as you lose that finding, you could be tried for the crime."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2435.031,2436.36,Not necessarily.
1995.95-5207,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.425,2447.246,"In any case, as long as that continues, you're still alive, aren't you?"
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2447.246,2450.379,"That is correct, and the important aspect--"
1995.95-5207,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2450.379,2452.031,Which is a good thing from your point of view.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2452.031,2458.683,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, and the important fact is the meshing of those two requirements."
1995.95-5207,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2458.683,2477.807,"Well, there's a meshing... I recognize the fact that if you had defendant's burden being preponderance to show incompetence, State's burden being clear and convincing to commit, that there is in fact a kind of gap between them in which some might fall."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2498.81,2499.972,"Nor, Justice--"
1995.95-5207,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2499.972,2501.132,"That wasn't a serious problem, was it?"
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2501.132,2513.671,"--Nor, Justice Souter, has there been any indication that in the 15 years that the State of Oklahoma has required a clear and convincing evidence standard, that defendants who were factually incompetent have been forced to stand trial in the State of Oklahoma."
1995.95-5207,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2517.803,2524.397,"Yes, well, that would be very difficult to tell, whereas the question that I raised would be very easy to answer."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2534.174,2545.731,"--I cannot answer that historically, Justice Souter, and my experience as a prosecutor and Attorney General only date back to 1982, so all of my personal experience has been under the new statute."
1995.95-5207,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2545.731,2548.533,"Of course, this could be one of those cases."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2569.327,2578.743,"Justice O'Connor, I... the judge's pronouncement seemed to indicate that he made that finding solely on the basis of clear and convincing evidence."
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.239,2620.801,"Yes, but the likelihood of malingering is just one of the facts the trier of fact has to take into consideration in reaching the ultimate conclusion, and it necessarily follows, as I understand the Oklahoma system, that there at least exists the possibility that there are a class of people who are more likely than not incompetent."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2631.888,2633.178,That is correct--
1995.95-5207,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2633.178,2633.668,Yes.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2633.668,2638.302,"--Justice Stevens, but not without a hearing to determine whether or not they are factually incompetent."
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2638.302,2653.751,"No, they've had the hearing, and after the hearing the conclusion might be, it's 55 percent chance they're incompetent, but it's not a 65 or 75 percent chance so we're going to let... the risk of error is placed on the defendant in those cases."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2653.751,2662.646,"That is correct, with the other safeguards of the statute designed to overcome that risk of error by providing multiple opportunities for the defendant to reraise the issue."
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2662.646,2666.459,"Yes, but the multiple opportunities would be there regardless of the standard."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2670.273,2674.454,"You have the same multiple opportunities, that is correct."
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.515,2690.186,"Yes, but all of those features of the system could remain in place under a different standard."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2690.186,2691.327,Exactly.
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.327,2692.296,Yes.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2692.296,2707.967,Except for my point that the reason those safeguards are there are to guarantee that the safeguards preserve the substantive due process rights of the defendant while still protecting against the false findings of incompetence based upon malingering.
1995.95-5207,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2707.967,2727.74,"General Edmondson, is there any evidence in the record or any references to studies in the record to indicate that in the last 20 or 30 years juries or judges as fact-finders have in fact been getting hoodwinked either by malingerers or by psychiatrists?"
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2754.457,2768.508,"Judge... Your Honor, there are, of course, studies about the effects of malingering, and there is the fact that it has reached the stage where it is a separate diagnosis under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition."
1995.95-5207,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2770.699,2772.309,"What do you mean, a separate diagnosis?"
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2774.93,2778.994,"--It is not classified as a disease, it is classified as a finding."
1995.95-5207,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.994,2779.304,Oh.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2779.304,2781.795,With requisite elements to make that finding.
1995.95-5207,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2781.795,2782.606,Even the psychiatrists can tell.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2785.199,2803.43,"None were presented in the context of this trial below, and I doubt if it would be very easy to get a collection of jurists who were willing to say that they were in fact hoodwinked by an accused who was falsely claiming incompetence."
1995.95-5207,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2846.258,2865.75,"I would... let me ask you... I don't want to go off on a tangent of the details of this case, but if he really had demanded a jury trial, wouldn't the State have had the opportunity to require his counsel to testify after there being a substitution of counsel?"
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2865.75,2872.536,The case law and the statutes of the State of Oklahoma are absolutely silent on this.
1995.95-5207,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2896.231,2901.755,So probably you could have gotten it in front of the jury if it had become a jury issue.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2901.755,2904.746,I don't know the answer to that question.
1995.95-5207,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2918.695,2941.351,"Is there anything else you want to say in response to what I've raised before, which I take it as being that he's saying under your test the only difference is that there will be five people in prison or executed who absolutely were the same as if they were in a coma for every one who is a faker who you caught by this test, and you don't need the test to catch the fakers, because the fakers are going to be put in mental hospitals anyway."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2946.955,2951.677,"Justice Breyer, I would have to concede that Oklahoma has not constructed a perfect system."
1995.95-5207,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2966.887,2968.559,--What about beyond a reasonable doubt?
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,2984.319,3008.244,"--Justice Ginsburg, I would very much doubt if any State could enact beyond a reasonable doubt consistent with the fundamental requirement of fairness and an opportunity for the defendant, if he's the one presenting the cause of incompetence, to meet that burden of proof no matter... and we have enacted a great number of safeguards in the Oklahoma statute, but I don't know if they would be sufficient to require beyond a reasonable doubt."
1995.95-5207,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.856,3013.167,--So--
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,3041.377,3045.358,"Justice Scalia, I do not concede that innocent people are going to go to prison."
1995.95-5207,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3045.699,3050.883,"Are you saying there isn't any fundamental right involved, because that's important."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,3067.754,3073.968,"--Not in those terms, Justice Ginsburg, but there is a fundamental right, under due process, not to be tried while incompetent."
1995.95-5207,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3073.968,3075.518,All right.
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,3098.462,3106.7,"I think, consistent with Patterson v. New York, a State has great latitude in constructing the procedures to guarantee that right."
1995.95-5207,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3111.571,3113.242,"--Thank you, General Edmondson."
1995.95-5207,3,44614,w_a_edmondson,,3113.242,3114.064,Thank you.
1995.95-5207,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3114.064,3115.466,"Mr. Ravitz, you have 5 minutes remaining."
1995.95-5207,4,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,3115.466,3118.688,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-5207,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3132.927,3135.429,"Now, the defendant here never asked for a jury determination of competency."
1995.95-5207,4,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,3135.429,3141.402,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1995.95-5207,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3141.402,3142.664,Why is that?
1995.95-5207,4,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,3144.564,3145.376,"Yes, sir... yes, ma'am."
1995.95-5207,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3175.086,3176.648,"How fundamental is this right, Mr. Ravitz?"
1995.95-5207,4,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,3178.118,3178.829,--I think--
1995.95-5207,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3178.829,3186.364,"We've... it's always been... some legal systems, of course, allow a trial in absentia, where he's not only incompetent, he's not even there."
1995.95-5207,4,40316,robert_alan_ravitz,,3188.596,3192.268,"--Less than 4 years ago, Justice Scalia, in Medina, this Court said it was a fundamental right."
1995.95-5207,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3222.887,3224.7,"Thank you, Mr. Ravitz."
