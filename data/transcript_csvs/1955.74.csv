1955.74,0,30073,john_f_davis,,12.29,16.754,If the Court please.
1955.74,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,145.836,148.979,What -- what does that mean on demand by the Government?
1955.74,0,30073,john_f_davis,,148.979,157.417,"The matter of fact in this case, the -- there was a letter addressed to them by the Commission in saying, we believe this is a situation which requires the tax and you -- when you put a tax on."
1955.74,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,157.417,161.561,(Voice Overlap) -- did Leslie Salt asked if it required them?
1955.74,0,30073,john_f_davis,,161.561,163.664,"I don't know, it doesn't appear in the record."
1955.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,414.806,418.953,"That's what you -- that's what you have trade, doesn't it?"
1955.74,0,30073,john_f_davis,,418.953,423.109,"Debt securities, no, no it doesn't."
1955.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,430.408,438.06,All I'm suggesting is we must be careful to paraphrase the word in the statute and then argue in paraphrase is though then you were you work for the statute.
1955.74,0,30073,john_f_davis,,438.06,442.426,"Well, I don't -- I don't take two great liberties when the title is security."
1955.74,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,446.753,448.752,But we're not referring to its title.
1955.74,0,30073,john_f_davis,,448.752,451.328,"No, but it is part of this -- this is part of the code."
1955.74,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,471.768,474.489,"Why do you -- why do you use the word ""security""?"
1955.74,0,30073,john_f_davis,,474.489,495.925,"Why do I use the word security, because basically our question is whether these are securities which have -- have -- to which a stamp tax should be abide or whether these are, let's say, bank loans to which the tax would not be applicable."
1955.74,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,495.925,501.697,When the security carries a connotation of being security made.
1955.74,0,30073,john_f_davis,,501.697,511.425,"Well, these are not secured, there is no mortgage that it is involved, but many securities, Your Honor, do not have any formal pledge of -- of security behind them."
1955.74,1,17544,bruce_m_casey_jr,,1823.601,1824.409,May it please the Court.
1955.74,2,30073,john_f_davis,,3093.602,3100.813,That seems to be something of an issue between me and Mr. Casey as to when private placements commenced.
