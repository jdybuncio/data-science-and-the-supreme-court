1966.575,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,29.272,"Number 575, Helen Jackson versus Lykes Brothers Steamship Company Incorporated."
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,30.26,31.56,Yes sir.
1966.575,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,34.792,36.824,You do have the time anyway you want.
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,36.824,40.919,Yes sir.
1966.575,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,41.72,42.9,"You may proceed, yes."
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,42.9,43.638,Yes.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,152.793,165.55,Is there any question in this case that if there had not been a death involved that you would have had a maritime cause of action for negligence?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,165.55,166.609,No sir.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,171.785,173.571,"But that's different, that's a different --"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,173.571,174.935,They -- this have might --
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,174.935,182.015,-- if there hadn't been a death wholly aside that in the Jones Act you would have had a maritime cause of action for negligence?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,182.015,183.235,No sir.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,212.683,218.617,"Well, that -- that they said that against that particular employer, the Longshoremen's Act was exclusive."
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,219.957,222.338,"Yes sir, under Rufus Robinson that would --"
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,222.338,228.881,"But if he had been a seaman -- if he had been a seaman, he would have had a maritime cause of action for ordinary negligence?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,228.881,236.936,"If he had been a member of the crew, they said he would have had a Jones Act but we contend that there was a question of fact in the salute to judge --"
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,236.936,248.749,"Well, what if -- if the owner of the vessel here had not been the stevedore, let's assume it is an ordinary owner, it wasn't a stevedore also."
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,256.402,266.696,"If it would have been a non-Lykes employee, I would imagine that the state court would have granted him a right in cause of action on the General Maritime Law."
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,272.748,277.774,"But there is such a cause of action presented in some court, in the federal court?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,277.774,279.845,"In federal court, we file this type all the time."
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,281.693,292.828,The longshoreman can -- can -- who isn't killed and sue the ship owner for unseaworthiness and also ordinary negligence --
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,292.828,293.011,I --
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,293.011,294.144,-- as a maritime matter?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,294.144,301.237,"We have a problem with ordinary negligence when the employer is a direct employer, because --"
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,301.237,303.13,I understand that.
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,303.13,310.409,"-- in this case this comes within the scope of Yaka versus Reed or Reed versus Yaka, so we have a problem with reference to negligence."
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,323.164,323.531,Yes.
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,323.531,325.144,We don't know where we stand on that.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.827,692.693,"Your -- let's assume that you were right, assume you're right on the fact that the Harbor Workers' Act does not bar you from seeking some kind of a relief, some kind of other relief, do you rely on both the Jones Act and General Maritime Law?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,692.693,693.542,Yes sir.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.861,721.525,"Well, now did the Louisiana court here reach the question of whether under the local law, the death -- the remedies on death reaches the maritime causes of action?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,721.525,726.649,"We had a very brief minor -- fewer discussion on Tungus, Goette, Hess --"
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.649,728.161,Yes.
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,728.161,728.72,-- and all of these landmark cases.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.72,730.027,And I read that (Voice Overlap).
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,730.027,730.766,-- very little --
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,730.766,745.19,"As I read it, they did not -- we have no rule again in this case anyway as to whether the appointment of the state courts, your state statute reaches -- your death statute would reach this kind of a cause of action?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,745.19,748.993,Our state -- that statute is a very broad death statute.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.186,789.871,What's your position as to the law that governs whether or not the state remedy is available to supplement admiralty law?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,789.871,801.257,My position would be that the state law is only a vehicle -- is only a vehicle to give him a right on the gen -- give the widow a right under General Maritime Law.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.644,817.846,"Well, is that -- you mean that -- well, in your cause of action on the General Maritime approach is you think rest on overruling Tungus?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,817.846,830.859,"Well, I don't say overruling, because I also feel that the 2315 statute of State of Louisiana is broad enough to include General Maritime Law."
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.319,838.338,But you have no -- you have no construction of your state statute to that effect?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,838.338,840.021,We have a case right now.
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,860.55,864.238,That is he decided that the widow and defendants had a --
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,864.238,864.361,Yes sir.
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,864.361,864.796,-- cause of action (Voice Overlap) --
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,864.796,865.076,Yes.
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,865.105,866.436,-- under Louisiana law?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,866.436,866.953,Yes sir.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.837,882.391,"So even if -- so that if this is a federal question, the federal law of government in general, at least the trial court's decision in that case is persuasive as to what the state law is?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,882.391,886.798,He really never considered this here a problem of Tungus.
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,917.077,924.368,"Yes, but in this Grigsby case as I understood you with the -- at least -- but what did you say, his name, this district judge?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,924.368,925.174,Judge Putnam.
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.174,940.362,"Judge Putnam apparently says that in these instances of a maritime death plan, there is a remedy and you suggest that maybe a good or better than a federal maritime?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,940.362,940.763,Yes sir.
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,940.763,943.641,There is a statement under your state statute?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,943.641,945.138,Yes sir.
1966.575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,945.138,950.329,You don't have to -- I thought your claim was here that your client was a member of the crew?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,950.329,951.931,That's my first -- my first claim that --
1966.575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,951.931,957.938,"If he was, you have no Tungus problem at all you have the Jones Act which gives you a right of recovery for wrongful death."
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,957.938,958.696,But if I'm wrong under the Jones Act --
1966.575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,958.696,960.388,That that is --
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,960.388,965.732,-- then I have to make my claim under General Maritime Law and then I have to resort to 2315.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.732,968.715,That's a big -- it was the same thing truly the longshoreman.
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,977.081,981.402,He was doing longshoreman work which work was traditionally that of the seaman.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.908,1009.255,"Well, let's assume there's been some other operator of the ship, does it take the difficult ship operator goes in being unloaded by longshoreman?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1009.255,1009.5,Yes sir.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.5,1011.226,Longshoreman is hurt on the ship.
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1011.226,1012.8,Yes sir.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.8,1014.197,He hasn't enjoyed that cause of action.
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1014.197,1019.21,"No sir because if he was -- it was a T. Smith & Sons situation, T. Smith is a stevedore."
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.864,1026.786,That's right.
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1026.786,1028.712,He must make it against his employer.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.48,1040.401,So you're saying that the situation was given here because stevedore here was the ship operator and he was the employer of the stevedore?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1040.401,1041.144,Yes sir.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.144,1050.517,"And he can make the claim against his employer, but if he's going to make it against his employer then you know what you'll get little bit cut off by the Longshoremen's Act."
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1058.491,1069.105,I want to first urge what any ordinary bonafide member of the crew would urge that he has a claim under the Jones Act against his employer who is a ship operator.
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1069.105,1073.045,"Well, now suppose you lose out on that, how do you get out -- suppose you lose them?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1073.045,1073.956,"Alright, I lose that."
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1073.956,1078.585,"Now, how do you get out from the under the Longshoremen's Act if you've lost on that claim?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1078.585,1078.874,Well --
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1078.874,1080.679,Where do you get a General Maritime claim?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1080.679,1081.129,Alright.
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1081.129,1082.77,Actionable under your states statute?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1082.77,1091.336,"Well, the longshoreman -- the longshoreman have a traditional third party claim against the vessel."
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1091.336,1092.099,I see.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.099,1093.33,Against the ship operator?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1093.33,1094.518,Against the ship operator.
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1094.518,1094.559,I see.
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1094.559,1098.222,Against the ship and in pursuant to Reed versus Yaka whoever owns the ship.
1966.575,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1098.222,1098.332,Yes.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.332,1104.839,Could there be a difference between your general maritime and negligence plan to get the operator in the Jones Act claim?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1104.839,1105.091,Yes sir.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1105.091,1106.779,The Jones Act claim would be easier?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1106.779,1110.299,The Jones Act claim is the easiest.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1126.701,1129.821,Is there comparative negligence in Louisiana law?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1129.821,1131.3,That's a little problem in Louisiana.
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1137.753,1140.115,"It should be the maritime law, wasn't it?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1140.115,1141.38,Sir?
1966.575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.38,1143.19,"It should be the maritime law, wouldn't' it?"
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1143.19,1144.898,"Well, this should be maritime law, yes sir."
1966.575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1144.898,1147.947,Well that's only if Tungus were overruled?
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1147.947,1149.204,You're right.
1966.575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1149.204,1150.057,Only if Tungus were overruled.
1966.575,0,19596,charles_r_maloney,,1150.057,1153.893,If Tungus were overruled then this would be comparative.
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1299.369,1302.128,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1966.575,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1405.48,1410.861,Early complaint did also overt that the decedent was a member of the crew?
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1410.861,1415.026,"Yes sir I included, I meant to include that when said it claimed under the Jones Act."
1966.575,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1417.992,1421.675,"Well, then you say did make the necessarily allegation?"
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1421.675,1424.259,Right.
1966.575,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1510.559,1514.883,Well what's the meaning of that opening allegation of the complaint?
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1514.883,1514.999,That is --
1966.575,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1514.999,1517.775,-- that you forgot some surviving widow in personal represent --
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1517.775,1521.745,"If you please sir, that is a conclusion of the pleader."
1966.575,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1533.371,1534.178,What?
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1534.178,1539.147,-- bold allegation of plea -- of the conclusion of the pleader.
1966.575,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1539.147,1545.849,"Under Louisiana practice, there's customer that set out more than the --"
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1545.849,1546.725,Oh yes sir.
1966.575,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1546.725,1548.697,-- end result that is say --
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1548.697,1548.95,Yes sir.
1966.575,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1548.95,1551.36,-- the claim of his personal representative?
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1551.36,1561.786,He alleges that she is the duly qualified administratrix by the judgment of such and such a court.
1966.575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.479,1584.784,But you wouldn't --
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1584.784,1585.257,And --
1966.575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.257,1593.973,"--you wouldn't say that this longshoreman would be barred by the Longshoremen's Act, if there had been someone else operating the ship?"
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1593.973,1597.866,If you mean that there was a third party whom he could sue?
1966.575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.953,1604.821,"Well if he's -- if that stevedore employer haven't been operating the ship, he would have had the --"
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1604.821,1606.736,"He would have a right to sue the ship, yes."
1966.575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.736,1607.467,And the --
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1607.467,1608.274,And the --
1966.575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.274,1611.504,-- and the he would not have been barred by the Longshoremen's Act?
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1611.504,1612.69,Precisely.

1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1618.908,1623.409,"Precisely, that is the (Voice Overlap) exact point of the case."
1966.575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.051,1971.768,Can I ask you --
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,1971.768,1972.539,Yes sir.

1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,2000.685,2005.543,"Louisiana Court in spite of what my friend had said, have not passed upon that."
1966.575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.693,2017.317,"Well, that is if he is dead -- that if he has died (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,2017.317,2017.878,Right.
1966.575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2017.878,2020.017,"-- he has said that you can borrow that Louisiana law, isn't it?"
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,2020.017,2021.472,Right.
1966.575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.526,2034.098,Is that case cited in your brief?
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,2034.098,2034.75,No sir.
1966.575,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.75,2035.528,What case is that?
1966.575,1,18181,benjamin_w_yancey,,2035.528,2054.596,"That is a case of a Babin, B-A-B-I-N versus Lykes the citation of which I do not have but I can get for you if you want in the Court of Appeals for the Parish of Orleans -- the Court of Appeals for the Parish of Orleans."
1966.575,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2375.77,2376.829,Mr. Maloney.
1966.575,2,19596,charles_r_maloney,,2376.829,2378.671,Yes sir.
1966.575,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2378.671,2381.422,What -- what about the pleadings?

1966.575,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2381.869,2384.827,What about the pleading point?
1966.575,2,19596,charles_r_maloney,,2384.827,2398.967,I would suggest that the pleading covers and includes a claim for the warranty of seaworthiness and if it wouldn't have we could've amended that specifically to cover anything that wouldn't have.
1966.575,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2472.411,2505.326,"Well, is this correct that -- I gather the point that the -- that Mr. Yancey makes is that under Jones Act you have not -- they're properly pleaded a Jones Act claim because that will be pleaded in the death case only by a personal representative that Louisiana practices as I understood requires an allegation that indeed she is by virtue of appointment by such and such a court a personal representative and that although you knew this all along you'd never made an effort to qualify it."
1966.575,2,19596,charles_r_maloney,,2505.326,2505.742,No.
1966.575,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2534.395,2538.627,"Well, I gather what you're saying is that for this effect, that you can still amend it, is that it?"
1966.575,2,19596,charles_r_maloney,,2538.627,2539.451,This could -- this Court (Voice Overlap) --
1966.575,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2539.451,2543.146,"If this goes back, it's not too late to amend it, that's what you're saying."

1966.575,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.127,2587.842,"Well, the state court didn't dispose of the case on this ground."

1966.575,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.528,2591.991,State court didn't dispose the case on this ground?

1966.575,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.06,2600.301,What about the pleadings point?
1966.575,2,19596,charles_r_maloney,,2600.536,2601.565,No.
1966.575,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.228,2603.064,They would --
