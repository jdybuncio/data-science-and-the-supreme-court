2014.13-1333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.52,"We'll hear argument next in Case 13-1333, Coleman v. Tollefson. Mr. Shanmugam."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,7.52,21.05,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under the three strikes provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a prisoner who has three prior dismissals on prior occasions must pay the full filing fee before bringing suit."
2014.13-1333,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,41.62,45.075,Does that include a petition for cert or is it only the first level appeal?
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,45.075,55.73,"The time for the filing of a petition for cert would count under our view, which is to say that a dismissal would not qualify as a strike until that time is complete."
2014.13-1333,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,55.73,62.4,So until there's a petition filed and it's denied or until the time expires to file the petition.
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,62.4,62.82,That is correct.
2014.13-1333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,75.65,76.16,"Sure, it is."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,98.91,99.61,Justice Scalia --
2014.13-1333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,99.61,103.73,It separately says by the district court or by the court of appeals.
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,103.73,114.04,"It is certainly true that a qualifying dismissal by a court of appeals, like a qualifying dismissal by a district court, qualifies as a distinct strike."
2014.13-1333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.69,129.06,"Well, I think on your theory, he wouldn't get two, he'd just get one."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,129.06,130.15,"No, that is --"
2014.13-1333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.15,135.99,"The -- the dismissal is simply not final until the court of appeals acts, and that's one dismissal."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,135.99,137.67,But there would still be two dismissals.
2014.13-1333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,141.41,141.47,No.
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,151.38,154.23,I don't think that there is any inconsistency.
2014.13-1333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.34,210.52,"Why do you say that? Where do you get that out of the word ""occasion""? I would -- I would think ""occasion"" means at any time prior, whether it's at the court -- whether it's at the district court or the court of appeals."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,216.67,228.9,"We don't believe that it could only mean what we suggest, which is to say that we don't think that the text precludes an interpretation under which the occasion is coterminous with the act of dismissal."
2014.13-1333,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,257.6,266.21,"Mr. Shanmugam, would you explain that distinction from the court of appeals level? So the district court dismisses for failure to state a claim."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,277.69,287.525,"So, Justice Ginsburg, when a district court dismisses for failure to state a claim, I think that the ordinary course would be for a court of appeals to affirm."
2014.13-1333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,340.6,352.21,"Mr. Shanmugam, I find it as one of the appealing points in your argument that you have a dismissal for frivolousness at the District Court level."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,380.03,383.2,"So, more often than you might think, Justice Scalia, and for the simple reason --"
2014.13-1333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.2,385.245,"I hope so, because I don't think it happens very often."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,385.245,392.62,"It is certainly true that there are not a lot of cases, as the Federal government points out, in which a Court of Appeals outright reverses."
2014.13-1333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,420.98,442.575,"In a case such as that, is there anything preventing the Plaintiff from getting a stay of the District Court judgment? The third strike, seeking a stay of the judgment, and if in fact it is because of a failure to state a claim, so has more merit than one of the frivolous ones, I suppose the Court of Appeals could grant a stay, and the problem we're addressing would totally go away."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,442.575,447.88,"So, neither Respondents, nor the Federal government suggest that that is a permissible solution."
2014.13-1333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,466.64,471.41,"Yeah, but that's a problem that is always presented when you have to ask a District Court to stay its own judgment."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,473.32,476.68,"Right, but you're not really staying the dismissal in that circumstance."
2014.13-1333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,481.26,482.49,"No, you stay the judgment."
2014.13-1333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,491.31,492.115,I'm sorry.
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,506.84,538.67,"I think, Justice Sotomayor, if I'm understanding the Chief Justice correctly, that what the Chief Justice is suggesting is that a District Court when it enters the potential third strike mit somehow enter a stay of the disposition and what I'm submitting is a little bit counterintuitive about that, is that what the District Court would essentially be doing is entering the dismissal because after all, the dismissal would need to take effect but at the same time saying that in essence the collateral consequences that have dismissal are not immediately going to take effect."
2014.13-1333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,538.67,543.835,"The remedy will be stayed in effect, of the third strike."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,543.835,551.47,"Well, but the only remedy is the disposition of the case and so, again, I think that that is why this idea really hasn't gotten --"
2014.13-1333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,551.47,561.6,Are you suggesting that the District Court cannot stay the disposition of the case? Or that a Court of Appeals has to review it or going to be asked to review it can't stay it?
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,561.6,567.72,"Well, but the only consequence of the case here is the actual act of entering the dismissal."
2014.13-1333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.78,582.88,It says the dismissal will not take effect.
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,592.585,601.27,"Yeah, again, I don't think that there is a lot of precedent for this even in the jurisdictions that have adopted respondent's or the Federal government's interpretation."
2014.13-1333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,601.84,611.595,"I actually don't even think -- I hadn't considered this, because we -- appellate courts have no jurisdiction until there's a final judgment."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,620.17,627.27,"I mean, in essence what you have to do is to prevent the very judgment from becoming a judgment, because of course at the moment --"
2014.13-1333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,627.27,634.25,"I'm sorry, isn't that what stays do? They suspend the effectiveness of the judgment and by doing so you stay any collateral consequences of it?"
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,634.25,640.86,"Well, I think what they tend to do, Mr. Chief Justice, I think, is to really stay the relief that is being provided until the appellate process runs its course."
2014.13-1333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,640.86,642.95,The problem here is not that case.
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,645.79,646.68,That is correct.
2014.13-1333,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,687.81,690.77,I thought in this case there was no such preclusion.
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,703.745,709.58,"But that is a problem, Justice Ginsburg, that I think inhere's in the interpretative question that is before the Court."
2014.13-1333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,728.27,730.765,But it has to be dealt with under anybody's interpretation.
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,751.865,769.48,"But, Justice Sotomayor, under our interpretation, all of these anomalies are dealt with for the simple reason you wait until the end of the appellate process and even those courts, those two Courts of Appeals that have gone the other way on this issue have recognized this anomaly."
2014.13-1333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,830.89,845.105,"Are you saying the government is being illogical or inconsistent, because if strike number 3 is a District Court ruling, the government says, well, there's no bar to your appealing that."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,850.59,856.945,"Well, we think that that is something that Congress could logically have done."
2014.13-1333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,862.81,872.355,"If it means what it means, then there's only two strikes anyway because there was or two prior cases or two prior --"
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,872.355,880.83,"Under our interpretation, that is certainly true and, of course, it bears emphasizing this is the interpretation of the overwhelming majority of lower courts."
2014.13-1333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,880.83,887.185,"By the way, how many of those courts count the time or rely on the time for cert?"
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,887.185,898.78,"You know, I'm not sure that all of the Court of Appeals opinions have expressly dealt with that issue simply because the cases haven't quite been postured in that position."
2014.13-1333,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,934.99,955.43,"Why not? I mean, what they argue is if we take your interpretation, has to be final to become a strike, all that takes time, and if you have a really real frequent filer during that year, perhaps you will file 38 more cases or maybe a hundred and there will be no way to stop you really."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,988.41,989.0,Sure.
2014.13-1333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.08,1061.45,"Now, wait."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1083.64,1104.395,"Two points in response to that, Justice Scalia. First of all, even under Respondent's interpretation, where a prisoner has two strikes, a prisoner could come in with a flurry of lawsuits, and it seems to be undisputed that you assess whether or not a prisoner has three strikes at the point at which the prisoner submits the complaint."
2014.13-1333,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1134.195,1147.57,"Mr. Shanmugan, why isn't this case just a casebook example of what the danger is? Because this Petitioner, as I understand it, filed not only the petition that's before us, but three more."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1150.04,1152.865,Over the span of about a year and a half.
2014.13-1333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1167.73,1170.93,"Well, but he's making up for lost time. (Laughter.)"
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1170.93,1173.36,"Well, he did file four lawsuits."
2014.13-1333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1188.93,1200.01,But -- but I don't -- I don't think that your earlier point that when he has two strikes he can file a flurry of suits is relevant. That's -- that's the grace period that the government has given him.
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1207.81,1210.065,"Well, and of course, that is the question."
2014.13-1333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1275.97,1294.395,"Do you know if any of those courts, the majority of the courts except for two, have outfit for addressing things your way? And -- and I have a slight leaning towards letting the majority of circuit courts figure out administrative -- the ease of administrative rules."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1300.12,1308.3,"Well, I think that when you look at the court of appeals' opinions that have gone our way, a number of them have recognized the text is ambiguous."
2014.13-1333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.58,1426.715,"Again -- again, that's a big problem depending upon how frequent that is."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1430.755,1437.34,"Well, everyone before this Court agrees that we're not exactly dealing with a large set of cases to begin with."
2014.13-1333,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1485.65,1500.595,"Well, I would think that the -- I would think the situation that we should concerned about is the situation in which the dismissal, which is initially counted as the third strike, ultimately results in some relief for the prisoner."
2014.13-1333,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1503.28,1511.71,"Well, but, of course, under the statute, the dismissal no longer qualifies even if the prisoner doesn't obtain relief."
2014.13-1333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.385,1541.04,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Lindstrom."
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1541.04,1549.575,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The plain language of Section 1915(g) identifies when a strike occurs."
2014.13-1333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1563.46,1568.89,"Mr. Lindstrom, I -- I understand that argument, and it seems to me a very natural reading of the statute."
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1610.89,1614.83,"No, Justice Kagan, we think the ordinary rules that apply to judgments apply."
2014.13-1333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1626.79,1633.565,"Yes, but that's something -- you're now appealing to some default principle that exists outside of the statutory text."
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1667.4,1676.85,"I think we're assuming that Congress is drafting against the ordinary background rules, and there's an ordinary meaning of what's dismissed, and that's what my colleague is changing -- is challenging."
2014.13-1333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1676.85,1685.48,The problem with the ordinary rule is that it really doesn't apply completely until the next case.
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1689.335,1692.71,"If you mean it doesn't apply, I guess I'm not sure what you're saying."
2014.13-1333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1692.71,1697.15,Meaning let's talk about res judicata or collateral estoppel.
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1702.45,1703.03,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1703.03,1707.26,"If it's collateral estoppel, it could be until a third party."
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1718.135,1725.17,But we do know that Congress did want to cut off IFP status in the same case in at least some instances.
2014.13-1333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1748.25,1756.49,"Except that the -- there's still a right to ask the court of appeals for a COA, and so there is an appellate process of sorts."
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1756.49,1758.26,"There -- there would be, and that's correct."
2014.13-1333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1788.3,1788.39,Right.
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1824.41,1832.26,"That wouldn't have fired any of the four lawsuits that Mr. Coleman could have brought in this case, because he could have brought all four of his lawsuits in State court."
2014.13-1333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1837.59,1852.175,But -- but there's no remedy for the fact that subsequent lawsuits that were -- that were filed based on the erroneous third strike would have been turned back without the filing of a complaint.
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1852.175,1855.39,"In other words, it was never filed, so there was nothing to relate back, at which point --"
2014.13-1333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1855.39,1857.35,And nothing -- or to file a 60(b).
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1857.35,1881.4,"But, again, it -- there's an easy way for a prisoner to get around that, and the prisoner could have done that by -- once he's got three strikes and the last one is on appeal, he has to make the decision: Should I file my next four cases that I'm going to file -- should I file them in Federal court, or should I file them in State court? And this statute is saying you shouldn't file them in Federal court. I think -- I'm not sure if I fully answered your point about reversal, but I think that's the ordinary background rule."
2014.13-1333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.175,1962.75,What does it cost to file an appeal?
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1962.75,1965.67,"In the Federal courts, it costs $505."
2014.13-1333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1965.67,1966.35,Sorry?
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1966.35,1969.15,"$505, Your Honor."
2014.13-1333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1976.38,1987.71,"Sort of an interesting question, basically admitting that in terms of your time, the suits would still remain because they could file in State court?"
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1987.71,1989.65,"Yes, I think they could file in State court."
2014.13-1333,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1997.5,1999.495,Do states have similar rules?
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,1999.495,2001.22,States do have similar rules.
2014.13-1333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2015.795,2046.23,"You know, and this is what I'm not quite sure about in your answer to my question, Mr. Lindstrom, is, if I understand you right, and tell me if I don't, you're basically saying that we look to these background principles and we decide that a strike doesn't happen if something is reversed on appeal, so a strike is kind of dependent on what happens on appeal. But when you say that, aren't you kind of giving up your best argument? I mean, aren't you then admitting that the notion of a strike encompasses what happens on appeal and encompasses finality on appeal?"
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,2046.23,2047.6,We don't think it does.
2014.13-1333,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2206.72,2236.02,"This is a question I probably should have asked petitioner, but what do you understand his -- what do you understand him to mean when he says it has to be final on appeal? Suppose that there is an appeal pending in one of the prior strike cases, but it's perfectly clear that the notice of appeal in that instance was filed woefully out of time."
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,2239.12,2249.945,"I think it would -- I assume his answer would be to look at, once the notice of -- I think he would say the end of the expiration of time is when the court would look at it."
2014.13-1333,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2264.99,2270.825,"Under your position, I suppose we don't have to ask about certiorari, pending whether or not that --"
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,2270.825,2271.82,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1333,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2271.82,2274.73,"You can say that that's the petitioner's problem, not yours."
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,2274.73,2275.63,I think that's right.
2014.13-1333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2277.81,2291.71,"What do you think about the government's argument about the third? You imagine he has -- the prisoner has filed one, dismissed as frivolous; appeal, the dismissal affirmed."
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,2328.335,2351.005,"I think that that reading takes the word ""prior"" and changes it from meaning ""before"" to meaning ""before or after in a separately filed suit."" So I think it's going too far with what the word ""prior"" could possibly mean. That ""occasions"" -- I mean, the whole point of the statute is to identify what occasions are going to give rise to a strike."
2014.13-1333,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2356.925,2362.06,What about -- it seems to me the government does give away too much in that position.
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,2380.245,2381.04,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2389.995,2402.585,"Why use the word ""occasion"" at all? Meaning: What meaning do you give to that word? Why didn't they just say ""three dismissals""?"
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,2402.585,2410.62,"I think the statute -- I think ""occasions"" is just kind of a way of framing the long clause that follows after it."
2014.13-1333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2410.62,2428.15,"It seems to me you could have just said, if a prisoner has three dismissals, then -- three prior dismissals; not three prior occasions, three prior dismissals -- he can't get IFP thereafter."
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,2428.15,2432.675,"I don't think that would change the outcome in this case, because that language still would remain."
2014.13-1333,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2447.19,2470.465,"What about the fact that this provision refers to a prior occasion on which an action was dismissed? If you put ""prior"" and ""action"" together, isn't there the suggestion that we're talking about an action that is different from the action that is before the court of appeals in what is arguably the third strike?"
2014.13-1333,1,56064,aaron_d_lindstrom,,2470.465,2475.14,"That word would also carry through to prior appeal, apparently."
2014.13-1333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2503.09,2512.62,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kedem."
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2512.62,2544.48,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I could start with the issue of finality and the normal background principles, the argument that petitioner makes, and this is echoed by the argument that he makes in pages 9 to 10 of his reply brief, is that sometimes Congress specifies that finality is required and sometimes it specifies that finality is not required, and so we can draw no negative inference from the fact that Congress was silent here. But if you look at the example of the statute in which Congress specified non-finality that he gives, it's actually not a statute at all."
2014.13-1333,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2602.625,2605.055,Isn't that what the court of appeals held here?
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2605.055,2605.61,Pardon?
2014.13-1333,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2605.61,2610.85,The court of appeals said you do get the appeal from the third strike.
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2610.85,2617.6,"Yes, the court of appeals said, we believe incorrectly, that the appeal from the third strike is the same occasion."
2014.13-1333,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2617.6,2633.09,"But is that before us? You -- I thought that this appeal is about the fourth case, and that you haven't -- you haven't contested the court of appeals' holding that you do get an appeal from the third strike."
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2633.09,2638.085,We don't believe that's directly at issue and we can talk about it if the Justices are interested in that.
2014.13-1333,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2662.07,2685.155,But that's -- that's the -- why I asked the question on page 25 of your brief; you say the bar goes into effect if the prisoners received strikes on three or more prior occasions. Now you say a prior occasion is not the district court dismissal in this third case.
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2702.09,2711.76,"The question, Justice Breyer, is whether the prior occasions that might prevent you from appealing a civil action includes that very action, the one you're trying to appeal."
2014.13-1333,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2711.76,2714.455,"No, it doesn't -- yes, it does."
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2733.66,2737.99,"Justice Breyer, it's important to consider the posture you're in when you're making that choice."
2014.13-1333,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2737.99,2739.86,I'm not saying it's good policy or anything.
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2743.915,2748.61,"Because at the time you're making the decision, a new occasion hasn't started."
2014.13-1333,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2752.225,2752.51,Good.
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2763.135,2763.72,No.
2014.13-1333,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2792.13,2795.62,I'm going to fail this test because -- (Laughter.)
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2795.62,2798.285,We don't think that's the natural reading.
2014.13-1333,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2814.765,2821.45,Was it your brief that said there were very few cases -- you found only two published cases?
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2821.45,2825.21,"Only two cases, and that includes cases that are not published."
2014.13-1333,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2825.21,2826.685,"That's what my question was, okay."
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2826.685,2831.855,"And, of course, it's important to emphasize, we're not just talking about the problem of a third strike reversal."
2014.13-1333,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2856.24,2867.18,"Then answer Judge Easterbook's point, which is, when the fourth case comes in, the court is just not granting IFP."
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2877.995,2887.93,"Well, what usually happens is what happened in this very case; namely, that the court says, I'm not granting you IFP status and I'm going to dismiss your case if you don't pay the filing fee."
2014.13-1333,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2904.695,2911.255,Do you -- do you have to file -- pay a filing fee to go with a 60(b) motion? Is that a separate proceeding?
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2911.255,2917.95,"My understanding is that there's a circuit split as to whether if you're denied IFP status, you nevertheless are still on the hook for the filing fee."
2014.13-1333,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2917.95,2920.845,"Well, that would really make your position complicated."
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2920.845,2940.915,"Your Honor, I think if you are a prisoner who's three strikes barred and you still want to file a fourth suit, there might be some consequence; namely, that you might be on the hook if that third strike is ultimately affirmed, as most third strikes are. I'd like to address also the point that Petitioner makes that his position is much more easily administered."
2014.13-1333,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3036.22,3046.165,"And just to be clear, Mr. Kedem, if we say, you know, we're not buying this prior occasion thing, does your -- does the rest of your position stay your position?"
2014.13-1333,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3046.165,3046.79,It does.
2014.13-1333,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3076.015,3079.455,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam, you have four minutes left."
2014.13-1333,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3079.455,3091.935,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice: Justice Kennedy asked Mr. Lindstrom whether the inconsistency between Respondent's position and the Federal government's position undercuts the whole argument here, and we would respectfully say that it does."
2014.13-1333,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3169.17,3171.98,Including strikes in Federal courts?
2014.13-1333,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3171.98,3173.24,Some States do.
2014.13-1333,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3308.72,3318.905,"In that connection, before your time runs out, can a case be final on -- can a case be final on appeal if there is a -- an appeal pending but the notice of appeal is untimely?"
2014.13-1333,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3318.905,3329.79,"We believe that in that circumstance, it probably would be until the Court of Appeals disposes of the case, because the Court of Appeals would, typically, eventually dismiss the appeal as untimely."
2014.13-1333,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3336.48,3344.31,So a prisoner could at least temporarily put some of these strikes in abeyance by filing untimely notices of appeal.
2014.13-1333,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3344.31,3351.655,"And I suppose that a court, if a court believed that that was a serious problem, could construe the finality rule differently."
2014.13-1333,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3363.84,0.0,"Thank you, Counsel. Case is submitted."
