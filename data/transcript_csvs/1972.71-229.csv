1972.71-229,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.236,"We will hear argument first in Number 71-229, United States against Dionisio."
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,19.486,22.714,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-229,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,650.634,659.901,"But that’s a -- if there's no invasion of either the Fourth and Fifth Amendment, you don’t even get to this question of what kind of a proceeding is involved here?"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,659.901,660.492,Yes sir.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,731.028,732.75,"But this is not a testimony, is it?"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,732.75,733.491,Well it is.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,735.011,735.3,"Well, I thought you said that --"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,735.3,737.89,It’s not testimonial -- pardon me.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,737.89,744.306,I thought you said this was done out -- was to be done outside of the grand jury room by an agent of the grand jury.
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,744.306,746.336,That was the procedure that was contemplated.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,747.07,749.096,"Well, is that a testimony?"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,749.096,749.491,Yes sir.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,751.813,759.989,"Well, I thought all these provisions you're talking about that have never disputed and all, that’s testimony before a grand jury, isn’t it?"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,759.989,762.146,"Well, I can answer that question --"
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.146,763.039,Good!
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,763.039,774.934,"-- by saying that the petition that the Government filed and the order that was entered in both of these cases did not require that the evidence and the testimony, if you will, be given outside the grand jury room."
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,784.612,793.205,"Well, would this man be ever refused to testify in the grand jury room pursuant to subpoena by the grand jury?"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,793.205,796.65,"He was asked that he would give exemplars, and he refused on Fourth and Fifth Amendment grounds."
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,796.65,808.666,"Now, this is not the -- I think you understand what I’m talking about, did he ever refuse to testify before the grand jury pursuant to a grand jury subpoena?"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,808.666,813.22,"My answer to that question and I don’t think it’s evasive, it’s that yes."
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,824.473,826.935,Do you think an exemplar is testimony?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,826.935,828.482,"Well, it’s testimony in the sense that --"
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,828.482,830.762,Is it or is it not?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,830.762,834.528,"Well, I can’t answer yes or no and be fair to the Court."
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,843.31,845.168,In the presence of the grand jury?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,845.168,845.557,Yes.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,845.87,849.891,But what did he refuse to do in the presence of the grand jury?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,849.891,850.936,He can refuse --
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,850.936,853.201,What did this man refuse to do?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,853.201,854.956,He refused to give an exemplar.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,854.956,856.982,In the presence of a grand jury?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,856.982,857.323,Yes sir.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,859.101,867.295,"But what did the grand jury -- how did this come up? Did the grand jury called him in and say, “We want you to testify.”"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,867.295,878.255,"The grand jury called him, explained that he was a potential defendant and that he had Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, and asked him whether he would give a voice exemplar if ordered to give one."
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,911.037,924.277,"Suppose the grand jury said, “Mr. Dionisio, whatever your name is, we order you to go into the other room and give a statement to an FBI agent.”"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,926.764,930.124,"Well, there we have a Fifth Amendment problem."
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,930.633,934.522,What’s the difference between that and this?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,934.522,943.441,"Well, we’re talking here about evidence which I believe the grand jury was entitled lawfully to compel Mr. Dionisio to give in the grand jury room and the fact that --"
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,943.441,948.054,"But would you still -- we keep you saying, “In the grand jury room.”"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,948.054,953.753,"The alternative procedure that was set up here was not a condition, on the government’s part, it made no difference."
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,953.753,959.878,"Well, did he -- did he, at any time, refuse to make these statements in the grand jury room?"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,959.878,970.274,"He was asked to refer -- to the grand jury testimony, he was asked whether he would give voice exemplars, and he said, “No” and he claimed the Fourth and Fifth Amendment --"
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,970.274,972.294,Was that in the grand jury room?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,972.294,975.031,"After he was told what the procedure was, he was asked whether he could give exemplars."
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,975.031,979.077,"Well, then he never refused to testify in the grand jury room?"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,979.077,980.427,"No sir, no, because at the hearing --"
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,980.427,988.413,Did he ever refuse to make -- to read these figures and numbers and horses’ names in the grand jury room?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,988.413,989.334,Yes sir.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1036.498,1042.239,"Well, what -- he didn’t refuse to answer any questions in the grand jury room, did he?"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1042.239,1047.279,"Well, he refused, while in the grand jury room, to give exemplars."
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1047.279,1049.75,Did he refuse any questions?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1049.75,1063.387,"No, the only evidence that he was asked to give in the grand jury room by the grand jury was the exemplars."
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1136.634,1139.379,"Well, the occurrence of 19 witnesses doesn’t affect this case at all?"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1139.379,1139.754,No sir.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1159.859,1161.304,Who was the agent?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1161.304,1168.453,He was an agent of the FBI sworn by the grand jury to receive these exemplars and then to testify what further processing they received.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1168.453,1172.748,"So it’s like -- my hypothetical, you'd go down the hall, and talk to an FBI agent."
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1172.748,1173.49,No sir.
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1173.49,1173.509,What's the difference?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1173.509,1175.015,We have a clear Fifth Amendment problem there.
1972.71-229,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.305,1211.724,"Would you turn it or turn your attention at least to the bottom of Page 9 of the Appendix where Mr. Dionisio, after being asked the question, said, “I refuse to give any voice exemplar based on the rights guaranteed me under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.”"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1214.615,1226.119,"That was inside the grand jury room and that’s the thrust of my position that his refusal was categorical just like the refusal in the Bryan case, which is also a contempt case."
1972.71-229,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1244.325,1246.887,Where is that in the Appendix?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1246.887,1249.336,That appears in the transcript.
1972.71-229,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1256.776,1271.335,"Mr. Lacovara, the Chief Justice was reading on Page 9 and then again on Page 10; Answer: “I refuse to give a voice exemplar based on the rights guaranteed me under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.”"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1271.335,1272.123,Yes sir.
1972.71-229,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1272.123,1273.49,No qualification whatsoever?
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1273.49,1275.009,Absolutely none.
1972.71-229,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1454.37,1466.174,"Do you suppose a grand jury could tell a man that, “To go to that table and put your fingerprints on each -- on that ink pad, we want the fingerprint of every one of your fingers?”"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1466.174,1476.368,"Well, we’d have a slightly different analysis, because of the reasonable expectation of privacy, but I’d be prepared to say the grand jury could insist on that too."
1972.71-229,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1554.364,1564.524,"In other words, it’s your submission as I understand it that the compulsory giving of fingerprints is not of itself a violation of either the Fourth or the Fifth Amendment?"
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1564.524,1565.11,Not of it self.
1972.71-229,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1565.11,1570.211,And that the rationale of Davis was that this was done during an unlawful detention which violated the Fourth Amendment.
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1570.211,1570.782,Yes sir.
1972.71-229,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1576.878,1581.33,"And that here there is no unlawful detention, there is merely a summoning of a person before the grand jury."
1972.71-229,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1582.112,1584.235,That’s our position.
1972.71-229,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1587.789,1593.353,Very well Mr. Lacovara.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1595.96,1602.449,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1738.379,1740.444,Is that case the in the Seventh Circuit now?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1740.444,1742.088,It is in the Seventh Circuit as of --
1972.71-229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1742.088,1742.775,Has it been argued?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1742.775,1754.297,"Briefs are filed -- it is has not been set for argument it is anticipated Mr. Justice Brennan that that case will be argued in January, in the January session of the Court."
1972.71-229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.297,1756.979,At the risk of repeating --
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1756.979,1757.177,"Yes, we would guess so."
1972.71-229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1757.177,1759.799,Would you summarize again on what happened with this other man?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1759.799,1761.73,I most certainly will.
1972.71-229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1775.62,1778.193,Same opinion.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1778.193,1790.86,"Subsequent to the filing of the petition for certiorari, Mr. Smith along with approximately 18 or 19 others was indicted by this special February 1971 grand jury."
1972.71-229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1838.615,1841.039,"Well, is Mr. Dionisio one of those who made that motion?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1841.039,1843.16,Mr. Dionisio was never indicted by this special grand jury.
1972.71-229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1843.16,1843.621,Oh no!
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1847.121,1849.341,That is correct; that is correct.
1972.71-229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1849.341,1851.337,And that was -- those were motions to suppress.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1851.337,1851.661,Motions to suppress.
1972.71-229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1851.661,1853.614,And they were upheld by the District Court.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1853.614,1856.472,By the District Court after indictment.
1972.71-229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1856.472,1857.307,Right.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1859.315,1860.09,The government appealed that.
1972.71-229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1860.09,1861.695,And that’s not pending in the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1861.695,1874.782,It is pending in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and it’s reflected in the -- that is reflected in my brief under the statement on Page 3 that it’s pending in the Court of Appeals --
1972.71-229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1874.782,1878.526,"But so far, I gather, Mr. Dionisio has never raised this point?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1878.526,1897.263,"No he had -- well, was he was not given, he -- no, he has not raised the point, assuming just for the purposes of argument that this Court holds that Mr. Dionisio was not protected under the Fourth Amendment just to give voice exemplars per se."
1972.71-229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1917.937,1921.873,"Or if this Court sustains his contempt conviction, how does he do that?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1921.873,1923.161,No Your Honor.
1972.71-229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1952.165,1959.724,"But if this Court reverses to Seventh Circuit, will that not reinstate the judgment, the contempt conviction?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1959.724,1965.993,"I think it would Your Honor, I would Your Honor but I think then Mr. Dionisio would have other collateral proceedings available to him."
1972.71-229,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1965.993,1969.608,"Would you mean he could go the grand jury, he’d --"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1969.608,1977.482,"Go to the grand jury and again refuse to give the exemplars, I think he have to do that on other grounds, on another grounds."
1972.71-229,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1977.482,1983.129,"Saying in effect he would give them say, for the unconstitutional obtaining of the evidence for --"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,1983.129,1999.093,"Without binding -- Your Honor again, I -- looking into the future as to what I would do or what his counsel at that time would do, I would assume that our -- a procedure similar to that would have to be followed in order to protect his record, and to comply with the order of this Court."
1972.71-229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1999.093,2006.498,"Mr. Crowley, you are not suggesting, are you that this issue which you’ve been discussing is before the Court on the present record?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2006.498,2014.401,"No I’m not, no I’m not Your Honor, no I’m not."
1972.71-229,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2141.133,2150.512,"Well, haven’t the grand jury powers traditionally been one of the broadest powers that are possessed by government?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2150.512,2188.115,"Mr. Chief Justice they have in the sense of their -- the broadness of the scope of the investigation, the admissibility before the grand jury of hearsay evidences carried by this Court in Costello and many other cases that the grand jury may -- its investigation may take many, many different channels and go in many, many different areas, but still the grand jury must -- the grand jury in its investigation cannot, because it wishes to investigate, cannot violate the privileges under the Fourth Amendment."
1972.71-229,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2188.221,2202.097,"But didn’t the Davis case turn on the fact that Davis’ fingerprints were taken when he was in custody illegally and here, is it not a distinction unless you claim --"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2202.097,2202.56,I think --
1972.71-229,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2202.56,2206.03,"-- that unless you claim that, he is illegally before the grand jury."
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2206.03,2209.591,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think it is a distinction without a difference."
1972.71-229,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2210.189,2212.872,"Well, the Davis case turned on that distinction, so how can you say it’s without a difference?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2212.872,2229.6,But I think in this case -- if this Court -- if we take that analogy then all that would have been required in Davis to legalize the grand jury are or the fingerprint.
1972.71-229,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.001,2423.215,"Mr. Crowley, I take it, you wouldn’t say that probable cause is required for either a grand jury or a counsel if trying a case before a petty jury to follow a particular line of inquiry where the witness were all that is being sized ordinarily -- ordinary oral question and answer testimony."
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2423.215,2443.334,"No, it is not probable cause but it must be questions that are relevant in material to the inquiry and there must be some showing of relevancy in materiality to the issues at trial before the court will allow counsel to question into an area that does not have immediate appearance of relevance."
1972.71-229,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.334,2445.332,How about before a grand jury?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2451.446,2460.803,I think there Your Honor we are seeking solely to testimony and absent a Fifth Amendment question.
1972.71-229,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.311,2471.231,"Your argument turns on the difference between a voiceprint, an ordinary question and answer testimony."
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2471.231,2473.102,I think there is a substantial difference.
1972.71-229,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2473.102,2476.552,"Well, is it critical to the case you’re making here?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2476.552,2478.74,Yes it is.
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2478.74,2490.7,Well assuming that the testimony before the grand jury is taken down on tape and then tested what would you do then?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2490.7,2515.926,"Then, there is another problem that maybe presented, there may be a violation of the Fourth Amendment if the grand jury, if it can be established, I think that we have here, that there was no reasonable grounds to bring this man before the grand jury and he was only called before the grand jury not asked any substantive questions in the regard to their investigation but merely as a (Voice Overlap) to obtain --"
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2515.926,2523.104,Or do you have a right to challenge -- do you have a right challenge the reason a person is brought before the grand jury?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2523.104,2529.031,"Not the -- not eliminate, no you do not."
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2541.466,2545.317,"My question for -- very simple, which I like an answer to it."
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2545.317,2546.331,I’m sorry Mr. Justice.
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2546.331,2552.836,"Your subpoena before a grand jury, do you have any redress other than to appear?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2552.836,2554.616,"I do not believe, you do know."
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2554.616,2568.229,"And when you appear, they ask you your name and address and that is taken down on tape and examined, what is your complaint?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2568.229,2585.272,I do not believe that we would be faced here with the voiceprint type of identification because my understanding of the voiceprint that this would -- taking your voice down on tape would not give the necessary fidelity that would allow comparison to the other (Voice Overlap) --
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2585.272,2588.12,My assumption was it could be done.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2590.575,2596.66,I think the complaint would be similar to the complaint here that if the witness --
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2596.66,2597.667,You'd moved to strike the grand jury admitting to something?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2597.667,2617.742,"Yes, move the sub -- no I couldn’t -- I couldn’t do anything then Your Honor but if I were subsequently indicted and this evidence that I gave before the grand jury was sought to be used against me for the purposes of that identification rather than used against me as is common for the --"
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2617.742,2620.944,But could you move to quash the indictment?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2620.944,2623.126,I don’t think I could move to quash the indictment Your Honor.
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2625.805,2633.137,So the only difference between this case and the hypothetical is that they asked him to go outside and do it.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2633.137,2634.469,"No Your Honor, it is not."
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.469,2635.764,What is the other difference?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2635.764,2636.402,There is not.
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2656.139,2660.766,"Well, in my case, if he didn’t answer the question, what would happen to him?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2660.766,2667.762,"In this -- in your case, he could take the Fifth Amendment and I don’t think there would be a -- I think it’ll be a perfectly valid claim of the Fifth Amendment."
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2667.762,2671.994,"Well, if you had anything, if he didn’t answer the question he goes to jail."
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2671.994,2674.333,In this case he would not and you’re hypothetically correct.
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2674.333,2675.22,That’s right.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2682.544,2699.066,"Well, Your Honor I think under the Fourth Amendment that the physical identifying characteristics such as in Schmerber versus California recognized that the taking of the blood sample was protected under the Fourth Amendment."
1972.71-229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2861.82,2862.499,How about it --
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2862.888,2863.113,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2863.113,2870.855,What if the grand jury asked the witness to bring before to roll up his sleeves so they could see whether or not he had a tattoo on his upper arm?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2870.855,2874.945,I think that’d be the physical characteristics as just as his face.
1972.71-229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2874.945,2876.958,So that would require an act of will.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2876.958,2903.125,"It would react in -- well, that would be such as the person putting on a coat to see if a coat fits it which has been approved by this Court but I think Your Honor that they go to things such as that go to a -- to a mere physical characteristics of a person."
1972.71-229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2905.349,2911.896,Could ask him to strip down to his shorts to see if he had something on his back or chest?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2911.896,2913.751,"This -- possibly be done, yes."
1972.71-229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2919.435,2920.749,"Well, I said, “Strip down to his shorts.”"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2920.749,2921.668,Right.
1972.71-229,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2977.138,2978.08,Well of course --
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,2978.08,2978.519,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1972.71-229,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2978.519,3001.603,"-- or perhaps I’m pursuing into an area where neither you nor I at least, certainly I don’t know very much but certainly what one technique of narcosynthesis and psychotherapy is administration of pentathol or something like that to get a man to speak where he does not in fact want to and where his unconscious takes over."
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3010.978,3046.428,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I -- but it's certainly an area beyond my expertise but it is my understanding just generally that the speaking, there is a speaking of with the release of all inhibitions and to speak what is in the subconscious, to answer questions that are in this -- that the answers to which are in the subconscious and that the man in answering the question will not color his answer and theoretically will speak the truth to the question put."
1972.71-229,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3127.63,3139.054,Do you make any point to the fact that the grand jury had directed the exercise to be carried outside of the courtroom?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3139.054,3141.804,"No I don’t, no I don't Your Honor that that --"
1972.71-229,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3141.804,3149.657,"He had refused while he was in the grand jury room and the refusal outside was merely a repetition, was it not?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3149.657,3168.318,I think the record here is this as the Solicitor points out would indicate that the witness when he appeared before the grand jury refused to testify in the grand jury and at in -- he was never requested to give the exemplars in front of the grand jury per se.
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3199.124,3207.394,"So your whole point is if you talked to the grand jury, you’ll say anything and answer any question but you’ll not give an exemplar?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3207.394,3208.624,"No, no Your Honor."
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3208.624,3211.189,Before the grand jury?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3212.04,3213.078,"No, no Your Honor."
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3214.21,3214.948,So what is your --
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3214.948,3215.887,That is pure expectation.
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3215.887,3218.363,"Well, then you please tell me what your point is?"
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3218.363,3234.803,"The point is this that the compelling of a witness before the grand jury is the position of this respondent, to give identifying characteristics which are normally not exposed to public view is protected by the Fourth Amendment."
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3234.803,3239.156,Exemplify and character is his talking?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3239.156,3239.907,"His voice, that is correct."
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3239.907,3243.397,His voice which he has been using in the grand jury.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3243.397,3245.478,"He has been using them in the grand jury but Justice, he has --"
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3245.478,3248.14,He has been using it in the grand jury.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3248.314,3248.857,Mr. Justice Marshall --
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3248.857,3254.117,But he does not allow the grand jury to make an exemplar out of it.
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3254.117,3254.685,Just as he is bringing his --
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3254.685,3255.775,Is that your point?
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3255.775,3286.272,He is bringing his fingerprints into the grand jury also but without having placed the fingerprints on an inkpad and then transferred them to another pad for the purposes of expert comparison that no comparison can be made and the same is true with the voice and as I understand the procedure that to obtain voice exemplars for any comparison to be made and whether -- and we don’t raise the question here of the validity of such experiments.
1972.71-229,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3316.873,3319.895,(Inaudible).
1972.71-229,1,29390,john_powers_crowley,,3319.895,3320.679,I don’t.
1972.71-229,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3325.131,3327.394,Thank you Mr. Crowley.
1972.71-229,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3330.494,3334.298,Yes two points Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-229,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3383.942,3386.949,And that can be done in the grand jury room?
1972.71-229,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3386.949,3387.067,Yes sir.
1972.71-229,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3387.067,3392.087,Or outside the grand jury room depending on whether or not the witness wants a lawyer present.
1972.71-229,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3392.087,3393.054,Yes sir.
1972.71-229,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3532.047,3534.083,And in that sense violating the statute?
1972.71-229,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3534.083,3536.93,In that sense as the District Courts found violate the statute.
1972.71-229,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3536.93,3541.229,"Suppose that should ultimately prevail, what happens to this case?"
1972.71-229,2,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3541.229,3556.502,"I think counsel’s argument is a very reasonable one that if the District Court is ultimately sustained in suppressing the evidence of the 25, 15 would preclude the use by the government of this evidence before the grand jury."
1972.71-229,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3557.296,3558.435,Thank you Mr. Lacovara.
