1985.84-1480,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.825,We will hear arguments next in Wainwright against Greenfield.
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,10.793,20.82,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, respondent David Greenfield was convicted in a jury trial of sexually battery committed with force likely to cause serious personal injury."
1985.84-1480,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,192.015,200.436,"All these times when he said he wanted a lawyer, did they tell him that if he couldn't afford one, one would be appointed for him?"
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,200.436,202.653,"--Yes, they gave the traditional--"
1985.84-1480,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,202.653,209.618,"I said, after he said he wanted a lawyer, did they than say we will give you a lawyer if you don't have one?"
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,209.618,210.29,"--Yes, they did."
1985.84-1480,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,210.29,213.711,"They said that, or just in the form of Miranda?"
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,218.116,230.5,"And they advised him... at the police station he said that he would like to speak to an attorney, and they contacted the public defender's office for him, and he was indeed able to speak to an attorney from the public defender's office."
1985.84-1480,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,230.5,233.218,Was he told that?
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,233.218,236.451,"As part of the standard warnings, and then he did--"
1985.84-1480,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,236.451,240.887,"Outside of the standard warning, did they tell him that they would get him a lawyer?"
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,244.09,247.103,--Not in so many words.
1985.84-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,454.644,483.211,"Ms. Paschall, just reviewing the quotation that the Eleventh Circuit made on Pages A9, All of the brief, petitioner's brief on jurisdiction, a lot of the prosecutor's references there strike me as not having been addressed to the defendant's silence at all coupled to his behavior before he ever received the Miranda warning."
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,488.693,495.644,I think quite probably some of it would come in under Doyle.
1985.84-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,509.591,514.932,"But that really just boils down to a couple of sentences of the prosecutor's argument, doesn't it?"
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,514.932,515.714,--It really does.
1985.84-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,515.714,518.665,Not the whole thing relied on by the Eleventh Circuit.
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,518.665,520.977,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1480,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.977,531.208,"Well, isn't one of the events that is the most meaningful, I gather, with respect to the insanity defense is that he asked for a lawyer?"
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,531.208,533.8,He asked for a lawyer--
1985.84-1480,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.8,534.642,That is hardly silence.
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,534.642,537.002,--That is hardly silence.
1985.84-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,755.694,763.082,What business is it of a federal court to decide whether evidence in a state criminal proceeding is relevant or not?
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,763.082,769.86,"Your Honor, we submit that that is part of the reason why the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is in error."
1985.84-1480,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,793.289,803.799,"Do you suppose the Court of Appeals didn't understand which kind of a case they were reviewing, and they think they were reviewing a trial in the District Court rather than the state court?"
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,803.799,808.843,"Your Honor, I was at that argument in the Court of Appeals."
1985.84-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,846.408,850.094,May I ask this question?
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,860.949,862.041,That is true.
1985.84-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.041,864.93,So the state court did not balance the way you suggest.
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,864.93,866.836,That is true.
1985.84-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.991,999.016,"Do you respond to your opponent's argument that since the Appellate Court, I guess after the Florida Supreme Court had it, they sent it back to the Appellate Court, and then they decided it on the merits."
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,1005.17,1020.337,"We argue that, and I guess our argument in response to that... first, to answer your question, yes, if the state court addresses it on the merits without addressing it in the alternative, it would cure the Wainwright v. Sikes problem."
1985.84-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1079.641,1089.09,"I really don't understand why they would do that if they thought that it was... if there wasn't a problem on the merits, why would they ask the appellate court to take a second look at it."
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,1092.369,1093.197,"Yes, they did."
1985.84-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1093.197,1099.195,"And so what they did is, your view is, they sent it back to say, isn't there a different reason for ruling in favor of the prosecutor?"
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,1099.195,1100.554,Yes.
1985.84-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.554,1102.413,Appellate Courts generally don't do that.
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,1102.413,1110.753,And we are left to some extent with speculation on precisely what the motivation was there.
1985.84-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.753,1121.857,"But I suppose at the time you filed your brief on the merits in the Court of Appeals, that is, the Federal Court of Appeals, the reason you didn't argue Wainwright against Sikes must have been that you thought the Appellate Court had addressed the merits."
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,1121.857,1125.294,The reason--
1985.84-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.294,1130.495,I shouldn't speculate that.
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,1130.495,1143.724,"--The reason we didn't argue Wainwright versus Sikes was, we did not and we made a judgment call at that time."
1985.84-1480,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.854,1225.081,"But what they said in their footnote was that the Florida District Courts of Appeals' willingness to address the merits solves the problem, and I think you agree with that if they did in fact address the merits, so the question is only whether they addressed the merits or not, isn't it, not whether they stated the law incorrectly."
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,1237.827,1239.28,"Yes, he did."
1985.84-1480,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1239.702,1241.606,"And you had ten days to object, and did not."
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,1241.606,1242.823,--Yes.
1985.84-1480,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1270.313,1284.979,"Even if it is a legal conclusion, we usually lead to terminations as to what a Florida court did to, you know, a magistrate or a District Court that sits in Florida, or a Court of Appeals opinion written by a judge from Jacksonville."
1985.84-1480,0,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,1284.979,1290.539,"That is frequently true, Your Honor."
1985.84-1480,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1303.722,1310.469,Mr. Whittemore.
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1310.469,1331.788,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, why we are here is because a state a prosecutor chose to take advantage of a defendant's exercise of his constitutional rights, to infer to the jury that there is some meaning to that exercise."
1985.84-1480,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1331.788,1335.287,"There was no objection to the testimony when it went in, was there?"
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1335.287,1337.957,"There was no objection, and the trial--"
1985.84-1480,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1337.957,1341.488,Then what could be objectionable about talking about it later?
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1341.488,1355.888,"--There is a distinction, Your Honor, between the mere testimony that the man remained silent and asked for an attorney and the use of that silence, the use of that constitutional right which has been exercised to draw meaning."
1985.84-1480,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1386.47,1396.06,Was there a request then by the judge to go back and strike that testimony and instruct the jury to disregard the testimony?
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1396.06,1397.449,"Unfortunately, we don't know."
1985.84-1480,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1402.479,1411.302,"If such a claim was made, the counsel could assert that it was made in an off the record bench conference, could he not?"
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1411.302,1412.114,Yes.
1985.84-1480,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1428.733,1438.605,"Since the issue here is the conduct post-Miranda warning, let me ask you a hypothetical question which may or may not have any relevance."
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1484.79,1485.131,Absolutely.
1985.84-1480,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1485.131,1486.444,Admissible?
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1486.444,1489.318,He has waived his Fifth Amendment rights by speaking to the officer.
1985.84-1480,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1497.955,1499.549,Suppose he said that before he got the Miranda warning.
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1499.549,1506.217,"Well, the recent opinions of this Court suggest that the Mirandizing is a significant point in time."
1985.84-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1555.448,1556.385,What about his request for a lawyer?
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1556.385,1557.885,"--That, Your Honor--"
1985.84-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.885,1559.321,That is not silence.
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1559.321,1571.847,"--I would suggest that a reading of Edwards versus Arizona suggests that when a defendant requests an attorney, that is a per se exercise of his Fifth Amendment right, and that is in that opinion, and I agree with it very strongly."
1985.84-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.847,1574.284,"I know, but it isn't silence."
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1574.284,1584.436,"It is not silence, but it is the exercise, the invocation of that right to silence, and that is also protected by the prophylactic protection of Miranda."
1985.84-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.513,1599.587,"Well, suppose they give him his Miranda warnings, and they start asking him some questions, he never asks for a lawyer, he answers this question, and then he answers that one, and then he was asked another question."
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1619.797,1625.764,"I think a reading of the Edwards case in Miranda suggests that, yes, he can selectively choose to answer--"
1985.84-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.764,1629.495,"Well, I know, but could they point out that he refused to answer some questions?"
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1629.495,1633.995,--Under one circumstances only... one circumstance only.
1985.84-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1633.995,1644.833,"The question is whether he had sense enough to answer some and not answer others, and can they introduce the whole question and answer session?"
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1644.833,1653.079,I think it depends more that the defendant takes the stand during his trial and testifies inconsistently with what occurred in that scenario.
1985.84-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.094,1660.514,You don't think they could use it to prove that he was sane.
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1660.514,1669.948,"--No, sir, and the reason for that, and this... we tread upon or venture into the evidentiary issue here, and I don't think it is a proper issue for this Court to address."
1985.84-1480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.036,1698.108,"Would you then say that the Eleventh Circuit's discussion of lack of relevance here is just unnecessary to its opinion even... the issue is, no matter how relevant, it still can't come in."
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1698.108,1712.54,"I think that opinion addressed the ambiguity of silence because Doyle addressed at length, but a close reading of Doyle is clear, it shows that the court turned on the Fifth Amendment fundamental fairness issue, and not so much the ambiguity."
1985.84-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.172,1738.092,"Well, it did more than say... it did more than say it is ambiguous."
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1743.824,1749.135,"--In this case it is absolutely irrelevant, because the experts tell us and the amicus briefs--"
1985.84-1480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1749.135,1751.024,You say it is absolutely relevant or absolutely irrelevant.
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1751.024,1753.664,"--Irrelevant, is my point, the silence."
1985.84-1480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.664,1756.305,That is what this Court... that is what the Eleventh Circuit said.
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1767.112,1770.83,"No, sir, but it was the function of the Eleventh Circuit to apply Doyle, and the two--"
1985.84-1480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.83,1778.138,Do you say that Doyle establishes the rule that federal courts decide what evidence is admissible and relevant in a state trial?
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1778.138,1781.121,"--No, sir, I do not suggest that at all."
1985.84-1480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1800.412,1801.879,The Court of Appeals went much further than that.
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1812.266,1815.638,"I think the reason the Court did that, Your Honor, and I agree--"
1985.84-1480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1815.638,1816.451,Do you defend its doing that?
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1816.451,1817.232,--Pardon me?
1985.84-1480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.232,1818.496,Do you defend its doing that?
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1818.496,1847.938,"Yes, sir, I do, because I think it had to draw the distinction between those cases which have been decided where there is a pre-Miranda silence and the Court has allowed impeachment of the testifying defendant by that silence on the basis that the silence prior to Miranda was so inconsistent with the testimony during trial that it was proper impeachment, and the Eleventh Circuit necessarily had to address that to explain why in this instance silence is not inconsistent with that defense--"
1985.84-1480,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.938,1856.685,"Well, but if you take a look... perhaps you have the opinion in mind, the long quotation from the prosecutor that the Eleventh Circuit has fairly early in its opinion."
1985.84-1480,1,33408,james_d_whittemore,,1880.425,1886.876,"--That is because, Your Honor, the case of Doyle addressed it, and I think the Eleventh Circuit--"
1985.84-1480,2,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,3077.923,3082.078,I think two things.
1985.84-1480,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.741,3113.035,Is it correct that in that case they construed the federal question the same way the Eleventh Circuit did?
1985.84-1480,2,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,3113.035,3113.784,--Yes.
1985.84-1480,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.538,3360.934,"What would you say if Miranda warnings were never give and he was interrogated and they wanted to use the statements to prove sanity, and the reason they want to use them is, they seem... anybody would conclude that this is very relevant as to his competence, but he never was given a--"
1985.84-1480,2,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,3360.934,3376.178,"Your Honor, I am not... of course, those facts are somewhat different from these."
1985.84-1480,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3386.174,3401.417,"--But if disproving the insanity defense is just completely different from guilt or innocence, why would you draw a distinction?"
1985.84-1480,2,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,3401.417,3428.907,"--I am not sure that... if I would draw a distinction, I would note that we certainly still have an attempt to abide by the Miranda decision, and whatever deterrent effect Miranda has on police misconduct, and excluding that type of evidence when the police have violated Miranda might or might not be appropriate."
1985.84-1480,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3428.907,3430.594,All right.
1985.84-1480,2,16687,ann_carrison_paschall,,3431.812,3433.249,It is not a distinction I am prepared to make.
1985.84-1480,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3436.342,3438.216,"Thank you, counsel."
