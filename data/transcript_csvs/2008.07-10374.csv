2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.754,"We will hear argument next in Case 07-10374, Haywood v. Drown."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,7.92,26.281,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In a 4-3 decision, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed Correction Law section 24, which prohibits Petitioner from bringing a section 1983 claim for money damages in any court of the State of New York."
2008.07-10374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,65.292,71.679,It does provide for a waiver of sovereign immunity and says that the State will respond in damages.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,83.57,92.426,"Your Honor, it is true that the State has waived sovereign immunity for claims brought in the court of claims under that State law."
2008.07-10374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,119.493,123.862,"Well, we can just mark that place in the record."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,136.455,146.644,"Your -- Your Honor, there may be -- reasonable minds I think could differ about whether it's preferable to have the State as a solvent entity or the -- or the prison employee as a defendant."
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,165.905,171.092,"Well, except -- they said except in cases where the guards are acting outside the scope of their employment."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,171.092,171.709,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-10374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,229.88,232.332,"He can still get that in Federal court, can't he?"
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,232.332,242.954,"Your Honor, it's -- Justice Scalia, it's absolutely true that Mr. Haywood could bring his case in Federal court and would be entitled to all the remedies available under section 1983, had he brought it in Federal court."
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,260.816,262.518,I guess there's a difference.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,301.393,314.867,"Your Honor, under this Court's decisions not only in Felder but going back to Martinez, this Court has said that -- that it hasn't decided whether a State is required to create a court to hear Federal claims."
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,334.698,344.637,"Yeah, but they're not really -- or at least you can view it as they are not discriminating against the Federal cause of action, because they don't allow the State cause of action of the sort you want to pursue either."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,344.637,347.589,"--Your Honor, that seems to be the crux of the Respondents' argument."
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,373.823,375.189,"Well, that's -- that's true."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,404.758,407.71,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think there are a couple of points on that."
2008.07-10374,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,446.716,448.501,That's not how it moves through the courts.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,480.87,484.238,"Justice Ginsburg, I think -- I think that that's exactly right."
2008.07-10374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,575.727,590.32,"Suppose the -- the New York legislature said, you have a choice, you can bring a 1983 suit or you can bring this sort of suit against the State, and the State will respond to damages, but you can't do both."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,591.02,593.771,"No, Your Honor, I don't think they could."
2008.07-10374,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,610.05,628.012,"What Justice Kennedy has asked you: Say, you could have this Federal claim, but we are going to offer you a substitute under New York law, which the Federal authority could not force us to do, because it's a State waiving its sovereign immunity."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,628.012,634.415,"I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg; certainly the State of New York could offer a State law alternative in addition to section 1983."
2008.07-10374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.415,635.281,"No, no."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,636.198,636.867,Okay.
2008.07-10374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,649.925,650.475,All right.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,666.351,667.534,"No, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-10374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,679.507,683.709,"But it's okay for the State to say, we don't want any tort actions in our courts?"
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,684.709,686.161,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-10374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,686.645,687.228,That's strange.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,705.387,713.01,"--Justice Scalia, I think that the distinction is -- relates to the relative power of Congress and the States."
2008.07-10374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,724.448,727.483,"But -- but not if New York says, we don't want any tort actions."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,740.908,745.528,"Justice Scalia, I -- I'm not sure exactly where the line is in terms of the analogy."
2008.07-10374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,779.333,779.966,I understand that.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,796.378,809.185,"--I think it -- intellectually, Justice Scalia, it seems to me that the distinction is that -- that there has to be a point at which you do respect the relative authority of the State and the Federal Governments."
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,835.67,845.893,"So if this were at the -- the beginning of whenever New York was establishing a court system, and they said from the outset, look, we are not going to hear these types of cases against -- then this would be okay?"
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,845.893,854.333,"Your Honor, I think under this Court's jurisprudence that would -- if the State of New York said, we are not going to hear any kind of tort action regardless of whether it's Federal or State, and it doesn't--"
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,854.333,854.833,"No, no."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,857.368,857.835,--Okay.
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,857.835,863.355,"--is once the court has opened it up to a particular type of claim, they can't say -- say no more."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,875.496,886.434,"As long as -- as long as the withdrawal of jurisdiction was across all analogous State law claims as well as the Federal claim, then, yes."
2008.07-10374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.088,892.105,"No, we would discuss what is analogous."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,892.105,894.64,"--Yes, and that's -- that's a very good point, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-10374,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,918.623,926.678,"Now, why can't New York take the position, we want to be realistic about these suits?"
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,984.384,995.406,"Justice Ginsburg, the -- the problem with that analysis, I think, is that in the court of claims, there are all sorts of other limitations."
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1027.711,1030.663,--So it's done exactly what the Federal system has done.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1043.755,1048.64,"And that's absolutely true, Justice Roberts, if the claim initially were a claim against the State."
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1060.865,1070.823,"Well, but in the Federal system, if you sue a Federal official or a postman and in fact, in reality it's going to be a claim against the United States, that has to go to the court of claims, too."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1070.823,1084.915,"--And Your Honor, that is absolutely something that Congress can decide to do with respect to Federal law, and New York can decide with respect to State law to do whatever it wants in terms of setting up where those claims can go."
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1093.771,1113.75,"I guess my point is that there's nothing fishy about what New York has done here, which leads me to think, well, maybe it's not really discrimination against the Federal claim; it's a rational way to handle claims against the State treasury, just as the Federal system is a rational way to handle claims against the Federal treasury."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1113.75,1136.432,"--Regardless of how rational an idea this is or how good an idea this is, for this Court to adopt a rule that says that once a State disagrees with Congress about how people ought to be liable under a Federal remedy would require this Court in essence to say that the rationale of several of your previous cases could be undone."
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1161.564,1166.784,"Well, that just gets back to our previous colloquy about what jurisdiction is and what it means."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1178.592,1191.15,"--I think that if this Court found that this were a jurisdiction -- a neutral rule of jurisdiction that constituted a valid excuse, that, yes, that would probably -- that would probably undermine my argument significantly."
2008.07-10374,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1235.845,1238.631,Isn't jurisdiction whatever the legislature says it is?
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1248.336,1258.458,"--Justice Alito, I think that jurisdiction -- that to determine whether a rule is jurisdictional requires that this Court look at the purpose and the effect of the underlying statute."
2008.07-10374,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1278.189,1282.058,So what is the -- what is the standard for determining whether it's jurisdictional or not?
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1282.058,1297.317,"Well, Justice Alito, the -- the important points, I think, come out of -- out of Felder: That it is a neutral rule that is applicable to all cases and that is not concerned with the underlying substance of the claim."
2008.07-10374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.66,1321.183,But you -- you've acknowledged that it would be okay and would be a jurisdictional rule if the court -- if the State courts did not entertain tort actions.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1324.635,1331.323,"Well, Your Honor, it goes to the substance of the claim, but it applies generally across all claims."
2008.07-10374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1335.691,1337.893,"Yes, it's picking and choosing tort claims."
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1337.893,1341.845,"--Well, it's picking and choosing tort claims as opposed, I suppose, to contract claims."
2008.07-10374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.845,1342.262,Yes.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1342.262,1347.499,"But it's not, Your Honor, saying: We're going to accept this kind of tort claim but not that kind of tort claim."
2008.07-10374,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1355.319,1358.855,Is there something you add -- you add to your statement of your rule?
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1364.442,1366.394,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-10374,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1367.996,1369.796,Don't just be agreeable to be agreeable.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1371.614,1384.005,"--I think, Your Honor -- I'd have to get the exact language from Felder, but I think that it is a neutral rule regarding the administration of the courts that is unrelated to the underlying substance of the matter or the nature of the parties."
2008.07-10374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1447.196,1452.316,You are being generous when you said that we would recall -- at least that I would recall the case.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1454.184,1456.134,"In Johnson v. Fankell, I believe--"
2008.07-10374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1456.134,1456.903,It was Johnson.
2008.07-10374,0,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,1457.736,1458.086,--Yes.
2008.07-10374,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1527.567,1528.367,"Thank you, Mr. Murtagh."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1532.869,1551.265,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Constitution permits State courts to hear Federal claims, but it does not require a State to hear them so long as the State does not discriminate against Federal claims in comparison with similar State claims."
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1565.942,1581.034,"Ms. Underwood, if that's going to be the criterion, that they exclude a State cause of action as readily as they exclude a Federal cause of action, then isn't the State always going to win every case in which there is an issue like this one?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1611.737,1613.42,"Well, that's not so."
2008.07-10374,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1641.22,1642.772,"Well, suppose a State extends--"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1642.772,1643.422,--the Court--
2008.07-10374,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1643.422,1650.659,--Suppose a State extends sovereign immunity to a broad class of State employees with reference to State law claims.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1656.146,1656.813,--No.
2008.07-10374,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1657.463,1658.765,--against those same defendants?
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1658.765,1659.248,--No.
2008.07-10374,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1667.371,1669.854,"Well, what if they phrase it in terms of jurisdiction?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1689.367,1704.794,"If -- if they not only used the word ""jurisdiction"" but gave the rule jurisdictional effect -- that is to say, a jurisdictional bar is one that can't be waived by the defendants; whereas, immunity can be waived."
2008.07-10374,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1708.013,1728.676,"Ms. Underwood, there's a feature of this case, even assuming that you were right about -- New York has not withdrawn jurisdiction from its courts over a 1983 claim; it has simply limited, taken away, one mode of relief."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1767.099,1769.365,"--Well, it's not just any form of relief."
2008.07-10374,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1807.724,1819.798,"Practically -- practically, hasn't what New York has done is to confer on its correctional officers absolute immunity, not merely qualified immunity?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1834.542,1837.577,--I don't think it's immunity.
2008.07-10374,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1839.56,1841.696,What's the difference of -- practically?
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1841.696,1842.479,--The practical difference--
2008.07-10374,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1842.479,1856.705,"Isn't the -- isn't the practical effect -- if you tried to explain to correctional officers what is your exposure, you would say: You have absolute immunity from anything that's going to try to reach into your pocket."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1856.705,1857.405,--Not at all.
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.757,1863.792,They're -- they are liable in Federal court.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1863.792,1864.644,"Yes, that's exactly -- yes."
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.644,1866.644,They're certainly not immune in Federal court.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1866.644,1868.846,They are fully liable in Federal court.
2008.07-10374,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1889.359,1889.942,What's the--
2008.07-10374,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1889.942,1898.282,"I thought the theory was that in our Federal system, Federal law is State law, too?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1922.914,1924.048,That's correct.
2008.07-10374,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.894,1960.404,--But what is the neutral reason related to the administration of courts that leads the State to close its door to a damage suit under 1983 against correctional officers--
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1960.404,1961.104,"Well, I have three."
2008.07-10374,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1961.104,1964.439,--taking as the assumption exactly what Justice Ginsburg said?
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1981.8,1985.471,"First of all, these -- this -- I would like to correct an observation."
2008.07-10374,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.716,2016.906,But that -- but Testa and Katt was a case in which the Court found that the State allows some State actions that are analogous to the Federal action and you can't discriminate against a Federal action.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2016.906,2017.423,--That's correct.
2008.07-10374,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2017.423,2018.692,This is not that case.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2054.115,2063.637,Prisons are large institutions in rural counties that generate a vast amount of litigation.
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2136.416,2145.605,"General Underwood, your friend on the other side acknowledges that if New York State closed its courts to tort actions, that would be okay."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2155.978,2168.637,"No, and I don't believe that this Court's cases about jurisdiction, as distinguished from its cases about case handling rules, require that kind of neutral administrative feature."
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2197.907,2218.57,"Suppose that the State of New York said that in suits against corrections -- against the corrections department, against the State, there should be no damages awarded to a prisoner in excess of $3,000, and then -- and then -- and then the prisoner tries to bring a 1983 suit in State court."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2218.57,2219.353,"Well, I think--"
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2219.353,2220.953,Would the case -- would the analysis be just the same?
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2220.953,2222.605,"--No, I don't think the analysis would be the same."
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2268.401,2271.019,"In my hypothetical, do you think it undermines the Federal claim?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2271.019,2282.292,"--Well, I think it could be argued -- I think it would be argued that limiting damages undermines a Federal action that is meant to provide--"
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2282.292,2300.288,"But why can't it be argued here that Congress has an important mechanism in holding prison officials -- prison correctional officers -- personally liable, so that they are themselves aware that they have a constitutional obligation that is enforceable against them, and New York has taken this away?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2312.846,2316.132,"--Well, I don't believe Congress has made that judgment."
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2320.334,2321.117,"No, it has made that judgment."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2322.969,2332.141,"--No, the purpose of 1983 is to -- actually was two things: It was to provide a Federal forum, and it was to provide compensation for these torts."
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.941,2334.759,"He's still responsible, right?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2335.226,2335.893,--Yes.
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.893,2337.378,--He's still responsible.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2337.378,2339.747,"I think there's no Federal policy that, for instance--"
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2339.747,2345.365,"No, the correctional officer, under the scheme we are talking about, is not responsible in damages."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2345.365,2357.709,"--He is responsible to exactly the same degree as he would be, were he sued personally, because New York indemnifies him and there is no requirement -- Congress has never shown any objection to indemnification."
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2357.709,2362.677,But -- does your case turn on whether or not there is an indemnification agreement?
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2362.677,2368.314,I don't know that our case turns on whether there's an indemnification agreement.
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2368.314,2368.93,I shouldn't think so.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2370.099,2384.542,"Well, what I'm saying is to the extent -- I don't believe we need to -- if you think that we need to -- that there may be a conflict with a Federal policy -- I think the statute stands because it's nondiscriminatory and jurisdictional."
2008.07-10374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.561,2389.111,Let me just ask--
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2389.111,2389.478,--Yes.
2008.07-10374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2389.478,2392.113,--Just to ask you an offshoot of Justice Kennedy's question.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2406.406,2420.365,"No, I don't think so, for the same reason that I don't think -- that is, if you have a tort remedy that the State is hearing, then a limit on recovery that goes -- that is inconsistent with congressional policy is not permitted."
2008.07-10374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2428.852,2439.558,"So you think -- consistently with our FELA cases, it could have a rule that no tort -- no tort cases may be brought by railroad employees against the railroad in State court?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2439.558,2440.591,--State or Federal.
2008.07-10374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.347,2452.632,"Well, they couldn't close the Federal doors under the FELA."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2454.482,2454.932,--Yes.
2008.07-10374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2455.751,2464.44,"--But you're saying they could shut the State -- close the State courts to suits against railroads where the damage -- for cases over $10,000?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2464.44,2469.242,"--Well, I don't think they could put the damage requirement on, because then they would be opening the--"
2008.07-10374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2469.242,2470.01,But they could totally close it?
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2470.01,2472.526,"--They could totally close the doors, and I think that's different."
2008.07-10374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.632,2486.5,If you leave the door open to suits against every other possible defendant except railroads?
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2492.421,2514.769,"--I think the FELA cases, some of which were -- some exclusions were upheld and some of which were struck down, support our position because they only strike down exclusions of jurisdiction where there is a discrimination, where the Court finds a discrimination between the Federal and State claim."
2008.07-10374,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2551.877,2562.85,I thought that in Testa the State said: We are evenhanded; we don't bring -- we don't allow penal actions to be -- to be brought on the civil side of our court.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2562.85,2572.023,"But what -- but what this Court pointed to in Testa was that while they said that, they did, in fact, hear double damage actions, which is what this was."
2008.07-10374,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2600.459,2606.446,"So what you have now is you have one reason, I think, would be clearly wrong, I think -- I assume that."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2650.075,2652.058,Or -- or we offer them a court of claims.
2008.07-10374,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2652.442,2657.06,"--You don't offer them a court of claims, because what you offer in the court of claims is an action against the State."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2657.06,2657.594,--It's a different action.
2008.07-10374,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2657.594,2664.25,"And you can say that isn't a big deal because, after all, most of these really are actions against the State anyway because they get compensated."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2687.429,2689.548,"Well, they aren't -- this is what I can tell you."
2008.07-10374,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2694.435,2698.054,"Well, 1983 actions, but maybe they bring them mostly in Federal court."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2698.054,2699.304,--They do bring them only in Federal court.
2008.07-10374,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2699.304,2699.839,Okay.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2730.991,2735.512,"Well, what I can tell you is that there are a great many State law -- I can't tell you numbers."
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2776.403,2781.141,"It's not really that they are not the supreme court, but the -- the damages are limited, aren't they?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2793.932,2800.704,"Well, there are two things to say about punitive damages: One is that, yes -- there are three things: There are no punitive damages in the court of claims."
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2818.082,2819.716,"Well, they could be brought in the State supreme court--"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2819.716,2821.034,They could be brought in the State supreme court.
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2821.034,2839.495,"--which is a -- which is one of your jurisdictional problems because the -- the -- in effect, New York is saying the most -- the most egregious class of cases, the cases in which the correctional officers are not only doing something actionable but something that's even outside the scope of their duty, well, we will hear them; they are fine."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2842.447,2843.263,Well--
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2843.263,2862.075,Which -- which makes it a little tough to say that in the less egregious cases there's a -- that the exclusion of the less egregious cases is a jurisdictional exclusion as distinct from an exclusion based upon policy about how less egregious cases ought to be handled.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2862.075,2867.146,"--Well, it's -- it is a jurisdiction -- it is framed as jurisdictional."
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2870.081,2874.919,"No, but aren't you simply saying, look, we go around calling it ""jurisdictional""."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2906.038,2917.679,"--No, because what the jurisdictional bar is for damage actions against corrections officers for actions in the scope of their employment -- and the New York courts don't just say it's jurisdictional."
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2920.547,2934.54,What if the New York Legislature passed a statute saying the -- the State supreme court will not have jurisdiction over 1983 actions for -- for harm committed on Wednesday?
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2937.575,2943.146,I think--
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2943.146,2946.431,"Well, I'll answer -- I'll answer the question for you, if you want."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2946.915,2947.498,--I think it would be hard to--
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2947.498,2947.998,You wouldn't have.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2947.998,2949.731,"--to find a rationale for it, but--"
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2949.731,2953.235,"Even if it were, it would be discriminatory and invalid, right?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2953.235,2957.353,"--I was going to say, I don't think its flaw is that it's not jurisdictional."
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2959.305,2960.955,Or discriminatory.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2961.972,2964.941,"Or discriminatory as between -- as between plaintiffs, yes."
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2965.293,2978.183,"Would you say it was jurisdictional so long as the supreme court said -- so long as the State legislature said, no State or Federal actions for -- for -- for Wednesday damages?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2980.932,2982.765,--I would call it very strange jurisdiction.
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2982.765,2989.371,"--You might call it crazy outside of court, but the one thing you wouldn't do is walk into court and say it's jurisdictional."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3006.481,3007.083,"Well, it--"
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3007.083,3039.036,"And that's what I -- that's why I keep getting at the point that when -- when you lay in some 1983 actions, the worst ones, the ones with the highest potential damages, but you say, well, the less awful ones, the ones that may be within the scope of employment, they can't come in, it seems to me that the -- that the teeth on the comb are getting rather fine, and in terms of our normal usage in -- in applying this criterion, it is not plausibly jurisdictional."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3039.036,3051.961,"--Well, unlike the Wednesday case, our statute is rational because it takes out of the courts of general jurisdiction the cases that are most numerous and that are most appropriately indemnified--"
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3051.961,3052.761,What are the--
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3052.761,3063.169,"--by the State, but it leaves in the courts of general jurisdiction the ones that are less numerous and that are not appropriately indemnified or turned into actions against the State."
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3065.536,3074.894,"--But one -- one of the concerns I have in this case is scope of employment is often litigated, and it would seem to me that the State of New York might routinely say, oh, this is not within the scope of employment."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3074.894,3078.013,"Well, there's a body of cases that is quite generous in--"
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3078.013,3085.333,Which -- which means that this is a very difficult distinction to work with and is a further burden on the 1983 right.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3085.333,3088.369,--The law of the State of New York is relatively clear on this.
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3100.159,3101.878,"Well, I think that's a rather routine defense."
2008.07-10374,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3101.878,3105.83,But why are they -- why are they left in the supreme court?
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3105.83,3124.91,"Because they are not appropriately -- because the State doesn't want to take responsibility -- when the same statute that takes them out the supreme court says actions for such matters can be brought against the State in the court of claims, and the State is not taking responsibility for those cases and will not indemnify them."
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.91,3128.696,"--General Underwood, when -- when was this statute first enacted?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3128.696,3135.265,"Well, the statute was first enacted in -- in about 1947 or so."
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3135.265,3140.919,"And you say there were not -- 1983 was on the books, but, gee, it wasn't -- it wasn't--"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3140.919,3143.186,It was not aimed at -- it wasn't--
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3143.186,3144.805,--It pretty clearly was not aimed--
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3144.805,3145.655,--Correct.
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.655,3147.323,--at defeating Federal actions.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3147.323,3148.007,Correct.
2008.07-10374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.327,3159.898,"In fact, it had not even been held then that State Farm was available for 1983 actions."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3159.898,3160.798,--That's correct.
2008.07-10374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3160.798,3161.581,Yes.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3161.581,3162.048,That's correct.
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.048,3162.581,Can I--
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3162.581,3167.069,"The rise of Federal 1983 actions came subsequently, and they then--"
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3167.069,3168.837,"--That's an important factor, I would think."
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3188.215,3193.786,--I don't know the answer to that.
2008.07-10374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3193.786,3194.336,I don't either.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3209.912,3211.347,"There may be, but there's no--"
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3211.347,3218.017,"Well, 1983 does not -- correct me if I am wrong -- does not allow punitive damages against a State, does it?"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3218.017,3220.703,--1983 does not allow any liability.
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3225.905,3228.957,Not -- not if -- if I got it right -- not if Monell--
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3228.957,3232.176,The State -- that's Monell and--
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3232.176,3244.584,"--But even if Monell -- even if Monell, there's no -- there's no punitive damages against the State, which is another reason in which you're discriminating against the employee here -- against the prisoner--"
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3244.584,3244.917,--No--
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3244.917,3250.302,--because the prisoner can get punitive damages against the correctional officer but not against the State in either court.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3250.302,3255.44,"--Where he can get -- where he can bring his 1983 action, he can get punitive damages."
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3260.594,3265.33,In neither court can you get -- correct me if I am wrong -- punitive damages against the State.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3266.68,3267.88,Or any damages the State.
2008.07-10374,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3271.665,3273.148,You can under Monell.
2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3273.148,3277.002,"--Not against -- no, not -- not against the State."

2008.07-10374,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3279.152,3279.688,Yes.
2008.07-10374,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3350.248,3351.284,"Thank you, General."
2008.07-10374,2,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,3354.069,3363.192,"Mr. Chief Justice, just very briefly, General Underwood just mentioned that -- that this could be analyzed as a mandatory removal statute."
2008.07-10374,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3421.381,3429.785,"In that same act, they might rescind the -- the law allowing the State to respond in damages, in which case you won't have gained very much."
2008.07-10374,2,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,3429.785,3449.131,"Well -- well, Your Honor, my client can't bring his section 1983 claim in any State court because he can't bring it against the employees, because Correctional Law section 24 keeps him out of supreme court, and he can't sue the State in the court of claims because in Will v. Michigan this Court said the State is not a person."
2008.07-10374,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3453.483,3462.089,I find it hard to regard this as a non-neutral law when it was put on the books before there were any of these 1983 actions.
2008.07-10374,2,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,3462.089,3467.16,"Well, Justice Scalia, the -- the very first iteration of this law was in 1947."
2008.07-10374,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3480.218,3489.006,Was there any substantive change from what the original enactment to the amendment -- from the one that's currently enforced?
2008.07-10374,2,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,3489.006,3491.608,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't recall whether there were any."
2008.07-10374,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3529.566,3532.268,They're saying -- they're also saying there's a -- there's a neutral reason.
2008.07-10374,2,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,3581.535,3583.82,"--No, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-10374,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3596.711,3599.08,"Well, forget all of the characterizations."
2008.07-10374,2,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,3619.993,3621.709,"And I'm sorry, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-10374,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3622.861,3637.205,"The reason is, you see, there are so many cases in which the person is suing -- the prisoner is suing the prison officials that our courts are clogged."
2008.07-10374,2,31910,jason_e_murtagh,,3648.393,3652.88,"Justice Breyer, the answer is that the State can certainly do that with respect to the State-law claims."
2008.07-10374,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3661.67,3662.703,"Thank you, counsel."
