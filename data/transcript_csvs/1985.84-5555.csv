1985.84-5555,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.617,We will hear arguments next in Heath against Alabama.
1985.84-5555,0,38521,ronald_j_allen,,73.988,87.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Mr. Heath was indicted in Georgia for the murder of his wife after joint investigation between Alabama and Georgia officials for capital murder."
1985.84-5555,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,185.052,202.604,"What would you say, Mr. Allen, if the record showed that there was a kidnapping and rape in one state, either Georgia or Alabama, and then another day the murder occurred?"
1985.84-5555,0,38521,ronald_j_allen,,204.774,206.276,"I am sorry, sir."
1985.84-5555,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,208.507,211.42,"The kidnapping and rape in, say--"
1985.84-5555,0,38521,ronald_j_allen,,211.42,211.67,"Say, Georgia?"
1985.84-5555,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,211.67,216.843,--and taking them across the state line and murdering the victim on the next day.
1985.84-5555,0,38521,ronald_j_allen,,216.843,229.492,"I think it is quite clear, Your Honor, for reasons I am going to develop in detail, that we have to respect territoriality in the criminal justice process, and that under those circumstances, the murder occurred in the one state, the kidnapping and the rape occurred in another."
1985.84-5555,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,260.562,263.664,"Well, was there some offense in Alabama?"
1985.84-5555,0,38521,ronald_j_allen,,263.664,266.314,If... was there some offense?
1985.84-5555,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.592,278.133,How about the contracts to kill the person?
1985.84-5555,0,38521,ronald_j_allen,,278.133,280.045,--Those things were entered into in Georgia.
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,1739.818,1741.12,Thank you.
1985.84-5555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2206.763,2213.358,"Mr. Little, how did the murder in Georgia interfere with the sovereignty of Alabama?"
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2213.358,2224.335,"--Your Honor, under Alabama law the offense that the petitioner was accused of and was prosecuted for is murder during a kidnapping in the first degree."
1985.84-5555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2228.318,2231.39,Could you prosecute him for kidnapping in another state?
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2231.39,2234.101,--Not if that kidnapping--
1985.84-5555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2234.101,2236.863,"Well, how can you prosecute for murder in another state?"
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2236.863,2243.967,"--Under Alabama law, Alabama has jurisdiction of an offense if it began in Alabama and ended in another state."
1985.84-5555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2256.215,2260.059,"But your real interest is, you want a killing."
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2260.059,2264.97,"Our real interest, Your Honor, is in prosecuting him for violating our law."
1985.84-5555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.97,2268.642,"Well, he has been prosecuted for murder, and he has been convicted."
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2268.642,2273.037,He has been prosecuted in Georgia for Georgia's offense of murder.
1985.84-5555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2273.335,2274.076,And convicted.
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2274.076,2275.596,--And he has been convicted.
1985.84-5555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2275.596,2275.906,And sentenced.
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2275.906,2276.437,And sentenced.
1985.84-5555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.437,2277.739,But he wasn't killed.
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2277.739,2279.87,"Well, what Georgia--"
1985.84-5555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2279.87,2280.831,And you want to kill him.
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2280.831,2284.752,--What Georgia does with respect to its offenses is simply not our business.
1985.84-5555,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2313.563,2315.003,"Mr. Little, let me see if I follow you."
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2327.221,2329.593,"Well, Your Honor, we prosecuted him."
1985.84-5555,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2353.968,2359.341,Are you conceding that the reason Alabama prosecuted is because he didn't get the death penalty in Georgia?
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2359.341,2360.773,"No, I am certainly not, Your Honor."
1985.84-5555,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2362.965,2370.421,"Well, then your answer to my other question is probably in the affirmative, that you would have prosecuted anyway."
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2370.421,2371.981,"Well, he would have--"
1985.84-5555,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2371.981,2372.311,--the death penalty--
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2372.311,2377.394,"--Well, all I can say is, I don't know."
1985.84-5555,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.041,2390.971,"--Well, you may... I suppose you insist that Alabama would have had the power to do it, but may not have exercised it."
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2390.971,2391.622,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-5555,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2411.107,2414.069,"The fact is, you weren't satisfied with a life sentence in Georgia."
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2414.069,2416.96,"--No, Your Honor, there is nothing in the record to suggest that."
1985.84-5555,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2416.96,2421.764,"The facts rather suggest it, don't they?"
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2452.734,2453.624,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-5555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2463.861,2472.095,"Mr. Little, you did argue earlier that one of the interests of Alabama was the death penalty."
1985.84-5555,1,45359,william_duncan_little_iii,,2474.897,2477.559,Maybe I could clarify my position.
1985.84-5555,2,38521,ronald_j_allen,,2752.91,2755.331,"A few points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-5555,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.331,2762.496,"Mr. Allen, suppose that Georgia had arrested this... Alabama had arrested this man first."
1985.84-5555,2,38521,ronald_j_allen,,2774.743,2775.103,That's correct.
1985.84-5555,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.103,2779.888,But then could Georgia have prosecuted him for murder?
1985.84-5555,2,38521,ronald_j_allen,,2779.888,2781.007,"No, I think not."
1985.84-5555,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2785.171,2785.632,All right.
1985.84-5555,2,38521,ronald_j_allen,,2785.632,2788.353,"Now, I have a number of points to make if I may."
1985.84-5555,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2875.221,2876.351,You say that is an invalid reason?
1985.84-5555,2,38521,ronald_j_allen,,2876.351,2876.831,--Yes.
1985.84-5555,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2888.878,2894.962,You agree that this man would be eligible for parole in seven years under Georgia law?
1985.84-5555,2,38521,ronald_j_allen,,2894.962,2897.423,I don't know when he would he eligible for parole.
1985.84-5555,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2901.267,2904.129,Average length of life sentence is 15 years?
1985.84-5555,2,38521,ronald_j_allen,,2904.129,2906.901,"--Average length, average is about 15 years."
1985.84-5555,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2906.901,2909.142,That is higher than the national average by far.
1985.84-5555,2,38521,ronald_j_allen,,2909.142,2910.862,Your Honor--
1985.84-5555,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2910.862,2923.38,And Georgia's statute that we dealt... new criminal code that we dealt with a few years ago was apparently one of the most generous in terms of short sentences of any in the country.
1985.84-5555,2,38521,ronald_j_allen,,2925.07,2935.228,"--I have been informed, and if you would like us to give you statistics on this, I would be most happy to provide it, that the average sentence in Georgia is 15 years for life for murder."
1985.84-5555,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2979.016,2980.027,"Thank you, gentlemen."
