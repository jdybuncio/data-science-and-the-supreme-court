1956.25,0,40770,richard_e_williams,,23.949,25.137,May it please the Court.
1956.25,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,25.137,27.831,Mr. Williams.
1956.25,0,40770,richard_e_williams,,27.831,42.59,This matter is before this Court on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit which Court affirmed the decision of the United States Tax Court.
1956.25,1,37869,philip_elman,,1512.893,1514.239,May it please the Court.
1956.25,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1528.173,1530.138,Existence as a corporate --
1956.25,1,37869,philip_elman,,1530.138,1530.593,Wasn't --
1956.25,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1530.593,1532.815,-- irresponsible corporate shell.
1956.25,1,37869,philip_elman,,1532.815,1551.467,"It was -- it was insolvent, it had no assets at the time the guaranty was paid but the particular basis of decision of the Fox case, that the debtor was not in existence, is not present here."
1956.25,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1557.382,1564.424,"What the -- was the debtor actually without any assets, so that no part of it (Inaudible)"
1956.25,1,37869,philip_elman,,1564.424,1576.279,The -- the facts as they are reflected by the record are that this corporation became totally unsuccessful on the summer of 1947.
1956.25,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,2018.418,2021.754,(Voice Overlap) whether the indemnitor is there?
1956.25,1,37869,philip_elman,,2021.754,2034.05,I think an indemnitor -- indemnitor may present an entirely different situation because there the creditor is in effect indemnified for a loss he suffered.
1956.25,2,40770,richard_e_williams,,3292.361,3294.802,May it please the Court.
1956.25,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3479.759,3498.926,"It is your contention then that this doctrine for which you're contending applied only in a situation like this, where -- where the guarantor pay the debtor (Inaudible) the debtor become (Inaudible) would have to furnish to him."
1956.25,2,40770,richard_e_williams,,3498.926,3500.109,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.25,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3515.892,3530.451,"Although -- although, before the year is up of being paid up, whatever (Inaudible) property is left, it becomes worthless and the stock market goes down (Inaudible)"
1956.25,2,40770,richard_e_williams,,3530.451,3541.996,"I think that it -- that the law requires this, if at the time of the performance of the guaranty, the right acquired by subrogation has some value."
1956.25,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3542.031,3543.398,Wouldn't that (Inaudible)
1956.25,2,40770,richard_e_williams,,3543.398,3558.736,"I -- I think to the extent that the right has value, then it does become a debt and would thereafter be treated as one to the extent that the right acquired where subrogation does not have value, then it is a loss that resulted from the transaction entered into for profit."
1956.25,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3565.745,3569.374,But the relation doesn't begin at the time the guarantor paid.
1956.25,2,40770,richard_e_williams,,3573.097,3582.104,"Well, Your Honor, is there, however, at that time any obligation owing to the taxpayer-guarantor."
1956.25,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3586.724,3597.098,"Well, the -- the debt hasn't become purported (Inaudible) but legal relations that come into being (Inaudible)"
1956.25,2,40770,richard_e_williams,,3597.098,3599.737,That may create a debt.
