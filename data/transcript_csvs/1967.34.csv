1967.34,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.748,"Number 34, International Longshoremen's Association, Local 1291, Petitioner, versus Philadelphia Marine Trade Association"
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,26.527,27.531,May it please the Court.
1967.34,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,54.689,60.279,Would you like to have them heard together as one case?
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,60.279,64.944,"I think that would be entirely satisfactory with me, if Your Honors.(Voice Overlap)"
1967.34,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,64.944,68.424,"Very well, that maybe consolidated then and argued together."
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,70.872,71.432,"Thank you, Your Honors."
1967.34,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,100.163,102.256,Why do you use these words “under the guise”?
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,110.342,122.77,"I think, perhaps I didn't want to go that far on my characterization and I would not impute any impropriety or anything of that --"
1967.34,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,122.77,126.112,"You're talking about that power, the existence of power --"
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,126.112,127.457,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.34,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,128.27,144.816,"Well really, Mr. Freedman, it comes down I gather part from your brief is an order enforcing an arbitrators award, an injunction for the purposes of the statute in Norris-LaGuardia that bars federal jurisdiction to issue injunction against free speech."
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,144.816,147.792,"That's a basic issue in this case, Your Honor."
1967.34,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,147.792,149.546,That's not under the guise of anything.
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,153.746,158.381,"Except, Your Honor, there is this much about it."
1967.34,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,168.614,171.51,You can rely on my decision.
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,171.51,177.952,"Well, Your Honors, an integral part of this Court and --"
1967.34,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,177.952,179.663,"No, but I dissented, I think."
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,179.663,185.948,"Well, I think we would all defend Your Honor's right to dissent."
1967.34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,660.785,661.726,How often?
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,666.764,667.288,"No, Your Honor."
1967.34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,667.288,669.055,This was the industry where bargaining wasn't it?
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,670.962,672.54,This is in the Port of Philadelphia.
1967.34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,672.54,672.723,The whole waterfront.
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,672.723,674.237,They're covering the entire fort of Philadelphia.
1967.34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,681.544,684.115,"By industry wide, I meant the Philadelphia waterfront."
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,684.115,684.259,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,684.259,685.071,And the whole waterfront?
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,685.071,685.934,"Oh, yes."
1967.34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,685.934,687.107,In one agreement?
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,687.107,690.053,One agreement covering the long tract of the entire waterfront.
1967.34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,690.138,698.04,An arbitrator made a decision as to the meaning of or the applicability of the provisions to that agreement for this particular situation.
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,698.04,699.135,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,699.135,712.951,"And now you are telling us, I gather, that there was nothing final or binding about that insofar as a -- because the next day, the day after that and the day after that, there could be -- they could continue to dispute it."
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,712.951,717.753,"Well, Your Honor, it just couldn't work out that way."
1967.34,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,720.718,724.206,"Apart from that, and up here, you had a court order since you have --"
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,724.206,724.67,Sorry.
1967.34,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,724.67,731.438,-- wasn't there a court order enforcing the arbitrator's award before it always happen?
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,731.438,737.174,"Well, the court order is one of the things that's involved in this case Your Honor and --"
1967.34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,737.174,743.14,I just want to be sure I understood the arguments you're making to us now and I'm not sure I do.
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,743.14,745.511,"Well, let me perhaps break it down now."
1967.34,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,971.685,1001.157,"But isn't the issue here -- isn't the issue here how you can test it on different sets of facts and the issue is not whether you could go back to the arbitrator or to the Court but the issue is whether an apparent plain violation of the Court's order, you can resort to self-help because what you say is a different set of facts."
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1004.991,1023.441,"No, I would not disagree with that, Your Honor, but I would say that in the context of this case, even if it was the identical issue, I would go so far as to say that a man should have the right to go to the arbitrator and say, I think you were wrong before."
1967.34,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1023.441,1028.807,"Well, that's not -- nobody is quarrelling with that in here.(Voice Overlap)"
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1028.807,1032.192,"As a matter of fact, that's what precipitated this whole conflict."
1967.34,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1032.192,1038.717,"Well, the Court's order of contempt was not based upon you're going back to the arbitrator, was it?"
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1038.717,1039.885,"That was a big part of it, Your Honor."
1967.34,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1039.885,1045.175,"It's based upon the work stoppage, is that right?"
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1045.175,1046.257,"That's only a part of it, Your Honor."
1967.34,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1050.576,1052.521,Is it right or wrong?
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1064.667,1069.408,"Well, the contempt order was based on the -- of course Your Honor is correct there."
1967.34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1133.2,1148.902,"Well, all you're really saying though is you just might as well forget whatever arbitrator's award because here, we have a new dispute and all these amounts to is enjoining a work stoppage contrary to a provision of the contract."
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1148.921,1150.21,No.
1967.34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.199,1151.906,Why shouldn't you?
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1156.316,1159.693,"Well, it might do it, Your Honor, but I can't go that far."
1967.34,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1161.731,1169.91,"You'd have trouble explaining how my dissent support your theory to say that one, wouldn't you?"
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1169.91,1171.109,"Well, no Your Honor."
1967.34,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1171.476,1177.022,"No, on what Mr. Justice White has suggested to you with your argument?"
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1177.022,1185.048,"The basic facts, as Mr. Justice Fortas pointed out before, is whether or not there was a work stoppage, whether or not the Court's order restrained the work stoppage."
1967.34,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1190.614,1203.529,"Well, I know, but what Justice White has suggested is you have said that in effect that which brought under the lawsuit is an entirely different dispute from the dispute which had been resolved in arbitration sometime before."
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1203.529,1204.077,"That's right, Your Honor."
1967.34,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1204.077,1219.284,"And that therefore, the action brought by the employers before a Judge Body was in the essence, nothing more than an action to restrain a work stoppage in violation of the contract."
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1219.744,1220.486,I think that's true.
1967.34,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1220.645,1227.651,"Well, if that's true, then why isn't Justice White right that this is just -- you're trying to make a pure Sinclair case out of this."
1967.34,0,15940,abraham_e_freedman,,1227.651,1229.591,"Well, I think this is a pure Sinclair case."
1967.34,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1231.11,1231.245,Oh!
1967.34,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.397,1242.681,"Well, certainly, if you are right, this later dispute has no connection with the earlier arbitration award."
1967.34,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1260.422,1266.929,"I think for purposes of this case, Your Honor is undoubtedly correct because this is the way the court below treated it."
1967.34,1,24676,francis_a_scanlan,,3980.378,3984.267,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.34,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4071.457,4083.289,"But that award just covered the question as to how much money certain people were going to be paid but that narrowly, isn't that correct?"
1967.34,1,24676,francis_a_scanlan,,4083.289,4099.345,"Now, the award, Mr. Justice Stewart, actually said that the Employer Association, Philadelphia Marine Trade Association, which is the collective bargaining agent here for all employers, has a right to set-back the gangs without qualification."
1967.34,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4099.345,4099.946,That's what it said.
1967.34,1,24676,francis_a_scanlan,,4099.946,4100.371,That's what it said.
1967.34,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4100.371,4108.703,That's what it said but what would the award do in order to restrain the opinion in the judgment and you are telling me what the opinion said or what the award said.
1967.34,1,24676,francis_a_scanlan,,4108.703,4112.792,"What the award did, Mr. Justice Stewart, was this."
1967.34,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4334.098,4339.118,Do you think that the order complied with Rule 65(d)?
1967.34,1,24676,francis_a_scanlan,,4339.118,4340.584,"Yes, I do, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1967.34,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4340.584,4343.524,"First of all, do you think Rule 65(d) is applicable to this one?"
1967.34,1,24676,francis_a_scanlan,,4343.524,4345.845,"No, I don't."
