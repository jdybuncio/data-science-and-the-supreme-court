1970.108,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.387,"We’ll hear arguments next in Number 108, Richardson against Perales."
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,35.487,38.772,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,172.516,174.252,"Mr. Friedman, how does it all start?"
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,176.167,177.057,"Yes, let me just --"
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,177.057,177.846,What's the disability?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,177.846,181.626,Well let me start by explaining what happened perhaps in this case.
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,231.599,237.348,And in the procedures by which they’re handled differed depending upon the state?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,237.348,252.383,"Well, they may vary some but the basic procedure I think is the same which is the state agency makes whatever examinations are necessary at -- the Federal Government pays for these but it sends the man out for medical examinations."
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,289.04,292.807,"Would you explain there a little bit, he did have surgery?"
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,292.807,296.463,"Yes, may I give the chronology of what happened to him?"
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,296.463,301.454,And was he -- was there any curative effect as a result of the laminectomy?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,301.454,303.679,"Apparently not, apparently not."
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,319.662,325.823,Do you know whether the surgery was performed by an orthopedist or a neurosurgeon or by both?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,329.4,334.025,I believe he was a neurosurgeon.
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,336.321,340.01,And I take if they found pathology but no -- no relief?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,340.01,343.677,"Well they didn’t find much they thought, and this is one of the points."
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,369.253,381.462,Well did the preoperative diagnosis (Inaudible)?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,381.462,391.185,Well there was enough there apparently to suggest that they performed two myelograms before the surgery and the first one is not on the record.
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,467.994,474.985,"What would’ve stopped him if the state agency found that indeed he was disabled, would that be the end of the case so far as so is this?"
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,474.985,483.513,"Probably, probably and mostly I think in almost every instance where the state agency finds the man is disabled social security administration --"
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,483.513,485.079,"I view, they found he was not."
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,485.079,485.673,He was not.
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,485.673,487.551,Then what's the procedure after that?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,487.551,500.418,Well then at this point he then goes to the social security administration and they wrote him a letter which is pretty much a form letter saying that the examination has been conducted and you’re found not disabled.
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,509.929,511.091,Reconsideration by whom?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,511.091,515.501,By the social security administration by the Bureau of Disability and --
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,515.501,516.899,The state agency is now out?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,516.899,519.634,The state agency is out.
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,542.77,544.004,Done at whose instance?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,544.004,544.514,Pardon?
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,544.514,545.864,Done at whose instance?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,545.864,556.577,"This was done at the instance of the social security people and probably, this examination was conduced and then he had a hearing as he had requested."
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,576.909,581.433,Both the state agency and whoever it was that made this last --
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,581.433,584.991,Well the examinations were made not by -- let me make this clear.
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,590.823,592.745,"Retained by whom, that’s what I'm asking."
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,592.745,593.671,Well they were referred by the state agency.
1970.108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,711.564,713.07,Was he the proponent of any position?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,713.07,717.972,"No he is not the proponent of anyone, he is an object -- he tries to give objective."
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,726.014,728.818,He’s paid -- He’s paid by the Government?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,728.818,731.234,He is paid by the government or rather --
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,731.234,732.357,Get it per dime or --
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,732.357,739.924,No it's a rather I think for a qualified medical -- he gets a $125.00 for appearing as the medical expert.
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,746.084,747.934,For $25.00 a day --
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,747.934,750.045,"$125.00 for the case, that’s all --"
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,750.045,751.687,As long as the case goes on.
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,751.687,756.426,Cases ordinarily do not go -- this case of course there were two days of hearings but he only attend one.
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,760.135,768.334,And he’s a member of a panel that has been sort of volunteers in response to request for volunteers?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,768.334,777.584,"That is correct, they have in each city, panels of different experts and in this case the record shows that the examiner did not select the particular expert."
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,790.793,797.285,How often would anyone medical advisor do this job over the course of the year?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,797.285,801.939,"It varies, again it depends on -- might several times a year, it might be just once or twice."
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,809.715,811.006,In which he is a specialist.
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,811.006,815.433,In which she is a specialist arose in the particular locality and also depending on the examiner.
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,825.554,829.067,Was this particular doctor a specialist or a generalist?
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,829.067,835.114,"No, this doctor was a specialist in something called physical medicine and rehabilitation."
1970.108,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,835.114,840.925,That’s -- that’s not neurosurgery or neurology or orthopedics.
1970.108,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,840.925,844.146,"That is right, but he said that he had --"
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2228.281,2231.0,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.108,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2330.558,2334.172,Is that the gist of your complaints about the hearsay?
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2334.172,2337.645,We actually have three points that I’d like to bring out Mr. Justice Black.
1970.108,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2379.815,2386.289,Could you argue that in suits again when the Government is consented to be sued?
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2386.289,2393.387,"No, because, generally in the suits where the Government consented to be sued, we have an impartial fact finder and that’s the federal district judge."
1970.108,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2393.387,2395.321,That’s what this is.
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2395.321,2397.421,No sir Your Honor in the suits of Federal Court --
1970.108,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2397.421,2399.062,In to the suit against the Government?
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2399.062,2403.528,Yes sir but the hearing examiner must be the Government’s lawyer as well as the judge.
1970.108,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2428.699,2439.487,"Can you subject the Government to the same kind of constitution or rule where it can be consent to be a sued or not as it seems here, as you are a private company?"
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2439.487,2443.78,"Well Your Honor, all we are saying here is that we are entitled."
1970.108,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2470.945,2473.202,What kind of suit was that?
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2473.202,2504.233,"That suit was a deportation proceeding, this was the last point that I was going to cover in my brief but it's on 24, it's Wong Yang Sung versus McGrath and virtually the identical procedure was followed in that case, as is followed in social security hearings where the Government hearing officer gathers the evidence for the Government and then listens to the evidence he gathers and listens to the immigrant in that case and then decides whether or not he should be deported."
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2581.884,2595.451,"Was your first point really the same as a charge that the Government hadn’t provided hearings but they have hearsay hearings, would you say that’s unconstitutional?"
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2595.451,2610.511,We say Your Honor when that it is basically unfair and that this Court has held it in cases where there is direct conflicts on the crucial issue to be decided and it is an issue which gives rights or denies rights to the individual.
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2618.032,2621.298,"Do you mean by that, in this instance, I gather you did."
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2621.298,2622.232,Yes sir we definitely did.
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2622.232,2624.957,You say evidence could not be used.
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2624.957,2630.042,We mean that it cannot be considered by the decision maker in rendering a decision.
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2630.042,2631.604,Well that would be no good.
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2631.604,2634.517,"That’s right, in fact Mr. Justice --"
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.517,2640.982,"What would it do to the subpoena to the doctors, if this man has a lawyer here?"
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2640.982,2642.929,"Yes sir, I was his lawyer at the hearing."
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2645.075,2655.109,"Just for a moment, if you subpoenaed the doctor, do you think that you would be able to shake him down and make them change that interest?"
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2655.109,2657.306,Well let me say this Mr. Justice Marshall.
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2667.675,2669.706,Well all I'm trying to say is are you offering experts?
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2669.706,2672.577,"Yes, we offered one doctor."
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2672.577,2676.769,My question was did you offer any expert?
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2676.769,2680.494,"Well, I consider that the doctor was an expert witness by that --"
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2680.494,2681.734,Expert in what?
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2681.734,2685.547,"In medicine Your Honor, in other words are you saying did I offer any specialist?"
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2685.547,2686.043,Yes.
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2686.043,2688.525,"No, I did not Your Honor."
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2688.525,2690.372,Were you prevented from doing it?
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2690.372,2693.44,No sir and it is our position in response to this.
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2693.44,2704.47,Would it be the proper way to contradict a medical testimony by your cross examination that could be done by contrary affidavits?
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2704.47,2713.178,"Your Honor I would say this to you, it has been my experience and I am a trial lawyer who is a plaintiff’s lawyer that in many cases."
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2737.246,2738.753,Do you testify to that?
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2738.753,2740.488,Yes sir on page 150 of the record.
1970.108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2740.488,2741.687,Is that on the record?
1970.108,1,40611,richard_tinsman,,2741.687,2742.396,Yes sir.
1970.108,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4840.232,4840.657,Thank you Mr.--
1970.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4840.657,4841.989,How much do you think would --
1970.108,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4841.989,4844.524,Oh I think another five minutes would certainly be plenty.
1970.108,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4925.26,4927.265,Medical adviser you mean?
1970.108,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4927.265,4930.426,"The medical adviser, I'm sorry if I misspoke myself."
1970.108,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5030.329,5032.624,Now does the statute use the word unfair?
1970.108,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5032.624,5064.991,"No, no the statute Mr. Justice says that the secretary shall -- it says the secretary shall have full power to make rules and regulations and shall adapt reasonable and proper rules and regulations to regulate and provide for the nature and extent of the proofs and the evidence and the method of taking and furnishing to say."
1970.108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5113.715,5118.979,Mr. Friedman is the hearing of this kind of case a full time job for this presenter?
1970.108,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5118.979,5119.411,Yes.
1970.108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5120.058,5120.993,That’s all they do?
1970.108,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5120.993,5138.456,"This is all they do and I might say that these examiners prior to the time they start on the job, they get some kind of a course in which they get some basic medical information, like a six or eight week course in which they are instructed, I understand by various specialists in the field."
1970.108,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5165.326,5183.827,What if the congress had passed a law providing cases against private insurance companies could be tried under the same statute and then the finding of the secretary would be final?
1970.108,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5186.019,5192.298,"Well in effect, I would think, it would again depend on what kind of case it was."
1970.108,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5197.201,5198.266,It would be wouldn’t it?
1970.108,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5198.266,5212.022,Yes but we do have a similar kind of proceeding Mr. Justice under the Harbor Workmans Compensation statute which traditionally you have it held before a deputy commissioner and that is there are two parties -- there's usually the claimant on the one hand and the --
1970.108,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5212.022,5215.029,"That’s against the Government, that’s the difference."
1970.108,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5215.029,5216.798,"That is a Government case, yes."
1970.108,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5216.798,5219.835,There's a difference in both these cases.
1970.108,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5219.835,5232.746,"That is correct, that is right this is the Government and the Government I think, can in dealing with these many problems resort to these more informal procedures that have been developed in recent years."
1970.108,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5232.911,5234.928,"Thank you Mr. Freedman, thank you Mr. Tinsman."
1970.108,3,40611,richard_tinsman,,5238.99,5239.719,Yes sir.
1970.108,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5239.719,5246.704,We thank you for your assistance to -- not only the petitioner here but your assistance to the Court.
1970.108,3,40611,richard_tinsman,,5246.704,5253.659,Thank you very much.
