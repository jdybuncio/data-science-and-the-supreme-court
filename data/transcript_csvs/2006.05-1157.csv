2006.05-1157,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.17,"We'll hear argument this morning in case 05-1157, Credit Suisse Securities versus Billing, et al.--"
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,9.272,12.058,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,98.78,104.916,"Did it, did it specifically state that, or is it that or just the principle that all Federal agencies have an obligation to--"
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,104.916,108.201,"Oh, no, Your Honor, it is very express in 75 and then again in the 96."
2006.05-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,124.561,131.9,"Mr. Shapiro, to what extent has the SEC regulated the specific vertical restraints that are alleged here?"
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,131.9,142.022,The SEC regulates the... the alleged tie-ins and it regulates the alleged excessive compensation claims.
2006.05-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,142.022,143.457,"And laddering, for example?"
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,143.457,146.909,"Laddering, tying, and excessive compensation."
2006.05-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,157.799,165.988,"And are we to assume that if the allegations are true, which they of course may not be, that this is a violation of the... of the securities laws?"
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,165.988,168.704,--Well the SEC has said it depends on the circumstances.
2006.05-1157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,194.921,200.725,How about in this case Did the SEC examine that question at all in this case?
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,202.511,211.617,"--In this case it took no position on the merit of the underlying claims, but it said that there would be serious problems if antitrust law were applied to these allegations."
2006.05-1157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,238.184,261.8,"How should we, we weigh... Congress is asking with respect to securities, private securities litigation, Congress looked at that and thought some restraint had to be placed on private actions, but it didn't do anything with respect to antitrust private action."
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,261.8,269.636,--We think part of the repugnance analysis here should focus on the fact that these securities claims have simply been repleaded as antitrust claims.
2006.05-1157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,280.627,285.665,"Doesn't, doesn't the statute specifically provide for... for exactly this possibility?"
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,291.319,294.604,--It doesn't refer to antitrust cases.
2006.05-1157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,298.889,303.959,Was it... were those two clauses expressly limited to state law remedies?
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,303.959,304.276,--No.
2006.05-1157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,307.961,309.03,But do they have to?
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,309.03,309.446,--We don't believe--
2006.05-1157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,309.446,312.815,None of the claims includes an antitrust claim on its face.
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,312.815,321.504,"Well, we think... we think they don't apply to antitrust, and in Gordon and NASD those same provisions were in place but that didn't deter the Court from finding them--"
2006.05-1157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.504,322.92,--I don't even think we mentioned them.
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,324.087,324.456,--Pardon me?
2006.05-1157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.456,326.206,Did we mention them in those cases?
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,326.206,327.541,I don't believe the Court did.
2006.05-1157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.541,330.61,"Well, maybe we just forgot."
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,331.693,333.312,"They... well, they... they don't pertain to antitrust."
2006.05-1157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,352.857,354.991,What happened in respect to the SEC?
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,368.383,376.489,"--Well, Your Honor, the reason it doesn't get mentioned is in that Gordon the Court held primary jurisdiction was not a fix for this kind of conflict."
2006.05-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,384.911,388.147,The allegations in this are quite different from Gordon.
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,403.157,409.81,"--Well, Your Honor, the conflict is different, but it's really quite a more serious conflict than it was in Gordon."
2006.05-1157,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,425.903,434.592,"Well, Mr. Shapiro, you're doing a good job of defending the SEC's interests but your position goes considerably beyond their position today."
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,434.592,445.567,"Well, the SEC in the lower courts advocated dismissal of the complaints; and in the Supreme Court, of course, they've... they've urged for a vacator of the lower court decision."
2006.05-1157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,452.57,454.939,That's why I wonder about primary jurisdiction.
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,498.634,501.153,"Well, I think Gordon is very informative on that point."
2006.05-1157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,514.894,518.198,That's in respect to the particular conduct at issue here.
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,518.198,518.682,Absolutely.
2006.05-1157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,520.097,526.286,"Of course the Petitioners have not had an opportunity, I would think... they filed a complaint."
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,536.159,548.217,"--Well, what this Court said in Gordon was that it's a legal question whether there is potential interference with the administrative scheme for us to decide the SEC's views are entitled to considerable deference, the Court said."
2006.05-1157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.186,567.779,"I suppose if primary jurisdiction were a cure-all, there would never be any cases in which the regulatory scheme did not displace the antitrust laws."
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,567.779,568.548,That's absolutely right.
2006.05-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.509,600.317,"The difference between this case and Gordon is that this case, the heart of their allegations are failure to disclose which is quintessentially the SEC's business, making sure disclosures are right."
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,604.985,617.944,"Well, what the SEC says is that if the conduct is ordinary book building, communications about future transactions, at future prices, there's no misconduct to be disclosed."
2006.05-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,619.394,622.663,The allegation in the complaint is there was no disclosure.
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,622.663,625.098,The complaint alleges an antitrust violation.
2006.05-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.169,633.371,The allegation is the agreement... the agreement not to disclose.
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,633.371,656.069,"--That certainly highlights why this is an SEC case and not an antitrust case, it seems to me, because that... disclosure is for this administrative agency to wrestle with, and it has made clear that investor welfare will be harmed and issuer welfare will be harmed if these sensitive questions are taken from it and are frozen by antitrust judgments."
2006.05-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,660.521,662.99,"Let me just ask one more question, Mr. Shapiro."
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,667.961,671.163,"Well, in part, I would say yes, there was an agreement in restraint of trade--"
2006.05-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,671.163,672.496,Agreeing on what the--
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,672.496,674.531,"--Yeah, that's their theory."
2006.05-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.531,676.667,--The preliminary before the IPO.
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,681.019,689.475,"Really what they are alleging is a conspiracy to violate the securities laws here, that had some... what they claim, a market effect."
2006.05-1157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,725.731,736.038,Are there many situations in which a particular industry is subject to regulators and they sometimes conflict?
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,738.473,739.223,"Oh, yes."
2006.05-1157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,767.291,772.528,The EPA is not a hands-on regulatory agency the way the SEC is.
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,777.698,778.848,"--I think that's right, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.188,823.829,"Well, the Government says that's fine where the regulations have been issued, and where they... where they render the action here lawful."
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,828.031,829.567,"Well, the Government says--"
2006.05-1157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,829.567,832.519,"The Government's willing, in other words, to give the SEC carte blanche."
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,837.471,842.291,--We think immunity extends beyond what is expressly permitted by the SEC.
2006.05-1157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.517,859.586,"Extends a lot further, I would think."
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,859.586,860.286,--I would think it does.
2006.05-1157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.106,891.106,So we could decide that way.
2006.05-1157,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,898.627,901.663,--We would win under either of these standards.
2006.05-1157,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,958.165,966.585,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,970.639,973.425,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1157,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.995,1060.031,May I ask this question about the laddering and so forth?
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1064.248,1066.184,"I think it might, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1157,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.658,1079.61,I can see how they would affect the market if they were disclosed.
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1079.61,1085.864,"--That may be true, but the way the regulation approaches that conduct is a little bit more of a prophylactic approach."
2006.05-1157,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1110.379,1123.906,"In light of the very fine line, how is the Court to distinguish between... determine whether what's alleged is inextricably intertwined with authorized conduct?"
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1123.906,1134.595,"Well, I think if you were looking at a challenge that took place solely within the context of a single IPO, it would probably be so difficult that I think we would concede that you can't practically separate the two."
2006.05-1157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.908,1157.96,But the problem you address has been a problem of strike suits.
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1193.631,1194.417,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
2006.05-1157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.417,1201.237,"I wouldn't want to roll the dice on whether something is inextricably intertwined, with treble damages at the end."
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1201.237,1209.093,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think that you could certainly perform this test and make the test protect conduct sufficient to protect against that threat."
2006.05-1157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1257.158,1259.36,"They might, but they haven't yet."
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1270.482,1274.453,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, I would warn you off of sort of saying absolutely no."
2006.05-1157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1291.062,1293.681,"And even then, why do you take the other position?"
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1308.191,1310.293,"Well, I suppose it's possible, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-1157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1310.293,1311.176,It is possible.
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1363.443,1370.931,"Well, I think if you draw a distinction between intraIPO allegations and interIPO allegations, you go a long way towards doing it."
2006.05-1157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1465.793,1470.261,What happens on remand in this very case based on your theory?
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1477.284,1479.05,"--That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and--"
2006.05-1157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1479.05,1481.502,What happens when it goes back?
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1481.502,1483.437,"--Well, I think this Court could do one of two things."
2006.05-1157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1500.163,1508.886,"But why, if this is a sprawling complaint and if the problem is that it says too much or too vaguely?"
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1541.14,1545.428,"--We would have no objection to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1567.407,1573.428,"What would, what would a satisfactory complaint for this party look like?"
2006.05-1157,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1573.428,1577.197,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's a little hard for me to frame that complaint."
2006.05-1157,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1602.848,1603.781,"Thank you, General Clement."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,1608.168,1611.636,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1639.886,1652.477,"Well, it might well be, because the reasoning would be, which I find very strong, is that as soon as you make an, bring an antitrust court in, you're talking about juries and treble damages."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,1680.88,1683.898,"I totally disagree, with great respect."
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1693.588,1700.61,What they say in respect to that is the other side says it's common to try to what's called make a book or something.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,1701.877,1702.46,Right.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1702.46,1710.716,"And when they do, what happens is that the marketer goes out and he asks people: What's your plan?"
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,1736.2,1737.983,"That's not this case, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.029,1758.08,He's not saying that that's this case.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,1780.16,1782.361,"Your Honor, sorry for interrupting."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.361,1783.261,I'm done.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,1783.261,1783.945,Okay.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.18,1840.132,The problem... I'd be repeating it.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,1886.346,1889.398,"Well, I'll do primary jurisdiction last, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1911.061,1915.032,May I ask you if your conspiracy allegation would be the same if there were only one underwriter?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,1915.032,1915.465,No.
2006.05-1157,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.065,1918.584,It is critical to your case that there are multiple underwriters?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,1918.584,1919.35,"Yes, yes."
2006.05-1157,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.35,1927.273,What if we thought that the activities of the multiple underwriters were Comparable to a single joint venture?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,1943.949,1946.984,"We totally depend on the horizontal agreement, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1953.005,1960.411,"If there had just been the vertical agreements and if they had been fully disclosed, there would no antitrust violation, would there?"
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,1969.0,1973.119,"--If there's no market power, we're not alleging that, and we wouldn't try to bring that case, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2003.673,2011.827,What about the Solicitor General's suggestion about extending antitrust immunity to a single IPO?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2024.853,2026.553,It's a hypothetical.
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2077.052,2079.971,What are you talking about when you say a horizontal agreement?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2083.375,2083.824,--No.
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2083.824,2084.192,No.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2084.192,2084.742,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2110.275,2127.904,"What about an agreement among underwriters, among underwriters, which says the following: We agree that we go... when we go on our tour, we will be certain to ask the potential purchasers whether they plan to hold this stock for at least a month."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2127.904,2128.637,No problem.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2128.637,2129.254,No problem.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2129.254,2129.854,Never.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2129.854,2133.975,How do you know that isn't a disguise when they say--
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2133.975,2134.958,"We wouldn't bring the case, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2134.958,2136.177,"--Ah, ah."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2142.997,2143.481,Yes.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2144.147,2144.813,What's the answer?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2144.813,2164.024,"--I don't think it fits into the way of this narrow case and the facts that are presented for immunity here, which the Congress has been trying to stop forever, and the conduct's spread between 1997 and 2001 and was a massive violation that the securities laws really aren't cut out to address."
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2207.887,2210.839,I'm trying to grasp the difference between the single IPO and multiple.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2220.028,2220.528,No problem.
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2220.528,2231.585,"Well, if the same underwriters get together the next month, they've got a different IPO and they say, you know, let's do the same thing we did last time because seemed to work well in terms of the issuance and the capital formation."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2233.068,2233.552,No.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2273.845,2277.047,Can you get damages for that from the SEC?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2278.597,2282.101,--The SEC refers the customers to the private lawyers if you complain.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2286.303,2292.807,"Suppose you lose, your client... suppose all these bad things happen and you don't have an antitrust claim."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2295.843,2296.445,Yes.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.667,2310.936,So what's at issue here is not whether you get a remedy.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2312.62,2313.12,--No.
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.618,2333.668,Why is that?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2344.14,2348.258,"Well, the SEC could make a rule to prohibit... to further supplement the protections."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2348.258,2348.725,"Right, right."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2348.725,2349.342,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.127,2352.544,They have chosen not to.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2352.544,2358.448,"--Well, it... it... I think it's more institutional that the focus has always been transactional, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.207,2373.057,"No, but--"
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2373.057,2374.99,--There could have been a suit by now but it has never happened.
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.99,2384.013,--But you... you could regard the activity of laddering and of making a book on a stock when the... in the case of a single offering.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2398.003,2411.194,In the... there's huge qualitative differences between certain types of conduct which has always been accepted and was not prohibited in the securities laws and laddering or pools of orders to raise prices and tie-in agreements.
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.83,2442.448,Yeah.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2451.388,2454.339,"Yes, Your Honor, across IPOs and across underwriters, so that--"
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2454.339,2454.939,Why?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2454.939,2456.989,--So that a customer couldn't go to another underwriter for a different deal.
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.989,2462.945,Uh-huh.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2465.595,2466.147,"No, no."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.753,2478.205,They'd have to pay the premium.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2478.205,2478.605,--Yeah.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.378,2515.778,All right.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2542.561,2547.615,--They agreed to inflate prices in precisely the way the securities laws have always prohibited.
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2558.073,2563.042,So your test is it has to be prohibited by the securities laws?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2563.042,2563.911,No.
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2594.68,2613.66,"What do you say to the... sort of stepping back from the trees to the forest, to the general suggestion that Congress has been tightening up the requirements for private securities litigation over the past few years; and you're bringing this now as antitrust claims as a way to circumvent Congress's regulation."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2613.66,2618.361,--That the actual facts show that Congress wanted this claim to be brought.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2642.411,2645.179,What about... what about... listen to what I'm about to say.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2694.796,2695.229,Bingo.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2700.532,2702.051,"I don't know if it's... I mean, you know--"
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2702.884,2704.201,"No, no... but we agree on every one."
2006.05-1157,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2704.851,2709.371,How could the Court... how could a court enforce that at the 12(b)(6) stage?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2712.323,2719.846,"--Well, in this particular case, Your Honor, there's five administrative proceedings that have, that have come forth since we... we filed first, and there was nothing."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.939,2739.558,"Look, the question isn't whether it satisfies it."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2747.663,2753.984,"Your Honor, I think you have... for the good of the country, I think you have to follow the facts and find out if these people conspired as alleged."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.984,2755.186,--discovery?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2755.752,2756.069,Yes.
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2756.419,2764.006,"But the problem... the problem is that, of course, these people are to some extent under the securities laws in the business of fixing prices."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2806.483,2808.102,Again it is the qualitative difference.
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.169,2835.269,I don't think you've answered his question.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2835.269,2835.935,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.935,2837.204,I think that you've said that the two were different.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2853.047,2853.564,Well--
2006.05-1157,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2853.564,2856.933,What is the particular difference between supporting the price and rigging the aftermarket?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2859.467,2863.688,"--You look, you compare the cases to the language in the complaint."
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2912.835,2914.737,How did they applaud them?
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2914.737,2918.789,"Well, they just said that they... Congress... that's too strong a statement."
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2951.16,2957.614,"The SEC which is the agency charged with supervising those markets, thinks otherwise."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2957.614,2958.516,--No... no.
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2958.516,2963.218,"They don't think these, the antitrust actions are good for the securities markets."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2963.218,2972.49,The SEC... and this is the first immunity case before the court where the SEC and the DOJ both are in favor of not having substantive immunity.
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2973.859,2976.894,"But that wasn't the SEC's position below, was it?"
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2976.894,2977.211,No.
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2978.344,2981.194,"And the Justice Department was on one side, the SEC was on the other."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2981.579,2982.396,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.712,2985.414,It looks to me like they split the baby up here.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,2986.348,2987.283,--I... I... that's the only way I can see it.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3002.042,3008.446,I would always... I think the standard I was more or less talking about is pretty close to what the SG says.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,3040.066,3040.917,Protected conduct.
2006.05-1157,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3041.717,3042.9,"You, you could live with the SG--"
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,3042.9,3044.669,--We could live with that.
2006.05-1157,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3155.543,3160.845,You didn't have a chance to answer Justice Breyer's question about primary jurisdiction.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,3171.469,3179.806,"--The public carrier cases, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the sea carriers and the air carriers have had primary jurisdiction as an approach."
2006.05-1157,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3236.21,3245.566,"No, but we haven't had this problem focus before, and isn't primary jurisdiction the most efficient answer to the problem that we've got?"
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,3248.368,3250.736,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3283.274,3288.178,I don't understand what happens with this primary jurisdiction in the context of an antitrust suit.
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,3291.313,3292.23,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3292.23,3302.286,"And in primary jurisdiction, would we refer it to the SEC and accept the SEC's fact determinations and then instruct the jury that--"
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,3302.286,3307.24,"Never happened before, and it's contrary to the... what Congress wants."
2006.05-1157,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3311.875,3329.069,"--And it is really the factual determination that is the hang-up, that you don't want things that are innocent and that the SEC would know are innocent to be taken as evidence of guilty by the jury."
2006.05-1157,2,19439,christopher_lovell,,3343.996,3345.448,"I agree, Your Honor."
2006.05-1157,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3373.765,3374.582,"Thank you, Mr. Lovell."
2006.05-1157,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3378.402,3378.986,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-1157,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3416.425,3418.543,"What's your test, Mr. Shapiro?"
2006.05-1157,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3418.543,3425.464,Our test is the one the Court laid down in those two cases: Is there active supervision or is there pervasive regulation?
2006.05-1157,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3450.514,3463.822,"--We all agree, say a group of underwriters, that for the next we will insist that every customer, whatever price we charge, will pay 30 percent more for 50 percent more shares next month."
2006.05-1157,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3465.708,3466.174,Well--
2006.05-1157,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3466.174,3468.642,"They write it down, just what I said."
2006.05-1157,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3468.642,3473.796,--The same circumstances were presented very similar to the NASD in the Invemed case.
2006.05-1157,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3640.419,3641.702,"--Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
2006.05-1157,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3641.702,3642.285,We thank the Court.
2006.05-1157,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3642.285,3643.002,The case is now submitted.
