2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,69.557,72.612,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.732,139.485,But this Court held only 3 years ago that the statute before us here does not permit the Attorney General to hold the alien indefinitely.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,139.485,144.21,The... the Court addressed one of the statutes before the Court here.
2004.03-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,172.345,177.259,"But, Mr. Kneedler, recognizing that distinction, is that a distinction drawn by the statute that's before us?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,177.259,186.38,"--Yes, I believe it is, but it... but... but first of all, there is another statute which is highly relevant to this, and that is 1182(d)(5)(A), the parole statute."
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,247.392,259.735,"So are you... are you arguing now that... that (5)(A)... (d)(5)(A), is the statute under which you are detaining him and that 1231(a)(6) has nothing to do with the case?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,259.735,259.885,No.
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,262.736,264.881,So... so you're arguing... then you are.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,301.434,302.815,"--Yes, absolutely, and the... and the--"
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,302.815,305.111,"--Now... now is that argument... I mean, I'm sorry that I--"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,305.111,307.673,"--Yes, and we... we make... we do make that argument in our brief."
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,307.673,310.524,--and that... and so is that made in the courts below and everything that they're doing in the cases--
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,310.524,310.861,Yes.
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.787,322.328,But this statute just... just goes in a circle because it ends.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,346.683,347.426,No.
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.512,365.22,"Well, this shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant--"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,365.22,365.73,--And an--
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,365.73,369.8,"--Dealt with includes, it seems to me, 1231(a)(6)."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,369.8,375.744,--An applicant for admission includes anyone who has been found not to be admissible to the United States.
2004.03-878,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,401.296,407.778,"How would that... how would that apply to someone who hasn't gotten parole, hasn't gotten any permission, who snuck across the border?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,431.268,432.011,Yes.
2004.03-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,467.738,468.276,But may I--
2004.03-878,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,468.276,484.828,"Well, are... are you saying that if an alien on... who seeks admission and is denied admission and is at Ellis Island or the JKF Airport, that the Attorney General is... does not have to consult 1231(a)(6)?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,484.828,485.078,--No.
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,489.165,499.939,"--Where does it say... I mean, the reason I guess I missed it is because when I looked at your table of contents and elsewhere in the brief, it seems phrased totally in terms of 1231(a)(6)."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,521.115,521.28,--Right.
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,537.423,538.842,"All right, but where does it say that?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,544.315,548.773,On page 12... 26 to 27.
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,548.773,564.998,"That's what I read and it was in a structure called the statutory and... text and structure support the Secretary's detention authority, which is under a bigger heading saying the text, structure, and history of section 1231(a)(6) confirm the executive branch's authority."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,564.998,565.403,I should... I should also--
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,565.403,567.261,So perhaps I could be forgiven for not understanding--
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,567.261,579.771,"--And... and I should also point out that... that in... in our response to the petition in the Benitez petition, we expressly... we expressly argued that 1182(d)(5)(A) is an independent source of authority."
2004.03-878,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,579.771,591.881,"But if... if there's a statute that directs you with reference to a class, that statute is applicable, and this person is within that class."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,598.18,600.409,My... my point is that's not the exclusive basis.
2004.03-878,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,603.67,606.975,"Well, it might be exclusive constitutionally, but the Congress has acted."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,606.975,607.513,--Or... or--
2004.03-878,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,607.513,609.083,"And once it's acted, you're controlled."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,609.083,625.179,"--Well, or... or... but... but what Congress... if I may go back to the parole statute, before 1231(a)(6) was enacted, the only statute that governed the detention and the release of aliens arriving at our shores, what used to be called excludable aliens, was the parole statute."
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.835,633.314,"By which you mean... parole statute, by which you mean?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,633.314,634.922,--1182(d)(5)(A).
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.544,635.998,Okay.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,635.998,644.953,"And until there is an order of exclusion, even now the parole statute is the only statute that governs the detention and release of the alien."
2004.03-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,665.098,666.13,"--May I interrupt you there, Mr. Kneedler?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,739.03,741.155,There are a number of responses to that.
2004.03-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,781.8,782.543,"Well, factually."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,788.282,805.1,"They were allowed into the country under the parole statute that I just read, which makes... which makes it clear that they are admitted not... not in a way that confers any rights on them, but they are admitted in the interest of the United States for public benefits under circumstances which make clear that it is not an admission and that--"
2004.03-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,805.1,805.183,No.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,814.099,817.815,--No... no vested right to come into the United States.
2004.03-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,819.673,819.889,All right.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,835.731,837.217,--At the sufferance of the United States.
2004.03-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,837.217,837.589,I... I know.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,838.598,860.396,"And... and the question we have here is when the... when and if the United States, pursuant to this statute, decides no longer to suffer the aliens being at large, but instead return them to the border, in effect, or return them to detention, this statute makes clear that that... that whatever practical experience they have had at large in the country is always subject to revocation--"
2004.03-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,860.396,860.784,No.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,888.753,904.828,"--This Court has always treated as the same the custody of an alien who arrives at the border and has not been admitted, whether that person stays on the boat, goes to Ellis Island, which the Court said was not an entry that gave somebody constitutional rights to come here."
2004.03-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,915.669,933.768,"You're giving me prior examples, but the issue here is should we continue to respect that... what has been called that fiction as to people who are allowed into the country and are allowed to move around like other aliens and, indeed, and by and large like citizens."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,933.768,952.616,"--With respect, I think it is not... it is not a fiction with respect to the constitutional issue because there's a critical difference between, for example, a lawful permanent resident... a person does not acquire lawful permanent resident status by something like adverse possession, by living in the United States for a long period of time."
2004.03-878,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,959.591,959.807,Which can be revoked.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,997.569,1003.142,--This Court... this Court thought otherwise in... in Zadvydas 3 years ago where it drew a distinction.
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1008.426,1008.715,--That's true.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1088.674,1096.022,"--But... but, with respect, the Court did not construe any word in this statute to impose the limitation that you're describing."
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1109.608,1110.184,That's an interpretation.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1110.184,1110.806,--Pardon me?
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1110.806,1112.125,It says... that's an interpretation.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1112.125,1112.763,But... but--
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.763,1116.462,It says the statute does not confer power to hold beyond a reasonable period.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1116.462,1123.437,"--But... but the... the mode of analysis of the Court... it starts with the introduction to the Court's opinion, and this is at page 682."
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1129.464,1129.714,"Yes, yes."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1130.457,1130.862,--No.
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1149.57,1165.09,"Well... well, yes, but what... what... we put in the presumptively 6 months, but we said in our view the statute, read in light of the Constitution's demands, limits an alien's post-removal period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United States."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1185.069,1185.235,No.
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1185.401,1187.425,"--not always, but presumptively 6 months."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1187.425,1199.313,"--What... what the... what the Court was doing was... the... the standard that the Court announced at the beginning of its opinion was a reasonable... a reasonable time limitation, the application of which is subject to court review."
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1208.973,1211.386,"Well, it interpreted the statute as doing it."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1213.327,1213.781,No.
2004.03-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1238.673,1246.353,All right. I can... I can agree with you that the different classes are going to implicate different considerations on what is reasonable.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1263.193,1263.731,Well--
2004.03-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1263.731,1266.62,And that's where... it's that stretch that's giving us the trouble.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1266.62,1274.71,"--And... first of all, the Court doesn't have to decide that in this case because we have a regime where each of the aliens before this Court, came here, was paroled--"
2004.03-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1274.71,1276.546,"That's true, but we've got to say something."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1276.546,1287.692,"--But if... if I may go to the Mezei case, what the Court said there is that the detention of the alien on Ellis Island was effectuating his exclusion."
2004.03-878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1289.921,1295.205,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you mind telling us whether the record shows where Martinez and Benitez are now?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1296.608,1300.407,Benitez has been released to a half-way house.
2004.03-878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1301.15,1301.522,That's what I thought.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1301.522,1306.973,--last week showing that the review process under these regulations actually works.
2004.03-878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1314.979,1316.715,So is that case basically moot?
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1317.458,1321.173,He hasn't been... he hasn't been... I think he's still in... in custody.
2004.03-878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1328.437,1329.18,Where's Martinez?
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1329.18,1337.725,"Martinez was released pursuant to the court... district court order almost 2 years ago, and he's... he's now at large under an order of supervision."
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1337.725,1338.634,Mr. Kneedler--
2004.03-878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1338.634,1342.516,"Now, if I can continue for just a moment and then I'll stop."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1362.782,1371.327,"If... if there's an... if there is an individualized reason to believe that an alien would be a terrorist or... or a threat to the security in that respect, but the threat to the--"
2004.03-878,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1371.327,1372.525,"And that's available, is it not?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1372.525,1376.9,"--That... that's available, but the threat to the national security here is much larger than that."
2004.03-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.667,1390.525,May I ask you about--
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1390.525,1392.549,--if the United States had no ability to... to deflect--
2004.03-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.549,1398.41,"--Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a question, forgetting the statutes for a moment... I... which we've already covered at some length?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1412.695,1413.825,"--No, no, surely."
2004.03-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.901,1418.533,Then what is the protection under the Constitution that deals... is it the Due Process Clause?
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1418.533,1423.696,--Whatever right... in... in a criminal prosecution the Bill of Rights would apply to that person.
2004.03-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1423.696,1425.637,Is he... is he a person within the meaning--
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1425.637,1425.804,Yes.
2004.03-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1431.209,1438.147,"--And is he a person who has a right to liberty, entitled to some protection, very, very, very minimal, but there is some protection to that... that individual."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1438.147,1440.293,It... depending upon the context.
2004.03-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.029,1443.637,"Well, the context is he got off a boat."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1452.226,1456.313,--He has no substantive due process right to be released into the United States.
2004.03-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.313,1459.079,He... he doesn't have a right to be released.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1462.068,1463.183,"No, absolutely not."
2004.03-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.298,1466.322,He does have some... some minimal protection under the Constitution.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1466.322,1470.659,Absolutely not. The formulation... and this was used in... in the Court's decision in Landon v. Plasencia.

2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1505.543,1506.536,Can I say what it is?
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1506.536,1507.195,"--Yes, I'm sorry."
2004.03-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1507.195,1522.883,I thought there was a reg... to be sure we're talking about the same thing... where the INS has said that Zadvydas applies to individuals who run into the United States illegally from Mexico.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1524.573,1528.167,The... the INS has... or now DHS has applied it.
2004.03-878,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1544.574,1545.689,But is that the current INS--
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.689,1547.812,"--Mr. Kneedler, may I... may I try to get in the question I did earlier?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1558.57,1568.851,"--No, because those were lawful permanent residents whose... whose lawful permanent residency had... had... they came in under a grant of lawful permanent residency."
2004.03-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.851,1570.17,So this is a new string to your bow in this case.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1570.17,1573.764,"Yes, because these aliens entered the United States only--"
2004.03-878,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1573.764,1580.451,--But it wouldn't... it wouldn't apply to the illegal alien because it's a statute that governs parole and they're not paroled into the United States.
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1580.451,1587.222,--But someone... someone who would be picked up would be an applicant for admission and could be released under this... under this statute.
2004.03-878,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1590.648,1591.27,How does that--
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1591.27,1592.134,--this is the only way someone could--
2004.03-878,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1592.134,1597.147,"--How does that make that person, the illegal entrant, a parolee?"
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1597.147,1602.72,"--He would be an applicant for admission, and the... I... I believe... I believe I'm correct on that."
2004.03-878,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1602.72,1604.577,"Suppose he says, I don't want to apply for admission."
2004.03-878,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1606.246,1609.945,The act treats him as an applicant for admission under 1225(a)(1).
2004.03-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.431,1613.372,"Very well, Mr. Kneedler."
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,1617.664,1623.691,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-878,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1652.215,1657.045,"Before you get to that, do you think that that's the only statute applicable here?"
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,1665.385,1670.131,"Justice Scalia, I don't believe it provides an independent basis for detention."
2004.03-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.806,1756.695,"Well, how do you explain then, Ms. Dahl, the language in the Court's Zadvydas opinion that had, were we dealing with, in effect, off-shore aliens, this would be a much different case?"
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,1756.695,1762.845,"I believe it would present a different question, but the constitutional issues presented by indefinite detention remain."
2004.03-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.785,1773.042,"So you say that a person, even though they're not lawfully admitted into the United States, still couldn't be indefinitely detained."
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,1773.042,1775.848,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is our... our point precisely."
2004.03-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.562,1799.586,"Well, the Government distinguishes that case."
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,1801.211,1801.937,--We disagree.
2004.03-878,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1860.183,1862.949,"Well, what do you think we should do with the 1182?"
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,1884.703,1890.897,"Well, the 1182(d)(5)(A) doesn't provide for indefinite detention."
2004.03-878,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1937.913,1951.925,"Well, but you haven't answered, I think, the question of whether the Government is entitled in this case, if we dispose of the 1231 question, to resort to the other statute."
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,1951.925,1973.745,"--I don't think that the Court could carve out a statute and use it in a way contrary to the way it functions in the immigration scheme and make superfluous or irrelevant a more express, more detailed statutory provision."
2004.03-878,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1973.745,1978.287,"Well, what you're saying is that even if 1182 comes first, 1231 comes second."
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,1978.287,1979.894,"Precisely, Your Honor."
2004.03-878,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.191,1992.526,"But still, is this another... could... could we do this?"
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2031.043,2036.41,I don't think so because I don't think that 1182 allows the interpretation that the Government--
2004.03-878,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2036.41,2040.702,"And that's your view of... of what 1182 means, and they're going to have a different view."
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2047.64,2063.364,"--What the Ninth Circuit found, though, in questions of an inadmissible alien, that this Court's construction of 1231(a)(6) in Zadvydas applied and there would be no need for resort to any other statute."
2004.03-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.364,2079.052,May I ask if you believe the supervision after the 90-day period covered in subparagraph 3... is there... can that continue indefinitely in your view?
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2079.052,2080.993,Yes.
2004.03-878,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2146.258,2154.227,"How long had the... the detainee in, however you pronounce it, Mezei lived in the United States?"
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2154.227,2162.994,"--Mr. Mezei had been in the United States for 25 years before he left, and he was gone for an extended period of time."
2004.03-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2199.385,2203.268,"Well, I don't think it really said they... they found there was a security risk."
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2208.013,2209.212,That's correct.
2004.03-878,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2209.212,2229.396,"What's... what's your best answer to the Government's argument that unless you treat this case differently from Zadvydas, at least for purposes of reasonable time or reasonable interest, which affects time, the United States is basically defenseless against countries that... that want to dump undesirable aliens and force them into the United States?"
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2229.396,2236.166,"I don't think that applying the statute, as it's written, leaves the Government defenseless."
2004.03-878,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2236.166,2237.28,Because.
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2237.28,2240.624,"Congress can pass another statute, if it needs to, and the Government--"
2004.03-878,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2240.624,2242.481,But it's defenseless under the present law?
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2242.481,2243.474,--I disagree.
2004.03-878,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2244.339,2245.519,Then what is the defense?
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2245.519,2248.386,--We have very effective means of interdicting--
2004.03-878,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2248.386,2248.863,What are they?
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2248.863,2266.036,"--Well, after the Mariel boatlift, the Government changed its policy and now intercepts people who are coming from Cuba by boat and detains them at Guantanamo Bay, does a screening, and has a more effective repatriation process for people that they do not want to come in."
2004.03-878,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2266.036,2266.574,You want us to take--
2004.03-878,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2266.574,2268.887,"So you're saying they can actually exclude, in practical terms."
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2268.887,2269.546,Yes.
2004.03-878,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2270.372,2274.004,--You want us to take judicial notice that the Mexican border and American border is impervious?
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2274.626,2278.462,--I think that would present a different question.
2004.03-878,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2289.32,2297.593,And there's no... and... and there's no answer to Justice Souter's question with regard to people who... who... once they enter that way.
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2298.047,2299.146,"--Well, the Government has--"
2004.03-878,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.146,2300.648,Except a new statute.
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2300.648,2307.691,"--Well, Congress has... has, by definition, treated those people as inadmissible aliens who are subject to removal proceedings."
2004.03-878,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2315.426,2321.066,"But they... in any case, those individuals are not the subject of sort of dumping action by their own governments."
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2321.066,2322.302,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-878,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.302,2333.614,"Does the... Congress has passed a special statute with respect to terrorism, hasn't it, where it does authorize detention of any of these people who are engaged in terrorism."
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2340.756,2349.794,"Well, if... well, first of all, the Government has the ability to detain, pending the removal proceedings, of people who are trying to come into the country."
2004.03-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2367.627,2371.054,But are... are the people here charged with any sort of terrorist activities?
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2376.505,2377.081,--That's correct.
2004.03-878,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.022,2380.425,"Just normal, harmless criminals."
2004.03-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2380.425,2380.962,Yes.
2004.03-878,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.962,2381.418,Right?
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2382.094,2393.428,--Their release from prison presents the same issues that the release of any person who has served the sentences that were imposed after the commission of a crime.
2004.03-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2393.428,2399.001,"Well, except that with aliens, they can be deported, whereas a citizen can't be, upon release from prison."
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2399.001,2400.115,That's correct.
2004.03-878,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2444.221,2446.805,I thought the other person was named Benitez.
2004.03-878,1,18767,christine_s_dahl,,2453.83,2454.357,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.495,2476.814,"Thank you, Ms. Dahl."
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,2479.621,2489.092,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2611.676,2613.8,"Well, you... you skipped a... a phrase."
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,2627.818,2630.874,That custody is the custody under 1225(b)(2)(A).
2004.03-878,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2749.638,2774.613,"How do you... how do you answer the Government's argument that this is necessary, that the United States shouldn't effectively be punished for being humanitarian, and if we can't hold these people, if we're forced to let them in, then any rogue nation can dump anyone it wants on the United States and we can't stop it?"
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,2774.613,2776.016,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-878,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2824.851,2827.657,"Well, you... you might wait a while if you went to the United Nations or--"
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,2834.139,2843.261,"--Sure, and our Government has demonstrated that it believes in preemptive... preemptive action and we can go in and have regime change in Cuba if it... if it is such a threat."
2004.03-878,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.486,2854.778,"But this... this regime is not sending, you know, an armed flotilla to Florida."
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,2864.438,2864.993,That was less than 1 percent--
2004.03-878,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2864.993,2865.719,--to bomb Cuba because of that.
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,2865.719,2869.351,--That was less than 1 percent of the Cubans who came in the Mariel boatlift.
2004.03-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2895.419,2902.599,"What you... what you mean when you say we can forcibly return them is literally we can take them to Guantanamo, take them to the gate, and push them out?"
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,2902.599,2903.879,--That's one option.
2004.03-878,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2925.345,2951.822,"I thought... maybe I... I misunderstood you, but I thought that one of your points were even assuming that we couldn't send these people back into Cuba without having a major conflagration, the rogue dictator is not going to be deterred by our tossing even into the sea the people that he doesn't want."
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,2951.822,2954.119,That... that is my point.
2004.03-878,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2981.526,2981.914,"Anyway, it's a little drastic."
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,2987.47,2988.668,--Exactly.
2004.03-878,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3016.306,3017.17,"Well, it's a policy decision either way."
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,3022.372,3023.365,That's correct.
2004.03-878,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3053.308,3062.103,"How do you explain, Mr. Mills, the language that the Court used, pointing out how different this kind of a case would have been from the... from the Zadvydas case?"
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,3062.103,3062.557,--Sure.
2004.03-878,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3100.452,3106.806,"It might have been a... a means of warning Congress off one area, but not the other."
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,3122.305,3126.186,I think that that is absolutely a... a conclusion that can be drawn that Congress--
2004.03-878,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3126.186,3127.013,"Of course, I dissented in that case."
2004.03-878,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.992,3130.273,But it... it's interesting.
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,3145.505,3146.62,--That's absolutely correct.
2004.03-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3221.955,3234.504,"Well, what about the argument that the statute, in effect, limits the... our... our interpretation limits the... the detention to a period reasonably related to the Government's interest in accomplishing that interest?"
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,3272.11,3277.394,My answer to that is that that might be a... a legislative policy decision to make that distinction.
2004.03-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3300.346,3303.318,There is only one class of excludables by the Government's own choice.
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,3304.804,3308.974,"--After a removal proceeding, there is only one class."
2004.03-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3309.512,3309.984,Yes.
2004.03-878,2,31986,john_s_mills,,3309.984,3318.036,"If there are no more questions, I would just ask that the Court reverse in this case."
2004.03-878,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3362.823,3363.816,"Thank you, Mr. Mills."
2004.03-878,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3366.538,3367.941,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.03-878,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3419.461,3428.171,"What's your... what's your answer to Mr.... Mr. Mills' position that the Government has, in fact, statutorily waived that distinction by creating one class of excludables?"
2004.03-878,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3428.171,3431.228,"--It... with respect... with respect, it has not."
