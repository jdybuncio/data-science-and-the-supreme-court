2002.02-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.024,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 02-69, Joseph Roell, Petra Garibay, and James Reagan versus John Michael Withrow."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,12.715,16.884,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,53.832,55.606,How about Rule 73(b)?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,55.606,65.553,"Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, Rule 73 does require that the parties execute a consent form filed with the court, and it did not occur in this case."
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,112.326,117.732,Do you agree that the consent has to precede the action of the magistrate?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,117.732,119.795,"Yes, Justice Stevens, we do."
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,119.795,125.079,So that there had to have been consent before he took any... the magistrate took any action in the case?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,125.079,128.506,Any case-dispositive actions under section 636(c)--
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,130.735,144.481,"So that an hour into the trial, somebody hands counsel a note that says, Your Honor, we've made a mistake, our office said we can't consent to this, the trial, the magistrate should say, too late, you've appeared, you've been deemed to have given consent?"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,144.481,145.512,Yes.
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,146.977,150.199,"So it's like double jeopardy when this first witness is sworn, or something like that?"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,150.199,163.945,"Well, certainly, consent in our view is predicated on two things, and first it's notice that the magistrate judge is proceeding in this case-dispositive authority, and notice that the party has an opportunity to decline to consent to that procedure."
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,163.945,166.34,So the first dispositive motion that he rules on?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,166.34,173.377,"Certainly, that would be a signal, and yes, if a party did not object at that point, after being on notice that the magistrate judge was exercising case-dispositive authority."
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,173.377,179.055,"Well, then, we need a whole jurisprudence parallel to the simple rules that you all didn't follow."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,179.055,181.822,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,182.11,187.024,We need a whole jurisprudence that's parallel to the simple rule.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,207.539,209.974,"--We would respectfully disagree, Justice Kennedy."
2002.02-69,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.869,250.636,"Was he represented at the trial, Withrow?"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,250.636,251.667,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,254.268,259.386,So... so your rule is that a pro se defendant has to tell the State of Texas how to comply with the Federal rules?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,259.386,261.327,"No, Justice Kennedy."
2002.02-69,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.187,285.187,But she was... she--
2002.02-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.187,298.356,"--Well, can... can local rules in one district produce a different result than another district which didn't have that local review with respect to this sort of consent?"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,298.356,300.131,"--Absolutely not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-69,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,310.988,321.224,"This local rule did require express... it required consent in writing before the... the proceeding, didn't it?"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,321.224,336.911,"--Yes, before even the case could be referred the local requirement existed, but that was departed from both by the clerk, who provided a form to the district judge before it had been signed by the parties, and by the district judge himself, who referred the case without waiting for all parties' consent, or even all parties' service."
2002.02-69,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,336.911,342.938,"Do... do we know how this came about, because the magistrate, she was certainly aware of it."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,342.938,342.938,Absolutely.
2002.02-69,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,342.938,353.341,"And she asked the State, do you consent, and whoever was representing the State said, well, I have no authority to do that today."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,353.341,367.791,"That was at a preliminary proceeding, Justice Ginsburg, a Spears hearing, that was determine whether or not plaintiff Withrow's claim should even be permitted to proceed, or whether he should be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis and whether service would be affected."
2002.02-69,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,457.244,459.807,And one of the defendants did put in a form.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,459.807,504.677,"Yes, who was represented by separate counsel, and that counsel did follow the instructions from the court and... and did comply, and that was not complied with by the attorney who was representing the two defendants at trial in this case, but everything that that attorney did was consistent with and demonstrated the parties' consent in this instance, including filing a dispositive motion with the... the court that the magistrate judge could grant only if she had authority under subsection (c), and only if she had the parties' consent, and when she denied that motion and made that adverse ruling, that she could only do with the parties' consent, these defendants never once objected, they did not dispute that they consented, instead, they asked her to reconsider the merits of their summary judgment motion."
2002.02-69,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,504.677,530.933,"Ms. Eskow, the statute, 636(c)(2), deals with the clerk of the court shall notify the parties of the availability of a magistrate, and then it goes on to say, the decision of the parties shall be communicated to the clerk of the court."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,540.926,546.786,"Certainly, communicated to... to the clerk suggests that... that the clerk will be informed of the decision."
2002.02-69,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,555.785,557.726,And satisfied that requirement?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,557.726,557.726,"--It would, and moreover, it's subsection (1) that discusses the authority of the magistrate judge--"
2002.02-69,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,557.726,563.299,Yes.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,563.299,569.409,--and speaks only of consent that is the provision of the statute in which Congress gave this grant of authority.
2002.02-69,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,569.409,569.698,Yes.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,569.698,577.378,"Subsection (2) is a procedural mechanism for ensuring the voluntariness, the requirement under subsection (1)."
2002.02-69,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.378,580.639,"And was it complied with here fully, do you think--"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,580.639,581.465,With subsection--
2002.02-69,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,581.465,582.375,--subsection (2)?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,582.375,585.469,"--Subsection (2), in this instance, no."
2002.02-69,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,606.729,610.444,May I just ask you a technical question about the local rule?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,624.456,625.487,"Yes, Justice Souter."
2002.02-69,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,698.184,705.986,I take it from your argument this morning you would say that these defendants... suppose they lost.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,719.732,733.107,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, if the court were to adopt an inferred consent rule and... and determine consent based on the parties' voluntary conduct beforehand, and there was notice, and there was a clear indication of conforming to 636(c)--"
2002.02-69,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,733.107,735.958,But I'm not asking the question hypothetically.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,737.323,737.982,--In this case?
2002.02-69,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,747.658,768.53,"But if the defendants, having lost instead of having prevailed, then said, aha, now we can get out of it because we never formalized our consent, you... you are saying that they could not have... that on these, on the facts of this case they could not have bowed out if they lost?"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,768.53,769.728,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-69,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,831.688,839.823,"Ms. Eskow, I take it all of the courts of appeals that have addressed this question have found express consent required?"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,839.823,845.806,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's absolutely true, but there's nothing in the statute that makes that requirement."
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.436,887.664,"You suggested earlier that the second sentence of... of (c)... of (c)(1) contains the written... the writing request, whereas the first second... sentence doesn't."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,887.664,888.036,Yes.
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,888.036,897.241,"But the writing request in the second sentence is a request for the... the magistrate to participate, rather than the consent itself."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,913.838,927.251,"We would read the statute differently, Justice Stevens, that the fact that it says, upon the consent of the parties pursuant to their specific request, would indicate that the consent of the parties has to be pursuant to their written request."
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.251,931.959,"That's right, but there doesn't have to be a written request with respect to the first sentence."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,938.563,941.414,We would respectfully disagree.
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.414,941.635,Yes.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,941.635,947.169,"That the writing requirement only exists with respect to the part-time magistrate judge, and that that goes to the consent as well."
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.169,948.488,That's not expressed.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,962.706,972.943,"Well, certainly respondent has a variety of writing requirements, and one that they deem to be dictated by the local rules as well, which is something that's not spoken to in subsection (c)(1)."
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.199,982.025,"Well, of course, that's the issue."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,982.025,983.101,--in any form.
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.101,983.883,"Yes, that's the issue."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,983.883,996.476,"And the absence of that we believe is significant because... in these other provisions because in the misdemeanor trial authority, it requires consent, and is probably the closest analogy to the trial authority in subsection (c)(1)."
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1002.42,1013.77,"The obvious reading of a statute like this I would think, and you tell me why I'm not right, but it just means consent in such form as the judicial conference or local rules provide."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1023.142,1027.494,"Certainly, Congress is aware of the common sense meaning of consent, and in substance--"
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1027.494,1043.204,"Well, it's also aware that they're writing a statute for the judiciary that's implemented through rule, and where you have a term like this, that is implemented through rule, that everybody would think it would be implemented through rule, the word consent in the statute means consent in the form that the rules provide."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1050.141,1063.023,"--We don't believe it's obvious, Justice Breyer, because if it was the form of the local rules, or the form of consent prescribed by local rules that determined the authority, you would have magistrate judges with different authority in a variety of jurisdictions across the country."
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1063.023,1064.713,So what's wrong with that?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1070.707,1075.01,Certainly it may be a good idea as a matter of policy--
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1075.01,1076.208,"No, no, it's a matter of law."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1076.208,1076.408,--to require.
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1076.408,1077.489,It's a matter of law.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1086.406,1105.065,"Certainly, our view is that because Congress specified the requirements for local rules in a separate subsection than the consent requirement itself, it was anticipating that there would be some need to protect the voluntariness, but that it is the voluntariness that's the cornerstone, and that it would be a matter of administrative discretion on the local level."
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1105.065,1108.204,"--Assume you lose on that, just for the sake of argument."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1108.204,1108.576,Yes.
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1108.576,1115.096,Then I guess the other question is whether you can cure the violation by not objecting on appeal.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1115.096,1117.985,That certainly is the question.
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.985,1119.183,And what is your answer to that?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1119.183,1119.926,"The... yes, absolutely."
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1119.926,1120.752,Because?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1120.752,1126.863,"Because the underlying voluntary consent is there through the parties' conduct, and to the extent the court construes the statute--"
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1126.863,1130.329,"No, no, I'm saying, suppose that there is not consent."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1161.498,1161.748,"--Well, certainly--"
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.748,1163.606,"Now what, about that?"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1163.606,1189.156,"--Assuming there is a violation of... of the rule, and that their consent is not lacking, the question is, what is the consequence for noncompliance with the rule, and certainly the failure to comply with these procedures, for that to be an automatic grounds for reversal would be a deviation from accepted practice, which is a party has to object to a proceeding, has to preserve error, and here, no party objected, and it is their personal right to the Article III judge."
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1189.778,1190.725,But the argument is--
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1190.725,1190.725,--that is at stake.
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1190.725,1194.319,"--of course, that you can't cure a basic jurisdictional problem."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1209.301,1239.188,"Well, certainly, if Congress had not provided for a scheme that existed, and the parties randomly invoked the authority of a person on the street, that would be a problem, but here, you have a magistrate judge who has been specifically assigned by Congress to perform this function and has been designated by the district judge of the court, and the only question is, have the parties agreed, and if... and if no party objects to that and the magistrate judge enters the final judgment, even if there's been noncompliance with the rules, the question is, what is the harm, and even--"
2002.02-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1239.188,1242.782,So you say basically this isn't jurisdictional in the strict sense of the word?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1242.782,1243.775,--No.
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1253.268,1259.295,"Do you think it's like personal jurisdiction, or more... it's more like personal jurisdiction or subject matter--"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1259.295,1259.666,It's more--
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1259.666,1266.559,"--Because if you say personal, then you have on your side the rule that a general appearance, general... as a--"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1266.559,1267.014,--Absolutely.
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1267.014,1269.51,--as a rule waives deficiencies.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1269.51,1272.648,"And that it can be waived inadvertently, even by failing to timely assert the person--"
2002.02-69,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1272.648,1313.599,"My question is why, because the argument that it is like a person on the street is that a magistrate who is not an Article III judge is going to preside over a jury trial, and the result of that trial will have all the trappings and... and dignity and enforcement power of a judgment of a court of the United States, and the only way this could possibly occur is if the parties consent, particularly since it's a jury trial, and where they don't consent, he really is like a person off the street, because of the importance of what the parties are giving up in order to obtain his judgment rather than that of an Article III judge."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1317.314,1356.983,"--Well, certainly in Peretz versus United States this Court considered a circumstance where, in a felony trial, a magistrate judge was supervising the voir dire, and the defendant's counsel did not make any objection to that when it went on, and this Court determined, both from a personal litigant Article III perspective, as well as from a structural perspective, that there was no infirmity in that procedure, and that a defendant who does not assert his right to an Article III judge has no cognizable right that he can enforce, and that would be the same circumstance here, for the same reasons why the felony voir dire was permissible without objection of the defendant in Peretz versus United States."
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1400.906,1423.485,"One of... one of the insulating features in the suggested form and the rules of civil procedure makes it express that the consent form is not to be communicated to the judge or the magistrate in order to protect the attorneys who don't consent so that the magistrate or the judge doesn't know which party doesn't consent, and your rule completely destroys that."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1423.485,1425.526,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1450.584,1460.82,"Well, no, but you... you presume a regime in which the magistrate said, I'm ready to proceed, and you... somebody stands up and says, well, I don't consent."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1467.879,1478.076,"Well, certainly in many circumstances the... the local rules do provide for the communication to the clerk, and that is what Rule 73 provides."
2002.02-69,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1497.529,1498.881,Where did... where did the Congress do that?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1499.83,1540.408,"--In 1990, Congress amended subsection (c)(2) to loosen the consent requirements, and certainly it still anticipated that the decision is going to go to the clerk of court, but magistrate judges and district judges are not prohibited from discussing the matter of a referral with the parties, and if a party failed to sign the requisite form, certainly there'd be no... no prejudice by proceeding to inform the judge at the time that the issue came up that they did consent, and certainly, to... to wait until the eve of trial, when every indication was that they had consented, and to withdraw it at that point, an inferred consent rule would be more consistent with holding the parties to the benefit of their bargain."
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.408,1543.298,May I just make one... ask you one clarifying question for me?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1551.926,1554.155,"No, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.151,1562.04,But... but wasn't there a finding that that did not occur in this case?
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1562.04,1565.755,"No, Your Honor, the... only a finding that they did not expressly consent."
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.668,1591.351,"The statutory provision that you... that you cited, which provides for subsequent discussions, is predicated on the fact that consent has first been communicated to the clerk of the court."
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1591.351,1592.383,Well--
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.383,1602.309,So Congress basically talked about this discussion process against the backdrop of a consent form that had already been communicated to the clerk.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1602.309,1603.983,"--We would disagree, Justice Kennedy."
2002.02-69,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1611.042,1612.899,But that's not what the statute says.
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1612.899,1623.924,"--to inform the parties of the availability, irrespective of whether they had actually already consented, because too many magistrate judges and district judges believed that they... they could not go on record."
2002.02-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.924,1625.41,"Do you want to reserve the remainder of your time, Ms. Eskow?"
2002.02-69,0,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,1625.41,1626.403,Thank you.
2002.02-69,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.403,1629.004,"Ms. Frost, we'll hear from you."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1629.004,1635.42,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-69,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1651.045,1656.512,"Oh, the text does not require express consent."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1657.611,1658.066,--I'd like to--
2002.02-69,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1658.066,1659.18,It does not.
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1664.298,1665.95,"--The word, express, is not there, Your Honor."
2002.02-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.211,1681.388,What part of 73(b) uses the word express?
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1681.388,1684.443,"73(b) refers... it does not use the word express, Your Honor."
2002.02-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.443,1690.676,"So then neither the statute nor the rule use the term express, as you suggested earlier."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1690.676,1692.162,"Neither use the term, express."
2002.02-69,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1731.421,1733.112,"Well, it could be implied."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1745.744,1748.966,"I... I respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
2002.02-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1786.755,1788.896,But wasn't there a trial?
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1788.896,1790.182,"Yes, there certainly was, Your Honor."
2002.02-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1790.182,1792.699,They... they did participate in the trial.
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1792.699,1793.442,Yes.
2002.02-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1793.442,1801.616,"So even if filing that motion did not give implied consent, perhaps it could be argued that simply participating in the trial gave it."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1801.616,1817.674,"Yes, Your Honor, that is petitioners' argument, and the reason I think that argument cannot be... is not in accord with the language of the Magistrates Act is, first of all, consent is used consistently throughout the act to be... to mean an express statement."
2002.02-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1836.25,1839.305,But it's used in a little bit different sense there.
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1860.277,1876.169,"--Well, I respectfully disagree, Your Honor, because both provisions, 636(h) and 636(c)(1) use the term, upon consent, and I think that where Congress used the same term throughout the statute, it should be interpreted to have the same meaning, but that's not the only provision I rely on."
2002.02-69,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1896.602,1897.262,Why not?
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1927.91,1942.028,"Justice Ginsburg, the answer to your question is that there is in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12, which says that showing up will be waiving your right, and here we have a statute that requires consent, and it's important to look at why Congress wanted that."
2002.02-69,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1955.114,1958.169,I could understand that in the abstract.
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,1984.647,1988.633,"I think not, Your Honor, for a few reasons."
2002.02-69,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1998.83,2004.031,"Well, how... how could they have made that argument in this case, say, well, we just forgot about the rule, we didn't know, or--"
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2004.031,2005.723,--The argument they would make is--
2002.02-69,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2005.723,2012.289,"--I... I just can't imagine what the State Attorney General would say, after having participated in a trial and say, well you know, I really didn't consent."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2012.289,2030.0,"--I think that what the State Attorney General would say was, I had not realized that my... I had not realized that I had not checked with my clients, that I had not... because the State Attorney General took this case over, he... he could say, I had not realized that my clients had not already agreed to do this, they have a right to an Article III judge."
2002.02-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.0,2036.688,"Well, but it... I mean, who... who is the Attorney General's client except State officials?"
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2036.688,2052.292,"Well, I think, Your Honor... that's true, Your Honor, but these questions go to the question of whether Congress intended different consent standards for different parties, and also to the question of whether Congress would want this kind of satellite litigation on the question of consent."
2002.02-69,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2074.955,2074.971,But Ms. Frost--
2002.02-69,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.971,2076.152,"--Well, once this--"
2002.02-69,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2076.152,2082.347,--you're asking them to engage in much more than satellite litigation over consent.
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2099.475,2111.53,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is true in this case, but if the rule is explicit consent rather than inferred consent, and if that is established as the rule, then there will be far fewer occasions on which mistakes are made."
2002.02-69,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2111.53,2114.707,--But it was the... but it was the local rule.
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2114.707,2115.533,Yes.
2002.02-69,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2115.533,2133.244,"And it... and... so we're dealing with only the consequences, and I could see if this were a big question of subject matter jurisdiction, you'd say that the parties can't waive that, but this kind of rule is at a much lower level."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2133.244,2135.595,"Well, I respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
2002.02-69,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2150.456,2157.886,"No, but if you're saying that that jurisdiction is on the level, as I think you are, on the level with subject matter jurisdiction--"
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2157.886,2158.175,Yes.
2002.02-69,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2158.175,2166.514,"--then it seems to me you've proved too much, because if it were... if Congress were assuming it was on that level, Congress wouldn't have done this in the first place."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2183.688,2186.782,"I respectfully disagree, Justice Souter, and here's why."
2002.02-69,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2192.726,2200.118,"No, but I mean, we... I'll... I'll grant you that... I mean, I read the statute, this... and the rule the same way you do."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2248.416,2253.45,"--I would not put it quite in those terms, in terms of less significant."
2002.02-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2273.102,2280.571,"630... 636(c), as you point out, talks about the consent of the parties."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2294.112,2308.972,"First notice... that's, I think, a question that's... it's arguable, but I would think that the argument would be that no, the client at that point is bound by the attorney's representation, just as clients are bound by their attorney's representations in many other situations."
2002.02-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2308.972,2313.142,But they aren't bound by their attorney's representations in some criminal cases.
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2316.652,2339.808,"I... I think the... it's arguable, but the answer I think is no, because there are many very important decisions that counsel... they're supposed to consult with their client and, indeed, it would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Responsibility if they didn't in this instance on this question of consent, but if for some reason the counsel made an error, frequently litigants are at the mercy of their counsel."
2002.02-69,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2339.808,2356.898,"I... I thought they were going to ask... I agree, Peretz is not in point, because it's an issue where they did consent, but the... the... there is a doctrine called the de facto officer doctrine, and that means that if it's a fairly unimportant error, it can be waived."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2388.932,2398.303,"Yes, well, Justice Breyer, the first response to the de facto officer doctrine is that that is supposed to apply to minor errors, and--"
2002.02-69,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.303,2398.775,That's right.
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2400.078,2400.449,--And--
2002.02-69,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2400.449,2404.786,"Because after all it's not that important, given the fact they gave the consent anyway."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2408.129,2417.622,"--I was going to say, it's not that important considering the fact that they expressly consented after the fact of the trial, but that, of course, cannot be what this Court relies on, or--"
2002.02-69,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.622,2421.133,"No, but I'm asking you really to answer, why isn't it trivial?"
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2433.308,2452.877,"--Justice Breyer, the answer to your question is first that Congress created it as a jurisdictional threshold, second, that Congress was very aware of the constitutional issues that arise when you delegate Article III powers to non-Article III actors, and for that reason, Congress repeatedly stated it wanted consent to be voluntary, knowing, and willing."
2002.02-69,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2461.255,2464.393,"But then, if it's jurisdictional as you say--"
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2464.393,2464.765,--Uh-huh.
2002.02-69,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2464.765,2469.678,--then why doesn't 1653 control?
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2506.952,2531.267,"I think that would not be sufficient, Your Honor, because it would change the language of the statute, and in addition it would... the question would have to arise, what would happen if the Attorney General came in at the end of this process and said, I didn't consent, and I think that there would be a strong basis on this record for the Attorney General to proceed on that argument successfully."
2002.02-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2560.162,2569.244,"Is the customary way in the Southern District of Texas to caption a pleading, Before the Magistrate Judge, if the magistrate judge is presiding?"
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2569.244,2572.877,I do not know the customary way that pleadings are captioned.
2002.02-69,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2590.217,2591.824,What did the later pleadings have?
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2591.824,2592.818,--Nothing.
2002.02-69,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2617.625,2635.625,"What happens with our... suppose you have a defective diversity suit, and you get up to the court of appeals and suddenly discover that one of the defendants is from the same State, that there are many defendants, and so the party says, oh, don't worry, we'll drop him out, so they drop him out at the appellate stage."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2639.833,2653.086,"This Court's decision in the Caterpillar case held that as long as there is the... as long as diversity is met at the time of the entry of judgment, then that is acceptable, but that isn't your hypothetical."
2002.02-69,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2653.086,2654.572,"Entry of which judgment, of the lower court's--"
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2654.572,2654.944,"The district court, the lower court's judgment."
2002.02-69,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2654.944,2659.38,"--The district court, so you'd say if we're doing it by analogy, you win?"
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2659.38,2659.856,Yes.
2002.02-69,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2661.138,2666.505,Who do you suppose was intended to be protected by these congressional requirements?
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2686.009,2687.085,No.
2002.02-69,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2708.012,2716.351,"Okay, but if... if we say, this does not rise to the level of structural problems, which is what we were getting at--"
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2716.351,2716.557,Yes.
2002.02-69,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2716.557,2742.192,"--earlier when we were saying, well, it doesn't rise to the level of personal jurisdiction, so if we say, that's not really involved here, then it's merely a personal protection, and I suppose it's a personal protection for the purpose who... for the person who can give or refuse consent, and as long as your client said, fine with me to be tried by a magistrate judge, why isn't the end of it, that the end of it for you?"
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2742.192,2749.045,"Because my client never consented to what happened here, which is that the Attorney General, by failing to consent--"
2002.02-69,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2749.045,2759.532,"Well, you're saying my client never consented that they could get by without giving a written consent, but that... I mean, that, it seems to me, is turning the whole premise on its head."
2002.02-69,1,15969,amanda_frost,,2759.532,2761.101,"--I have a slightly different point I'm trying to make, Justice Souter, which is--"
2002.02-69,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2761.101,2761.473,Okay.
2002.02-69,2,34381,lisa_r_eskow,,3235.953,3298.096,"Because the statute was designed to protect the voluntariness of the parties, and the local rules and the Federal rules also serve that purpose, and here you have no party suggesting that they were coerced or involuntarily dragged before a magistrate judge rather than an Article III judge, to reverse in these circumstances, as the Fifth Circuit did, to sua sponte investigate consent when there is no question, where no one is claiming to have been involuntarily dragged before the magistrate judge, would be to import some sort of automatic, per se, plain error, subject matter jurisdictional principle into a context that is not based on subject matter jurisdiction but, rather, the particularity of a particular officer presiding and, as Justice Breyer noted, the de facto officer doctrine exists to insulate judgments from attack that have a technical deficiency, for example, not signing a consent form."
