2004.04-169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.802,We'll hear argument next in Graham County Soil & Water Conservation District v. the United States.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,70.874,74.868,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-169,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.415,237.897,"Mr. Browning, this argument that you're making, where you seem to be having great solicitude for the... for the whistleblowers, for the people who might be retaliated against... the respondent and the Solicitor General answer your argument by saying in all the years that 3730(h) retaliation claims have been available, there has been no instance of qui tam plaintiff barred because the retaliation occurred outside the 6 but are there any actual cases where the retaliation in fact fell outside the 6-year, dated from the submission of the false claim?"
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,237.897,247.219,"Justice Ginsburg, I cannot cite to a specific situation where that has occurred, and the Government, you're right, makes very much of the argument that this is simply hypothetical."
2004.04-169,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,265.086,269.768,Maybe they don't get retaliated against if they testify at trial.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,269.768,270.099,--Well--
2004.04-169,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,270.099,281.127,And if the question is whether there is a problem out there in the real world on... for people whose interest is certainly not identical to yours.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,281.127,288.941,"--Your Honor, I recognize that, but you have to look at the statute as a whole to construe it in its proper context."
2004.04-169,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,324.438,324.859,All right.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,354.503,356.098,I cannot cite a specific example.
2004.04-169,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,370.913,371.335,Okay.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,409.729,429.429,"--Well, Your Honor, if Congress had said that, they certainly could have made that decision, but it would run completely contrary to almost 200 years of precedent from this Court that as a general rule, the limitations period does not begin to run before your cause of action even comes into existence."
2004.04-169,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,429.429,430.725,"Yes, that's true, it would be."
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,449.198,449.652,Well I--
2004.04-169,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,449.652,451.46,And I can't find that reason idiotic.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,451.46,485.513,"--Well, Your Honor, I... I don't think the language points to that because the language of the limitations period, 3731(b), which is set out in the appendix to the cert petition at page 135a... the language of the statute is a civil action under section 3730 may not be brought more than 6 years after the date of the violation of section 3729."
2004.04-169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.539,500.951,"Well, I... I don't mean to interrupt, but it is true that this is a civil action that's brought under 3730(h), is it not?"
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,500.951,504.044,"--The... the action is brought under 3730(h), and Justice Stevens--"
2004.04-169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,504.044,507.403,So it is literally within the plain language of the statute.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,507.403,508.705,"--Well, it is and it isn't."
2004.04-169,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,573.093,577.449,"It seems... it seems if you read a provision like this, it says what the United States would be required to prove."
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,589.353,590.691,"--Exactly, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-169,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,614.568,624.092,"Well, I don't think that's at all as clear as that (c) is directed to cases brought by the United States for the reason that Justice Breyer just explained."
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,635.047,664.242,"--And, Justice Ginsburg, my point is just as section 3731(c) is not intended to cover all of the causes of action under the False Claims Act, 3731(b) is not intended to cover all of the actions under the False Claims Act as well, that it's only intended to cover the causes of action in which a violation of section 3729 is an element of the cause of action."
2004.04-169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,687.9,695.702,"That's true, but is it also not true that some of the people who get retaliated against may be the same people who bring the qui tam action?"
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,695.702,698.757,"In some cases, that is... is the case, Justice--"
2004.04-169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,698.757,706.383,"So if they don't get the... recover as being the victim of retaliation, they may still get a very handsome reward for what happened to them."
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,706.383,718.569,"--That is the case, but... but I also want to point out that in many cases, the person who brings the qui tam action is a completely different plaintiff than the person who brings the retaliatory discharge action."
2004.04-169,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,768.072,770.05,"In the real world, do we have such cases?"
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,770.05,770.881,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-169,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,779.131,781.765,Another real-world question.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,799.589,800.175,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-169,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,812.83,830.078,"In connection with what's included and what isn't included, the... in that same 3731 provision in (d), (d) is limited to (a) and (b) and so excludes (h)."
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,839.549,865.447,"Your Honor, I would recognize that there is different language that Congress could have... have chosen to state this in a different way, but... and you're right, that in section 3731(d), Congress did specifically reference section 3730(a) and 3730(b), but Congress did not use that precision in drafting throughout the Federal False Claims Act."
2004.04-169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.471,880.546,They could have done the same in 3731(c) also.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,891.159,892.956,"3730(a), Justice Scalia."
2004.04-169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.956,893.083,(a).
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,896.502,896.698,Yes.
2004.04-169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,901.956,902.515,Sloppy--
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,902.515,903.463,--Yes.
2004.04-169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,903.463,903.576,--is what you can take.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,903.576,904.168,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.033,920.357,May I ask... may I ask you a question about the alternative?
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,926.575,927.252,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.252,945.827,"And I imagine because there are different forms of retaliation... sometimes it's a discharge, sometimes it might be slander by defaming the person for his next employer, it might be a tort, they beat him up or something, there could be a lot of different kinds of retaliation... each of which would give rise to a different statute of limitations under State law."
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,947.454,955.182,"Well, Your Honor, this Court has faced that situation with 1983 in a variety of contexts, and there are a number of--"
2004.04-169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.182,956.237,We had to make up a rule to fill a gap.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,956.237,958.738,--And... and in North Carolina it's easy.
2004.04-169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.838,974.789,"But what about Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and... and Florida?"
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,981.862,984.208,"--Your Honor, that is certainly an issue."
2004.04-169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.183,1001.006,"No, but in our construction of the statute, we have to think about its application throughout the United States, not just in North... North Carolina."
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1001.006,1013.117,"--Yes, and a rule that would apply the residual limitation period for personal injury would certainly be appropriate for a situation like this."
2004.04-169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1013.117,1026.739,Is it... is it a necessary element of a successful action for retaliatory discharge that... that the action under the False Claims Act have succeeded?
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1026.739,1027.665,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.195,1050.72,What does the Government contend is to be done under (b)(1) when no violation of section 3729 is committed?
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1050.72,1066.82,"Well, the way I read the Government's brief is they want to modify the language of section 3731(b) by inserting the phrase alleged before the phrase, violation of section 3729."
2004.04-169,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1066.82,1071.205,But don't we have to do that anyway when... when in fact a person brings an ordinary claim?
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1084.66,1104.35,"But... but, Justice Breyer, when the jury renders its verdict, if there is a violation of section 3729 that's proven to exist, but that... that proven violation is beyond the 6-year period, the defendant would be entitled to judgment based upon the affirmative--"
2004.04-169,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1104.35,1114.579,"You mean if in fact the plaintiff loses because the jury finds for the defendant in the qui tam action, then it should have been dismissed on statute of limitations grounds."
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1114.579,1114.995,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-169,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1115.502,1121.208,"No, of course not because... because the word is committed there refers to the claim of a plaintiff."
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1122.36,1136.418,"--What I'm... what I'm saying is you have to look at the facts that are ultimately proven at trial, and if the fact of the violation is more than 6 years from the filing of the cause of action, clearly that's going to be barred by the limitations period."
2004.04-169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.712,1161.708,"Well, it seems to me that if... if there's no violation, then there's no triggering event to start the statute of limitations running."
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1161.708,1164.359,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-169,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1232.512,1263.66,"Mr. Browning, is it proper to consider in the calculus that if you use 6 years from the date the... that the false claim was made or was alleged to be made, then you don't have to get into the question which State's statute of limitations, the choice of law question, and then when you identify that State, which limitation period within that State?"
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1276.71,1296.507,"--Justice Ginsburg, you're absolutely right, that if the respondents' and the Fourth Circuit's reading of the statute is correct, that Congress did intend this bizarre result to take place for all three causes of action, then you don't have to look to a State law cause of action to fill the gap."
2004.04-169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.634,1320.185,"We've done it for several hundred years, haven't we--"
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1320.185,1320.819,Yes.
2004.04-169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.819,1322.606,--for all Federal causes of action?
2004.04-169,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1323.949,1326.707,When there is no statute of limitations.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1326.707,1327.469,When... when--
2004.04-169,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1327.469,1328.638,The question is Federal statute.
2004.04-169,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1340.232,1355.693,"--There... there is a 6-year period and if that is applied by this Court to a retaliatory discharge action, there will still be difficulties because you will have situations where there is no violation of section 3729."
2004.04-169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1381.313,1382.678,"Very well, Mr. Browning."
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1386.187,1388.561,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.575,1435.19,Sloppiness.
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1442.933,1452.357,"--Well, I... I would propose that if Congress really wanted this trigger, wanted a uniform limitations period, they really couldn't have done this particular provision, (b)(1), in a more clear way."
2004.04-169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1452.357,1470.367,"Do you... do you know of... of any other situation in which a... a time limit is imposed that has nothing whatever to do with the... with the act that the individual is complaining about, nothing whatever to do with the act--"
2004.04-169,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1470.367,1474.069,And... and where the time limit begins to run even before the act occurs?
2004.04-169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.069,1474.8,--Before the act occurs.
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1474.8,1476.325,"The answer is no, but--"
2004.04-169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.325,1480.111,And the time limit could have expired before the act occurs.
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1484.234,1488.624,"--Sometimes equitable doctrines might apply, but the--"
2004.04-169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.624,1489.264,"No, wait."
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1490.464,1498.458,"--For instance, if the employer deliberately waited to retaliate until the 6 years has past, that could be an instance."
2004.04-169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.111,1523.98,"I thought that one of the major things they were concerned about was retaliation against witnesses in the qui tam action, and that will always occur after."
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1528.241,1531.696,I believe the core concern is to incentivize the whistleblower.
2004.04-169,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1596.187,1597.978,"Mr. Hurt, can you... can you go back a few steps?"
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1632.467,1635.906,"--Well, the SG's office informed us that they did a search of the reported cases."
2004.04-169,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1641.133,1641.352,All right.
2004.04-169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1641.352,1644.626,"You're now saying majority, not vast majority."
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1644.626,1645.698,Okay.
2004.04-169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1646.033,1646.972,"Well, wait for the SG."
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1650.139,1661.083,"--But they point out... they realized, I think, petitioners, that this is a problem that... that this is a unique act, and they... and they point out... they make the claim that the Major Fraud Act somehow renders this not unique."
2004.04-169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.211,1675.877,So you're reading alleged into... into (b)(1).
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1680.741,1682.351,"Well, no."
2004.04-169,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1787.283,1823.203,"Mr. Hurt, what... what about the argument that unlike most retaliation situations, here if you take that 6-year period, which is much longer than the general run of retaliation statutes take it, then you could have a qui tam plaintiff who waits while the back pay is mounting, and so you can have an exorbitant application both with respect to the amount of back pay and the claim for reinstatement."
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1842.034,1845.736,--I think that that type of situation is just so highly unlikely.
2004.04-169,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1859.292,1873.088,"No, but isn't... isn't Justice Ginsburg's question raised by your very argument, that you don't want whistleblowers having to bring their whistleblower actions before they are ready to bring their main actions?"
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1906.934,1912.56,I think that... I think there's a split in the lower courts about how the mitigation will apply.
2004.04-169,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1912.56,1914.496,"Well, let's... let's first see about your argument."
2004.04-169,1,35963,mark__t_hurt,,1916.5,1925.763,"I think that... that that is a possible case, but I think that that's... the priorities for the Government and... and Congress in drafting this law was to get money back for the Government."
2004.04-169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.393,2066.971,"Thank you, Mr. Hurt."
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2069.652,2082.762,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2110.431,2143.743,"What he's saying is it should be read to include only those causes of action under 3730 that the rest of (b) makes sense as applied to, just as in (c) the phrase, brought under section 3730, should be interpreted to... to include only those causes of action that the rest of that provision applies to, namely, those... those actions under 3730 that involve the United States."
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2146.42,2165.107,"--Section 3731(c) does not require, in its application, the Court to construe a civil action under section 3730 to mean anything other than what its words import because it only relates to the United States' burden of proof."
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.822,2220.608,"--You think... do you think Congress is more likely to amend 3731(b) to say clearly and non-sloppily what it means if we find for the Government here or if we find for the... I mean, for... for the side that the Government supports or if we find for the other side?"
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2220.608,2237.578,"Well, Your Honor, I think that 3731(b) is capable of application exactly as written, and in fact, as we say in our brief, that that is the statute of limitations which most serves the purposes of the statute unlike the alternative the petitioner--"
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2237.578,2241.22,What... what about this as a general... as a general principle of construction?
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2260.062,2260.697,--Well--
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.697,2262.084,Is that a reasonable proposition?
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2262.084,2262.692,"--No, sir."
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.692,2263.47,No?
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2263.47,2264.959,There are any--
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2264.959,2266.148,It seems to me reasonable to me.
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2266.148,2280.504,"--Many States have adopted statutes of repose, and they apply to a cause of action that under State law accrues for purposes of statute of limitations upon the discovery of the injury."
2004.04-169,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2307.625,2312.824,And that was the point that the Seventh Circuit made clear in... in its--
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2312.824,2313.422,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.04-169,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2313.422,2315.058,--statute of repose.

2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2323.954,2324.812,That's right.
2004.04-169,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.628,2327.004,I'm not sure it is right.
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2327.004,2336.464,--there other examples of... of cases in which the time in which a claim can be brought may have expired before the cause of action accrues.
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.464,2340.646,"But we don't run forward to create situations like that, do we?"
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2340.646,2341.318,Well--
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.318,2343.318,My... my point isn't that it couldn't exist.
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2351.488,2364.005,"--Well, in the Bay Area Laundry case and in the Reiter case, the Court has acknowledged that there is a general rule that statutes of limitations start to run when the cause of action accrues."
2004.04-169,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2465.234,2469.293,"Well, he's already alerted to the extent that he's taking retaliatory action as true."

2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2542.387,2542.883,--will be the same.
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.883,2545.24,--Can I ask you another textual question?
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2560.925,2575.772,"The... the most close reading of the text would be that any civil action under 3730 can be brought within 3 years of when the official of the United States... now, we differ from the Ninth Circuit on this."
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.106,2619.635,So that... that could exclude even a retaliation action by an individual who... who doesn't... who doesn't know when the... when the individual... the official of the United States found out about those facts.

2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2623.552,2628.378,That provision is very... very reasonable as applied to qui tam actions.
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2633.039,2650.911,"--Well, Your Honor, it... it does make sense applying it to a retaliation action because it could be, for instance, the employee who was the individual who informed the Government official charged with responsibility to act of the facts that would warrant the United States in filing an action under 3730(a)."
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2650.911,2655.428,"It might be, but maybe the United States found out before... before that individual came forward."

2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2663.938,2665.58,"Well, there may be events that--"
2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2665.58,2666.07,Strange.
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2666.07,2670.64,--There may be instances where the employee would not know that they could take advantage of that provision.

2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2761.794,2771.773,"--Well, again, we believe that the best, most faithful reading of the text is that (b)(2) is available to all causes of action under 3730."

2004.04-169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.213,2813.088,That's--

2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2825.841,2837.872,"--Well, Your Honor, in... in fact, if we... if we look more closely at those 14 cases, 5 of them were dismissed because the plaintiff was not even involved in protected conduct under the statute."

2004.04-169,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2902.228,2905.545,Apparently Florida didn't think it was too short.
2004.04-169,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2905.545,2911.998,"Well, Florida may have made an alternative policy decision in terms of wanting the claims to be litigated together or apart."
