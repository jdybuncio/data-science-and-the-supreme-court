1972.72-486,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,31.366,34.695,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,140.473,144.789,"When you say the matter first came, you’re talking historically not about this particular proceeding?"
1972.72-486,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,144.789,151.871,"That’s right, historically; it back was in 1956 or so."
1972.72-486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,337.887,356.453,"May I ask you a couple of questions, does the record of the -- does the legislative history show why Congress is concern was limited to the impact of accelerated depreciation only with respect to public utilities?"
1972.72-486,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,356.453,359.354,"No, it doesn’t -- not that I’m aware of."
1972.72-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.356,367.242,I lost the point.
1972.72-486,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,367.242,370.059,Accelerated tax depreciation is flow-through.
1972.72-486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,370.059,371.928,Well now that’s what I want to get.
1972.72-486,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,371.928,373.949,There’s first the loss resulting to the increase that deduction --
1972.72-486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.949,377.655,Of tax remedy – because of the higher deduction there’s a lower tax remedy?
1972.72-486,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,377.655,390.751,"And then secondly, there’s a lower rates due to the flow-through which means that there’s less revenues to be taxed by the utilities -- have less revenues coming in to be taxed because the benefits are passed on in lower rates."
1972.72-486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.751,402.567,"I see, so there’s a first of all a -- I see everything that lower rates to the consumers?"
1972.72-486,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,402.567,404.795,Lower rates to the consumer.
1972.72-486,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,483.262,486.784,What was the company use?
1972.72-486,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,486.784,494.879,"Well, it said that it would use -- it sought permission to use normalization on the expansion property as well as on its existing property."
1972.72-486,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,869.39,876.379,Thank you Mr. Huntington.
1972.72-486,1,18437,christopher_t_boland,,878.052,881.559,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-486,2,25708,george_e_morrow,,1537.302,1541.877,May it please -- Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-486,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1823.322,1829.314,What about the language on page 83 that your friend was discussing a bit ago?
1972.72-486,2,25708,george_e_morrow,,1841.501,1843.774,Permits the change as to that property?
1972.72-486,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1885.682,1896.553,"Well, isn’t that exactly what this tells us? Did you seem to suggest some doubt about what regulatory agency it would be?"
1972.72-486,2,25708,george_e_morrow,,1896.553,1901.857,"Well, I'm just saying that this applies not only to Federal Power Commission, but it applies to all the regulatory [Voice Overlap]."
1972.72-486,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.857,1904.027,No doubt that it similarly means Federal Power [voice overlap].
1972.72-486,2,25708,george_e_morrow,,1904.027,1906.981,"Oh, yes sir, yes sir it includes that."
1972.72-486,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1934.123,1946.902,But any change from the “flow-through” would of course be beneficial from the point of view of Congress’ concern at the time of the 1969 Act because it would serve to increase taxes?
1972.72-486,2,25708,george_e_morrow,,1946.902,1948.419,"But, yes Your Honor."
1972.72-486,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1948.419,1951.188,Because it would be change either the normalization or to start a straight-line?
1972.72-486,2,25708,george_e_morrow,,1951.188,1956.993,"But Your Honor, Congress have two concerns of equal value to it at that time."
1972.72-486,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1961.354,1961.734,Right.
1972.72-486,2,25708,george_e_morrow,,1961.734,1971.737,The other concern was that we do it without creating widespread prompt substantial rate -- utility rate increase.
1972.72-486,3,40555,richard_a_solomon,,2762.88,2766.565,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1972.72-486,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2848.363,2853.308,And so that the report really doesn’t speak to the act is finally passed [voice overlap]?
1972.72-486,3,40555,richard_a_solomon,,2853.308,2875.447,"The report speaks to the Senate Bill then before them, the conference limit it and the Court of Appeals thought that was significant and I think it’s significant but you have to look at my brief for that point because I would really if I had a limited time I have like to go on to the exercise of power assuming they had any power."
1972.72-486,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3413.549,3416.029,Mr. Huntington.
1972.72-486,4,41452,samuel_huntington,,3416.029,3427.49,I’d like to talk first about the power issue and then I have few remarks to say about the Commission’s exercise of discretion in this case.
