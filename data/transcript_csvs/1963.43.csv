1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,1785.737,1787.435,May it please the Court.
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2158.424,2161.773,May I ask what happened to the damages (Inaudible)?
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2161.773,2164.099,"That has never been determined Your Honor, because they --"
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2164.099,2164.871,They still open --
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2164.871,2166.316,"Yes sir, that is still open."
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2166.316,2167.951,In this very litigation?
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2167.951,2169.198,"Yes sir, that is still open."
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2179.253,2184.435,"Well then do I understand that if you prevail here, you may now go back and tryout request for damages?"
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2184.435,2185.473,"Yes, Your Honor."
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2185.891,2189.097,What -- what have you move this argument?
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2189.097,2190.672,I don't know that there is anything.
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2193.036,2194.481,You would not?
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2194.481,2196.242,"No, sir."

1963.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2589.163,2605.846,(Inaudible)
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2605.846,2615.049,"Your Honor please, the Court of Appeals and its opinion went beyond there."
1963.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2669.973,2674.588,(Inaudible)
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2674.588,2677.043,I -- I think that Your Honor is probably correct.
1963.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2925.245,2937.897,I notice in your reply brief that you rely heavily on the fact that this -- this case has been mooted for approximately a year and a half?
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2937.897,2938.424,"Yes, sir."
1963.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2956.944,2961.328,"Well, you're very clear on your mind now, although this case is not moot."
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2961.328,2970.227,"I would say Your Honor in the light of what's been brought to my attention by Mr. Justice Goldberg that it is moot because there is law, no longer any question of damaging."
1963.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2981.558,2983.565,But they're -- they are not are they?
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2983.565,2984.332,Sir?
1963.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2984.332,2986.787,"They are not cut off, are they?"
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2986.787,2987.817,I don't know Your Honor.
1963.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2987.817,2989.768,"Well, you have bond?"
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,2989.768,2993.392,"Oh, on -- on the question of bond, the question was raised about that."
1963.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3010.691,3012.314,Something like a --
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3012.314,3012.685,Sir?
1963.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3012.685,3014.788,How can a judgment reversed --
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3014.788,3024.933,"Well, it's a question of -- it's a question almost of -- of the intent at the time the thing is done, the good faith you might say in -- in seeking the injunction."
1963.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3024.933,3037.542,What's the matter (Inaudible)?
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3037.542,3043.342,"That would be up to the judge may it please the Court, to the Chancellor as I understand it and he would order a reference."
1963.43,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3053.499,3056.361,(Inaudible)
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3056.361,3057.287,"That's right, yes."
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3057.287,3060.072,"Well, do you -- I'm not quite clear about this bond."
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3068.782,3068.928,Your Honor --
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3068.928,3069.324,I mean --
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3069.324,3072.312,"-- please, there is an injunction bond --"
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3072.312,3072.739,I mean this --
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3072.739,3075.428,"The exact terms of that bond, I do not recall."
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3075.428,3077.466,"Well, I gather, your client had to post it for the --"
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3077.466,3078.516,"Yes, Your Honor."
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3078.516,3083.528,"So that if in consequence to the issuance of the injunction, this is on a hypothetical --"
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3083.528,3083.697,"Yes, sir."
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3083.697,3085.898,"-- without suggesting of course, one way the other what the --"
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3085.898,3086.09,Sure.
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3086.09,3087.346,-- result will be.
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3093.98,3095.711,It's my understanding that it could be.
1963.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3099.877,3105.767,"Well, my question then is if that's the fact, how could this case possibly be moot?"
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3105.767,3112.646,"Your Honor pleases, as I said sometime ago, the question of whether it is moot or not doesn't really make a great deal of difference to it."
1963.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3112.646,3133.798,"May I call your attention to that fact that this Court held some years ago that District Court failed to consider and assess damages at the injunction that's been issued wrongfully, with guilty with abusive use of the discretion to the (Inaudible), so that there is still the question of damage here."
1963.43,1,29645,john_a_chambliss_jr,,3133.798,3135.641,"Yes, yes."
1963.43,2,41324,s_del_fuston,,3244.924,3258.197,"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find the page in the credit record up to where the State was made that we desired to picket the same company in the future."
1963.43,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3267.526,3271.677,"Well, Mr. Fuston, may I -- I've look that it was since I asked you the question."
1963.43,2,41324,s_del_fuston,,3296.876,3300.511,"That is it and Mr. Raymond Floyd made oath to that, I remember that."
1963.43,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3300.511,3309.559,"And the court went on to say that they weren't in the business of rendering advisory opinions and therefore, what was going to happen in the future was is no concern of the Court of Appeals."
1963.43,2,41324,s_del_fuston,,3309.559,3309.717,That is --
1963.43,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3309.717,3310.502,Is that what you have reference?
1963.43,2,41324,s_del_fuston,,3310.502,3314.641,That's what I have reference to Your Honor.
1963.43,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3318.944,3321.499,Very well.
