1977.77-365,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.483,We will hear arguments next in United States against LaSalle National Bank.
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,56.122,59.779,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-365,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,322.846,335.011,"Mr. Wallace, before you leave Judge McGarr’s opinion, he does say, in the next to the last paragraph, “it is apparent that the agent was conducting his investigation solely purpose of unearthing evidence of criminal conduct.”"
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,335.011,336.595,That is correct.
1977.77-365,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,336.595,338.563,"That is what the Court of Appeals say he found too, is it not?"
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,342.293,350.382,"Well, there is no indication that there was any rejection of any of the witness’ testimony on the basis of credibility by Judge McGarr."
1977.77-365,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,350.382,357.128,"Well, to the extent that the witness said it was for some other purpose when the District Court says it is solely for the purpose of criminal proceedings --"
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,357.128,359.216,That is the test being used.
1977.77-365,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,394.647,396.271,How do you expect us to decide the case?
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,401.766,412.384,"That is what I am trying to get to, if you will let me do it a little bit indirectly."
1977.77-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,563.184,587.012,"Mr. Wallace, we do have a case here involving a particular agent and a particular investigation and Justice Stevens asked you awhile ago about whether in view of Judge McGarr’s finding that the investigation was solely for criminal purposes, which he suggested the Court of Appeals had upheld is not clearly erroneous, what hypothesis do we go ahead on this case?"
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,592.248,594.237,"I will have to differ with you, Mr. Justice."
1977.77-365,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.873,654.188,"Mr. Wallace, he said that is what may happen and later on, he says what did happen in this case which is a criminal investigation."
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,654.188,666.701,What I am trying to tell the Court is that there is no such thing as a civil and criminal investigation going on side-by-side in the way the Internal Revenue Service proceeds.
1977.77-365,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,685.038,700.319,"Would this Court not be as free as the Court of Appeals’ would have been to say that absent contrary testimony or some affirmative testimony finding by District Judge, his finding on this subject was clearly erroneous."
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,703.006,710.235,"It is an alternative open, but I think this is not a matter of the clearly erroneous finding."
1977.77-365,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,834.163,837.699,How did Judge McGarr go wrong?
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,837.699,842.475,By not understanding that there is no way to differentiate the civil and criminal aspects of the special agent’s work.
1977.77-365,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,842.475,845.423,Did the government lawyer explain it to him?
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,845.423,846.961,He may not have sufficiently.
1977.77-365,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,846.961,848.555,"If he did not, what are we going to do?"
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,852.973,866.087,That is the question presented in the petition that was granted by this Court and that is the question that needs deciding because the Courts of Appeals are going in many disparate directions here and many tax investigations are being delayed.
1977.77-365,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,866.087,870.867,What are you going to give us to show that he was wrong?
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,870.867,873.435,That is the purpose of my argument.
1977.77-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,873.435,876.985,"Judge Friendly’s opinion would have no trouble with Judge McGarr’s finding, would it?"
1977.77-365,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,876.985,877.727,That is right.
1977.77-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,877.727,884.828,"It simply would have said I can accept it as not clearly erroneous and nonetheless, they are not entitled."
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,884.828,886.287,That is correct.
1977.77-365,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,909.309,929.808,"It is not in this record, but I know what you say was not a rule in 1965 because in a case of the Second Circuit there were two agents sitting in the same office, one of them civil and one of them criminal on the same name, has that changed?"
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,929.808,936.504,There are revenue agents and special agents who specialize in different aspects of the investigation.
1977.77-365,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.357,997.398,"Mr. Wallace, let me see if I understand your position."
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1012.511,1014.155,That is our position.
1977.77-365,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.218,1027.271,"You can assume there is and you would make the same argument, would you not?"
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1027.271,1030.78,I cannot assume that there is because it is unrealistic.
1977.77-365,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.935,1045.863,"It is theoretically possible, is it not, that there could be an absolutely detailed determination of tax liability, but some lacking or some shortage of evidence on intent and you are looking for some corporate menage or something."
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1051.962,1057.075,"Well, it is, but it has to be put in context."
1977.77-365,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1058.004,1063.095,"Every time you say it has to be put in context, you are going to say you got to have a factual hearing unless you got to --"
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1063.095,1071.308,"No, I agree with the position, but it has to be understood in the context of two points."
1977.77-365,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1357.201,1362.025,"In Reisman v. Caplin, Mr. Wallace, had there been a recommendation for a criminal prosecution?"
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1362.025,1362.646,There had not.
1977.77-365,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1413.414,1415.7,It is not called for a criminal purpose.
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1418.767,1422.687,"Yes, well for use in a criminal prosecution."
1977.77-365,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1422.687,1424.577,Not for criminal purpose because that is not the test.
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1424.577,1459.826,"Obtaining evidence for use in a criminal prosecution, but the point is the special agent not only does not have authority to determine whether the recommendation will be made to the Department of Justice, he also does not have the authority to determine what will be included in the notice of tax deficiency that has to, under the statute, be sent to the taxpayer 90 days before the tax can be assessed and the taxpayer has an opportunity to contest it during those 90 days in the Tax Court."
1977.77-365,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.987,1556.329,"Mr. Wallace, the dictum in Reisman really could be read to refer to criminal prosecution other than for violation of the Revenue Code, it is clearly improper?"
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1556.329,1559.997,"Of course, if it is used for some collateral purpose."
1977.77-365,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.812,1573.627,I realize that.
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1581.797,1582.7,It might not.
1977.77-365,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.986,1640.171,"That is a bright line that all of the Courts of Appeals would readily understand, would it not be?"
1977.77-365,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1640.171,1647.849,"Yes, I believe so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.77-365,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1647.849,1649.477,Mr. Cushner?
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,1649.477,1652.413,Mr. Chief Justice and May I please the Court.
1977.77-365,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1713.794,1724.942,"But if Judge Friendly is right, you are not here arguing an evidentiary question because in his view even if the evidentiary question is in your client’s favor, you still lose?"
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,1724.942,1725.921,I think that is correct.
1977.77-365,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1737.159,1750.938,"To put it in another way, if the line that you later decide whether that is a bright line is when the recommendation is made with the Department of Justice for prosecution, if that is the line then that is the end of the case, is it not?"
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,1750.938,1751.686,"Yes, if that is the line."
1977.77-365,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1751.686,1755.54,It make no difference what was in the mind of the agent?
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,1755.54,1757.796,"I would agree, if that is the line."
1977.77-365,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1779.025,1790.612,You are assuming that there is a bright line in fact at all times in the mind of the inquiring agent as there is a bright line if we draw the line there?
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,1790.612,1793.893,"No, I suggest in this case there was such a line."
1977.77-365,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1804.974,1820.68,"What if you had a situation where some people involved with knowledge of the inquiry, had as their objective, the prospect of the criminal prosecution and others did not?"
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,1830.205,1837.697,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not think it is because someone in the Internal Revenue Service thought there was a possibility or thought there was equivocal violation."
1977.77-365,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.507,1908.535,"How can that injure your client, if he did not have any authority?"
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,1908.535,1914.164,I think that this is a most peculiar type of case also because the nature of the record sought.
1977.77-365,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1950.524,1953.546,Let me give a hypothetical case.
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,1969.617,1977.433,"I think, Justice Marshall, anytime I am served with legal process I have a right to inquire as to whether that legal process is, in fact, legal."
1977.77-365,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1977.433,1983.111,"Yes you require, but If he gets them, how are you hurt?"
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,1983.111,1988.223,I think anybody who is required to comply with legal process which is in fact not legal is hurt.
1977.77-365,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1989.328,2018.276,"As I understand, if a man in government gets as much as he can get legally, but is prevented from doing anything with it, there is no way, as I understand it, that an investigator on the civil side can participate on the criminal side in Internal Revenue?"
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,2018.276,2022.392,"I am not sure I understand your question, Justice Marshall."
1977.77-365,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2022.392,2024.849,Was the agent here on the civil side?
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,2024.849,2029.812,"No, this was a special agent from the Intelligence Division which is now known as the Criminal Enforcement Division."
1977.77-365,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2041.204,2045.125,That could be the reason for that sentence about him going side by side.
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,2045.125,2049.483,It could be.
1977.77-365,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.483,2057.025,"I take it all we have got is a question of statutory construction here, is it not?"
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,2059.164,2061.657,I think there is a constitutional issue involved.
1977.77-365,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2086.799,2098.714,"Well I know, but you might have a constitutional objection to a summons in a criminal investigation, but that has not got anything to do with how the statute is to be construed, is it?"
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,2098.714,2100.093,It is not a matter of construing the statute.
1977.77-365,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.093,2107.501,"Well, suppose somebody has a Fifth Amendment objection to complying with the summons, could he make it?"
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,2107.501,2109.999,"Of course, he could."
1977.77-365,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.999,2122.088,"Well, you are not losing your constitutional protection just because of what the statute is?"
1977.77-365,1,35667,matt_p_cushner,,2122.088,2131.679,I think we lose our constitutional protection if the Supreme Court orders the compliance with summonses issued solely in aid of a criminal investigation.
1977.77-365,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3434.675,3446.927,There is no basis in this case for counsel’s suggestion that the finding was that there was a criminal investigation here that may be unrelated to tax liabilities.
1977.77-365,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3675.256,3677.941,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Wallace."
