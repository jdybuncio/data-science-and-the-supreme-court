1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,10.921,12.105,Mr. Chief Justice.
1960.25,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,12.105,13.522,Mr. Crockett.
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,13.522,19.928,Members of the Court.
1960.25,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,233.161,233.222,Pardon me Mr. Crockett.
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,233.222,234.933,Following his appeal --
1960.25,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,234.933,237.587,"Mr. Crockett, when was this that these appeals --"
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,237.587,237.686,These appeals --
1960.25,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,237.686,238.256,Indicated?
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,238.256,240.763,Would be in 1953.
1960.25,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,240.763,240.78,(Voice Overlap)
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,240.78,249.193,"petitioner's case was appealed, if I remember correctly, in October, 1953."
1960.25,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,349.133,356.288,"Mr. Crockett, were these cases all under the 1940 National Act -- Nationality Act?"
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,356.288,362.496,"The three that I've mentioned Sweet, Chomiak, and Charnowola were under the 1940 Act."
1960.25,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,365.232,368.593,"Yes, that's what I want to know."
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,368.593,384.98,"Are you really ready to say that you're not familiar with the fact that this Court had frequently, after it has denied certiorari, taken up a question and reversed what was better for the rulings of the lower court?"
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,384.98,385.094,"No, Your Honor."
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,385.094,385.649,That this Court --
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,385.649,385.814,I --
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,385.814,400.366,-- has even dismissed as wanting -- for want of a substantial federal question in a succession of cases and then dramatically reversed on -- on a consideration of the merits?
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,400.366,400.382,I do not --
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,400.382,402.079,"You really don't mean to say that, Mr. Crockett."
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,402.226,402.946,I do not say that --
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,402.946,403.197,-- to say that.
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,403.197,404.146,-- Your Honor.
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,433.362,447.82,"Well -- but each case pre -- may present a separate state of fact and not all -- this wasn't a case of -- where all presented the same simple, lucid, unembarrassed question of law."
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,447.82,447.937,Your Honor --
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,447.937,451.525,Denaturalization cases don't all fall under the same pattern.
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,451.525,455.041,They do not and I mean no criticism of this Court when I say --
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,455.041,455.342,"Well, I didn't --"
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,455.342,456.376,That I myself --
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,456.376,458.538,I didn't take -- I wasn't defending the Court.
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,465.689,472.991,"Subsequently, this Court accepted certiorari in Nowak and Maisenberg, which also were handled by my office."
1960.25,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,651.609,655.77,We'll recess.
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,658.976,661.019,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1960.25,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,734.196,736.232,"What page did you say you were reading from, Mr. Crockett?"
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,736.232,740.995,I was reading from page 26 and 27.
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1334.938,1360.047,"Mr. Gordon, I'd like to call your attention to the fact that the Sunal case was decided before this Court that so unequivocally laid down the rule in Garr against Griffith as to the legal non-significant, in any sense of the merit, of a denial of certiorari."
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,1373.261,1373.324,I might --
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1373.324,1383.21,"Before Darren Griffin, in relying on denial of certiorari, isn't that true?"
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,1383.21,1404.034,"I think you -- I think you're right, Your Honor, but I also think that there were other cases even before the promulgation of Rule 60 (b) and even before Sunal that did not arise under any rule but arose under the general powers of equity to give relief where there have been a substantial change in the law."
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1411.04,1430.431,"All I'm suggesting that, in Sunal, a man was kept in jail simply because his counsel had relied on what he thought he had a right to rely on, namely, clear contrary rulings which were never taken by this Court, merely in the Court of Appeals."
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,1430.431,1432.274,"I wouldn't go so far, Mr. Justice Frankfurter --"
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1432.274,1433.217,That's the effect and why you go --
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,1433.217,1434.149,As to say that was --
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1434.149,1436.836,"And that's what Sunal decided, isn't it?"
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,1436.836,1446.31,I wouldn't go so far as to say that was the only consideration that influenced the majority in Sunal merely because he did not take an appeal.
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1450.463,1455.913,And the reason was that he had every right to rely that there would consistent decisions.
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,1464.081,1478.246,"No, I think you had another element there that I emphasize in my brief in my discussion of the Title case, and that is that, within the time that was still available to Sunal to take an appeal, this Court had indicated a willingness to consider the question."
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1496.418,1496.599,But I --
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,1496.599,1500.251,"And, notwithstanding that, he did nothing to protect his right to appeal."
1960.25,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1500.251,1518.075,"It isn't my observation, in the course of all these years, that counsels of the United States are rather timid about filing petitions for certiorari, particularly in causes that they think worthy that alone in all the frivolous cases in which petitions apply to this Court."
1960.25,0,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,1528.551,1533.374,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1960.25,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1533.374,1536.805,Mr. Gordon?
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1536.805,1539.237,May it please the Court.
1960.25,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1774.427,1782.683,(Inaudible)
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1782.683,1785.863,I'm talking about Polites.
1960.25,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1785.863,1792.291,(Inaudible)
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1792.291,1799.081,"And -- and the certiorari was denied and that -- we have a three-prong position here, Your Honor."
1960.25,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1799.081,1804.223,(Inaudible)
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1804.223,1805.033,Our answer is no.
1960.25,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1872.717,1878.017,"I don't understand the difference in your second and third, and third --"
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1878.017,1885.967,"Well, the third is slightly different because he stipulated to appeal -- to dismiss the appeal with prejudice knowing the consequences."
1960.25,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1885.967,1886.739,What is the second?
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1886.739,1889.798,The second is that he abandoned the appeal.
1960.25,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1891.01,1891.109,Alright.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1891.109,1891.483,I think.
1960.25,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1891.483,1891.851,Alright.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1891.851,1895.089,It is -- it may not be very great but there's some difference.
1960.25,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2286.358,2295.905,Was the Court addressing itself there to the merits of the case or to the power of the district judge to act under 60 (b)?
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2295.905,2304.755,"The merits -- by the merits, you mean the question of whether the individual was properly denaturalized or whether relief under 60 (b) was available?"
1960.25,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2304.755,2306.681,"Yes, I mean, which of the two?"
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2306.681,2310.666,"Oh, only to the question of whether relief under 60 (b) was available."
1960.25,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2310.666,2315.332,What was the action of the trial below?
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2315.435,2316.558,In -- in Ackermann?
1960.25,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2316.558,2316.796,Yes.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2316.796,2318.774,The -- the reopening was refused.
1960.25,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2318.774,2321.457,"Yes, but on the merits?"
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2321.457,2324.783,"On -- no, on the applicability of Rule 60 (b)."
1960.25,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2324.783,2328.167,You mean that he didn't have the power to do it?
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2328.167,2328.362,"Well, under --"
1960.25,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2328.362,2328.614,Under this --
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2328.614,2331.181,"-- the circumstances, the Court did not have the power."
1960.25,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2331.181,2339.176,"Did the -- did the District Court say that, under circumstances, he did not have the power or that, in his discretion, it wouldn't be done?"
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2339.176,2341.621,"Well, Your Honor discretion, I think is a treacherous word here."
1960.25,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2719.489,2724.753,Doesn't everything you're arguing go to the question -- or discretion of the questions?
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2724.753,2733.954,"Well, as I said in answer to Mr. -- the Chief Justice's question, discretion here may be a relative term."
1960.25,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2735.934,2736.266,This --
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2736.266,2745.823,"-- discretion, there are certain standards which have been established for determining whether such a motion is appropriate."
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2768.933,2776.239,"May I ask you, suppose the man had been deported under the statute -- an order to be deported under a statute --"
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2776.239,2776.932,Under a --
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2776.932,2778.493,Under -- under a statute.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2778.888,2778.974,"The statute, I'm sorry."
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2778.974,2784.263,Ordered to be denaturalized by either one.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2800.392,2807.006,"Well, my first reaction to that sir, is that I would say that he should have raised that at the outset."
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2808.077,2811.311,You would say that he should be deprived of his right --
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2811.311,2811.446,Well --
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2811.446,2825.71,"Deprived of any advantage under 60 (b), even though you knew and this Government knew that the statute was unimposable and has been all the time void?"
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2863.104,2868.051,"Well, if Your Honor please we don't have any question here of a claim that the statute is unconstitutional."
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2868.051,2868.964,I understand that.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2868.964,2870.666,"So, this is something which is speculative."
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2870.666,2875.198,"You might have -- you might have -- well, you might have a different Circuit Court."
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2889.752,2899.39,"I -- I agree with Your Honor that the rule is not rigid, that the circumstances of the case are controlling, and I say that the circumstances here are nowhere near as acute as the circumstances --"
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2899.39,2900.005,"Well, I gather that."
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2900.005,2901.255,"Allegedly, Klapprott recommended."
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2901.255,2902.44,I understand that argument.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2902.44,2905.862,"And in those cases, the Court denied Rule 60 (b) relief."
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2905.862,2912.905,I understand your argument when you say that there is so much like this that involved the Government acts.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2931.902,2933.302,"Well, I think we agree."
1960.25,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2938.229,2940.041,-- like what you're doing?
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2980.78,2984.045,Your Honor stated completely what I attempted to say.
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2984.045,2992.972,"So, you do agree that they held that both of them stand for the tranquility judges by the extraordinary circumstances of the case."
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2992.972,2995.215,"Well, you must find -- I wouldn't put it that -- you must find extra --"
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2995.215,3001.618,"The Court is not in discretion, in that, the Court can do what he wants to because he wants to and not because he won."
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3013.57,3023.986,"I agree fully with Your Honor, but extraordinary circumstances -- in determining whether there are extraordinary circumstances, we have some guidelines, Klapprott and Ackermann."
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3065.281,3071.278,"Are you saying the argument now, that they may be or not, that maybe it's right?"
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3089.799,3090.111,No.
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3092.333,3092.963,I see.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3093.543,3093.762,I know.
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3093.762,3093.997,Something that --
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3093.997,3096.752,"I don't mean to say that and I don't believe I've said it, sir."
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3097.843,3098.91,That's what I gathered from --
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3098.91,3100.075,"Well, let me make my point --"
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3100.075,3100.138,Yes.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3100.138,3102.0,My position clear.
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3127.761,3134.099,"Well, that's just a critical -- the one critical point, whether he doesn't appeal or couldn't appeal."
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3134.099,3136.335,"Well, that's right, whether he was prevented from appealing."
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3136.335,3141.282,It wouldn't make any difference how much change had occurred in reference to anything in the world therein.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3145.723,3153.042,"That that is my position sir, that Rule 60 (b) says to the individual “you have a day in court."
1960.25,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3168.174,3186.543,"In other words, as I understand you are agreeing to the fact that Rule 60 (b) should not fall around delay in motions to re-file but rather allow reopen upon defined condition set out in the rule."
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3187.237,3189.414,"Well, defiance is also a sort of vague term."
1960.25,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3253.724,3263.611,"Do you agree Ackermann, as Mr. Crockett does, that involving only discretion is not power?"
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3263.611,3265.399,"Well, I've made that answer twice."
1960.25,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3265.96,3266.456,(Inaudible)
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3266.456,3284.958,I -- I would hate to be put in the position that Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggested as conceding that Rule 60 (b) gives to any trial court the discretion in the judgment of reopening a case when it deems fit.
1960.25,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3323.893,3341.874,"Mr. Gordon, you have a long white note to the Immigration and Naturalization Service Department but you're here as a representative of the Department of Justice dealing with a problem arising under 60 (b)."
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3414.699,3423.665,"Exactly, sir, and touching on your point that this -- the question involved here is broader than the rule in denaturalization cases."
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3443.375,3445.502,What is the judgment there?
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3445.502,3447.011,The name of the case?
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3447.011,3447.833,"Yes, the case you have mentioned."
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3447.833,3450.227,Emmett against Beard.
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3450.227,3450.97,But what is it?
1960.25,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3451.296,3452.092,What's it about?
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3452.092,3453.676,Condemnation.
1960.25,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3453.676,3454.407,Condemnation?
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3454.407,3470.067,"Condemnation, yes, sir, in which one party in a condemnation suit were not appealed, later, attempt to take advantage of benefits which the persons who had appealed had obtained."
1960.25,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3470.067,3473.507,Are you going to save some time in getting to the merits to this case?
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3473.507,3475.421,That all depends on the Court.
1960.25,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3828.99,3870.854,"Mr. Gordon, as I understood Mr. Crockett's argument was or his position was that these matters, the actual merits of the controversy, should best be left in this stage to District Court and that it was, as he suggested, that the basic issue for us to decide was whether or not there was power under Rule 60 (b) to grant this motion and, having to sign at that, that we should remand it to the District Court for consideration of the merits of the petitioner's argument under 60 (b) as to the applicability of Belmont, Nowak, and Maisenberg, and to the pe -- specific facts of this case."
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3880.39,3883.135,"I -- I don't rega -- I haven't gotten to the merits yet, Your Honor."
1960.25,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3911.475,3918.879,"He also said, or at least he find, that -- he said, didn't he, that he was without power, in any event, under Rule 60 (b)?"
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3918.879,3923.92,Because this was not the type of situation that Rule 60 (b) contemplated.
1960.25,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3925.14,3926.132,It was an alternative --
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3926.132,3926.538,That's right.
1960.25,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3926.538,3927.079,Position.
1960.25,1,19054,charles_gordon,,3927.079,3929.668,And he said that he didn't find Nowak and he discussed it.
1960.25,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4916.036,4916.654,Mr. Crockett.
1960.25,2,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,4916.654,4921.3,"Mr. Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.25,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5283.954,5289.593,Why -- why do you think -- why do you find conflict in those cases?
1960.25,2,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,5289.593,5308.825,"I find conflict in those cases, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, because, here, you do not have any intervening rights of third parties vested, as the Government itself, which put my petition in this predicament, which is now seeking to take advantage of the subsequent more liberal interpretation of the law made by this Court."
1960.25,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5308.825,5315.574,What part of the Government put your client to do it particularly?
1960.25,2,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,5315.574,5320.614,The Government was the one that instituted the denaturalization proceeding against him.
1960.25,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5335.108,5338.261,Why should I make any quick assumption?
1960.25,2,25088,george_w_crockett_jr,,5348.292,5354.224,I suppose I turn then Your Honor to the discussion of whether or not the judgment itself is erroneous.
