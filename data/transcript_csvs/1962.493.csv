1962.493,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,184.716,189.219,Is the case of Wheeldin before us?
1962.493,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,189.219,189.975,No.
1962.493,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,524.69,529.177,How do you concede that there was no cause of action?
1962.493,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,533.423,533.69,Yes.
1962.493,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,533.69,538.222,"And do you concede that it's a cause of action, your argument on federal law?"
1962.493,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,538.222,551.689,"We concede it as a cause of action arising solely and entirely under federal law, having no basis in or rooted in any state law and for the following three reasons."
1962.493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,650.246,655.457,[Inaudible]
1962.493,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,655.457,663.992,"Well, we rely primarily upon the Fourth, but also upon the Fifth and the reasons for our reliance upon the Fourth but that -- of the --"

1962.493,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,668.218,670.529,The Due Process Clause.
1962.493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.843,739.032,The service of it?
1962.493,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,739.032,740.928,The issuance and service of it.
1962.493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,740.928,741.753,That's all?
1962.493,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,741.753,768.411,"That's all and that a person who claims that the subpoena on its face is too broad, may challenge the subpoena and tell me successfully, if you convince -- you can convince the Court it's too broad, merely because of the issuance of a subpoena on the ground that the subpoena duces tecum on itself prior to the actual seizure of the records which are the subject matter of the subpoena is too broad."
1962.493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.321,781.87,Duces tecum?
1962.493,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,781.87,784.026,"Duces tecum, yes."

1962.493,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1154.123,1157.543,[Inaudible]
1962.493,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1157.543,1168.14,"Because Your Honor, there's no allegation in this complaint that there was any appearance or any action on the part of the petitioner in response to the subpoena."
1962.493,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1168.369,1173.55,[Inaudible]
1962.493,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1173.55,1174.428,"That's right, Your Honor."
1962.493,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1174.428,1175.559,[Inaudible]
1962.493,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1175.559,1176.083,That's right.
1962.493,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1176.083,1176.624,[Inaudible]
1962.493,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1176.624,1177.153,That's right.
1962.493,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1177.153,1179.674,[Inaudible]
1962.493,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1179.674,1181.163,That is -- that is correct.
1962.493,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1376.121,1386.676,[Inaudible]
1962.493,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1386.676,1387.186,That's right.
1962.493,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1408.973,1416.859,What is the ground on which you say you distinguish and say that this one should have been dismissed for what reason?
1962.493,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1416.859,1429.606,"In this case, for the fairness to state a claim upon which relief could be granted in an action in a Federal District Court where jurisdiction rested necessarily upon Section 1331 of the judicial code."
1962.493,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1429.606,1431.571,You mean failed to state the cause of action?
1962.493,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1431.571,1431.915,That's right.
1962.493,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1437.628,1438.893,Failed to state a cause of action.
1962.493,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1438.893,1440.813,That's correct.
1962.493,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1443.036,1447.496,"And I gather you're relying on -- what suit is the civil rule, 12 or something rather, isn't it?"
1962.493,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1450.948,1451.862,"Yes, I think so."
1962.493,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1452.298,1453.479,Is that what you are relying?
1962.493,1,16789,alan_s_rosenthal,,1453.479,1454.606,That's correct.
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,2960.799,2963.006,May it please the Court.
1962.493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2963.006,2967.392,"Mr. Wirin, has it [Inaudible] on this, any violation of the Civil Rights Act at all?"
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,2967.392,2968.482,None at all.
1962.493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2968.482,2969.466,Any reason for that?
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,2969.466,2969.991,Yes.
1962.493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2970.153,2972.938,It only applies to state action (Voice Overlap) -- I beg your pardon?
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,2972.938,2974.473,I think the Civil Rights Act probably (Voice Overlap) --
1962.493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2974.473,2975.162,That's right.
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,2975.162,2976.393,-- conduct by state officers --
1962.493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2976.393,2977.128,That's right.
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,2977.128,2978.474,And that this is a conduct by a federal official.
1962.493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2978.474,2979.168,That's right.
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,2980.366,3012.123,"Now, I dissent from the views of the Solicitor General's office with respect to the meaning of the phrase arise under law or Constitution, and the suggestion made that in order for a federal court to have jurisdiction, in order for a matter to arise under a law or the Constitution, the law or Constitution must expressly confer a specific right."
1962.493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3040.907,3044.776,"I don't think there's any issue between these two, the jurisdiction and the federal court as I understand it."
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3044.776,3059.357,"Well, I think perhaps there isn't, but what I really ought to go on to say is that not only is there jurisdiction but in such circumstances then there is a statement of a cause of action invoking a federal claim."
1962.493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3059.357,3059.789,And that is the --
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3059.789,3074.882,"And if so, there would be -- if so, the motion to dismiss which was sustained here because the complaint doesn't state the claim, I suppose presumably doesn't say the federal claim was improvidently granted."
1962.493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3074.882,3075.055,Mr. Wirin --
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3075.055,3075.564,Yes.
1962.493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.564,3082.478,-- there is a -- the Government does not agree with you however that there -- that the case arises under a law.
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3085.276,3086.176,Yes.
1962.493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.176,3086.34,And I don't --
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3086.34,3087.518,"Now, we say --"
1962.493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.518,3097.347,I don't understand why in your mind it's significant for you to insist that there -- it arises under a law as well as under the Constitution?
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3097.347,3102.266,"Well, if we have two strings to our bow, could be -- maybe a little better off than just one."
1962.493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3102.266,3104.957,You don't need any if the other side agrees with you.
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3104.957,3122.506,"Well, but you see, their agreement with us, Your Honor, to be candid, is nominal rather than substantive because they concede there was jurisdiction and then they proceed to argue that there is no cause of action stated because no federal claim is stated."
1962.493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3122.506,3131.582,"Well, is it â€“ [Inaudible] on the ground that any federal claim stated is so insubstantial and frivolous that it does not state a cause of action."
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3134.673,3136.288,I'm not sure.
1962.493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3136.288,3136.458,I thought --
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3136.458,3137.562,If they -- if --
1962.493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3137.562,3144.331,"I thought they were relying -- I thought they were saying the fact that under Bell and Hood, you've got two things."
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3156.435,3171.915,"Alright, now let me address myself to that summarily, and also say something that I neglected to say in my opening argument with respect to the matter of the Fifth Amendment as well as the Fourth Amendment, we're trying three strings rather than two."
1962.493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3194.469,3197.773,"Arbitrarily, only because it was an excess of authority to issue, is that it?"
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3197.773,3198.528,That's right.
1962.493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3213.842,3214.376,"Well now, isn't that true --"
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3214.376,3215.106,And --
1962.493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3215.106,3225.254,"Every subpoena issued by every court in the land and they're (Inaudible) -- issued by the thousands everyday, affects to some extent the liberty of those upon whom those subpoenas are served."
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3225.254,3225.561,"With these three, Your Honor."
1962.493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3225.561,3230.152,"Because if they have to go to court, instead of going to work that day or instead of going to the ball game."
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3230.152,3236.753,But every such subpoena would not abridge liberty without due process of law unless if it were issued arbitrarily.
1962.493,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3251.895,3262.082,[Inaudible]
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3262.082,3262.491,It would --
1962.493,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3262.491,3277.745,[Inaudible]
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3277.745,3278.641,"Yes, I think that's correct."
1962.493,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3283.477,3283.787,Are you basing --
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3283.787,3284.37,I'm not too sure now.
1962.493,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3284.37,3285.158,-- your case on that?
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3285.158,3286.176,Pardon?
1962.493,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3286.176,3287.557,Are you basing your case on that?
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3287.557,3288.629,"No, not at all because --"
1962.493,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3288.629,3290.061,"If you are, you probably will --"
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3290.061,3290.8,Because of --
1962.493,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3290.8,3292.366,-- have to make a full argument you've made of --
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3292.366,3293.16,Yes.
1962.493,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3294.366,3297.519,Which provision of the Constitution says arbitrarily and capricious?
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3299.214,3302.683,"Well, all I'm saying is, I think we also have a due process."
1962.493,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3307.303,3313.747,"What it is, is a deprivation of that due process, isn't it if it violates the Fourth Amendment in order to make the arrest?"
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3313.747,3314.751,"Well, I --"
1962.493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3314.751,3315.014,What was the arrest (Voice Overlap) --
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3315.014,3316.573,I have to go a little farther (Voice Overlap) --
1962.493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3316.573,3317.901,What arrest was there in this case?
1962.493,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3317.901,3320.177,I mean to make this -- serve the subpoena --
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3320.177,3321.918,I am not contending there was any (Voice Overlap) --
1962.493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3321.918,3322.95,I didn't think you were.
1962.493,2,17198,a_l_wirin,,3322.95,3324.432,I'm not contending to what arrest.
