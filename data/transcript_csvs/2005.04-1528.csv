2005.04-1528,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.886,"We'll hear argument first this morning in 04-1528, Randall v. Sorrell, and the consolidated cases."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,8.814,10.324,Thank you.
2005.04-1528,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,175.225,179.341,"Mr. Bopp, would you clarify a procedural point?"
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,192.198,195.136,"Well, there were... that is correct, that there is a remand."
2005.04-1528,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,195.136,201.772,And it may... the district court might... may well find that nothing passes constitutional muster in the end.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,201.772,204.627,"Well, they could potentially, yes."
2005.04-1528,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,231.591,236.14,Are you arguing now then that there may be no limits on expenditures?
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,236.14,257.295,"Well, the... this Court has now considered, including this case, a dozen times in which the government has sought to limit expenditures, either of candidates or PAC's or political parties, and despite the work of the most brilliant lawyers in the United States, they have not come up with any compelling governmental interest that this Court has accepted."
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,266.286,277.706,"Do you... when... when you make that point, that on this record the... the claimed interests are not compelling or not proven, would you have us leave the door open for a greater degree of proof?"
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,307.524,314.506,"--Well, we... we are asserting that that is not a compelling interest in and of itself, and this Court should reject it."
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,315.456,317.1,"But you also say, on this record."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,317.1,317.677,--Yes.
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,331.55,339.02,So I... I take it your point then on the combined corruption/competition for money problem is that there isn't any record that would support it.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,339.02,344.647,"If it were a compelling interest, there's no record here that is a problem in Vermont."
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,344.647,349.939,"Right, but you're saying this combination cannot be a compelling interest as a matter of law, consistent with the First Amendment."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,350.533,351.15,"Yes, it is."
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,363.807,364.29,Yes.
2005.04-1528,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,364.29,365.901,"Well, just--"
2005.04-1528,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,365.901,372.287,Or at least where... where the limitation... you make a big point of this in your brief as... as I... as I recall.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,390.344,406.9,"It is a self justifying statute by imposing the lowest contribution limits in... in the Nation, adjusted for inflation for 1974 dollars, when the $1,000 limit was approved."
2005.04-1528,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,411.449,416.891,"--Well, to get back to Justice Souter's questions, could you answer it this way?"
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,450.992,454.941,"--Well, I think it's not a matter of just access."
2005.04-1528,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,459.056,459.756,All right.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,460.289,463.505,"--Well, if it... if it's privileged--"
2005.04-1528,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,463.505,466.876,"I mean, isn't the answer that the... that this is up to the voters."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,471.57,477.279,"--Indeed, and in fact, the... there are other less restrictive ways of... of dealing with this."
2005.04-1528,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,502.398,507.181,It... it is true that all the polls say that there's public disaffection and cynicism.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,516.85,518.527,I'm not aware of that.
2005.04-1528,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,567.33,568.424,"May ask you this question, Mr. Bopp?"
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,583.374,585.218,--That is not our position.
2005.04-1528,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,585.218,593.626,"Well, if that's the case, then why... why would it be inappropriate to have further hearings in this case to see whether they're... they could be justified?"
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,593.626,599.253,Because there have been legal findings by the Second Circuit that we believe are erroneous.
2005.04-1528,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,625.306,626.133,"No, I understand."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,634.282,640.752,--I have a... a very difficult time justifying expenditure limits.
2005.04-1528,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,679.135,686.782,"Counsel, with respect to the contribution limits, what... what makes this case different from the... the Shrink PAC case from a few years ago?"
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,686.782,688.226,"--Well, several things."
2005.04-1528,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,731.386,733.397,So you think it... you think it's the dollar amounts that are involved?
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,733.397,748.358,"--Well, one of the decisions that the Court has to make under your jurisprudence is that... that contribution limits can only eliminate large contributions that give rise to this realistic perception or actuality of corruption."
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,758.099,763.81,"It... it was pointed out in... in one of the briefs... and I... I didn't go back and check it myself, but I'd like your comment."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,778.094,781.282,"Well, it depends on how you... you compute it."
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,782.042,784.386,"It always... it always does, yes."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,785.397,809.673,"--The... well, certainly what the... what the evidence was in Shrink was it was a $1,075 limit, again adjusted for inflation, was about $375 adjusted for inflation compared to the Buckley limits, and because of the paucity of evidence and the fact that it wasn't really novel to say that a $1,000 limit could give rise to corruption because--"
2005.04-1528,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,809.673,815.133,"But there were lower limits, Mr. Bopp, and I think that's what Justice Souter was asking about."
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,815.133,816.06,Yes.
2005.04-1528,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,816.06,821.186,"There were the thousand dollars, but I think it went down as low as $250 in--"
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,821.186,823.113,"Yes, take the whole schedule in Missouri."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,823.113,823.624,--Yes.
2005.04-1528,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,830.345,835.294,--There... there was a court that subsequently considered the rest and upheld the contribution--
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,835.294,835.638,"--Yes, there was."
2005.04-1528,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.657,886.318,"And we... we didn't send it back so that more of a record could be made, did we?"
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,886.318,886.712,No.
2005.04-1528,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.336,936.096,"Well, but you know."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,941.056,941.606,"Well, if--"
2005.04-1528,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.606,943.994,"Really, that... that's... that's a lot to ask."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,943.994,949.536,"--Well... well, they at least have to give, you know, realistic circumstances."
2005.04-1528,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,950.964,960.373,"Well, suppose three legislators had been corrupted, venal, criminal corruption, actually taking no wink wink, nod nod, a specific agreement to vote for money."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,964.155,973.219,"--Well, the... the responsibility that Shrink imposes is to... to demonstrate both actual and perceived corruption at that the--"
2005.04-1528,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,973.219,975.657,Suppose... suppose that had been demonstrated in... in a particular State.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,981.71,983.737,"--If it's just anecdotal, no."
2005.04-1528,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,984.814,985.081,No.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,987.502,999.866,"--Well, the... if it's isolated examples that are unconnected to any perception of corruption at that level, then it would not be adequate on... on its... on its... by itself."
2005.04-1528,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1011.185,1029.834,"Well... well, if... if you... if you concede and... and you tend, at least, to back away from the proposition that the case I put would be an inadequate ground or an adequate ground for legislative limits, then I suppose you can say the State has the power to prevent this from happening to begin with."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1029.834,1044.036,"Well, this Court has never approved restrictions on fundamental First Amendment values based purely upon speculation or concern about something that's happening some other place."
2005.04-1528,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.78,1067.468,Only... only the most corruptible.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1068.484,1069.145,--Nor corruptible.
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1126.688,1146.849,"Mr. Bopp, toward the end of your brief, you... you make the argument that if we accepted the State's position in this case, we implicitly would have accepted the position that totally... totally publicly funded elections would be constitutional."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1165.666,1168.354,"The key would be if it's mandated, voluntary--"
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1168.354,1168.971,Yes.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1168.971,1171.709,"--If it was mandated, yes, it would be unconstitutional."
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1171.709,1178.429,"And... and its unconstitutionality would rest on the limitation on expenditure, in effect?"
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1178.429,1179.023,Yes.
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1183.721,1184.238,"Oh, yes, yes."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1184.238,1192.285,"--on... on contributions, and there would be also a... a mandatory expenditure limit because you could only spend what the government gave you."
2005.04-1528,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1217.739,1228.259,"But on... on your view, if... if there were a... a mandatory publicly funded scheme and the... the limits on expenditure were very high... it was a very generous scheme."
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1240.849,1254.705,"There would be an absolute prohibition, and this Court in... in Beaumont reserved that question of whether or not an absolute prohibition... and... and then in McConnell, you struck down the absolute prohibition on minors' contributing to campaigns."
2005.04-1528,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1263.354,1273.956,"Well, it would also prevent the candidate himself from expending his entire fortune, if he wishes, in informing people of why he should be elected--"
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1273.956,1275.283,"Yes, that is true."
2005.04-1528,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.283,1275.794,--think that's okay.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1275.794,1294.183,"And... and in the record below, plaintiff Donald Brunelle said that he was prepared to spend considerable sums in support of his State Senate election, which... and considerable sums above the expenditure limits that were before... that were adopted by Vermont."
2005.04-1528,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.299,1299.143,Which raises no possibility of corruption.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1299.143,1305.946,"--Well, nor... nor on fund raising using up your time because all a wealthy person has to do is write a check."
2005.04-1528,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.281,1318.459,I don't know what you mean they have an exception for the wealthy family.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1318.459,1318.969,--Yes.
2005.04-1528,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1403.55,1404.311,"--Mr. Bopp, may I ask you?"
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1423.044,1429.337,"--They did, but erroneously, and I... we believe that you have a responsibility to do an independent examination of the record."
2005.04-1528,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.35,1440.783,Excuse me.
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1442.695,1447.571,--The contribution limits... amounts over the contribution limits for--
2005.04-1528,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1447.571,1454.291,Can you... can you point to the place in the district court opinion that you're referring to?
2005.04-1528,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1454.291,1455.468,--I am sorry.
2005.04-1528,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1571.906,1573.333,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1575.505,1579.287,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1528,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1601.291,1601.968,Counsel--
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1601.968,1603.063,--of the Senate--
2005.04-1528,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1603.063,1615.326,"--Counsel, you... you say in your brief... I'm reading from page 13... that the record convincingly shows that the ties among donor groups and elected officials often determine the positions officials take."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1620.952,1632.037,"--The... there was testimony that the President of the Senate said to another Senator who was testifying at trial, we've lost the drug money."
2005.04-1528,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1654.969,1661.023,"So your position is that that official's official positions were determined by the donor groups, as you say in your brief."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1661.023,1662.867,Influenced and--
2005.04-1528,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1662.867,1664.211,"Well, your brief says determined."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1667.827,1671.942,--Have an influence and we would suggest an undue influence in some cases.
2005.04-1528,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1671.942,1674.897,--So it should say influenced rather than determined.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1674.897,1684.205,"We didn't have anyone, as Justice Scalia asked, who stood up and admitted to having taken bribes."
2005.04-1528,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1707.471,1710.753,How many prosecutions for political corruption have you brought?
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1710.753,1718.983,We have not had any of legislators or statewide officers that I'm aware of.
2005.04-1528,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1718.983,1723.265,Do you think that political corruption in Vermont is a serious problem?
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1723.265,1724.793,It is a serious problem.
2005.04-1528,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1745.614,1750.824,Would you describe your State as a clean State politically or as a corrupt one?
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1750.824,1753.512,--We have a real problem in Vermont.
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1777.111,1783.831,To the extent that Vermont legislators can be bought off by $51?
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1785.008,1787.113,There's nothing in the record--
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.113,1788.063,That's very sad.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1792.655,1794.166,--I... no.
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.166,1800.376,"I mean, the... you know, if... if you accept more than $51, you're... you're likely to have your vote determined by that."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1800.376,1803.992,"No, I... we don't suggest... we don't suggest that."
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.992,1806.68,Then why... why the $50 limit?
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1809.201,1811.722,I don't know what $50 limit you are talking--
2005.04-1528,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1811.722,1812.9,"No, no."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1821.38,1821.963,"--Oh, it's--"
2005.04-1528,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1821.963,1822.346,It's $200.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1823.39,1824.024,--It's the math.
2005.04-1528,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1845.989,1848.511,And they can... and presumably they act accordingly at the polls.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1852.459,1862.534,--The Buckley court thought that disclosure obligations and contribution limits alone would be... would suffice to address corruption and--
2005.04-1528,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1862.534,1864.805,But I have the same question Justice Scalia had.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1873.37,1875.392,"--For a House race, yes."
2005.04-1528,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1875.392,1875.925,For a House.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1915.035,1919.995,Incumbents had a much more of an advantage in the pre Act 64 world.
2005.04-1528,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1923.777,1928.725,It's not going to help to say incumbents had a bigger advantage before.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1959.555,1960.749,--Vermont has the--
2005.04-1528,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.749,1961.593,I want your answer.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,1961.593,1966.108,--Vermont has the second lowest gubernatorial spending in the country.
2005.04-1528,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1980.56,1983.665,I'm not talking about the expenditure.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2026.924,2042.886,"The extensive record below shows that with these contribution limits, attacking the corruption and the appearance of corruption issue, the candidates can amass the resources necessary to run effective campaigns at all levels."
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.886,2044.491,--It shows that on average.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2049.773,2066.246,"The... the reality is that... that in virtually all classes of races, other than the single member Senate races, that average spending was below these expenditure limits, and these include contested cases with primaries, without."
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.246,2067.422,That's just what I said.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2086.572,2104.795,"And, Justice Scalia, under our law, the challenger can spend more than the incumbent because the incumbent has a lid not... of 85 percent or 90 percent of the expenditure limit, depending on whether it's a legislative race or a... or a statewide race."
2005.04-1528,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2126.132,2139.323,"But in... in any... or in many campaigns, the... the issues take shape during the process of the campaign, and there are historical events, national events that suddenly occur that people want to comment on."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2182.238,2190.396,"--We have the second lowest... smallest legislative districts in the country, 4,000 citizens per single member legislative district."
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.967,2232.727,Did he have a primary?
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2232.727,2236.427,I don't know whether he had a primary or not.
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.427,2239.865,That's another feature of... of this scheme that I find quite puzzling.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2248.44,2256.42,The... there was testimony in the record that those who have a primary might actually get a bump over others who are not challenged.
2005.04-1528,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2325.466,2330.342,"Mr. Sorrell, would you go back to the... your comment on... on average expenditures?"
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2344.199,2350.075,We don't have that evidence in the record.
2005.04-1528,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2383.093,2390.646,Was there any testimony or evidence on the other side of the point that Judge Winter makes?
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2418.455,2425.175,And that might be an issue that on remand... and this case is being remanded on a couple of issues that aren't even before this Court.
2005.04-1528,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2425.175,2426.685,"Not on the contributions, is it?"
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2426.685,2443.325,"No, it's not on the contributions, but it is going back to the court on issues of transfers of money from national parties to State parties and on whether related or coordinated expenditures are, indeed, allowed to be an expenditure."
2005.04-1528,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2446.763,2449.034,But it's not going back on the expenditure limit.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2449.034,2450.795,I--
2005.04-1528,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2450.795,2455.838,"I mean, the problem, I mean, I was getting at and Justice Ginsburg is getting at, Judge Winter got at it."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2486.251,2493.721,--That has not been a problem that was reflected in the record either before the legislature or at trial.
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2532.449,2542.457,If the burden is on the candidate to establish that... that somebody's expenditure is independent and shouldn't be counted against his expenditure limit.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2542.457,2542.967,No.
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.545,2548.66,"A presumption, which means the burden, to go forward and show the opposite, is on him."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2549.227,2552.275,"--Well, but it could be on the... on the party because--"
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.275,2558.651,And the money that he spends in overcoming that presumption is charged against his expenditure.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2559.413,2559.963,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.947,2574.447,The other side says the opposite.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2575.958,2583.522,"--But the... the Secretary of State's public opinion that we, the enforcement authority, agree with is to the contrary."
2005.04-1528,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2583.522,2584.172,May... may I ask--
2005.04-1528,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2584.172,2587.804,"Well, I suppose the Vermont courts could construe it more narrowly at some later point."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2590.492,2601.578,"The... the... under Vermont law, a presumption such... such as this is not a burden... creates no burden of persuasion, nor does it change the burden of proof."
2005.04-1528,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2601.578,2608.642,"--Well, you know, I looked at your... the... the references in your brief for that proposition, and I did not see them borne out."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2651.224,2672.912,"Well, if you... if some entity that has the burden of proof to show, in fact, that it was a related or coordinated expenditure has the party on the one hand and the candidate on the other saying, we did not coordinate here, I didn't ask for it, I didn't approve it, and then where is the evidence?"
2005.04-1528,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2672.912,2677.011,The... the point is what if we don't have that simple of a situation.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2695.161,2696.005,Yes.
2005.04-1528,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2696.005,2696.638,Okay.
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2696.638,2697.599,"Well, credible evidence, yes."
2005.04-1528,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2698.61,2703.225,Is... is an affidavit from the candidate enough credible evidence in your view?
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2703.225,2703.858,Yes.
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2703.858,2713.994,"--And thereafter, all the... all the candidate has to say is in an affidavit, no, it wasn't coordinated, and then the burden is on the State to show that it was."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2713.994,2725.574,"If the State is the party that's trying to prove that it was, in fact, a coordinated expenditure, under the law... it would typically be a opposing candidate who tries to--"
2005.04-1528,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2725.574,2726.835,"Okay, the opposing candidate or the State."
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2726.835,2740.875,--So Justice Brandeis said that there's room under our system for a courageous State to experiment.
2005.04-1528,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2740.875,2743.213,Just can I ask a technical question here?
2005.04-1528,1,46116,william_h_sorrell,,2743.213,2743.613,Yes.
2005.04-1528,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2743.613,2754.966,"Just... is... is it the case or not the case that if I contribute my car to drive the candidate for Governor, let's say, between Burlington and Montpelier, and I buy the gas, does that count against the limit?"

2005.04-1528,2,18138,brenda_wright,,2884.683,2885.699,--But the--

2005.04-1528,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2939.932,2940.86,But I thought--
2005.04-1528,2,18138,brenda_wright,,2940.86,2941.626,--understand that that's--

2005.04-1528,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2970.429,2971.045,Which is it?

2005.04-1528,2,18138,brenda_wright,,3039.063,3039.824,--Yes.
2005.04-1528,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3039.824,3040.918,--to run effective campaigns.
2005.04-1528,2,18138,brenda_wright,,3040.918,3057.13,"Yes, Your Honor, because this Burlington mayor's race, as an example, was one in which there was no limit on... on spending, and both candidates were able to raise amounts either similar to what they had raised in the past or at least amounts that met the campaign budget that they had sought to... to follow."
2005.04-1528,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3081.657,3082.751,I thought the--
2005.04-1528,2,18138,brenda_wright,,3082.751,3083.417,--did the same ratio for Vermont.
2005.04-1528,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3084.678,3085.689,--Wasn't it the State auditor?
2005.04-1528,2,18138,brenda_wright,,3085.689,3088.127,Not the $8 million or $9 million.

2005.04-1528,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3282.352,3283.113,That solves that problem.
2005.04-1528,2,18138,brenda_wright,,3284.113,3284.54,--Well--
2005.04-1528,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3284.54,3287.895,"But you want to limit expenditures, even if it's the person's own money."
2005.04-1528,2,18138,brenda_wright,,3296.887,3316.964,"--Because the... the interests that Vermont is seeking to serve are fundamental to the core functions of government, preserving the quality of representative government, preserving the integrity of government, assuring the public that its officeholders can act in the best interests of the public and make decisions on the merits, not simply based on their need for campaign cash."

2005.04-1528,3,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3537.803,3544.857,It comes about because challengers frequently in Vermont actually spend more than do incumbents.
