1983.82-472,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,79.328,"Mr. Dion, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,79.328,82.67,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.362,226.112,"Where do we find that, Mr. Dion, in the papers?"
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,229.626,233.531,"--A copy of it is in our Appendix at Appendix 1, Your Honor."
1983.82-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.022,613.284,"Mr. Dion, you say that the government relies on speeches by individual senators and House members and you rely on synopses and a preamble."
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,615.814,623.342,"Well, both of us rely initially on the wording of the statute and both submit that the express wording supports their respective positions."
1983.82-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.886,632.353,At that point you go to the secondary theory.
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,632.353,634.118,That is when both sides go to the secondary.
1983.82-472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,642.724,665.622,"Mr. Dion, with respect to Congress' stated purpose which, as I understand it, was to eradicate organized crime, why in the world would Congress have wanted to exempt from forfeiture cash profits that are the primary product of an illegal enterprise?"
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,670.51,675.039,"Well, there are primarily two reasons, Your Honor."
1983.82-472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,716.788,721.973,Wasn't it Congress' whole purpose to make a crime unprofitable?
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,721.973,723.051,"Of course, it was."
1983.82-472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,723.051,725.909,"And, if you don't forfeit the profits, how do you do that?"
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,725.909,728.456,"Well, again, there are two answers."
1983.82-472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,789.477,797.021,"Well, that letter referred to a different version of the bill that was eventually enacted."
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,797.021,824.478,"It was a predecessor of the 1963, however, the importance of the statute... of the letter at this juncture is that when Congress said, is it constitutional, Kleindeinst responded, yes, it is constitutional as limited, as limited to interest in the enterprise, and as limited so that no other property is subject to forfeiture."
1983.82-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.108,913.912,"Mr. Dion, looking again at the language of 1963(a) as it appears in your brief at, I guess, the second page of the Appendix, what is the difference in operation between Subsection... What does Subsection (2) have that Subsection (1) doesn't and and vice versa?"
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,946.758,959.377,"Unfortunately, I am not a grammarian, however, several of the lower courts have so indicated that that limitation does apply across-the-board, if not expressly as an indication of the intent of the entire section."
1983.82-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,959.377,964.907,"Well, is the reach of (1) somehow narrower than (2)?"
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,964.907,973.231,It is not a question of being narrower or not.
1983.82-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1035.222,1037.83,What then does (a)(2) reach that (a)(1) doesn't?
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1037.83,1066.068,"(a)(2) primarily would reach not only interest in the enterprise which give a source of influence, which would also be arguably be covered under (a)(1), but it also allows the forfeiture of the securities, the claims, property contractual rights, all of which are a form of influence that arguably is not subject to forfeiture under (a)(1)."
1983.82-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1076.705,1099.211,"But, surely, when Congress is writing in one single paragraph that someone shall forfeit to the United States, (1), and then a sentence, and then, (2), a sentence, we assume that Congress has two different... It was striking at two different things or it would have put it all in one sentence."
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1099.211,1099.758,"--Of course, Your Honor."
1983.82-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.02,1155.439,"I wonder if you misspoke or if I was incorrectly advised, but was it not (a)(2) that was originally in the statute and (a)(1) that was added later?"
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1155.439,1157.126,I do not believe so.
1983.82-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.828,1166.918,"Because the original draft, I thought, was expressly limited to interest in an enterprise."
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1166.918,1167.918,--That is correct.
1983.82-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.308,1170.901,"No, it is (a)(2)."
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1170.901,1172.182,"Excuse me, let me rephrase that."
1983.82-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.882,1180.773,Right.
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1180.773,1182.959,"Which they did not then separate in any way, shape, or form."
1983.82-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.803,1187.614,"Now, the words (a)(2), but not in (a)(1)."
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1187.614,1196.501,"And, I would submit that they are in (a)(2) for the express purpose of modifying the other sections of (a)(2) which were not in the predecessor proposed statute."
1983.82-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.501,1213.947,"Is it correct that under your reading, and I am not suggesting it is not tenable, but you in effect read in the words (a)(1) and you also treat the violation of Section 1962 language as though it said violation of Section 1962(a) or (b)."
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1224.146,1228.957,This is where I disagree with some of the lower courts that have ruled in my favor.
1983.82-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.773,1301.958,You are saying that if the government... If you lose that the entire property would have been forfeitable?
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1301.958,1302.833,That is correct.
1983.82-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.833,1304.426,Not just the profit from the illegal activity?
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1304.426,1308.784,"The property would have been forfeitable because it was donated and used by the enterprise, yes, sir."
1983.82-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1333.071,1338.413,"You say, Mr. Dion, that here we are going into the area of policy formulation."
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1348.283,1350.002,--Exactly the opposite.
1983.82-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1432.468,1435.497,"Well, what is the constitutional problem?"
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1435.497,1439.121,Personally I don't see one.
1983.82-472,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.121,1440.62,I don't either.
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1440.62,1442.494,"Personally I think they have every right to do it, Your Honor."
1983.82-472,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1442.494,1445.477,"Well, were you raising that as the policy question?"
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1448.632,1449.336,No.
1983.82-472,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1492.179,1495.787,Why does that concern the judicial process?
1983.82-472,0,39051,ronald_a_dion,,1495.787,1499.863,"It absolutely should not concern this Court, Your Honor, absolutely should not."
1983.82-472,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1502.316,1511.204,Mr. Alito?
