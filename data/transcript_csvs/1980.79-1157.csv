1980.79-1157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.233,We will hear arguments next in Rosewell v. LaSalle National Bank.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,65.1,68.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,184.05,190.767,"A 1983 action in the state court, are you referring to, now?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,190.767,191.392,Yes.
1980.79-1157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,204.917,208.198,Any other remedies besides 1983 in the state court?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,208.198,209.634,She certainly did.
1980.79-1157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,248.149,264.206,"Well, her response to that in part is that since the State pays no interest on the tax while the refund's being litigated, that that's not an efficient remedy."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,265.394,276.873,"Well, our response is that the taxpayer would have a right to file a 1983 action in a state court raising that precise claim."
1980.79-1157,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,306.83,311.671,How far behind is your Cook County civil calendar these days?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,311.671,316.824,"It's... well, we're about five years behind right now."
1980.79-1157,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,326.322,328.836,You would call five years' delay a speedy remedy?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,328.836,342.409,"Well, it's speedy in the sense that if the taxpayer... it's available to the taxpayer, and the taxpayer has a damage remedy that... at least a taxpayer who can pay has a damage remedy available to her."
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,384.816,399.075,"Mr. Hauser, isn't it possible that there's no constitutional right to interest, but that nevertheless, the denial of interest when you have to wait four or five years to get your money back, would prevent the remedy from being speedy, adequate, and efficient, or whatever the statutory language is?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,399.075,410.429,--Well I think that in that aspect one has to balance the threatened harm from a federal tax injunction against the delay or the harm that's caused to the taxpayer.
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,417.49,419.192,What is the federal damage remedy?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,425.112,426.877,"--Well, she would have to show that, judge."
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,426.877,443.041,"I don't think that responds to my question that one might assume there's no federal constitutional right to interest, and nevertheless feel that a remedy which denies interest on withheld money for a five-year period is not an adequate remedy, within the meaning of the statute."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,443.041,457.676,"Well, again we argue the policy that under Tully v. Griffin, as long as long as the taxpayer suffers no irreparable injury, that whatever one might want to say qualitatively--"
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,457.676,461.409,"Well, it's surely irreparable if you lose the use of the money for five years."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,466.126,466.86,"--No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,471.373,474.982,"Well, but it only supports a damage claim if there's a constitutional right to interest."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,474.982,487.304,"Well, then, what's the... I question the policy behind the other side of the argument that there is some reason why there should be, why that must lay?"
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,487.304,491.553,"Well, the reason would be that an adequate remedy ought to make the litigant who's been harmed whole."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,493.084,495.504,"Well, the damage remedy certainly does that, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,495.504,506.376,"Well, five years at 15 percent a year, or even ten, to make it easier to compute, at least for me, that doesn't make them very whole, does it?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,506.376,507.485,"Well, let me refocus that."
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,524.555,528.115,"Yes, but these are all ""ifs""."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,529.412,530.271,"No, we don't, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.317,535.051,You just say she's got a right to file another lawsuit and see if she can get it?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,535.051,535.504,--Right.
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.776,563.539,But only predicated on a constitutional violation?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,563.539,567.318,"--Well, that's so; that's so."
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.19,576.596,Right.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,576.596,588.28,"And we respectfully submit that the risk... the complaint alleges, and I need to clarify this, the complaint alleges a two-year delay, not a five-year delay."
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.346,623.922,What's the calendar like in the federal court for Cook County?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,623.922,627.343,The calendar of the federal court?
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,631.044,635.605,"Well, is it slower than... is it as slow as the state court?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,635.605,640.292,"Well, we don't have any federal tax cases, Your Honor, with which we can measure this."
1980.79-1157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,641.431,643.337,What's the civil calendar generally?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,643.337,645.96,"That I couldn't say, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.929,653.472,"Well, now, what's the interval from the filing of the complaint to trial in the federal court?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,653.472,655.034,"I have no idea, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.784,659.532,"It's probably pretty long, isn't it?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,659.532,669.138,"Well, it's probably... the question is whether that, whether the federal remedy is any speedier than the state, if we're talking about damage remedies."
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,676.947,681.571,"Mr. Hauser, you keep saying, if she gets the interest back."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,684.102,687.288,--Except that her position is that she--
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,687.288,690.396,"I know what her position is, but your position is that she's not entitled to interest."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,690.927,692.144,--Under Illinois law.
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.144,695.049,Under Illinois law or under the Federal Constitution?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,695.049,695.893,"Well, we argue that also."
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.893,697.813,Yes.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,703.109,708.217,"Well, if she can demonstrate the right to the interest, she ought not... unless she can demonstrate the right to interest--"
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.217,709.746,"Yes, I know, but you don't concede she has any right to interest."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,709.746,724.788,"--I couldn't, Your Honor, because we oppose that position, and I... but I say this, that unless the taxpayer can demonstrate a right to interest and demonstrate... or, let's say, interest may be the wrong word."
1980.79-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,738.157,757.774,"Well, then she wouldn't... you can turn that argument on its head too, and say that if she can't demonstrate that she has a right to what she's claiming, she's not entitled to the injunction that she's claiming, not because of the anti-injunction statute, but because of a shortcoming in her pleadings."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,757.774,758.805,"We argue that too, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.849,774.36,"Isn't the real question, how soon should she get a hearing?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,789.152,793.603,"--Well, the question is whether she's entitled to an injunction in a federal court."
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.603,793.916,Yes.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,793.916,805.021,"And the question in the federal court is whether... not only whether there's a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in the state court, but also whether there's a remedy in the federal court."
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,811.362,825.45,"Well, is it true that in her administrative remedy, is the remedy provided by the Illinois tax statutes and refund statutes, there is no interest allowable in those, is there?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,825.45,825.809,--Not... the way--
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.809,827.917,Is that right or not?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,827.917,831.807,"--As a matter of Illinois statutory construction, that's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,831.807,832.354,All right.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,839.726,847.286,Or the availability in federal court of a similar damage remedy which is the predicate for our state argument.
1980.79-1157,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,966.377,970.017,"Mr. Hauser, it's a little late in the argument, but how are you going to get under 1983?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,970.017,974.031,"--Well, that's my question too, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,975.141,976.248,That was another question.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,985.182,986.526,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,986.526,993.381,And the Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit referred to that question as the sole question.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,993.381,993.897,That's right.
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,993.897,996.553,I'm looking at page 2a of the certiorari petition.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,996.553,996.99,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,996.99,1000.161,"Now, all of a sudden, on the argument, we have three questions."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1000.676,1001.77,"Well, here's how it happened, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1002.176,1005.986,One of those questions is the one to which my brother Marshall has just directed your attention.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1005.986,1006.471,--Yes.
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1020.153,1024.573,"But it's not a question, then, on which we granted certiorari, nor fairly subsumed within it, is it?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1024.573,1026.416,"Well, it's not... we suggest that it is."
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1026.416,1036.255,"We granted certiorari to consider a single question and the Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit said they had a single, and to use their word, s-o-l-e, sole question."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1037.052,1054.374,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor, although I suggest that if the decision of the 7th Circuit is incorrect, then if the decision of Judge Bua in the district court was correct but for the wrong reasons, then it simply makes sense to reach that issue as a matter of judicial economy."
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1071.603,1087.016,"Then the only question presented in the certiorari petition and the only question that the Court of Appeals undertook to decide was whether or not there was a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in the state courts."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1087.86,1089.235,--My response to that is that--
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1089.235,1090.094,Isn't that correct?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1090.094,1093.874,"--Well, that's the question that they decided, but--"
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1093.874,1094.39,Yes.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1096.498,1097.576,"--Well, no, there's two questions."
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1097.936,1106.463,"Well, I only see one, and I'm looking at page 2 of your petition for certiorari: ""Question presented""."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1107.556,1108.322,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1118.77,1119.566,Yes.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1122.862,1123.378,--Right.
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.378,1128.563,"But your point is, your question did include two alternative state remedies, is it not?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1128.563,1132.202,"Yes, it really did."
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.202,1132.92,"Yes, but it didn't include the propriety of a federal 1983 action."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1132.92,1135.186,"That's correct, Your Honor, although that's a fundamental question which is--"
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1135.186,1143.45,"Well, that's a fundamental and quite a different question from the one embraced in your certiorari petition on which we granted."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1143.45,1162.956,"--It is a different question, although I think that if there is federal jurisdiction lacking, again, the district court ruled in the favor of the County, on granting the motion to dismiss, and it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to allow a judge to be reversed, if he was right for the wrong reason."
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.498,1188.555,"Don't you really... just like in this case, the question of the power to issue the injunction, was reached before decisions on whether the complaint stated a cause of action."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1188.555,1189.164,"Well, the difficulty--"
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.164,1190.664,"Which is rather normal, isn't it?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1190.664,1201.284,"--Well, the difficulty is that the usual way that these tax cases go is under a 1341 analysis of the federal tax injunction statute."
1980.79-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1320.331,1327.25,Is a 1983 action available in state courts in this kind of tax case?
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1327.25,1334.997,"Well, we don't know that, Your Honor, because it's never been filed."
1980.79-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1335.356,1335.683,You don't know it.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1342.072,1342.697,--That's correct.
1980.79-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1342.697,1345.305,We've held it in Thiboutat last term that it may.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1345.305,1345.883,That it may.
1980.79-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1345.883,1354.942,"Now, if there's no requirement that... you don't know whether it will or won't, does that bear on the plaintiff's speedy and efficient remedy?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1354.942,1355.16,Yes.
1980.79-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1405.249,1413.464,"My question really is, it's clear that the action is available in the federal court; no doubt about that."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1420.633,1429.349,"--The question is, there's a failure, I think, to distinguish between injunctive relief as against damage relief."
1980.79-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1521.281,1529.902,"Does this imply that were this 1983 action of the taxpayer in federal court limited to a claim of a damage remedy, you wouldn't be making this argument?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1529.902,1534.243,--I'm not sure that I understand that.
1980.79-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1534.618,1540.07,"Well, would you be resisting the 1983 suit, seeking only damages in federal court?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1540.07,1544.333,--We resisted that in federal court and we lost in the 7th Circuit and certiorari was denied.
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.374,1565.591,But it's an availability under federal law.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1580.943,1586.879,--I think that--
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.879,1589.44,"After all, it will be federal law, won't it?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1589.44,1592.095,"--Well, the difficulty we--"
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.095,1592.861,"Well, will it or not?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1592.861,1593.547,--I think it might--
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.547,1596.609,"If it's under 1983 it is a federal statute, it will be federal law."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1596.609,1600.436,--It will be a state determination of the federal law.
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1600.436,1603.372,"Well, that the action substantively will proceed under federal law?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1603.372,1603.56,Right.
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.947,1611.228,"Oh, I don't know."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1611.853,1613.087,"--Well, yes--"
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.087,1614.101,A remedy in the state courts.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1618.818,1619.849,"--Well, here's what I would say to that--"
1980.79-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.849,1624.364,"I know what your answer is, but... your answer is, yes."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1624.364,1632.828,"--The answer is that the state court will look to federal law, much the same way that federal courts look to state law in diversity jurisdictions."
1980.79-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.608,1689.026,"But if the remedy you're relying on to get you out from under 1341 is a damage suit in federal court, it simply doesn't come within the language of 1341."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1689.026,1690.791,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.743,1708.128,"Well, however it may be, you can't invoke 1341 by saying that she has an adequate damage remedy in federal court."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1711.376,1735.118,"But we do argue that in Tully v. Griffin, a 1341 case that under the broader view of equity law, that a federal court is under an equitable duty to refrain from interfering with a state's collection of its revenue, except in cases where a federal right may otherwise be lost, and the view is not restricted solely to the state remedy, but to the federal remedy too."
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1735.118,1760.03,"Mr. Hauser, I think my brother Rehnquist's point is that the plain language of 1341 says that a federal court does not have the power to enjoin the collection of state taxes where there is a speedy, a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in the state courts, in the state courts."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1760.03,1760.466,That's right.
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1784.004,1789.845,"Well, there might be reasons not to issue an injunction in various cases, depending upon--"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1789.845,1790.423,--Yes.
1980.79-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1790.423,1800.653,"--In any particular case, depending upon the generally applicable maximus of equity with respect to irreparable damage and no adequate remedy at law and the rest of it."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1808.337,1809.119,"Well, no."
1980.79-1157,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1847.729,1862.598,"Well, what case is there that fits in to say that you do have a remedy in the state courts of Illinois under 1983?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1865.237,1871.578,"I have a case, I cited it in my brief, Your Honor, Alberty v. Daniel."
1980.79-1157,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1876.076,1879.357,"I didn't say, willingness; I said, that says it can be done."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1879.357,1887.276,"--Well, Your Honor, if Your Honor demands a case, me to demonstrate a case that's never been filed, I can't."
1980.79-1157,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1888.338,1890.868,"Well, isn't that what the statute requires?"
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1890.868,1895.6,"--No, I don't think so, because I think that is--"
1980.79-1157,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1895.6,1907.252,"Well, I think the statute requires either a case or a statute which says that the courts of Illinois are open for this point, 1983."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1908.205,1924.481,"--The only point I would make, Your Honor, is that as far as 1983 is concerned, the Illinois appellate court in the district in which the taxpayer's property is located has accepted jurisdiction of a 1983 action arising out of employment claims."
1980.79-1157,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1931.195,1933.804,I know a lot of other things they've never denied.
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1938.021,1938.802,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1938.802,1940.395,"Mr. Hauser, just one question, if I may."
1980.79-1157,0,27285,henry_a_hauser,,1947.096,1948.252,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1956.467,1967.04,Mr. Fox?
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,1967.04,1970.054,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2039.121,2043.556,Do you equate inadequate with inefficient?
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2043.556,2044.181,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2071.186,2075.637,"Well, there are a great many claims against the United States in which no interest is allowed."
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2089.116,2097.565,"Sir, in the context of the United States, first of all, we do have the question of the sovereign."
1980.79-1157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2107.531,2109.811,"Well, haven't you got a sovereign here?"
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2109.811,2119.792,"We are not claiming, Mr. Chief Justice, that Illinois is compelled to award interest."
1980.79-1157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2155.464,2161.26,"Well, there's a certain circularity to that, though, counsel, isn't there?"
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2177.767,2187.857,"No, sir, because we do not sue for a refund... 1341 is directed only to injunctive relief and this case stands on that particular proposition which we have alleged."
1980.79-1157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2207.272,2207.709,"Now, what is that?"
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2208.1,2208.818,"--No, sir."
1980.79-1157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2215.799,2216.409,It's an equal protection claim?
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2216.409,2221.015,"--An equal protection and due process, no matter how you call it."
1980.79-1157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.726,2249.349,You're... the lack of provision for interest is simply the reason why the remedy is inadequate?
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2249.349,2250.379,--The remedy is inadequate.
1980.79-1157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.159,2256.126,"And the merits of your constitutional claim are not here at all, are they?"
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2256.126,2258.204,--I think they are procedurally admitted.
1980.79-1157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2258.204,2264.669,"Yes, but the only question is, whether or not 1341 bars an injunction."
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2264.669,2265.263,Exactly.
1980.79-1157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2265.263,2270.604,"There's no question here about whether or not, for some other reason, you may not be entitled to an injunction."
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2270.604,2271.51,That is correct.
1980.79-1157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.872,2317.274,"But then, why should it be of any importance in the administration of the anti-injunction statute that a state doesn't allow interest, if you have no constitutional right to it?"
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2317.274,2350.619,"Because, I believe that to take a man's money today... to paraphrase Judge Learned Hand about 50 years ago in the Procter & Gamble case, to take a man's money today as a condition of his going into court and being able to sue for a refund and then two or more years later giving back that same money, is giving back less than the state took."
1980.79-1157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2350.619,2360.568,"So, even though it is not a constitutional violation, it brings into play, it relieves you from the bar of 1341?"
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2360.568,2361.24,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2410.923,2413.437,Now you're talking about a Fifth Amendment taking?
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2413.437,2415.952,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2418.498,2423.262,"Well, but you've said it's not in this case, but you've put it in the case."
1980.79-1157,1,30333,james_l_fox,,2423.262,2424.184,I apologize--
