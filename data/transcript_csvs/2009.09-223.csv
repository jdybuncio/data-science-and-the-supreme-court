2009.09-223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.087,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-223, Levin, the Tax Commissioner, v. Commerce Energy."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,8.02,10.789,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.09-223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,48.581,53.218,"Before you get into that, I have a question that there may be an obvious answer to, but I haven't found it."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,66.742,0.0,"--That is how they have -- that is the case, correct."
2009.09-223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,69.158,0.0,Okay.
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,126.659,133.997,"Well, I think there is a good reason that there -- there aren't cases in the Federal courts to that effect, but it's not a standing problem."
2009.09-223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,144.167,156.725,"I have no doubt, and the standing rule I think is clear, that if we're saying because I am injured, and they have injury, you can't -- you must give me reduction in my tax."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,193.462,202.734,"I am not aware of any prudential standing rule, Your Honor, any case, but that's because the Tax Injunction Act and the comity doctrine have always prohibited such a case."
2009.09-223,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,205.234,218.076,"Well, I suppose in discrimination cases, if there is a discrimination men versus women one way to resolve it would be to have either -- either rule apply to both sides."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,218.076,218.693,--That's right.
2009.09-223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.405,260.52,"On the other hand, until the Administrative Procedure Act was enacted, which -- which eliminated all prudential bars to standing -- it clearly was the law that you could not complain about preference, unlawful preference, being given by the government under regulatory provisions to a competitor."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,271.042,287.484,"--And cases would have existed challenging State tax laws, regardless of the APA for Federal challenges, because the -- and those cases all would have existed in the State courts, because that is where State tax laws and State administrative procedures are best challenged."
2009.09-223,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,309.98,317.086,--State law is unclear here that would require Federal interpretation?
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,317.086,336.631,"--At pages 27 to 33 of the blue brief, we identify all of the ways in which the parties, the State and the Respondents, dispute the application and meaning of State tax law, particularly as to what taxes should be compared for apples and oranges purposes."
2009.09-223,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,356.728,369.552,"So why can't the Pullman doctrine or the Burford doctrine, abstention doctrines, be enough to counsel Federal abstention in this case?"
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,376.289,386.995,"--The Court doesn't have to create anything, Your Honor, because Fair Assessment and Great Lakes already say that the Burford and Pullman principles get sort of bonus points in the tax context."
2009.09-223,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,387.264,389.73,So why did you -- did you argue Pullman in the court below?
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,389.73,395.267,"--Yes, the principles of abstention were argued in the district court and--"
2009.09-223,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,395.267,395.667,"No, no, no, no."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,400.987,427.389,"--To be frank, I don't know if Pullman was -- was specifically cited, but that's because Fair Assessment itself, which was heavily cited in the lower courts, incorporates the principles of Pullman and Burford and says that these tax questions raise -- that these tax challenges raise questions about the meaning of State law, about the operation of a complicated regulatory regime, and so they are better left to the State court."
2009.09-223,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,487.991,515.741,"Do you think it's -- it's correct -- in relation to Hibbs, is it accurate to say that you think that this case is different from Hibbs for essentially three reasons: That this one involves a complicated analysis of State law and Hibbs did not; that this one would potentially have a substantial financial effect on the State and in Hibbs that would not happen; and this case involves claims under the dormant Commerce Clause and equal protection rather than the Establishment Clause?"
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,518.859,521.375,"The first two especially capture it, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,557.095,564.415,"Well, suppose if this -- you have the dormant Commerce Clause claim and it doesn't require a complicated analysis of State law."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,581.557,604.39,"I think it would be a much closer case, Your Honor, but still there would be an interest in allowing the State courts to resolve that challenge, because as the Court has explained, when a State court is -- is trying to address a constitutional challenge that involves the application of State law, it can engage in constitutional avoidance in ways that the Federal courts cannot."
2009.09-223,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,637.76,647.366,"Let's assume that States have a law that said, we are going to do different tax schemes for African Americans than from whites."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,665.642,680.234,"--Fair Assessment says in footnote 4 that if it doesn't -- if such a challenge doesn't require scrutiny of the meaning and application of State laws, then it may -- Fair Assessment suggests that such a case might be able to proceed in Federal court."
2009.09-223,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,691.859,693.978,I don't know if that is an answer to my question or not.
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,712.69,715.991,"--I see, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,732.334,736.821,And you reach that conclusion under the comity principles of Fair Assessment?
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,736.821,746.261,"--I do, but also because the Tax Injunction Act would exclude the case if it would have revenue depleting effects--"
2009.09-223,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,746.261,746.994,Revenue depleting.
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,746.994,748.327,--on the State coffers.
2009.09-223,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,760.302,767.823,I am curious to know why neither opinion in Hibbs addressed the comity principle and I would like your view on that.
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,777.012,783.599,"Well, it was fully briefed in Hibbs, and that is I think why the Court addressed comity in footnote 9."
2009.09-223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,823.221,834.427,"It wasn't brought up -- comity wasn't brought up in Hibbs because if the -- if there was an alleged constitutional violation, then there was only one way to go."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,886.275,889.31,--I think there are three options available to the State court.
2009.09-223,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,927.165,929.515,May I come back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,952.363,959.184,--I think the entire provision would have to be stricken in Hibbs because of the nature of the as-applied challenge there.
2009.09-223,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,963.986,979.579,"The point is that -- that one possible -- if there was an Establishment Clause violation, one remedy would be to prohibit credits for payments made to religiously affiliated schools, but allow the credits for other private schools."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,990.435,1007.412,"--That's probably right, Your Honor, and the -- what it illustrates is that often State courts have available to them remedies that Federal courts may not, particularly when plaintiffs have pleaded the case in such a way as to tie one hand behind the Federal court's back."
2009.09-223,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1007.412,1009.848,Doesn't that suggest Hibbs should have come out the other way?
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1009.848,1015.852,"Well, to be frank, Your Honor, the State of Ohio joined an amicus brief urging the opposite outcome in Hibbs."
2009.09-223,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1027.641,1028.758,If -- just one more.
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1042.75,1045.952,"--Yes, I believe so, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1054.974,1058.343,Contempt of the legislature?
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1059.343,1061.193,--Of the -- of the tax commissioner.
2009.09-223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1109.805,1118.744,"Where is -- the cases running up to Hibbs, those were all cases that involved racial discrimination, and they were in the Federal courts."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1118.744,1140.34,"They were, Your Honor, and in -- in every case that we have examined one of two things was true: Either the party was claiming standing not based on the fact that he himself was subject to unconstitutional taxes; or the party was not -- did not have an adequate remedy in the State court."
2009.09-223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.84,1173.041,"Is there anything -- I see in their complaint, they ask for"
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1190.134,1191.086,We think--
2009.09-223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.086,1200.541,"What is -- what's your -- you better give me your accurate assessment, not just agree with me, because I would like to know what you -- I want to know both sides."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1200.541,1218.086,"--The Tax Injunction Act would bar the Court, I think, from entering an order that says the taxes on the challengers are decreased, which illustrates the reason that the State of Ohio with its sovereign interest in its own tax policy--"
2009.09-223,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1218.086,1226.175,But I have no idea -- why I am asking the question is I have no idea or little idea of the underlying State law merits.
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1244.903,1257.544,"--Well, first of all, Your Honor, the -- the merits of this case are very much like the merits of General Motors Corporation v. Tracy, which this Court decided about 13 years ago."
2009.09-223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.072,1345.064,"Yes, but this -- but this doctrine, I -- I am not very sympathetic to that argument because this is a doctrine that is directed to the State collecting taxes, not to interfering with State regulation."
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1347.249,1380.403,"--But Your Honor, I think that Great Lakes and Fair Assessment stand for the proposition that when a Federal court issues an order that invalidates a State tax law, that has a disruptive effect on the collection of taxes; and that would be true here because the State of Ohio would no longer be able -- would not be able to collect five different taxes from local distribution companies without being -- turning around and facing a new challenge on -- on unconstitutionality of that burden by the local distribution companies."
2009.09-223,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.951,1407.034,I'm just a little puzzled.
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1427.66,1450.859,"--The State court might be able to enter a remedy, Justice Stevens, that is so simple as enjoining the sales tax exemption and the commercial activities tax exemption for local distribution companies, and then also saying that because the LDCs have to pay those taxes they no longer have to pay the gross receipts tax and the other two taxes that are imposed on them."
2009.09-223,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1458.365,1464.519,But the Tax Injunction Act goes to the authority or the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the case in the first place.
2009.09-223,0,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,1477.342,1493.436,"--With respect, Your Honor, I think that Great -- that Grace Brethren squarely stands for the proposition that a Federal court shouldn't enter an order that says that the State tax law is -- that declares the State tax law unconstitutional and then enjoins it."
2009.09-223,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1518.567,1519.602,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1527.691,1533.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1541.532,1541.932,That's all right.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1543.249,1545.568,"--I understand, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1578.789,1586.128,"They might want to -- in all the Court's cases, the challenger wanted -- he said: I don't care; either make them pay or give me my money back."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1586.128,1586.611,--Well--
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1586.611,1589.847,"So that -- that should be your case, I would have thought."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1600.804,1605.089,"--Well, Justice Breyer, so -- what I would say is that--"
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1605.089,1614.528,"The Establishment Clause, I would add, there is a lot of reason for thinking it's special in respect to standing, because there is no other way to challenge the Establishment Clause."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1621.782,1622.965,"--And I understand that, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1634.589,1641.511,But you see what is worrying me.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1665.041,1665.293,--Okay.
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1711.238,1712.94,And this is not true of the other cases.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1762.901,1769.971,"Your Honor, I don't -- as my friend Mr. Mizer said, I don't believe a court could say: Give them an exemption."
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1769.971,1770.271,Why not?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1770.271,1771.757,It would be in violation of the TIA.
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1771.757,1772.057,"No, no."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1773.19,1777.225,It would interrupt -- interrupt -- it would impede the collection of taxes.
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1777.225,1777.661,--Of course.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1805.228,1808.263,"And I -- I'm -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer."
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1817.119,1818.469,You didn't ask only for the other relief.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1827.074,1828.374,--We did include that phrase.
2009.09-223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.794,1836.328,I think your--
2009.09-223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1836.328,1836.494,Suppose the answer -- suppose the answer--
2009.09-223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.494,1842.648,--I think your answer is that relief that would violate the Tax Injunction Act is not appropriate relief.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1842.648,1844.248,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.248,1845.95,And therefore not covered by your plea.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1845.95,1848.302,And that was not what we were seeking.
2009.09-223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1848.302,1849.586,Makes sense to me.
2009.09-223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1849.586,1852.354,"--Well, there's another little problem."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1883.642,1886.844,"The response, Justice Ginsburg, is this."
2009.09-223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1938.758,1939.96,What was that argument?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1948.899,1959.337,"Well, our argument was simply, Your Honor, that we are challenging the exemption issued by the State."
2009.09-223,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1980.251,1984.119,"Well, in Hibbs, were all the beneficiaries of the provision that was challenged parties--"
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1984.119,1984.386,I'm sorry?
2009.09-223,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1984.386,1990.273,"--In Hibbs, were all of the beneficiaries of the provision that was challenged parties in that case?"
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1990.273,1991.207,"They were not, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1992.559,1995.427,Was there a due process problem there because of that?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,1995.427,2000.812,"I cannot identify a due process problem there, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2052.661,2054.177,You conceded -- I'm sorry.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2062.017,2063.517,--In State court.
2009.09-223,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2093.869,2106.796,So you are claiming that the Federal court could only power -- only power would be to declare it unconstitutional and send it back the State legislature to decide what to do?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2118.103,2118.486,--Okay.
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2141.552,2158.328,"So then, in your opinion, your next-door law firm, next to you, brings a case and says: Mr. Fitch should pay $1,000 more taxes next year because he deducted $2,000 that was illegal."
2009.09-223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.517,2174.504,"Your next-door neighbor has to be a competitor of yours before it would be an exact parallel, right?"
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2174.504,2176.79,"I believe that is correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.79,2179.957,"I mean, your next-door neighbor in your business, which would be a competing law firm."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2179.957,2180.374,Yes.
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2184.659,2186.778,But they don't actually bring you into the case.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2189.294,2193.932,"--If I could try to bring that point home, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.09-223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2215.328,2217.38,Why should -- why should the Federal court make that choice?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2258.89,2262.342,--We do not believe that the Federal court could extend that benefit.
2009.09-223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2266.477,2268.162,The State court could.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2268.162,2270.862,--We questioned whether the State could.
2009.09-223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.006,2322.942,That raises another -- another problem for me.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2336.715,2337.301,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.557,2347.223,Right.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2347.223,2364.083,"And what our -- what our complaint lays out is the sea change of change, we have gone from a regulated situation to essentially an unregulated situation on the gas commodity piece."
2009.09-223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.477,2408.443,"Counsel, I -- I hate to introduce another procedural glitch into this thing, but as I -- as I understand it, the State's motion to dismiss was under -- under 12(b)(1), which is a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and that was granted by the court."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2432.355,2433.374,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2009.09-223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.374,2434.957,You did not make that objection.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2434.957,2439.444,"We did not -- we did not make that objection, I do not believe."
2009.09-223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2498.713,2501.665,But that's because there was only one way to go.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2530.501,2537.821,"--And -- and I think what we are trying to say, Justice Ginsburg, in our -- in our case is we are not trying to seek invalidation."
2009.09-223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2542.123,2547.844,"It is not up to you to make that decision, if the State can go either way."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2560.27,2572.411,"But, Your Honor, the point we are making is that some court somewhere has to make the decision whether this exemption violates the dormant Commerce Clause in the equal protection case."
2009.09-223,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2612.353,2626.379,"Do you -- do you recognize that comity is broader than the Tax Injunction Act, and if it is, how do you justify your argument that would essentially limit the comity doctrine to the contours of the Tax Injunction Act?"
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2626.379,2639.722,"--Justice Alito, what the court has said, not only this Court but the First Circuit said in Coors, is what the Sixth Circuit says is that comity extends broader than the TIA."
2009.09-223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.802,2740.671,Let me just go back to my question before.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2752.377,2752.895,"They are, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2752.895,2760.815,And isn't -- is not the reason they are subject to a different tax regime is historically they were in regulated utilities?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2760.815,2777.86,"To -- to -- to some extent I believe that's correct, Justice Stevens, but my response would be this: If we want to get into them, what taxes do they pay, versus what taxes do we pay -- that's a merits question."
2009.09-223,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2799.257,2809.148,And you don't think that the very question of what taxes you compare and don't compare is a matter of interpreting State law?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2817.235,2819.503,"We -- we believe it is not, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.09-223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2860.264,2864.882,But the idea was the Federal court should abstain.
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2875.738,2878.79,"Well, but -- very early on they raised it."
2009.09-223,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2946.664,2961.59,"When you say that there is no impeding of State court process or taxes, because neither a Federal or State court could order the reduction of the exemption--"
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2961.59,2964.125,"--That -- that is correct, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2964.125,2972.463,"--That is -- even though the practical consequence is that that is a remedy that the State could choose, or must consider."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2972.463,2974.148,"It -- it could, Your Honor."
2009.09-223,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2974.848,2977.1,"That wasn't an issue, however, in Hibbs."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,2977.1,2977.9,--That -- that's right.
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3007.219,3008.719,Or why isn't this a Hibbs?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,3049.712,3053.164,"--What's wrong with it, Your Honor, is because what we are trying to do is fix a problem."
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3058.818,3059.585,Why not?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,3059.585,3061.437,What we're -- because that's not.
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3061.437,3062.937,So not give it -- up to the State?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,3066.655,3079.296,"The point that we tried to get across in our brief, Your Honor, is that we are in a competitive situation where we are trying to solve a problem, the problem of policy that has been adopted in Ohio or freeing up this--"
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3079.296,3081.498,If doesn't solve the problem for you if you get a refund?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,3081.498,3082.548,--It does not.
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3082.548,3083.081,Why not?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,3083.081,3084.433,The problem remains.
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3084.433,3084.916,Why?
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,3084.916,3088.652,"Well, the problem remains because the exemption still exists."
2009.09-223,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3088.652,3096.406,"Well, no, no, you have it, too -- they -- they work it out, so it equally applies to everybody including your clients, so you are all on the same footing."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,3098.258,3105.995,"And I guess we have to be careful with the term ""refund"", because what I am saying is -- is that we are dealing with primarily -- we have three taxes to deal with."
2009.09-223,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3233.463,3234.58,"Thank you, Mr. Fitch."
2009.09-223,1,41289,stephen_c_fitch,,3234.58,3235.913,"Thank you, members of the Court."

2009.09-223,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3238.781,3247.987,"First off, Justice Scalia's question about the 12(b)(1) dismissal motion."
2009.09-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3271.419,3276.221,All threshold non-merits questions are jurisdictional questions?
2009.09-223,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3276.221,3277.073,No.
2009.09-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3281.957,3283.392,What is the case you're citing.
2009.09-223,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3283.392,3288.194,--It's Sinochem v. Malaysian -- Malaysia International Shipping.
2009.09-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3291.629,3292.414,Do you have a volume anywhere?
2009.09-223,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3292.414,3294.864,--I don't have a volume number at the moment.
2009.09-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3294.864,3294.864,Okay.
2009.09-223,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3294.864,3312.39,"But the -- the holding was the forum non conveniens doctrine can be addressed before jurisdictional questions, and along the way the Court said that Younger -- specifically said that Younger can be answered before Article 3 standing."
2009.09-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3312.39,3313.109,"Okay, fine."
2009.09-223,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3318.812,3320.562,Well--
2009.09-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.562,3323.097,And -- and that is not a basis for dismissal here.
2009.09-223,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3331.067,3337.421,"--Well, in any event, Your Honor, we do submit that the Tax Injunction Act and the jurisdictional doctrine which would prevail."
2009.09-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.421,3338.087,That is so -- okay.
2009.09-223,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3338.087,3354.097,"And on Justice Stevens' question about the similarly situated or not similarly situated nature of public utilities and nonpublic utilities, Mr. Fitch has pointed to the continuing deregulation in the wake of General Motors Corporation v. Tracy."

2009.09-223,2,17897,benjamin_c_mizer,,3415.335,3418.287,"I disagree with that contention, Your Honor."
