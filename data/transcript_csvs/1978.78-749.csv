1978.78-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.957,We'll hear arguments next in Kentucky against Whorton.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,37.725,41.033,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.914,680.003,"Mr. Attorney General, then the instruction on innocence wouldn't have hurt the Government at all, would it?"
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,680.003,680.537,That's correct.
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,681.936,683.462,So why not give it?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,685.044,700.505,"Well in fact interesting enough Justice Marshall, the day after the oral argument was heard by the Kentucky Supreme Court in this case, that court amended Kentucky Rule Criminal Procedure 9.56 and now requires a presumption of innocence instruction."
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.801,707.567,Is this an order by an order?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,707.567,711.772,"This is by act of the court, Your Honor, Justice White."
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.119,717.852,Do you have a copy of the order --
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,717.852,723.664,Not the order but the amended rule is a part of the brief in our case and it is in one of the footnotes.
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,723.664,725.986,"I'm sorry, now what do we have before us?"
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,725.986,728.015,Well before this Court it's --
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,728.015,729.789,We can't.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,729.789,730.856,"Yes, Your Honor, before this Court is this --"
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,730.856,733.147,Can we reverse that order?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,733.147,734.055,Well that order --
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,734.055,735.662,Can we touch that order?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,735.662,738.359,Justice Marshall that order became effective --
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,738.359,738.908,Can we?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,738.908,740.484,"No, but that order doesn't affect this case."
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,740.484,744.889,"Well as of now, in Kentucky you have to give the instruction."
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,744.889,745.812,"Right, Your Honor."
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,746.06,747.491,So what is this here?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,747.491,755.719,Because that order does not affect this case nor does it affect the other 49 or 50 cases which were reversed before that order ever went into effect.
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.959,759.217,Do you have the copy of the Watson decision here?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,759.217,764.012,Your Honor it is made part of the reply brief filed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in its status.
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.012,766.041,In info is it?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,766.041,766.71,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,767.753,779.435,"In Watson your court said, in Whorton, we elected as a matter of state law not to engage in application of the harmless error doctrine."
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,785.136,785.932,"Yes, Your Honor I'm fully aware of what that opinion says."
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,785.932,788.032,"And that means what, and that means what?"
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,788.032,792.746,That brings us to the second aspect of this case.
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,838.612,842.293,But that rule is not before us.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,842.398,844.037,But the rule --
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.037,844.633,Can we?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,844.633,847.439,"No, Your Honor but the rule has no significance to this case."
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,850.296,852.037,But that is the rule in Kentucky.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,852.037,852.649,It's the rule now in --
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,852.649,854.176,Regardless of what we say.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,854.176,855.48,-- and it affects all -- that's true.
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,855.48,857.978,Regardless of what we say in this case.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,857.978,863.568,That's true but it affects this case and the other -- all the cases that were in the pipeline prior to the rule going into effect.
1978.78-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,865.549,867.395,And it will affect whether this particular --
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,867.395,867.619,It will.
1978.78-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,867.619,869.773,-- respondent remains in jail or gets out --
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,869.773,876.858,"Oh certainly, because it's like you need change in criminal rules in Kentucky or in any of the other states who are in federal government."
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,880.316,882.257,-- before us.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,882.257,882.734,That's true.
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,885.326,886.981,Well how can we rule on it?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,886.981,890.105,I'm not asking you to rule on that rule on the changing rule because this hasn't -- the rule hadn't went into effect.
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,890.105,891.933,Well you brought it up.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,894.554,897.893,I brought it up to advice the Court of what was happening in Kentucky.
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,923.998,925.159,Mr. Kimberlin may I ask?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,925.159,925.24,"Yes, Justice Brennan."
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.24,930.383,I'm looking at page 9 of your reply brief that's from the Watson opinion.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,931.114,936.254,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,936.977,941.032,The paragraph at the bottom of the page.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,947.011,948.655,You mean the last paragraph in the argument?
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,948.655,949.873,Yes.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,949.873,951.353,"Yes, Your Honor but that instance --"
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,951.353,952.315,It does?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,952.315,952.794,Yes but that's just --
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,952.794,954.95,Now tell me -- just a moment.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,954.95,955.031,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,955.031,956.398,Does apply to this case.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,969.07,971.264,I'm sorry I had the wrong page Your Honor.
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1007.528,1010.558,"No, but hasn't your -- taking your second proposition."
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1010.558,1011.202,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1011.202,1023.524,Doesn't this paragraph from Watson indicate that your Supreme Court as a matter of Kentucky law has said “We're not going to indulge in the application of the harmless error doctrine.”
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1023.524,1026.767,As to the application of the federal harmless error rule that's true.
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1027.006,1029.496,Are they federal -- I see.
1978.78-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1029.496,1036.978,But it has not said that it regards it as a per se violation of the federal constitution to fail to give the instruction.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1036.978,1038.45,"Oh yes, I believe it has."
1978.78-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.595,1046.646,But that's what you're appealing here.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1046.646,1054.828,"That's right that if this is a per se rule, if this is a per se rule the only hope we have is to apply the federal harmless error rule and quite candidly the Watson case --"
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1054.828,1068.939,Now this looks does it not as if your Supreme Court has said “If you get to the point where there's been a violation then it can't be saved by application of the harmless error rule.”
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1068.939,1069.084,That's --
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1069.084,1070.008,The conviction can't be saved --
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1070.008,1070.447,They had chosen --
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1070.447,1071.919,-- isn't what it says?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1071.919,1077.444,"They have chosen in that case, I agree Justice Brennan that they have chosen not to apply the federal harmless error rule."
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1083.773,1084.457,"Well, I understand this --"
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1084.457,1085.254,Now if it's across the board.
1978.78-749,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1085.254,1086.488,-- this is the first submission.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1086.488,1087.61,That's going back to that.
1978.78-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1096.331,1100.697,But the Kentucky court has simply announced a prospective ruling.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1100.697,1103.497,"That's correct, Your Honor it's like the rule, like it's the amendment of the criminal --"
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1103.497,1111.895,Well don't you -- is it your basic submission that Whorton is not -- that Taylor was not a per se rule.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1111.895,1112.92,"Exactly, exactly Justice White."
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.92,1122.005,"And, yes but don't you think -- aren't you really arguing that Taylor only applies where you couldn't define harmless error?"
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1122.005,1122.817,"Oh, no."
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.691,1137.446,But if there's no prejudice there's no error under your reading at Taylor.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1137.446,1140.541,In assumes you could say that.
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.787,1142.124,Well in the sense that's what you're saying.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1142.124,1145.853,"Yes, well because what do you have to do was saying on ad hoc basis --"
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.853,1147.762,"Well, what do you think Taylor means?"
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1147.762,1154.96,We think that it is not necessary to give the presumption of innocence instruction where there are no extraneous matters.
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.96,1155.876,And what does that mean?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1155.876,1158.548,That in effect I guess just saying exactly what you just said Justice White.
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1158.548,1163.112,"Exactly, and do you think that's any different from saying --"
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1163.112,1164.162,A per se rule?
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.162,1164.935,"No, no."
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1176.599,1181.879,Well what that is of course is assuming as a per se rule and then applying a harmless error.
1978.78-749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1181.879,1204.344,That wouldn't be the first instance in the law in which there was a semantic doubt for instance in our Bruton case where we held that an implicated defendant could admit -- could object to the admission of a co-defendant's confession against him.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1216.136,1217.219,"That's right, I understand that."
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.165,1239.637,Well why -- harmless error?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1239.637,1248.668,"-- and I believe -- if you have to do that for the ad hoc rule to establish the constitutional violation, I don't think the harmless error applies in an ad hoc rule case."
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1248.668,1254.924,"Once you decide that the Taylor rule applies, there couldn't possibly be harmless error."
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1254.924,1261.026,That's correct if it's on an ad hoc basis because you have to look at the facts first to determine the constitutional violation.
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1263.134,1270.194,"Well I know, but if there's some possibility of harm, there couldn't be harmless error."
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1270.194,1277.881,"Well, harmless error rules have only been applied where there -- to my knowledge where there is a per se constitutional rule."
1978.78-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.357,1293.459,"He can be questioned or you don't want to question him, or you can -- but unless you --"
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1293.459,1294.224,"And if you want to get the others in the trial, of course, of course Justice Stewart."
1978.78-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.224,1296.817,-- and unless you obey the Miranda rules you can have whatever he says at trial.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1296.817,1299.297,That's correct if you want to get that rule.
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.465,1360.674,"I suppose you said that if your Kentucky court had said “Well, as we understand Taylor it's not a per se rule, it's on an ad hoc basis."
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1365.031,1366.463,A constitutional error?
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.463,1368.959,-- any real need to give this instruction.
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1387.235,1388.007,"Well, I think --"
1978.78-749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.007,1389.606,"That would be a matter of state law then, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1389.606,1390.759,As a matter of state law.
1978.78-749,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1430.708,1433.786,"Well, do you want us to overrule Taylor, do you?"
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1433.786,1444.741,"Oh no, I don't want you -- I think Taylor is a superb case for its facts in any other cases that come within the degree or purview of those type of facts that establish a constitutional violation."
1978.78-749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1456.502,1457.664,When requested?
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1457.664,1459.486,When requested.
1978.78-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1463.971,1465.125,"Very well, Mr. Kimberlin."
1978.78-749,0,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,1465.125,1467.065,Thank you.
1978.78-749,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1467.065,1471.78,Mr. Fitzgerald.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1487.792,1498.836,"Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court, it is very difficult for me to tell this Court what it meant by its language."
1978.78-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1498.836,1501.326,"Well, I want to know what you know, what you think it meant."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1501.326,1503.625,I will be glad to tell you what I think it means.
1978.78-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.577,1587.221,You're talking about Whorton and not Watson?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1587.221,1588.081,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1588.081,1598.192,"Take a look at page 22 of the petition for writ of certiorari, the penultimate paragraph of the court's opinion in Whorton."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1612.415,1616.43,Now I think that's the second branch of our case here today.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.416,1668.457,"But in here Wharton it said in this paragraph I'm talking about, it says, “yet Taylor contains no hint that it might have been appropriate to consider whether the error was in fact prejudice --"
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1668.457,1678.237,"And then at the end it says “If we're wrong, we shall welcome further enlightenment from the only source that seems to be able to either construe or amend the Constitution.”"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1692.042,1701.632,"I think that I'm not here to defend the language of the Supreme Court of Kentucky, but I think the result was correct."
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.405,1739.014,"No, it is not."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1756.021,1756.188,It would appear so --
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1756.188,1757.071,Isn't it?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1757.071,1759.473,-- if the Whorton case were taken --
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1759.473,1760.117,On its own.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1760.117,1760.737,-- on its own.
1978.78-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.259,1775.877,"But your client is Whorton not Watson, right?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1775.877,1777.572,That is correct.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1791.181,1791.42,Not to.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1791.42,1796.541,-- not to do so that this Court should not involve itself in the state process.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.541,1797.989,"Well I don't think we can, can we?"
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1797.989,1798.029,We can't.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1798.029,1799.206,That's what I'm saying.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1799.206,1799.748,Exactly.
1978.78-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1799.748,1809.721,"Well then that would still leave the question of whether Taylor is a per se rule or not, would it not as a matter of federal constitutional law?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1809.721,1811.495,"Yes, I think so."
1978.78-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1832.975,1835.002,"Well did not, I repeat the question."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1852.116,1861.453,"My own reading of Taylor, again, I profess a little if any clairvoyance when it comes to the minds of the members of this Court is that --"
1978.78-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.453,1864.237,"Well, I'm not asking about the minds of the Court."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1864.237,1864.684,What I'm saying --
1978.78-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1864.684,1868.382,"I'm referring to you, when you read those words on the facts of this case?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1868.382,1869.043,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1916.288,1918.531,Well what is before us?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1927.309,1936.636,General Kimberlin has contended that because it does not apply to the cases pending at the time it was adopted that those cases are still before you.
1978.78-749,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1962.125,1965.966,"But, wouldn't that take this case from us?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1975.261,1976.511,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1977.951,1981.036,"The rule is perspective only, is it not?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,1981.036,1982.111,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1982.111,1983.679,How about retrials?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2001.927,2003.391,"Yes, it will."
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2003.391,2005.76,So it will be applicable to these cases if they're tried again.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2005.76,2007.239,"That is correct, absolutely."
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.565,2012.473,Including this one?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2012.473,2012.84,Including this one.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.84,2013.929,If it were retried.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2013.929,2021.045,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2067.248,2083.465,There's somewhere in these papers in one of the separate opinions in the Kentucky Supreme Court reference to a study that indicates that 37% of the population thinks that the rule of law is that a person is guilty until he proves himself innocent?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2085.531,2086.803,I don't recall that.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.553,2090.213,I can't find it.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2090.213,2092.574,-- but I don't recall where.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2108.482,2116.662,"It's in Justice Clayton's dissenting opinion on page 33 of the petition for certiorari, the footnote."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2136.338,2138.422,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2162.484,2173.507,What should we do with this case if we say the Kentucky court was wrong with respect to Taylor that it wasn't a per se rule?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2184.981,2194.069,I think you can dismiss for mootness in light of the language in Watson that they would not want to engage in that kind of mental gymnastics on the front end anymore than they would on the back end.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.069,2194.452,"Well, I know we can --"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2194.452,2195.773,It's the same process.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.773,2202.514,"Yes but they could -- they can say that again, but we're talking about this case not Watson."
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2220.839,2221.69,You mean Taylor.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.69,2222.479,I mean Taylor.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2228.842,2236.602,If this Court feels that Taylor is strictly an exceptional circumstances cases that certainly is a remedy available to the --
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.602,2245.67,"Well, it's available but is that what we -- let's just assume that that's what we would hold with respect to Taylor."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2249.995,2272.67,I think that the circumstance of the Kentucky court's explanation of its unwillingness to get into a case by case approach and the adoption of the rule would still justify this Court in upholding the decision in Whorton as -- and mooting this case.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.982,2332.27,"So I take it what you then would are quite sure in your own mind, at least you would argue that even if no matter what we said about Taylor, if we said this is not a per se case, the Kentucky court would still leave its mandatory instruction rule in?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2332.27,2338.316,I believe that unless this Court over rules Taylor that the Kentucky court will continue to prefer the prophylaxis to case by case matters.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.316,2341.195,Would rather have a -- would rather have a black or white situation --
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2341.195,2341.688,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.688,2345.05,-- than a case by case argument about it.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2345.05,2346.302,"Yes, I'm confident about it."
1978.78-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2346.302,2357.918,"Of course if we reverse this case saying that Taylor had not met what the Supreme Court of -- what the Kentucky Court of Appeals said it meant, the Kentucky Court of Appeals is perfectly free to say that on remand."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2357.918,2359.238,Surely.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2360.05,2366.736,"And could say as a matter of state law, we just don't want this uncertainty we're going to leave our rule in."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2366.736,2370.315,"That's true, it could do that."
1978.78-749,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2370.315,2374.236,"Mr. Fitzgerald, are the judges of the Kentucky Supreme Court elected?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2374.236,2375.12,"Yes, they are."
1978.78-749,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2375.12,2377.427,When was the last election?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2377.427,2380.688,I believe the elections are staggered.
1978.78-749,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2380.688,2383.106,Was there one in the fall of '78?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2383.106,2383.678,No.
1978.78-749,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2383.678,2385.618,There wasn't?
1978.78-749,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.618,2398.783,"Mr. Fitzgerald, the issue in Taylor really was whether or not there been a fair trial and the court emphasized a number of factors relevant to that issue."
1978.78-749,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2468.623,2470.174,When requested.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2470.174,2470.748,I take --
1978.78-749,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.748,2470.861,When requested.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2470.861,2482.859,-- Taylor to mean and perhaps wrongly from what you're saying that the trial judge has a duty to ensure that the substance of the presumption is conveyed to the jury in some manner.
1978.78-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2505.399,2523.097,"Didn't that language that Justice -- Mr. Justice Powell just repeated to you indicate that there might be a different result when you have 15 eyewitnesses and no contrary, no contradiction on those eyewitnesses that was enough to shake the jury?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2523.097,2523.186,Yes that --
1978.78-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2523.186,2525.022,Here you had only one alibi witness.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2525.022,2525.062,I think --
1978.78-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2525.062,2529.514,"His wife said he was home, 15 other people said he was in the store with a gun."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2529.514,2532.107,I think it at least leaves open that possibility.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2624.11,2631.773,"The instructions actually given are -- appear on beginning on page 18 of the appendix, those were actually given?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2631.773,2633.197,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2633.197,2642.168,And where are the instructions on presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt that were actually given?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2642.168,2645.095,The instructions tendered by the defense and not given --
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2645.095,2646.845,"No, no I'm talking about the ones actually given in this case."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2646.845,2647.855,Oh!
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2649.756,2650.806,On page 18.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2650.806,2654.099,And they go on counting the form verdicts all the way over to page 40.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2654.099,2655.73,"Or, 31 anyway."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2655.73,2658.902,22 pages that the jury had to sift through.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2658.902,2659.81,Well 31 are the actual instructions.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2659.81,2661.608,All right.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2661.608,2672.342,"18 to 31, and where if you know and don't waste your time if you don't, in here are the instructions actually given as to presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt."
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2672.342,2673.606,None.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2673.606,2674.067,Zero?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2674.067,2678.343,"Except the instruction, the standard Kentucky instruction that was given in Taylor which is --"
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2678.343,2682.596,"Well, you say none except, so what? That means there were some and where are they?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2682.596,2690.012,Alright.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2691.238,2693.441,Page 30?
1978.78-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2693.441,2696.367,At the beginning in page 15 of the petitioner's.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2696.367,2700.176,"Yes, in the middle of page 30 instruction number XVIII."
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2723.44,2729.02,And there's nothing except beyond that at least as to presumption of innocence?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2729.02,2729.983,Nothing whatsoever.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2729.983,2731.033,Nothing.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.033,2732.434,"Well, it's like Taylor then?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2732.434,2734.184,Exactly in that respect.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2734.184,2734.55,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2734.55,2736.744,Except that instead of a close -- Excuse me.
1978.78-749,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2736.744,2738.676,"How about during the voir dire, it wasn't Taylor?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2741.42,2742.676,You mean by the court?
1978.78-749,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2742.676,2744.457,Either court or counsel.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2744.457,2746.796,I do not recall whether there was any by counsel.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2749.373,2752.044,How about in closing argument?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2757.594,2760.059,I do not recall.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.059,2763.781,Do you argue before the judge's instructions in Kentucky?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2763.781,2771.077,"Yes -- no, excuse me, the judge reads the instructions to the jury, the attorneys then have to go from the instructions."
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2773.932,2779.968,Are you free -- would you be free to argue a presumption of innocence if the judge hadn't instructed on it?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2779.968,2781.224,"Presumably so, yes."
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2781.224,2781.615,Well why?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2784.413,2789.317,Well what I'm saying is that's not contrary to the instructions but neither does it carry the weight of the court behind it.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2789.317,2790.049,Right.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2790.049,2793.946,"If I were to argue there's a presumption of innocence, and I sit down --"
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.946,2795.251,So did you try this case or did somebody else?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2795.251,2797.445,"No, someone else from our office tried it."
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.445,2798.502,You don't know whether he did?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2798.502,2800.983,I believe he did discuss it in the closing argument.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2800.983,2802.018,The presumption of innocence?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2802.018,2802.298,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.048,2811.852,"Well, unless --"
1978.78-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2811.852,2812.679,"Under Taylor, isn't it?"
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.679,2820.745,-- unless Taylor is a totality case.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2820.745,2823.6,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.6,2828.346,And if you -- but you say that it's the judge that must get it across to the jury.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2828.346,2841.051,"Yes, and not only that, the written instructions are carried in to the jury room so that long after the arguments of counsel have seized to ring in the jurors ears, all that remains is the truncated reasonable doubt instruction."
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2841.051,2842.913,You hope they ring there at all.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2842.913,2851.537,"If they do, and 12 or 13 pages of instructions to sift through without one mention of the presumption of innocence."
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2860.308,2862.836,"That's about all he had going for him, wasn't it?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2862.836,2864.634,That's about all he had going for him exactly.
1978.78-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2907.238,2911.651,"Well the jurors also given 15 witnesses incriminating him, weren't they?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2911.651,2912.407,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2919.595,2921.186,Were the sentences concurrent or?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2921.186,2922.053,"No, they were all consecutive."
1978.78-749,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.053,2922.595,Consecutive.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2922.595,2924.32,Totaling 230 years.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2924.32,2932.723,And you say in Kentucky the judge's instructions go in written form to the jury when it begins to deliberate?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2932.723,2933.9,That's correct.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2940.684,2941.344,In writing?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2941.344,2941.401,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2941.401,2945.885,What did it say about reasonable doubt again?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2945.885,2948.534,"The same as was in Taylor, it's --"
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2948.534,2949.545,Instruction number 18.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2949.545,2953.742,-- instruction number XVIII on page 30.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2953.742,2953.941,If upon --
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2953.941,2959.269,"“If upon the whole case, you have a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt, you shall find him not guilty.”"
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2981.824,2988.976,Isn't there something else in these instructions about whose burden it is to present evidence -- to make the -- to present the proof?
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2988.976,2989.526,I don't think so.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2989.526,2991.315,No.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2991.547,2995.014,Except that each one of the instruction says they must find beyond a reasonable doubt.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,2995.014,2996.247,Yes.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3007.053,3009.692,15 pages of skeletal instruction?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,3009.692,3012.937,15 pages of instructions on the substantive offense.
1978.78-749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.693,3022.593,Right.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,3022.593,3029.701,That's the skeletal part.
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3077.977,3087.542,"When the jury comes in, in a Kentucky criminal trial does the judge give him a little talk first before the trial starts or not?"
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,3087.542,3094.49,"At the present time, I don't think this was true at the time Whorton was tried in Jefferson County, Kentucky."
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.332,3108.703,And so the judge never said a word to him except “Good morning ladies and gentlemen”?
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,3108.703,3111.765,"As a matter of fact, practice was very sporadic."
1978.78-749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.521,3138.146,But every single instruction had the reasonable doubt reference in it.
1978.78-749,1,42673,terrence_r_fitzgerald,,3138.146,3142.41,Has the reference yes.
1978.78-749,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3142.41,3144.033,"Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald."
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3148.238,3149.057,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1978.78-749,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3149.057,3150.416,Do you have anything further?
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3150.416,3151.545,Could I just have one comment?
1978.78-749,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3151.545,3153.922,"Oh yes, you have two minutes left."
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3153.922,3166.492,"I believe the reason the rule was amended and the reason the Whorton opinion was written the way it was, was because of the way that Kentucky Supreme Court had it fixed in their minds as to what the Taylor case meant."
1978.78-749,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3181.232,3183.061,That doesn't really follow does it?
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3192.396,3199.17,"I think looking at it practically, what happened was a knee-jerk reaction on the part of the court back in Kentucky, Your Honor."
1978.78-749,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3202.502,3214.508,"Now, it seems to me the Kentucky Supreme Court indicated the very definite interest in running its own affairs to the extent it could, and there would be very likely to have played down a per se rule that it thought was wise whether it thought it was compelled to or not."
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3214.508,3218.309,Well I don't come to that conclusion from reading the language in the Whorton opinion.
1978.78-749,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3257.43,3266.714,"And by the time the case -- by the time the case comes to the Supreme Court, your first terminology was correct is, he stands convicted when he comes with a conviction."
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3266.714,3272.264,"Well all these cases come before the Court, Your Honor, now where their conviction is reversed."
1978.78-749,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.956,3298.363,"Your prediction is that a plea reversed and said Taylor is a totality case depending on the circumstances and their ultimate issue being whether there's a fair trial in the particular case, as my brother Powell says?"
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3303.595,3306.322,I don't know that they would revoke this rule which is a prospective effect.
1978.78-749,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3345.715,3352.513,"But Mr. Attorney General, can we decide what they said as well as you can?"
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3355.499,3357.869,"Yes, I can only give my ideas of what they said, Your Honor."
1978.78-749,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3357.869,3359.237,Oh!
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3360.701,3361.409,That's all I have.
1978.78-749,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3362.325,3363.193,Thank you gentlemen.
1978.78-749,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3363.193,3364.282,Can I ask you one more question?
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3364.282,3365.53,"Certainly, Justice White."
1978.78-749,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.53,3371.884,"Do you have a list of the -- I take it you have list of the cases that might be affected, the past convictions?"
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3371.884,3373.014,"Yes, we'll get it, yes."
1978.78-749,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3373.014,3379.16,"I don't want the list, but what's the oldest one?"
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3379.16,3380.957,The oldest one?
1978.78-749,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3401.335,3402.726,You're talking about cases on direct appeal?
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3402.726,3418.981,"I'm talking about cases, yes, they are going to retry to delay the cases in the sense that we ask all the procedural things like petitions for rehearing and this and that, because what has happened is we've been getting blocked up with all these cases trying to keep them alive until they get to this Court and hoping for a decision from this Court."
1978.78-749,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3420.835,3426.029,Why are there a lot of other cases that might come up on collateral attack?
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3426.029,3431.721,"We don't know, because we don't know the detail of when these have come up or not because it would depend upon whether the instruction was requested or not."
1978.78-749,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3431.721,3435.371,You're only talking now about “X” number that are on direct appeal?
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3435.371,3440.577,"Right, and from time to time the most recent case was about two weeks ago that came to our attention."
1978.78-749,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3449.862,3455.967,But there may be a lot of cases that will be subject to state and then federal collateral attack.
1978.78-749,2,38041,patrick_b_kimberlin_iii,,3455.967,3461.762,"It certainly could be, it certainly could be, although we don't know the -- any exact number of course."
1978.78-749,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3462.477,3463.185,Thank you gentlemen.
