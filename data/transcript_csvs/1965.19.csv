1965.19,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,21.225,25.226,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.19,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,554.521,557.455,[Inaudible]
1965.19,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,557.455,562.93,"It has -- , well this union, the Steelworkers sets up a local whenever it organizes a plant."
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,1596.769,1601.134,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1970.521,1971.636,[Inaudible]
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,1971.636,1977.289,"Yes, sir and I would like under my fifth point to come to that if I may."
1965.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.348,2080.578,[Inaudible]
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2080.578,2081.261,Sir?
1965.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.261,2085.652,[Inaudible]
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2085.652,2094.882,"As I understand the rule Your Honor, Bouligny being a North Carolina corporation could have named the local agent and some other local members."
1965.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.882,2096.69,[Inaudible]
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2096.69,2098.204,"No, we wish to stay in state court."
1965.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.204,2099.545,[Inaudible]
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2099.545,2106.568,"Yes we brought the suit in the state court, it was the union that wished to go to the federal court."
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2106.568,2109.133,"Naming the defendant as a union, is it?"
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2109.133,2110.154,"Yes, sir."
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2110.154,2112.428,As you may under North Carolina practice I gather?
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2112.428,2117.232,Under North Carolina practice there are two sections of our law.
1965.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.71,2143.603,We just may -- we might have trouble questioning your judgment?
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2143.603,2146.415,Yes.
1965.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.403,2274.764,You mean one labor union might be different than another?
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2274.764,2277.523,One labor union might be different from another.
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2277.523,2286.791,"Or even the same one, I gather, your position might be -- in different cases it might require factual inquiries in each instance, even against the Steelworkers?"
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2286.791,2287.447,Yes sir.
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2287.447,2287.954,Is that it?
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2287.954,2288.873,Yes sir.
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2690.269,2697.393,"Well that means that if that had been in effect when you brought your action against the Steelworkers, it wouldn't be removable, isn't that right?"
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2697.393,2700.956,It would be removable if this was the end of the recommendations.
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2700.956,2701.387,Oh I see.
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2701.387,2714.214,"But there is a Section 1302 that says provided however and it's that section that I would like to come to, but before I do it, I would like to make a couple of comments about this section."
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2740.013,2742.821,And under the law of North Carolina –-
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2742.821,2743.122,A Union --
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2743.122,2744.256,Steelworker could –-
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2744.256,2744.59,Yes.
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2744.59,2745.523,[Inaudible] suit.
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2745.523,2747.232,"Yes, that's correct."
1965.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2841.656,2843.314,Well what would that do to you?
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2843.314,2846.403,That would have no application to this case.
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2879.129,2885.125,Well your thought would be that if Steelworkers has local unions in the state that takes them out of Landrum-Griffin?
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2885.125,2886.476,Yes sir.
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2886.476,2891.134,"That would depend I suppose whether a local union is a local establishment, would it?"
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2891.134,2895.182,Well the definition of a local establishment is defined as follows.
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2937.774,2944.368,"But you read that definition of local establishment, that doesn't seem to me that was federal labors --"
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2944.368,2946.407,Well it may not if Your Honor please.
1965.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.336,2990.562,"Now whether it's a matter of structuring diversity jurisdiction the union would or wouldn't be within that exception nevertheless the ALI recommendation is that the union be treated as an entity and as a citizen and it's just that some citizen may have some activities in the state which may borrow from the Federal Court, but on the issue we're talking about the ALI seems to have gone along the Russell way."
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,2990.562,2996.482,"No sir, the Russell way is to look at particular facts of the entity, all the facts."
1965.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3003.874,3007.99,Now you are just saying -- all your are saying is they get at it in a different way.
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,3007.99,3010.865,"Well, they go at it in a different way, but I am suggesting to you --"
1965.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.865,3020.198,They arrive at the result of the union being as a -- qualified to be in court as an entity.
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,3020.198,3026.331,I suggest to you though it's vastly superior way to that of having to make an inquiry into each particular case.
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3026.331,3038.102,"And I suppose it's true is it, still that in many, many states, perhaps in most unions are not suiable?"
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,3038.102,3049.058,"One of the things we say about this particular unit – union that claims to have all the authority is in its own state of Pennsylvania, it may sue only in the name of trustees."
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3049.058,3049.363,Yeah.
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,3049.363,3051.34,Which we say is a fairly serious limitation.
1965.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3051.34,3060.925,"Well it's a long time since I've to think about this, but it used to be I know that you couldn't sue in most states."
1965.19,1,30457,joseph_w_grier_jr,,3060.925,3091.708,"I going to make this point about the local statute rule, it applies to corporations as well as to unincorporated association and represents an effort on the part of ALI people to contract Federal Jurisdiction and perhaps the basic issue here is the question of how far should Federal Jurisdiction go that may cut across what the union regards as the trend to treat any of these in a different way from what they were formally treated."
1965.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3190.847,3192.743,Mr. Gottesman.
1965.19,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3192.743,3194.02,May it please the Court.
1965.19,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3225.557,3226.74,[Inaudible]
1965.19,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3226.74,3231.591,And it marches on because the union has become an entity and recognized as such.
1965.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3351.563,3352.759,Why is that followed?
1965.19,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3352.759,3354.16,It doesn't necessarily follow.
1965.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3362.785,3365.145,It doesn't define the word suit?
1965.19,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3365.145,3373.071,"Well, that's right it may not be constitutional to make a labor union a citizen, but if it is constitutional we say Congress has already done it."
1965.19,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3381.154,3382.1,Thank you.
