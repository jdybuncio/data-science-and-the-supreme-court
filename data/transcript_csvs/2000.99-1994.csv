2000.99-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.016,"We'll argument now Number 99-1994, Nevada v. Floyd Hicks."
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,16.968,21.426,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1994,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,35.172,38.599,"You mean, ever, for anything, no matter what?"
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,38.599,45.203,"Yes, Your Honor, as long as they were acting in a representative capacity for the state."
2000.99-1994,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,45.203,67.949,"This comes to us in the context of a state official who went to the tribal court to get authority to carry out a search warrant, and was given a warrant with certain terms and conditions to go on the reservation and carry it out."
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,84.09,86.031,"Your Honor, I--"
2000.99-1994,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,86.031,87.805,That's your position?
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,87.805,89.663,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is--"
2000.99-1994,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,89.663,92.346,Suppose he just goes and buys some gasoline and doesn't pay for it.
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,100.519,107.372,"--The answer is no, Your Honor, not in tribal court, but in state or federal court, and there is a remedy there."
2000.99-1994,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.858,114.431,"Okay, what is your authority for this broad initial proposition you're making?"
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,114.431,116.455,--The authority is--
2000.99-1994,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.455,117.282,What case?
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,117.282,125.621,"--Oliphant, which describes a divestiture of tribal jurisdiction which is inconsistent with the tribe's status."
2000.99-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,125.621,128.056,"But that's criminal jurisdiction, is it not?"
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,128.056,128.965,"Yes, Your Honor, it was."
2000.99-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,128.965,131.483,How about civil jurisdiction?
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,131.483,144.569,"In the case of civil jurisdiction, the case of National Farmers Union also requires an examination of the tribe's sovereignty, and to the extent it's been divested."
2000.99-1994,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,144.569,157.572,"I read another brief... a 1934 opinion of the Solicitor General who said that the tribes under Acts passed by Congress had the basic sovereignty that they had for generations, unless it was taken away."
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,169.915,182.192,"Well, Your Honor, first of all I'm not prepared to concede that much regarding even a nonmember in a private capacity, but with regard to state officials, there are special considerations."
2000.99-1994,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,211.237,225.726,"Mr. Howle, I could understand a position that says when a state official is acting pursuant to state authority... there's a warrant, a state warrant... that that person can't be questioned in tribal court."
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,249.298,250.701,"We would, Your Honor."
2000.99-1994,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,252.475,274.106,You're not even making a distinction that's often made in these public employment cases between acting within the scope of one's authority and going so far beyond the pale of anything that would fit within that authority as to be on a frolic of one's own.
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,275.221,289.339,"We're suggesting a higher standard, and that being acting in a representative capacity, and that's a standard that we see employed, albeit in an ambiguous fashion--"
2000.99-1994,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.339,290.248,--What does that mean?
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,304.449,307.792,"--That's a difficult case, Your Honor."
2000.99-1994,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.164,309.816,"Gee, I don't think it's difficult at all."
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,309.816,311.507,"--That isn't this case, though."
2000.99-1994,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,343.353,352.086,May I be sure I understand your position... are you saying that your immunity rule would only apply when the state official is acting within the scope of his authority?
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,354.11,357.287,"I phrase it differently, Your Honor."
2000.99-1994,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,361.829,368.971,"Well, supposing he goes beyond his representative capacity and does what Justice Scalia describes."
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,370.169,383.626,"Well, I think that... I think in that case the analysis then falls back to a different test, and that being the ordinary test for a private citizen."
2000.99-1994,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,383.626,388.456,But that isn't this frolic of his own or something like that?
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,388.456,396.175,"Surely he'd be treated differently if he were an officer, but unrelated to any of the state business."
2000.99-1994,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.175,413.431,"But why don't you go the whole hog and say that it's your position that it ought to be a question for the state court and not for the tribal court whether, in fact, he was just going in to beat up a tribal member he didn't like, or he was going on state business."
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,422.059,423.273,"No, it isn't, Your Honor."
2000.99-1994,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,423.273,424.371,Is that the position you're taking?
2000.99-1994,0,19108,c_wayne_howle,,424.371,424.743,"I'll take that position, Your Honor."
2000.99-1994,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,424.743,426.229,Why not take it?
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1608.22,1618.828,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1634.126,1640.088,"Well, the petitioner says they didn't even need to get tribal court permission to get a search warrant."
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1640.088,1642.872,"We disagree, and the authority of this Court will indicate the contrary."
2000.99-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1642.872,1644.275,And what do you rely on?
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1644.275,1660.976,"Williams v. Lee, and its progeny, Your Honor, which establishes clearly that the sovereignty of tribes precludes the authority of the state to the extent it interferes with the ability of the tribe to make its own laws and be governed by them."
2000.99-1994,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1660.976,1669.15,But it's not governed by its own criminal laws insofar as a crime that occurs off the reservation is concerned.
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1671.667,1682.441,"Your Honor, the tribal court... if this were a crime under tribal law, and it is not a crime under tribal law as far as I know."
2000.99-1994,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1682.441,1690.698,The tribe can make off-reservation crimes a crime under tribal law triable in the tribal court?
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1690.698,1692.722,"It could as to members, perhaps."
2000.99-1994,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.722,1694.579,"Oh, crimes by members."
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1694.579,1695.239,By members.
2000.99-1994,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.239,1696.437,Not crimes against members.
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1696.437,1697.385,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1994,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.385,1707.211,And what if they did make it triable in tribal court... would the state still be able to prosecute it as a violation of state law?
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1707.211,1710.555,"The state could, in any instance, prosecute this case."
2000.99-1994,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.353,1723.353,"Well, the state's ability to prosecute is not worth a whole lot if it leaves the by your leave of somebody else to go and grab the person who allegedly did the offense."
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1723.353,1723.519,That may be.
2000.99-1994,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.519,1731.898,"That's what you're saying... that the state is entirely at the mercy of the tribal court to get a search warrant, and I presume an arrest warrant as well."
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1731.898,1734.127,"Yes, Your Honor, that is what I'm saying."
2000.99-1994,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.127,1737.554,"That's quite an incursion on the state's criminal jurisdiction, it seems to me."
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1737.554,1740.692,The state judge who issued the state warrant agreed with that position.
2000.99-1994,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.553,1747.668,He might have been wrong.
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1748.411,1755.553,"--Well, he could be wrong, but we... he got it right as far as our position goes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1994,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1769.959,1770.991,Where is that?
2000.99-1994,1,40921,s_james_anaya,,1770.991,1775.532,"Your Honor, that's not in our brief."
2000.99-1994,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.532,1780.279,"I didn't think it was, and I would have sat up, and my eyes would have popped open."
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2849.922,2855.479,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1994,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2863.009,2864.867,"Well, how about a 1983 action?"
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2864.867,2872.463,"Well, we would say that the federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over that sort of action, as in El Paso Natural Gas."
2000.99-1994,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2878.242,2880.554,"I agree, but does it exist?"
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2880.554,2885.755,"To the extent it existed in El Paso, Your Honor, it exists here as well."
2000.99-1994,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2899.13,2907.386,But the Wheeler Act... is that the Act... the Nuclear Power Act... had a specific provision for exclusive jurisdiction.
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2909.781,2911.473,"Exclusive jurisdiction, Your Honor--"
2000.99-1994,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2911.473,2913.702,The El Paso case was not a removal case.
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2913.702,2916.302,"--Yes, it was, with respect, Your Honor."
2000.99-1994,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2920.555,2929.472,Excuse me... there was an underlying congressional act which gave exclusive jurisdiction.
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2929.472,2942.641,"--Only if the defendant raised it, Your Honor, the case would be free to proceed in state court for a nuclear tort, or in tribal court, unless the defendant sought a federal forum."
2000.99-1994,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2958.245,2965.221,Really making up a statute that Congress didn't pass because that's what happens... a federal officer is sued in state court.
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2972.734,2974.303,"--Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1994,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2986.564,2992.342,"But they don't have to have any intent to leave it in trial court, you need an intent to get it removed from tribal court."
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2998.907,3013.767,"--Well, the reason to remove it is because the plaintiff has asserted a federal cause of action, and we would think that Congress would want a defendant sued in tribal court to have the same right as the defendants sued in state court to get a federal forum."
2000.99-1994,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3026.854,3030.94,"No, I don't mean to cut you off... I thought maybe you would address this."
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3086.297,3089.269,"--We don't think that would be the necessary result, Your Honor."
2000.99-1994,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3096.328,3098.557,"Okay, but I mean this is getting Rube Goldberg."
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3116.761,3125.677,"Well, there is a common law nature to much of this Court's jurisprudence with respect to Indian law, certainly the cases--"
2000.99-1994,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3125.677,3143.51,"But what is the justification, then, for saying to the tribes that they could not proceed in their related tort actions in the tribal courts merely because we think the 1983 action should be enjoined for purposes of quasi-removal."
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3150.569,3154.284,"--Well, they certainly can choose to proceed in their own courts."
2000.99-1994,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3157.339,3168.773,"No, but what I'm getting at is your notion that all... that these tribal tort law claims would be deemed pendent to the 1983 actions and enjoined with them."
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3176.37,3181.366,"--Well, that's typically the treatment of state law claims when we remove to federal court."
2000.99-1994,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3181.366,3183.512,But we've got a statute on it.
2000.99-1994,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3184.626,3186.195,How does it work?
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3215.751,3220.442,There would be federal immunity defenses.
2000.99-1994,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3220.442,3221.489,But where do they come from?
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3221.489,3228.176,They come from the federal government's unique interest in law enforcement on reservations.
2000.99-1994,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3228.176,3236.516,"So if they're going to have... and are we now going to have a new sort of federal government thing we're making up, which... well, then why not have it all in the federal court?"
2000.99-1994,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.578,3250.651,Why does the federal government have a unique interest in law enforcement?
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3257.504,3260.848,"Not with respect to Indian reservations, Your Honor."
2000.99-1994,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3267.124,3270.856,Not with respect to state crimes that occur off the reservation.
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3291.644,3294.079,--Not in the circumstances of this case.
2000.99-1994,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3326.773,3330.116,"In that situation, I'm just thinking, aren't you really on the other side?"
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3350.056,3352.285,"As a practical matter, that may well be correct."
2000.99-1994,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3352.285,3370.035,"Then you have to think that the Ninth Circuit got it all wrong here, because as I take it, you're saying we let the tribal members sue in tribal court, but the defendant state officer the next day can remove it and there's nothing that the tribe or the tribal member can do about it."
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3384.607,3396.207,"Yes, although the tribal plaintiff would have the opportunity to amend his complaint to assert only tribal causes of action, in which case the case would remain at least initially in tribal court."
2000.99-1994,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3396.207,3399.551,What about the officer's position?
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3413.957,3416.269,I would disagree with that.
2000.99-1994,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3426.466,3439.675,"So that this case could remain in tribal court if they just alleged tribal torts, the officer says I have qualified immunity, I don't want that resolved in tribal court, but it belongs in tribal court, in your view of this?"
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3439.675,3455.528,"In our view, in the ordinary course the state officer defendant should raise the defense first in tribal court and then would have review of the defense under the National Farmers Union approach in federal court after exhaustion."
2000.99-1994,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3455.528,3456.188,How far?
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3467.855,3468.902,May I answer?
2000.99-1994,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3468.902,3469.851,"Yes, shortly."
2000.99-1994,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3469.851,3479.305,"If there's not an opportunity before trial for the defense to reach federal court, we would say exhaustion shouldn't be required."
2000.99-1994,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3479.305,3480.253,"Thank you, Ms. McDowell."
2000.99-1994,3,19108,c_wayne_howle,,3483.225,3485.166,"Thank you, You Honor."
