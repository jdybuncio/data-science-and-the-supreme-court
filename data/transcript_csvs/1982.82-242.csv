1982.82-242,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.681,We will hear arguments first this morning in the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency against the Sierra Club.
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,14.838,17.821,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1982.82-242,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,149.344,160.355,"Was it your burden here today, Ms. Oberly, to persuade the court that this was an abuse of discretion on the part of the--"
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,160.355,166.697,"We're happy to take that burden on, Your Honor, because we believe it was an abuse of discretion."
1982.82-242,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,194.933,203.746,--What do you think Congress meant by the language when appropriate that fees should be awarded... when appropriate?
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,203.746,206.915,We think the legislative history shows that Congress meant two things.
1982.82-242,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,362.21,372.395,"Ms. Oberly, are you satisfied with a standard that says if the suit furthered the goals of the statute, it is appropriate?"
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,372.395,372.754,"Yes, Your Honor, we are."
1982.82-242,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,377.438,378.595,If you don't prevail?
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,378.595,387.591,--when a party wins nothing on the merits and in no way alters or improves or changes EPA's administration of the statute.
1982.82-242,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.707,422.06,"Well do you think, did I understand you to say that you think the court below applied the correct... that the court below set forth the correct standard, but simply applied it improperly?"
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,422.06,429.745,"--We think the Court of Appeals standard is perfectly plausible, given the guidance that Congress provided in the legislative history."
1982.82-242,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,451.158,457.015,"Can a party who loses the case ever further the goals of the statute, in your view?"
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,457.015,493.155,"--No, Your Honor, not if they not only lose on the merits in the technical sense of failing to obtain a judgment, but also lose in the broader sense of failing to alter EPA's conduct or alter the regulations or the statute, I might add, applies not only to the government as defendant, but to private corporations as defendant and if they are unable, through their lawsuit, as a catalyst, to get a private defendant to change his behavior or its behavior, a corporation's behavior, even short of a judgment, then we would say that fees could not be appropriate."
1982.82-242,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.155,508.323,"The respondents cited, I think, something like 20 other statutes, federal statutes, for attorney's fees that do not require that the party have prevailed."
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,519.427,525.537,"The statutes that respondents cited, and I believe there are about 14 of them, are all where appropriate statutes."
1982.82-242,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,586.292,588.058,Could it be said that they speeded up--
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,588.058,589.509,--Pardon.
1982.82-242,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,589.509,593.462,--Could it be said that this action speeded up?
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,593.462,595.334,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1982.82-242,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,611.72,614.203,It took them more than ten years to get around to it?
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,614.203,615.935,"--No, it did not take then ten years, Your Honor."
1982.82-242,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,615.935,617.499,"Well, you said '70."
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,619.324,627.634,"I said in the mid, excuse me, early to mid-70's was when they first approached EPA but without a formal request."
1982.82-242,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,667.241,671.57,"Had it not been for this statute, would you be here?"
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,671.57,674.989,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
1982.82-242,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,674.989,679.738,"Well, you seem to say the statute forced EPA to do this."
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,679.738,681.688,The statute directed EPA--
1982.82-242,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,681.688,688.86,"So my question is if the statute had not been passed, would you have said that the lawsuit did it?"
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,688.86,699.7,"--No, Your Honor, because if the statute had not been passed, it probably would have been fully within EPA's discretion to decline to initiate a rulemaking proceeding."
1982.82-242,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,708.241,712.382,Well didn't the action remind EPA that they should do it?
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,712.382,717.786,"It wasn't clear until the statute was passed, Your Honor, that EPA should do it."
1982.82-242,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,740.992,747.992,"Of course, one could be facetious and say that they ought to be paid just to plow through the voluminous opinions of the law."
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,749.146,768.297,"Maybe the Court of Appeals judges ought to get higher salaries to plow through the opinion, but respondents took this task upon themselves voluntarily and it would seem to me that the government has as good a claim to having contributed to the public interest and to the purposes of the statute as do respondents."
1982.82-242,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.297,771.513,"Ms. Oberly, may I ask you a sort of a hypothetical question?"
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,798.284,800.191,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1982.82-242,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,811.449,815.98,"Well, if Congress passed a statute saying we can give fees where appropriate, that would be different."
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,817.369,821.229,"You would have to look to the guidance of your statute, if you had one."
1982.82-242,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.254,1102.988,"Ms. Oberly, isn't it a little bit of an overstatement to say winning party never pays the losing party's fees?"
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1104.548,1107.596,Under the Criminal Justice Act.
1982.82-242,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1185.407,1187.61,"But that wasn't an abuse of discretion case, was it?"
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1187.61,1190.858,--It was a statutory construction case and basically--
1982.82-242,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1190.858,1194.388,And it wasn't... and this you admit is an abuse of discretion case?
1982.82-242,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1195.464,1201.29,"--And it's a statutory construction case, Your Honor, in terms of interpreting what appropriate means."
1982.82-242,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.823,1396.995,Mr. Tyler.
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,1396.995,1399.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-242,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1603.465,1606.484,"Well, Mr. Tyler, that would be something of a new departure."
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,1609.794,1631.409,"I think, Justice Rehnquist, that of course Congress didn't have, the legislative history doesn't have somebody saying look, this year, 1977, we want the phrase when appropriate, which we're going to continue for 307 cases, to mean that even losers get fees."
1982.82-242,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.605,1652.635,They won on some issues?
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,1652.635,1653.337,--Yes.
1982.82-242,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1711.346,1716.282,"Well that's a perfectly understandable motive if Congress, indeed, did entertain it."
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,1723.045,1735.585,"Well, there is language in the legislative history, concededly, if I were standing here today and had a chance to rewrite what was said, I'd have it a lot clearer, I agree."
1982.82-242,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.796,1998.385,"Mr. Tyler, is there any reason to think that the same result wouldn't have been reached simply if the government had defended its own position without the help of the environmental groups."
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,1998.385,2010.286,"Your Honor, as an ex-bureaucrat I'd like to admit that there is some grounds for thinking that the government possibly reaches the same result without citizen intervention."
1982.82-242,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.286,2010.754,Occasionally.
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2010.754,2015.971,"The point is that Congress has said, though, there should be citizen intervention."
1982.82-242,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.799,2053.488,"The only thing is, they took their chances and lost."
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2053.488,2054.471,Ah.
1982.82-242,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.345,2061.279,I understand that.
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2061.279,2066.918,This is not a statute designed to restore and look back and say we only reward winners.
1982.82-242,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.161,2126.787,"I agree, you do have to."
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2130.878,2137.0,"Well, different in the sense that it isn't the frequent thing."
1982.82-242,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.196,2158.978,I used to collect fees like that.
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2158.978,2160.179,You don't win anything.
1982.82-242,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.927,2173.815,But that's the... where you have a fund out of which the fees are paid.
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2173.815,2174.236,Ah.
1982.82-242,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.497,2182.418,And a distinction that was critical in Alyeska.
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2182.418,2183.498,Fine.
1982.82-242,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2204.551,2208.095,"Of course, there the purpose is to provide the criminal defendant with an attorney."
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2208.095,2208.688,Right.
1982.82-242,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.606,2232.866,"Well, but the Criminal Justice Act is express when it says our purpose is to provide a criminal defendant with an attorney in every case, win or lose."
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2232.866,2237.74,"Admittedly, it's clearer language."
1982.82-242,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2498.492,2511.661,"Mr. Tyler, if this had been a Section 304 suit and the defendant had been a small to medium size business, would you be making this same argument under 304?"
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2511.661,2515.721,"Not entirely, because there--"
1982.82-242,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2515.721,2517.175,Is the language different?
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2517.175,2530.418,"--The language is not different, but I would answer you and admit that I would argue differently because I think there a court would apply its discretion differently."
1982.82-242,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2530.418,2532.823,Why should it in light of the language?
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2545.707,2549.443,"Well, I can see the argument."
1982.82-242,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2549.443,2554.972,Do you think any judge would award fees to a dead loser in that sort of case against a small business?
1982.82-242,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2554.972,2563.658,"I would, if I were exercising the discretion, concededly not award fees if I were the panel."
1982.82-242,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2597.002,2600.5,"Do you have anything further, Ms. Oberly?"
1982.82-242,2,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2600.5,2602.672,"A few points, Your Honor."
1982.82-242,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2690.977,2692.35,"Thank you, counsel."
