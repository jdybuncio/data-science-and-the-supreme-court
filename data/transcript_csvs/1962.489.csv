1962.489,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,6.142,"Raymond Downum, Petitioner, versus United States."
1962.489,0,40611,richard_tinsman,,9.075,10.902,May it please the Court.
1962.489,1,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,1363.221,1367.837,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court."
1962.489,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1845.908,1847.321,In this case?
1962.489,1,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,1847.321,1850.476,"Not in this case, in all the cases which had been assigned to him."
1962.489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.476,1851.713,What year?
1962.489,1,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,1851.713,1856.088,"1961, in the early Spring of 1961."
1962.489,2,35328,miller,,2074.958,2077.266,About 250 to 300 miles.
1962.489,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2077.266,2078.76,250 to 300 miles.
1962.489,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2078.76,2081.181,Away on his automobile or how it'd be away?
1962.489,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2084.014,2090.56,"I suspect from reading the record, I don't think it's specifically stated but I suspect that he was traveling by automobile."
1962.489,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2090.56,2092.333,What does he sell?
1962.489,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2092.333,2099.616,I don't believe the record indicates that.
1962.489,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2099.616,2117.607,Was there any discussion at the time the jury was discharged as to why this man was not there or was there any justification or shown by the prosecution for this discharge?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2117.607,2122.216,"No, the record on that point -- the record before the Court on that point is very, very brief."
1962.489,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2122.216,2123.429,Where is it?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2123.429,2132.523,"It appears on page 10, I believe, of the page 10 of the record."
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2151.788,2152.079,What page is that?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2152.079,2154.751,On page 10 -- page 10 of the record.
1962.489,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2154.751,2162.886,"Well, would that indicate that the Court and the prosecutor had determined beforehand that this jury would be discharged?"
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2162.886,2164.121,There's no indication.
1962.489,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2164.121,2169.038,There is any thing here to indicate that the Court exercised any discretion.
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2193.935,2222.088,"Well, I think we may presume that when the U.S. Attorney talked to the judge that he did discuss the fact that he was -- the witness had been under subpoena, the record does reveal later on the motion, two days later when the motion went -- or rather when the plea of prior jeopardy was argued, then they go into this more fully and developed the fact that the witness had been subpoenaed that he had been -- that Mr. McDonald had checked at the U.S. Attorneys at the marshal's office the day before and -- and so forth."
1962.489,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2222.919,2233.232,Well shouldn't -- shouldn't the judge exercise this discretion on what happens in the Court rather than -- rather than what the prosecutor tells him out of Court?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2233.232,2246.339,"Well, I'm not so certain that the judge is bound to act in this matter, in a matter such as this solely on what appears and what might appear on open court or might be testified to an open court appear on the record."
1962.489,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2253.724,2255.93,Where does it ever -- where does it say that?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2255.93,2258.811,"Well, the judge doesn't make a specific finding to that effect."
1962.489,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2265.044,2266.386,Was that at the same time?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2266.386,2270.816,No this was when the -- this was when the -- they were arguing the plea of prior jeopardy.
1962.489,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2270.816,2280.367,"Well, that's on a different occasion and this is when the Court took the action to dismiss this jury and that's a critical time as far as I'm concerned."
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2280.367,2286.318,"Well, the record does, the record fails to reveal at that particular time just what knowledge the judge had."
1962.489,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2286.318,2296.246,"Well Mr. Geoghegan, isn't this something that [Inaudible]"
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2296.246,2296.914,Yes.
1962.489,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2296.914,2301.749,[Inaudible]
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2301.749,2306.286,"Well, if there is -- I think the record, I think we can state form the record on page 10."
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2334.6,2336.072,Where did he get them?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2336.072,2340.111,I presume he received them from the Assistant of United States Attorney.
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2340.111,2341.357,Where and when?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2341.357,2348.183,"Possibly, probably in chambers or in the courtroom before the Court convened."
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2349.567,2352.556,Did the Court have to select the jury recess?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2352.556,2353.514,What is that sir?
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2353.514,2356.048,Did the Court recess after selecting the jury?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2356.048,2358.623,"Yes, they recessed for lunch, the Court recessed for lunch --"
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2358.623,2360.753,And then -- and they came back from lunch.
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2360.753,2361.83,And they came back from lunch and the jury --
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2361.83,2366.132,"When they left, the case was ready for trial so as you said?"
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2368.075,2373.574,That statement had been made by the United States Attorney in the morning prior to the time when the jury was selected.
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2376.609,2377.482,To select the jury --
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2377.482,2377.62,Yes.
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2377.62,2378.97,And went out for lunch.
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2378.97,2379.205,And then he went out.
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2379.205,2387.799,"And when they came back, the first thing the judge said to Mr. Tinsman was that he's going to discharge the jury?"
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2387.799,2388.388,That's correct.
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2399.011,2401.631,And what did the defendant say?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2401.631,2413.72,The defendant at that time -- the defendant at that time objected and said that he suggested that they go to trial on those counts of the indictment on which the testimony in this witness -- on which the testimony of this witness was not required.
1962.489,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.72,2421.242,[Inaudible]
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2421.242,2422.787,"No, he did not object at that time."
1962.489,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2427.791,2429.673,That was after the tenth?
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2429.673,2433.947,"No, that was on the -- that was on the -- on Tuesday, the day the --"
1962.489,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.947,2438.556,[Inaudible]
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2438.556,2439.402,"No, no."
1962.489,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2499.839,2501.01,"But there is a little more, isn't it?"
1962.489,3,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,2501.01,2502.317,"Well, yes, excuse me, yes."
1962.489,4,40611,richard_tinsman,,3659.959,3670.158,I would briefly like to reply to the Government's contention that there is a danger in future cases if this case is not affirmed.
1962.489,5,44808,william_a_geoghegan,,4189.846,4201.631,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."
