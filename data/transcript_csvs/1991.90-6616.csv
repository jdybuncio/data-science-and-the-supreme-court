1991.90-6616,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.324,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-6616, James R. Stringer v. Lee Roy Black."
1991.90-6616,0,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,10.996,13.543,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6616,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,105.036,114.174,"Counsel, just at the outset, and you can just do it in the course of your oral argument, but it seems to me the briefs don't meet very well."
1991.90-6616,0,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,139.789,142.007,"Your Honor, I could go ahead and address that now."
1991.90-6616,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,242.248,247.542,"But of course, the further question is whether or not that's a new rule under Teague."
1991.90-6616,0,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,266.676,269.549,"Your Honor, Florida has narrowing."
1991.90-6616,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.037,383.549,"Mr. Rose, I understand Mississippi says it relied on Zant."
1991.90-6616,0,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,410.133,411.883,"Your Honor, I would agree."
1991.90-6616,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.082,425.033,"Yes, but that's your Maynard point, that's not your Clemons point, to go back to the Fifth Circuit's analysis."
1991.90-6616,0,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,425.033,435.341,"Your Honor, our Clemons point is that there must be some individualized cure once the sentencer has considered a vague statutory aggravating circumstance."
1991.90-6616,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.254,468.157,"You know, that probably shows your case is different from Zant, but I think you have to go further in Teague and show that Clemons was not a new rule."
1991.90-6616,0,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,468.157,471.655,"Yes, Your Honor, we do have to show Clemons is not a new rule."
1991.90-6616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,542.642,544.454,Are you talking about Maynard now or--
1991.90-6616,0,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,544.454,549.188,"--Your Honor, I'm talking about what was applied in Maynard."
1991.90-6616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,551.873,553.966,"--But you're going to get to Clemons pretty soon, I guess."
1991.90-6616,0,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,553.966,554.591,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-6616,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,557.387,557.903,That's all right.
1991.90-6616,0,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,561.635,568.678,Clemons had stated that there is some requirement of individualized review.
1991.90-6616,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,638.355,641.664,Do you deduce all of that just from that one sentence in Barclay?
1991.90-6616,0,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,641.664,643.414,"Your Honor, no, sir."
1991.90-6616,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.076,865.277,"Thank you, Mr. Rose."
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,866.511,872.243,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6616,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,913.306,918.303,And was Lowenfield v. Phelps from Louisiana?
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,918.303,919.397,"Yes, ma'am... yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-6616,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,919.397,926.3,And did we say there that only one narrowing procedure is constitutionally required?
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,926.3,946.23,"You said that, there in Lowenfield, that... and I interpreted as saying yes... that in Lowenfield that the Constitution... the last sentence of the opinion says that the narrowing, constitutional narrowing is done by the finding of guilt of one of the narrowly defined crimes, and the Constitution requires no more."
1991.90-6616,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,946.23,954.586,"So then, the State is permitted to use vague aggravating circumstances thereafter if it wants to, is that the theory you offer?"
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,954.586,956.397,The... that is not the theory.
1991.90-6616,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,969.767,980.2,"Well, your position is that they can be vague, and under a standard that you would apply to a constitutional inquiry, but still stand up."
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,980.2,980.669,--That's correct.
1991.90-6616,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,980.669,985.182,That's your... so that Maynard doesn't apply at all.
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,985.182,985.604,That's correct.
1991.90-6616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.598,1006.642,"Well, in this case it was still necessary to find an aggravating circumstance."
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1006.642,1008.032,"That's correct, under State law."
1991.90-6616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1008.032,1013.516,"Yes, and so the jury had to find an aggravating circumstance."
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1013.516,1013.797,That's correct.
1991.90-6616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.797,1014.607,In addition to the narrowing.
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1014.607,1016.466,That's correct.
1991.90-6616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.466,1032.116,And you say the jury could be... could satisfy that requirement by finding an aggravating circumstance that's just plain outright vague.
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1032.116,1035.786,"That's correct, because it's not constitutionally required."
1991.90-6616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1035.786,1037.646,"Well, your brother, I think--"
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1040.083,1041.455,That's correct.
1991.90-6616,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1041.455,1063.525,"I think your brother is arguing that you've got a two-step narrowing procedure, and he is saying, at least I think he's saying implicitly, that if you do employ a two-step narrowing procedure, the standards applicable to, we'll say the second step, should be the same applicable to the first and there's nothing new about applying a given standard."
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1069.085,1094.045,"Well, if in Lowenfield... and the Mississippi statute operates as does the Louisiana statute... if the narrowing... that all the Constitution requires is that narrowing to limit the class of people for who the death penalty may be imposed is constitutionally completed or established by the finding of guilt of one of the narrowly defined crimes... and Lowenfield said the Constitution requires no more."
1991.90-6616,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.277,1109.429,"Well, didn't the Fifth Circuit find this instruction invalid for vagueness?"
1991.90-6616,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1109.429,1111.709,--In this case?
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,1889.911,1891.691,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1991.90-6616,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1931.427,1935.83,And Lowenfield is not controlling on that point because?
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,1935.83,1950.263,"Your Honor, Lowenfield is not at all controlling, and that has no relevance to the question, because Lowenfield just defines the point where there has to be... what is constitutionally permitted for a State to do."
1991.90-6616,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.359,2021.203,They were wrong about that in Clemons?
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,2021.203,2024.53,"Your Honor, they were wrong on that under Zant."
1991.90-6616,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.53,2026.623,"Well, yes, yes."
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,2026.623,2033.526,Because Zant said that it was constitutional error for the sentencer to consider vague statutory aggravating circumstances.
1991.90-6616,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.502,2067.981,"Yes, but didn't we, in Zant, didn't it just leave open the question of the significance of the invalidity of one of several aggravating circumstances in a balancing State, in a weighing State?"
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,2067.981,2068.949,"Your Honor, the question--"
1991.90-6616,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.949,2070.074,Is it yes or no?
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,2070.074,2089.503,"--Your Honor, the question is yes, but what was left open was whether or not a State was required to automatically reverse based on a vague stat... in a weighing State, we know that each statutory aggravating circumstance found by the jury plays an important role."
1991.90-6616,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.667,2117.15,"Well, surely Clemons was, in that respect was a new rule on the Fifth Circuit, wasn't it?"
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,2117.15,2120.289,"--Clemons reversed the Fifth Circuit, Your Honor."
1991.90-6616,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.521,2127.206,So it was a new rule somewhere and it--
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,2131.017,2131.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-6616,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2131.58,2137.296,"It disagreed with the Fifth Circuit, and obviously when we disagree with the Fifth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit was wrong."
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,2137.296,2138.686,"That's right, Your Honor."
1991.90-6616,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.773,2158.304,"Well, that's the Maynard."
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,2161.007,2182.154,"--The counsel opposite has argued that Mississippi does not limit consideration, the weighing stage, to just statutory aggravating facts supporting the statutory aggravating circumstance."
1991.90-6616,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2244.332,2249.362,"Mr. Rose, you've mentioned California v. Ramos a couple of times in your oral argument."
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,2251.58,2252.393,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.90-6616,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2252.393,2253.828,You don't?
1991.90-6616,2,33966,kenneth_j_rose,,2253.828,2255.891,I do not cite it in my brief.
1991.90-6616,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2307.072,2308.322,"Thank you, Mr. Rose."
