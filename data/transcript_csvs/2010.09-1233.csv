2010.09-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.821,"09-1233, Schwarzenegger versus Plata, and the related cases, Mr. Phillips."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,7.821,10.846,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,62.179,67.052,"One case, Mr. Phillips, is pending for 20 years, is that not so?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,67.052,68.939,"Yes that is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,68.939,81.026,"So it seems to me -- and there were something like 70 orders from the district court, the single-judge district court in that case?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,81.026,82.47,"That is absolutely true, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,82.47,86.809,"And no change, so how much longer do we have to wait, another 20 years?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,86.809,87.706,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,143.045,151.432,"Excuse me, could you tell me from your briefs, I just haven't understood what the alternative steps are?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,213.647,214.45,Sure.
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,214.45,227.008,"-- details about what the least restrictive means would have been other than to say, throw it back to a receiver and special master who are saying, we don't have a solution outside of reducing overcrowding."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,227.008,229.817,-- I don't think that's a fair characterization of what the receiver said.
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,233.108,237.552,"Oh, Counsel that was one statement years ago."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,238.988,239.312,"--No, no."
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,240.501,241.693,That may be your weakest argument.
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,246.064,255.772,"Well if you -- all you have to do is look at what the receiver has done over the course of the period of time since his appointment, and particularly when the second receiver was put in place."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,271.104,288.835,"Is there in fact less overcrowding because I thought what this case was all about was that the receiver has said, the special master has said, “we can't make any progress at all until there are fewer people; we have no place to put clinics."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,307.198,314.086,"Justice Ginsburg, the fundamental issue in this case seems to me as -- what is the real cause of the constitutional violation here?"
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,336.817,341.802,But he can't provide construction when the State doesn't supply the money for it?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,341.802,362.673,"Except that since the August 8, 2008, period of time, you know, literally hundreds of millions of dollars have gone to construction specifically and more than $4 billion have been spent on the provision of healthcare in this particular system and a great deal of that is because of the receiver."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,362.673,395.022,"Then if there are -- if there are these great changes in circumstances so that now they -- medical care can be administered in something approaching a decent way, you could go back to the single-judge district court and say I'm moving under 60(b); circumstances have changed, it is no longer the case that it's impossible to render decent health care."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,395.022,403.22,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't think we could get that relief from the single-judge district court, unless you are asking me to actually seek to remove the entirety of the claim."
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,413.115,419.818,"So you go back to that panel because it invited you to. It said if circumstances change, come back."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,419.818,422.357,"Right, but that will always be the case, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,437.461,442.512,What the receiver said the best statement that seemed to me to summarize it.
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,466.665,466.97,Well --
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,466.97,481.674,"What the receiver says is overcrowding is a big cause of it and then he says, “I think we have discovered you actually can provide care, and certainly our plan and turnaround plan believes we can provide constitutional levels of care, no matter what the population is.”"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,493.839,499.372,"No, but, Justice Breyer, the legislature also approved a smaller, but nevertheless multibillion-dollar construction program."
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,499.372,501.097,That was 2.31 or something like that.
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,501.097,502.006,"Well, I –"
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,502.006,503.449,And did they approve the 2.3?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,506.315,506.867,"Yes, they did approve that --"
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,506.867,507.416,Okay.
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,507.416,507.735,-- and that money is being spent.
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,507.735,512.683,"So he said, “we need eight, we need eight and they approved 2.35.”"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,512.683,513.378,"Right, and the receiver --"
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.378,519.491,Is there any evidence here that suggests that 2.35 is sufficient to cure the constitutional violation?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,519.491,521.107,"Well, I don't know whether it will get you there or not --"
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,521.107,523.76,"So I take it from your answer the answer is no, there is no evidence?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,523.76,538.07,"Well, there is the evidence that the receiver asked for contempt for not getting the 8 billion and withdrew that motion, so obviously there is some sense in which the receiver is reasonably satisfied with 2.35 billion as an opening gambit."
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.912,559.535,"Well, what he says -- what the receiver says about the 2.35, is that it is a significant step farther. It is certainly better than no construction at all."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,581.584,595.812,"Justice Breyer, when the receiver says that, now remember he says at current population levels, he doesn't suggest, and his brief is very clear that it doesn't urge this Court to affirm the particular order in this case."
2010.09-1233,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,595.812,597.088,Mr.--
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,597.088,598.434,Can I just finish this?
2010.09-1233,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,598.434,599.034,Yes.
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,599.034,622.636,"And the reality is that the population levels have dropped pretty significantly since August, since the trial in this particular case and given the actions by the legislature in AB 18 and the actions of the legislature in AB 900, there are both a lot of expenditures on the table and substantial reductions in the population size, and so therefore, even under the receiver's --"
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,622.636,626.239,Do we have information about that substantial reduction?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,646.198,658.679,"Well, it's down to around, as I understand it, about 147,000 from a high of around 165 to 170,000, and it has dropped, as we know, because there has been a change in the good time credits."
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,664.127,670.721,"So it's possible that within the two-year period, you are going to hit the mark, if you -- that's what --"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,670.721,671.536,I think it unlikely.
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,671.536,681.364,"-- that's what the three-judge panel said, which is if you implement most of the proposals being made, you are likely to hit the mark."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,706.662,712.45,There is a core sort of federalism answer and then a basic sort of factual point to be made here.
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,732.207,733.786,So what are we fighting about?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,733.786,733.955,So --
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,733.955,748.091,"Are we fighting about that the plan was wrong or are we fighting about that you are angry that you were told to do it in two years -- in 22 years, as opposed to do it in 25 years?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,749.553,749.75,No.
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,752.406,754.663,Can you do it in 5 years?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,754.663,755.236,I don't know.
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,764.133,773.509,"Well, the best interest of the State of California, isn't it to deliver adequate constitutional care to the people that it incarcerates?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,775.514,776.178,Absolutely!
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,777.216,779.246,So when are you going to get to that?
2010.09-1233,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,798.88,801.073,But don't be rhetorical.
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,801.073,801.833,I'll do my best.
2010.09-1233,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.453,849.558,"Of course, but the problem I have with that, Mr. Phillips, is that at some point the Court has to say, “You have been given enough time, the constitutional violation still persists as the State itself acknowledges” –"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,849.558,851.336,"--Well, I'm not sure we've--"
2010.09-1233,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,851.336,858.277,"-- “overcrowding is the principal -- overcrowding is the principal cause, as experts have testified, and it's now time for a remedy."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,866.691,882.598,"Justice Kennedy, I agree with everything you say except -- and I even agree with the last statement because, you know, you needed a significant remedy, there's no question about it, but you got a significant remedy when the receiver was appointed in 2005 and implemented a program in 2006."
2010.09-1233,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,882.598,884.938,How much time do you think the receiver needed?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,892.173,894.885,"Well, there's no -- Justice Kagan, there is no specific time frame."
2010.09-1233,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,903.147,912.164,"Well, at some point the State itself said that if it had I think seven years, it could get down to 137.5, and didn't seem to object to that?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,912.164,927.56,"No, that's -- Justice Kennedy, you know, given all of the other constraints, et cetera -- again, there is a fundamental difference between what you do under the hammer of a district court order, which is what we have under these circumstances, and what the State will do."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,973.475,984.195,"But I thought that officer himself said, “I can't do this without as a first step reducing the population."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1023.254,1048.654,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, even if you accept that, and I don't think that's precisely how I would interpret what the receiver said under these circumstances anyway, but even if you accept that, the idea of a 137.5 percent designed cap that has to be implemented within fewer than two years is a remedy that is neither necessary nor sufficient and is not aimed at the specific class."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1054.053,1062.027,"I don't get the class thing, because what -- you can't have a remedy just limited to the class."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1082.799,1104.488,"I think, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the fundamental point here is that it may eventually be that you have to get to that stage, but if you look at the receiver's reports since August 2008, which consistently analyzed this issue, and they say, “we have been able successfully to bring in very qualified personnel, and we have significantly larger numbers."
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1119.119,1121.068,Where do I look at to find this?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1187.112,1206.379,"I would say that the Prisoners Litigation Reform Act has a series of very specific requirements that the Federal court has to comply with and that in deciding to go to the three-judge district court in the first instance, you have to examine the orders that are in place and whether those orders have had a reasonable time within which to operate."
2010.09-1233,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1206.379,1215.128,"Yes, but the State -- the State did not claim that either order in either case has succeeded in achieving the remedy."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1217.545,1219.273,"Well, it depends on what you mean by --"
2010.09-1233,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1219.273,1226.321,"And -- and -- and just if I can have your attention for a moment, I have this problem with the case."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1265.478,1276.683,"I mean, it seems to me that, first of all, I'm not sure that is consistent with the language, that’s primary cause of the constitutional violation, not the primary impediment to the implementation of a specific remedy."
2010.09-1233,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1352.331,1364.966,"All this talk about what the receiver may think can be done seems a little bit perplexing to me because the receiver did not testify before the three-judge court, isn't that correct?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1364.966,1365.748,"That -- that is true, Justice Alito."
2010.09-1233,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1365.748,1367.561,You were not allowed to question him?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1367.561,1368.47,We were not allowed to --
2010.09-1233,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1368.47,1376.163,And now he has submitted what is styled in amicus brief where he doesn't address issues of law.
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1386.347,1394.235,"Well, you know, I'm a long-time believer that amicus briefs is pretty much open season in terms of anything you want to present on them, but I mean, obviously I think it’s --"
2010.09-1233,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1394.235,1394.676,Is that true?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1394.676,1396.038,-- clearly a better system –
2010.09-1233,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1396.038,1401.298,Can a witness testify -- can a witness submit an amicus brief that consists of an affidavit?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1401.298,1404.715,"No, Your Honor, that's obviously not appropriate and it's one of the things that we've complained about."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1404.715,1429.487,"I thought the -- the -- that brief was filed because the -- there were, in your presentations there were representations about the special master, and he filed that brief to say, “You must understand this in context, I was making a speech at the club,” but he wanted to put in context what you had used."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1432.072,1439.318,"Well, to be sure, although, candidly, we had -- we had referred to some of those same statements even in the jurisdictional statement in this litigation."
2010.09-1233,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1490.77,1493.96,"Well, but the experts testified to that effect?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1493.96,1498.891,"I mean, experts may -- certainly reached that specific conclusion, but this Court has recognized --"
2010.09-1233,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1498.891,1504.117,And the strike force and the governor's -- governor's commission reached the same conclusion?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1504.117,1504.405,Well --
2010.09-1233,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1504.405,1506.037,"The strike team, I think they called them."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1506.037,1529.266,"Right, but again, it seems to me that there is a very, very, very big difference between what do you need to accomplish in order to remedy whatever -- whatever the constitutional violation is, recognizing in the first instance that the biggest element of an Eighth Amendment violation is the deliberate indifference prong, which absolutely seems to me to have been completely eliminated by the conduct of the State over the course of the last three to four years."
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1529.995,1531.852,What specifically will happen?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1580.44,1582.39,"Well, it depends I suppose on some ways on how you --"
2010.09-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1582.39,1594.192,"A constitutional problem which the State itself admits is constitutional, a State with a governor who has said publicly that there is this tremendous safety and health problem in the prisons."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1595.528,1601.356,"Well, if the Court were to conclude that the three-judge panel shouldn't have been convened, that would be one outcome."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1618.205,1640.933,"One piece of it -- you said something about the 2.35 million, they didn't come up with the 8 million, but they did come up with the 2.35 billion and then I'm just looking at this brief for the receiver and there is a footnote, page 11, footnote 3, that says, “No, that money isn't there."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1653.758,1656.137,"Well, 400 million of it has already been spent."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1670.747,1672.537,But not the 2.35?
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1683.179,1686.234,"Well, the receiver is saying it's not etched in stone."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1705.791,1712.497,"And one project that the joint legislative budget committee said, no, we are not going to give you money for that."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1712.497,1732.675,"They asked for additional information, to be sure, but the expectation, again, from the governor, both from this governor and the governor-elect, is that that money will ultimately be approved and that that facility would be built and we are moving along very rapidly to get that construction under way, because we are talking about enormous facilities under these particular circumstances, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1233,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1732.675,1741.76,"Mr. Phillips, my trouble listening to you is that it seems as though you are asking us to re-find facts."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1778.16,1782.349,"The fundamental problem with the fact-finding in this -- well, there are actually two fundamental problems."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1836.963,1841.547,"Can you explain me something about that, it was confusing in the brief, Mr. Phillips?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1884.206,1906.73,"Well, there is a huge difference between not allowing formal tours and all of the rigamarole that goes with that, which is what the State specifically objected to, but what the State wanted to do and what the Intervenors on our side in even greater vehemence wanted to do was to bring forward evidence that proved that in the interim period of time there have been, in fact, significant improvements."
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1917.826,1919.901,But then don't you have the burden?
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1936.277,1938.137,"Counsel, did you--"
2010.09-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1938.137,1938.707,I'm sorry.
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1941.308,1941.463,Yes.
2010.09-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1997.205,2009.406,"Well, maybe we are talking about one of the cases, but the other one, and it's the newer one in 2000 -- instituted in 2001, but what about the one that started out in 1990?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2009.406,2033.047,"Coleman is obviously a much -- a much more serious problem, I don't doubt that, but it seems -- and if the Court were to conclude ultimately that Coleman ought to go back for another analysis based on the problems there, I could understand that and it would be a very different prisoner release order under those circumstances because then you would have to take out all of the evidence with respect to Plata and let that play out."
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2070.012,2082.474,"Counsel, this issue about evidence, did you proffer to the judge anywhere in this record what the additional evidence it was that you wanted to show?"
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2091.072,2093.018,Right.
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2093.018,2094.728,But you are from the prisons.
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2119.348,2119.523,Right.
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2119.523,2122.217,Why didn't you -- you keep saying we were blocked.
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2122.217,2145.758,"Because the district court -- because the district court could not have been plainer and when the Intervenor's counsel stood up in the opening statement and said, I want to start talking about the beneficial changes and where the status is today as opposed to where it was way back when, the three-judge court, at least one of the member of the three-judge court said, “We have been as clear as we can be that we are not entertaining any evidence on that point.”"
2010.09-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2159.86,2169.447,"Except that the district court invited you to proffer that evidence that went to the appropriateness of the remedy, so you didn't have to proffer it."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2185.277,2194.582,"But Justice Sotomayor, there is, to my mind at least, a complete disconnect by saying, I'm not going to tell you exactly where the constitutional violation is today."
2010.09-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2207.421,2209.977,"Counsel, I see your time is about to expire."
2010.09-1233,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2209.977,2230.349,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2230.349,2231.749,Mr. Specter.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2231.749,2238.844,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2257.732,2260.491,Are you talking about current figures or past?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2261.907,2262.301,Sure.
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2264.895,2265.933,That's what I thought.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2280.178,2291.538,"Well, I think, Your Honor, there was massive amounts of evidence about the constitutional violations that existed at the time that the remedy was imposed."
2010.09-1233,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2309.978,2312.448,"They didn't take any evidence on the point, I thought."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2312.448,2315.755,"No, Your Honor I'm sorry, that's not correct, with all respect."
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2324.944,2326.287,Could you give us the record?
2010.09-1233,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.287,2327.758,Current conditions?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2327.758,2328.602,Current as of the time of the trial.
2010.09-1233,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.602,2337.805,What was -- what was your friend talking about when he said that they rejected any effort to show the current situation?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2337.805,2344.777,"Well, my friend and I have a disagreement, but I think Justice Sotomayor accurately captured it."
2010.09-1233,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2376.037,2378.334,That was in 2008.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2378.334,2381.199,"That was the time of the trial, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2381.327,2386.786,They had a cutoff date of some two months before the trial.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2386.786,2388.519,"In August, and the trial started in November."
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2388.519,2397.959,"And that -- but before that point, the experts that were -- had testified were aware of the conditions that existed?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2397.959,2399.168,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.168,2401.274,And when was the remedy imposed?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2401.274,2407.348,"The remedy -- well, the final order came -- well, the close of evidence was in December of 2008."
2010.09-1233,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.348,2410.081,"That was in the -- in the one-judge court, in the district court, wasn't it?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2410.081,2412.001,"No, no in the three-judge court."
2010.09-1233,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2434.175,2434.74,Didn't you –
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2434.74,2437.075,"I'm sorry, let me just keep track here."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2440.207,2447.397,"The trial closed in December of 2008, after all the parties had submitted all their evidence."
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2463.061,2480.277,"You don't dispute the statement I have, it's in the response to the Intervenors that between October 2006 and October 2010 the population of the adult facilities declined by 14,832 inmates?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2480.277,2487.504,"I agree with my friend Mr. Phillips that the population has declined by about 10,000 prisoners."
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2505.642,2513.036,"What about the argument that there was evidence that should have been admitted, but that was not with reference to new construction?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2513.036,2520.756,"Well, I don't -- there was no evidence that wasn't -- that was offered that wasn't considered by the three-judge panel, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2537.468,2539.287,Could --
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2539.287,2554.962,Can you explain what the connection is between the 137.5 percent figure and the constitutional violations relating to the provision of medical care in general and treatment for -- for mental illness?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2569.113,2570.126,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2570.126,2582.78,"Now, what does the ruling -- that doesn't speak to the number of personnel who are available in the system to attend to medical needs or mental illness?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2596.527,2598.461,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2626.805,2628.034,"See, that's what I don't understand."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2641.401,2644.486,"No, it -- you could have -- it's a remedy, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2644.486,2658.095,"You could have a prison where the -- the cells themselves are crowded, and yet there are other facilities available for medical care and plenty of staff to attend to those things."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2659.21,2661.581,"Well, that's -- that's -- and you're right."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2705.781,2719.11,"But why order the release of around 40,000 prisoners, many of whom, perhaps the great majority of whom, are not going to be within the class in either of these lawsuits?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2738.989,2743.097,"Well, I have two responses to that, and they are both a little separate."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2774.021,2777.597,"If all they do is to build more cells, they are not going to address the problem."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2777.597,2778.156,Exactly.
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2827.265,2828.156,I still don't get it.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2834.452,2834.774,No.
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2834.774,2845.181,In order to -- in order to provide some kind of remedy we are going to order something else that doesn't address the problems that these lawsuits aim at addressing.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2845.181,2854.88,"No, that -- no, Your Honor, to the contrary, Justice Alito, we -- I think the court believes based on the facts that it found that this would be an effective remedy."
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2916.988,2917.325,Counsel --
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2917.325,2923.623,That is a very indirect way of addressing the problem and it has collateral consequences.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2936.308,2936.514,Crowding –
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2936.514,2938.269,-- terminology you used was.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2952.868,2952.991,Well --
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2952.991,2954.025,-- in the State of California?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,2980.734,2994.532,"Your Honor, this trial court found based on, 50 pages of its opinion, based on expert testimony, not only from our experts, but from the State's experts, from the Intervenors' experts."
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3037.485,3043.379,But that is not what -- that is not what the three-judge district court determined.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3051.192,3051.664,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3051.664,3058.285,"And when -- and then it said to the State, look, you come up with a plan that gets you to 137.5 in two years."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3058.285,3058.819,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3058.819,3067.618,"The State did, and the State did not say, emphatically did not say this is not going to have an adverse impact on public safety."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3067.618,3068.198,"Right, but the--"
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3068.198,3074.078,"There is a problem with negative there, but -- and what the district court said, it didn't examine that."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3082.818,3083.224,Right.
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3083.462,3094.625,"And said -- and so it did not make those determinations, but the PLRA requires it to determine that what it's ordering or at least gives substantial weight to the public safety issue."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3100.877,3103.188,I would respectfully disagree with that and I'll tell you why--
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3103.188,3106.068,I thought you would.[Laughter]
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3106.068,3110.623,At least it's respectful. [Laughter]
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3136.578,3139.667,Did he want to do it within the two-year period the district court ordered?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3139.667,3141.038,"Yes, Your Honor, he did."
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3163.61,3164.182,"Right, right."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3166.934,3167.397,I'll get to that.
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3167.397,3168.364,-- with respect to the two-year plan --
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3168.364,3168.862,Right.
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3168.862,3170.212,-- and I would like an answer to that.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3170.212,3170.36,Yes.
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3170.36,3177.905,"As I look at this record, I see that the district court did what was required by the Act with respect to the plan that it's ordering."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3187.804,3188.345,Right.
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3218.948,3231.43,"Well, they said we're sure, because we trust, I'm just quoting from 4a, ""We trust that the State will comply with its duty to ensure public safety as it implements the constitutionally required reduction."""
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3237.226,3242.027,Right and the -- that's the State's position and had been the State's position all along.
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3266.245,3267.289,"Counsel, didn't the court --"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3267.289,3269.419,-- and they haven't been shown to be clearly erroneous.
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3282.163,3282.464,Counsel --
2010.09-1233,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3282.464,3283.266,"Well, what do you mean they can do it?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3287.846,3289.216,But they can also do it safely --
2010.09-1233,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3289.216,3290.605,"You know, that's pie in the sky, that's not going to happen."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3290.605,3294.12,"No, it isn't, Your Honor, because they can also do it safely by good time credits."
2010.09-1233,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3295.595,3299.843,Doesn't good time credits let -- let people out who would not otherwise be out?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3299.843,3316.123,"Just a -- you know, the evidence was at trial, and the court's finding about that evidence was, and the State officials so testified, that giving prisoners good time credits is not a threat to public safety."
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3316.123,3316.504,Counsel.
2010.09-1233,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3317.321,3327.498,"Why wouldn't it have been the better course, for the State -- for the court to say, you know, the State said it can do this in five years without any public safety problem?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3327.498,3328.321,Right.
2010.09-1233,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3328.321,3332.124,So why don't we let them take those five years?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3332.124,3340.879,Because Your Honor as Justice Ginsburg and others have been saying before the constitutional violations have been ongoing for 20 years.
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3370.359,3370.896,I think --
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3370.896,3371.733,Counsel--
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3371.733,3374.139,I think Justice Sotomayor has been patient.
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3374.139,3384.927,I have several questions but I'm not sure why -- you have not been responding to Justice -- to the Chief Justice.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3391.224,3391.514,Yes.
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3391.514,3396.175,"And said, we are not imposing them because we want the State to do -- to choose among them?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3396.175,3397.022,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3397.022,3412.94,"As I've looked at the State's final plan, I thought that they had in fact not only accepted all of the recommendations, but they added a couple of additional remedies that the court had not suggested?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3412.94,3413.587,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3413.587,3424.992,"Is it a fair statement that the district, that the three judge panel was saying, if you do these things that's their finding, you can do it without affecting public safety, wasn't that what they were saying?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3424.992,3427.352,"Yes, Your Honor, if I didn't make that clear, I meant to."
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3427.352,3444.097,"The second more important question was going back to something that Justice Scalia asked you, which was, you made the statement that no one was stopped from proffering evidence about prison conditions up till two months before the trial."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3447.936,3449.052,Nothing.
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3449.052,3455.649,What point is the other side making that they were excluded from making?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3455.649,3470.316,"Well, as we said in our briefs, Your Honor, there was no evidence that was excluded, and in fact, the State's witnesses testified about conditions, some of the conditions current as of the day of the testimony."
2010.09-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3479.236,3481.077,What is the number?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3497.538,3498.355,"35,000."
2010.09-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3498.355,3500.914,"35,000, and this could be done safely."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3500.914,3501.2,Yes.
2010.09-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3501.2,3505.563,"Preceding page, whatever that was, 253."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3505.563,3505.813,Right.
2010.09-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3505.813,3525.311,"There are about six pages where they summarize evidence from all kinds of criminologists that say, for example, there are 17,000 technical parole violators that are being sent to prison who haven't committed additional crimes and they could perhaps be released from some of the time that they're spending in prison."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3538.783,3539.183,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3539.183,3541.303,Then they had several other things.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3544.627,3553.716,And there was also testimony that the Department Of Corrections was using a risk assessment instrument to identify the low risk prisoners.
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3553.716,3563.988,Isn't it true that in one of the main programs that was cited as providing a safeguard is evidence-based rehabilitation programs?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3563.988,3564.811,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3579.636,3583.312,What is the general record on the success of rehabilitation efforts?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3583.312,3588.322,"Well, you can't say generally because different programs have different records."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3588.322,3594.492,What did Congress think when it enacted the sentencing format?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3594.492,3596.869,I don't know.
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3596.869,3602.603,I have this question and this goes just to remedy.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3612.195,3614.022,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3614.022,3624.468,"I think that certainly the Prison Litigation Reform Act means that you have to, if there is going to be a release order, it must be releasing the minimum amount."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3624.468,3625.267,Yes.
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3625.267,3629.931,That will affect the purposes of the remedy order.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3647.154,3648.389,Well --
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3648.389,3659.893,"And I understand -- may I make -- there were more, correct me if I am wrong, there were more experts that testified that 145 would work then there were that 130 was necessary?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3659.893,3662.021,No.
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3727.983,3740.058,"But the experts -- the experts who were testifying were quite aware of the fact that overcrowding related to the constitutional violations, that was their whole theory."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3740.058,3740.675,Yes.
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3740.675,3743.796,And any number of them suggested that 145.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3743.796,3749.267,"I think there might have been only one, one expert suggested 145."
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3782.025,3793.924,"I see no evidence in the record that the State -- pardon me, that your clients said that 145 wouldn't work."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3793.924,3794.983,I think --
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3794.983,3796.096,Maybe you can answer.
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3796.096,3796.928,Just the experts.
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3796.928,3798.895,"Maybe you can answer, counsel, please."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3798.895,3801.87,Thank you.
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3811.75,3814.268,The expert who gave the 145?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3814.268,3814.897,Pardon me?
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3814.897,3816.997,The expert who gave the 145?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3816.997,3823.278,"There was no expert -- well, there was one expert who said maybe in the best of circumstances it could get to 145."
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3825.871,3828.602,Let's go to the one who's used the 145 figure.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3828.602,3830.829,"He was a psychologist, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3830.829,3831.466,He was a what?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3831.466,3835.703,He was a psychologist who has expertise in prison healthcare.
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3835.703,3840.296,And did he say that 145 you could deliver healthcare?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3840.296,3842.11,He was equivocal on that point.
2010.09-1233,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3860.872,3868.488,"Mr. Specter, there has been at least two significant changes; one is the good time credit."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3892.363,3900.837,"It was passed, I think, last year and I think it went into effect in July of last year, I believe, if that's what you are referring to."
2010.09-1233,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3900.837,3906.222,So do we know at all what effect this has had?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3906.222,3909.375,It has had a marginal effect on reducing the population.
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3964.431,3977.699,"I don't see a finding by the three-judge court that 145, is it, would not be an efficacious remedy."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,3982.622,3983.21,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4001.48,4013.808,"Can I ask you a hypothetical question that I know is not your case, but let's say you had the district court entering an order saying you have to bring it down to 137.5 in 2 years."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4039.981,4048.487,"Well, the Prison Litigation Reform Act requires the court to give substantial weight to the public safety implications of its decision."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4107.79,4111.89,What is the recidivism rate for those parolees?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4111.89,4114.72,"Well, it depends on the risk of the parolee."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4115.537,4117.502,"In general, what is the recidivism rate?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4117.502,4127.721,"--Well, overall, the risk is around 70 percent, but for low-risk prisoners the risk is 17 percent who reviolate."
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4127.721,4128.022,I'm sorry.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4130.353,4134.705,"The first number when you take all parolees, all together, it's 70 percent."
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4134.705,4135.499,70?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4135.499,4138.263,"70, because -- within three years."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4154.1,4154.673,What is the lowest?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4155.477,4167.256,17 percent and California has a risk assessment instrument which the court found could be used to make sure that what happened in Philadelphia doesn't happen again. (Voice Overlap)
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4167.256,4175.376,"Well, I understood that of the low-risk, if only the low-risk people are released, around 3,000 of them are going to commit another crime."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4175.376,4182.483,"They -- but they don't have to be released, first off I want to make sure I emphasize the point that this is a crowding reduction measure."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4185.84,4189.072,They don't have to be released if you can build enough cells --
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4189.072,4202.756,"Or you can divert, or you can improve the parole system so that parole violators don't commit so many crimes, if you offer rehabilitation alternatives, if you provide a number of diversion into the community."
2010.09-1233,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4208.096,4213.278,The 17 percent figure goes exactly to my concern.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4229.853,4241.134,"Well based on the experience in other jurisdictions, the court found we wouldn't and I wanted to say -- to clarify one point, Your Honor, the 70 percent figure includes -- doesn't always include crimes."
2010.09-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4250.631,4251.552,Is there any –
2010.09-1233,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4251.552,4262.87,"Is -- is there any other case where the prison reduction has been done under the PLRA, or is this the first -- the first one?"
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4262.87,4264.863,"It's the first one to reach this Court, obviously."
2010.09-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4273.081,4283.12,Is there any evidence on -- I see their suggestions -- the technical parole violators go elsewhere.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4328.044,4328.808,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4328.808,4335.236,All right is there any statistical evidence on the part -- on the point that Justice Alito raised --
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4335.236,4335.972,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4335.972,4338.649,-- as to whether these did or did not result in higher crime rates?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4338.649,4361.954,"Well, the evidence was, and the Court found -- and again, it's not clear error that these programs were more effective than prison in reducing recidivism and they were less expensive and -- and that's part of the reason why the three-judge panel concluded that a reduction in the prison population wouldn't increase crime."
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4361.954,4370.242,"Counsel, one of the things that concern me about this type of institutional reform litigation is that the State is responsible for a lot of different things."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4401.124,4403.874,"Well Your Honor, in this particular case --"
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4403.874,4405.482,I know you like your particular case.
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4419.617,4423.748,"Well, I believe the Federal courts have an obligation to enforce the Constitution and the laws."
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4423.748,4426.132,"No, no, I believe that as well, Counsel."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4443.749,4460.339,"Well, my simple answer to your question, Your Honor, and I don't mean to be flippant, but they're -- they have an obligation to follow the Federal law, the constitutional law, and other laws and if they are not, then the Federal court has an obligation to impose a remedy."
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4531.968,4545.871,"If you take the State's concession that it can meet a goal in 5 years and the Federal court order is 2 years, we are talking about 3 years."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4556.291,4559.341,"Well, there are a lot of things the State can do quickly."
2010.09-1233,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4565.607,4566.487,"No, no."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4574.823,4581.855,"--The State -- well, I just want to remind you that the governor proposed to the legislature that he reduced the prison population."
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4621.896,4633.263,So should the court have said 2 years for everything but construction? Wouldn't that have been a more narrowly tailored remedy?
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4633.263,4633.922,"Well, the State --"
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4633.922,4634.955,Except that they --
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4634.955,4635.126,I was --
2010.09-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4635.126,4638.81,"-- that there was going to be no construction adequate, because there was no money."
2010.09-1233,1,21601,donald_specter,,4638.81,4644.577,Right and the State has -- has really not put up the money to construct those new prisons.
2010.09-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4656.602,4657.563,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1233,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,4667.168,4669.741,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, just a few points."
2010.09-1233,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4687.888,4689.561,"I'm sorry, what page was that?"
2010.09-1233,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,4689.561,4702.913,"2085, that is volume 6 of it and it's at that point where the plaintiffs, the intervening plaintiffs say we would like to put on evidence of institutional violations, and Judge Karlton says twice this court has said, we will not receive that evidence."
2010.09-1233,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4726.58,4731.707,I'm sorry; I don't know what the declaration said. Is the actual declaration in the record somewhere?
2010.09-1233,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,4731.707,4734.389,"Yes, I believe the actual declaration is in the record."
2010.09-1233,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4734.389,4734.969,All right.
2010.09-1233,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4734.969,4737.692,"Mr. Phillips, sorry, but I'm on a different subject."
2010.09-1233,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,4745.883,4746.27,Yes.
2010.09-1233,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4750.926,4752.107,That means it's true.
2010.09-1233,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,4752.107,4752.771,We --
