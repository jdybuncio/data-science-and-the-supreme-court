2012.11-184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.487,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-184, Kloeckner v. Solis."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,7.587,10.022,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,69.66,80.035,"Mr. Schnapper, could you clarify what the district court, as you see it, does?"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,90.491,103.299,"With regard to the -- when the case gets to district court, there may be two substantive claims, a discrimination claim and a CSRA claim."
2012.11-184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,152.897,153.563,Mr. Schnapper--
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,153.563,155.163,--but that's a determinative defense.
2012.11-184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,155.163,167.138,"--But the critical point, I gather, is what standard of review the district court will apply to that exhaustion question, or the bottom question, right?"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,181.315,190.003,"When it's come up, Your Honor, it has generally been a question of law, like whether the 30-day rule had applied."
2012.11-184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.711,218.09,"Why don't we take this -- this very case, where the MSPB said that -- that the claim was time barred, so the government would raise it as an affirmative defense."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,218.09,224.594,"And the first question would be whether it's an affirmative defense at all, and our position would be that it is not."
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,242.738,250.209,"Counselor, can I back you up a minute to join the two questions that my colleague posed to you?"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,284.913,285.496,--They're there--
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,285.496,286.446,--that that's--
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,286.446,288.198,"--it's -- yeah, I totally understand the question."
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,288.198,299.506,"--We can then fight about whether the factual issue regarding the timeliness and exhaustion should be subject to one or the other standard of review, but what are the standards of review?"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,299.506,301.106,They -- they are different.
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,301.106,302.042,All right.
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,302.042,305.493,The -- the discrimination claim is dealt with de novo.
2012.11-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,317.148,318.015,"Well, could you tell me what--"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,318.015,318.9,--well established.
2012.11-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,318.9,319.517,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,320.25,322.186,That's what the lower courts have been doing.
2012.11-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.221,326.254,Could you finish your prior answer?
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,327.84,328.623,I doubt it.
2012.11-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.623,336.529,--you started to say that the Civil Service Reform Act made some fundamental change?
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,336.529,337.396,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.183,342.9,Yes.
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,342.9,349.919,"Prior to that, courts were applying the judicially fashioned exhaustion requirements."
2012.11-184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.715,476.619,That's -- you're talking about the discrimination claim.
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,504.853,505.805,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.589,513.558,And then that would take care of the whole thing you discussed before about the affirmative defense and the Government.
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,518.529,519.696,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,531.687,532.289,"Well, what provision--"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,532.289,533.139,--that's what happened here.
2012.11-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,542.062,549.316,--What provision authorizes the filing of anything other than a discrimination claim in district court?
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,550.75,558.237,The statute says “ Cases of discrimination subject to ”--
2012.11-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,558.237,561.725,“ Cases of discrimination ”--
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,561.725,563.175,"""Cases of discrimination subject to 7702. """
2012.11-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,564.677,565.16,--Yes.
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,572.628,574.914,--No.
2012.11-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,599.429,601.247,"Well, I understand that a lot of courts have read it that way."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,622.995,643.324,"Well, the second point you make is really separate from the first, because even if only a discrimination claim is filed, the Government can insert an affirmative defense, and one possible affirmative defense which the Government has repeated asserted successfully is that the appeal to the MSPB was untimely."
2012.11-184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,645.36,651.414,"--Even if you give up your CSRA claim, they can assert that defense?"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,651.414,651.847,Yes.
2012.11-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,670.642,681.866,"I don't understand why you're giving this up, and I don't see -- I also don't see any provision that says that -- that specifies what the standard of review in the district court is for a nondiscrimination claim."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,695.776,704.799,"--Your Honor, that question, of course, isn't here because we haven't asserted a CSRA claim."
2012.11-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,745.376,759.033,"Suppose -- suppose the Civil Service Reform Act had said nothing at all about suits under the Civil Rights Act, under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act and so forth."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,763.503,764.72,Yes.
2012.11-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,767.289,776.728,"So, to prevent you from going to district court under those statutes, you have to find a repealer contained somewhere--"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,776.728,777.478,In that--
2012.11-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.478,778.847,"--in the Civil Service Reform Act, correct?"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,778.847,779.747,--That's exactly right.
2012.11-184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,824.542,827.328,"Could I make sure I understand something that you said, Mr. Schnapper."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,846.936,849.738,"Not -- that's not entirely correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,880.342,883.144,Those time periods relevant to the MSPB?
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,883.144,889.132,--And there are also time periods relevant to filing a complaint at the agency level.
2012.11-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,922.0,929.256,"Well, why isn't that a repealer of what would otherwise be the law under all these civil rights statutes?"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,947.135,951.02,"We don't -- we think not, Your Honor."
2012.11-184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,971.415,972.349,And would that--
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,972.349,974.635,--Congress contemplated you would have forever to do these things.
2012.11-184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,974.635,984.841,--And would that put the employee who has a mixed case in the same position as an employee who has a straight anti-discrimination case?
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,984.841,986.674,Non-mixed case.
2012.11-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1003.986,1010.789,"I've probably led a charmed life, but I've never heard of mixed case until this matter came before us."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1034.288,1037.457,"Well, Your Honor, the -- you have led a charmed life."
2012.11-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1037.457,1038.809,"I mean, I think that helps you."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1038.809,1043.963,I'm not sure how that affects it.
2012.11-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1077.684,1081.569,Can't an employee take a mixed case appeal to the Federal circuit?
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1081.569,1088.491,--You could not take that case to the Federal circuit without waiving your antidiscrimination claim.
2012.11-184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1101.881,1109.052,"Mr. Schnapper, can you explain something about the MSPB's role?"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1147.16,1163.872,"Well, it's our view that once you appeal to the MSPB, and putting aside the unusual situation of people who withdraw the appeal, you then must wait, under the statute, 120 days or until you have a decision."
2012.11-184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1176.096,1178.715,What are -- what are your advantages?
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1190.956,1205.199,What you gain are the rights in Section 7701(c) which are set out on page 3a of the Government's brief.
2012.11-184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1235.118,1236.335,Suppose -- I'm sorry.
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1236.335,1241.372,--The CSRA claim is much more valuable at the MSPB.
2012.11-184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1264.571,1285.65,"So I suppose if you say, I was fired on the basis of race, and the agency says, No, you were fired because you were incompetent, you could take the incompetence claim to the MSPB, and if you win, saying, No, you were perfectly competent, they shouldn't have fired you, you get that relief and you don't need to proceed with the discrimination--"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1285.65,1286.25,Sure.
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1288.602,1309.016,"You argued that you were exceeding the dismissals on the basis of jurisdiction should go to the Federal circuit, but that you were only invoking the exception that procedural dismissals should be permitted to go to the district court or authorized to go."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1311.233,1312.468,"No, no, that was not our distinction."
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1315.068,1321.038,"Yes, but when you argued it below you argued the exception, you didn't argue the jurisdictional rule."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1322.24,1322.74,--Yes.
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1334.047,1336.666,"But it's not the view of the circuit courts, even the courts--"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1336.666,1337.466,--It's not the view of the circuit courts.
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1337.466,1340.701,--Even the courts whose exception you--
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1340.701,1342.903,That is not their view and we think--
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1342.903,1351.176,--Every circuit court unanimously holds that jurisdictional rule dismissals should go only to the Federal circuit.
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1351.176,1351.743,--Right.
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1352.926,1353.376,And you--
2012.11-184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1353.376,1355.061,I'm sorry -- go ahead.
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1355.828,1358.747,--Should you be arguing this before us?
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1358.747,1359.613,"--Well, you don't--"
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1359.613,1361.465,Is this a distinction you should abandon here?
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1361.465,1362.099,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1362.099,1363.651,Or at least ask us not to address?
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1363.651,1367.436,"You don't need to address it, but we think those decisions are wrong."
2012.11-184,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1374.006,1379.244,"Actually the 7512 argument has more legs, I think."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1391.384,1396.919,"--It's somewhat stronger, but there are a couple of reasons why we think this distinction doesn't make sense."
2012.11-184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1457.577,1464.414,"Mr. Schnapper, if I disagree with everything that you just said, I can still rule for you in this case, right?"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1464.414,1466.35,"You can, and you don't need to address what I just said."
2012.11-184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1466.35,1489.048,"Because there does seem to be a good deal of difference between the question, what happens to something that is clearly a mixed case, and alternatively, the question of whether something is a mixed case; that is, whether it includes a claim about an action which the employee may appeal to the MSPB."
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1504.491,1511.545,"Your Honor, you don't need to rule for that -- me on that, but if I could identify another problem before my time runs out."
2012.11-184,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1526.254,1530.892,"Well, that just makes the next case very complicated but it has nothing to do with this case; is that correct?"
2012.11-184,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,1530.892,1531.542,--Right.
2012.11-184,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1553.407,1555.057,"--Thank you, Counsel."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1558.692,1560.727,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1563.429,1568.667,Are you abandoning the jurisdictional procedural distinction as you did in your brief?
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1573.219,1575.921,"That's always been our position, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1584.693,1598.102,"So you are prepared on behalf of the Government to say that if we rule that procedural dismissals can go to the district court, then you -- then the Government will concede that jurisdictional dismissal should as well?"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1598.102,1598.802,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1598.802,1599.969,Under 7512.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1599.969,1601.488,"Again, we don't think any of them should and--"
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1601.488,1610.494,"We don't have to reach that question in this case, but your brief seemed to make the argument that there was no basis for the distinction between procedural and jurisdictional."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1610.494,1626.604,"--I agree that there is no basis for the distinction and part of that is because, as my friend Mr. Schnapper pointed out, there is an EEOC regulation providing that when the board dismisses a case on jurisdictional grounds the case can go back to the agency, the agency can essentially reissue its final decision, and then the plaintiff goes in to district court."
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1707.037,1715.493,"Now, does that mean that it is not a judicially reviewable action if it is thrown out on a procedural ground."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1715.493,1719.029,It means that it's not a judicially reviewable action under 7702.
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1719.029,1720.047,Why is that?
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1735.991,1751.25,"Well, in our view, again, because it uses the phrase “ judicially reviewable action ” under 7702 and that phrase “ judicially reviewable action ” in the whole U.S. Code is only ever used when you are talking about 7702, that -- in our view that's the signal that that's a term of art in this context."
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1762.791,1763.91,Could you say that again?
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1763.91,1765.543,--Yes.
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.543,1766.778,A little more slowly.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1766.778,1767.778,Yes.
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1775.099,1775.801,Okay.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1777.034,1777.518,Yes.
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1777.518,1778.268,"Now, the next--"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1778.268,1783.138,But it does not fall within the term of art “ judicially reviewable action ” under 7702.
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1783.138,1783.788,--Okay.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1794.143,1794.776,Say it again?
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1798.378,1799.297,More slowly.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1814.404,1814.923,That's right.
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1815.84,1816.606,Okay.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1816.606,1817.523,--the exception to exclusive--
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1817.523,1818.208,It's a tough argument.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1818.208,1819.325,--review.
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1846.859,1848.792,Can I ask you a couple questions?
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1848.792,1849.359,Yes.
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1849.359,1855.346,"When the Federal Circuit was created, this language preexisted its creation, correct?"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1855.346,1856.398,Yes.
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1856.398,1870.974,So could you tell me how when Congress was writing 7702 it was creating the system that you are advocating when it had no idea that it would ever create the Federal Circuit?
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1870.974,1871.957,"Well, I have two answers."
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1919.855,1943.254,"That still doesn't answer my question, which is: Assuming there is no Federal Circuit, I have to read the language that exists in 7702 and 7703, and I see judicial review, appealable judicial review, used not in the manner that you're describing."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1943.254,1944.439,"--I disagree, Your Honor."
2012.11-184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1962.567,1982.546,"But, Ms. Harrington, go back to the question that the Chief Justice asked you, because the question was: Should we read “ judicially reviewable action ” as something different from action subject to judicial review, which is how you would normally read that language, as something different from just final agency action that you can take to a court."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1997.74,2007.763,"--Well, you look at 7702, and let me just say, even if you disagree with us that it's a term of art, it's hard to disagree with the fact that it has to be a judicially reviewable action under 7702."
2012.11-184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2010.465,2017.885,"Yes, it has to be an action that -- you know, the MSPB is done and now you have a certain number of days to take it to a court."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2020.904,2021.289,But--
2012.11-184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2021.289,2037.798,"But you say no, it really, you know, it includes some kinds of decisions and not other kinds of decisions and the effect of that is that it's really a switch as to which court you get to take the action to, which is a very counterintuitive way to read this language."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2051.375,2051.875,--Yes.
2012.11-184,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2104.76,2126.423,"Why doesn't the language that Justice Kagan referred to, the requirement that the board within 120 days decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action, mean that the board has to dispose of both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action, not that it must actually adjudicate those two issues?"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2137.481,2138.031,No.
2012.11-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.625,2205.758,"You don't have to read it that way, do you?"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2246.452,2251.404,But I think normally when a court dismisses a case based on timeliness you don't think of it as deciding the issue.
2012.11-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.404,2252.837,"Oh, well, I see."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2358.737,2360.356,That would certainly be simpler.
2012.11-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2363.224,2363.824,"Oh, no, no."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2380.77,2390.142,But what we're trying to do is figure out how much of an exception Congress wanted to create to the exclusive -- to the Federal circuit's exclusive jurisdiction to review MSPB decisions.
2012.11-184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2398.095,2398.647,I'm sorry.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2398.647,2398.881,I'm sorry.
2012.11-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2444.176,2466.542,"Ms. Harrington, may I just clarify that if -- if the case goes to the MSPB, and the MS -- the Federal circuit, the Federal circuit agrees with the MSPB that this was untimely filed, that's the end of the case, the discrimination claims would never be heard then."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2466.542,2475.815,"I mean, the plaintiffs could then file a suit in district court and seek equitable tolling for having missed the deadline to file from the date of the final agency decision."
2012.11-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2482.551,2488.039,"So if the Plaintiff then goes to the district court, then what position does the government take?"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2488.039,2488.955,It depends on the case.
2012.11-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2507.767,2532.982,"Mr. Schnapper told us in his brief, and he repeated it this morning, that the MSPB and the EEOC disagree with your reading of the statute, that they think that the so-called mixed case goes to the district court."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2532.982,2535.334,I don't think that's correct.
2012.11-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2541.238,2550.444,"Well, didn't -- in the Ballentine case, didn't the MSPB take the position that it didn't go to the Federal circuit?"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2550.444,2553.796,"--That was our position, you know, I think it was 30 years ago now."
2012.11-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2559.549,2571.023,"And so you -- are you -- are you telling us that the position you're representing on behalf of the government is the position that the MSPB would take today, is the position that the EEOC would take today?"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2571.023,2571.49,--Yes.
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2576.494,2579.446,"Counsel, getting back to judicially reviewable--"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2579.446,2580.146,Yes.
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2580.146,2592.037,"--even if I accept your argument that that's not the same as subject to judicial review, isn't it an odd backhanded way to get to your position?"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2604.226,2605.295,"Well, but some--"
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2605.295,2612.699,"And then you say that judicial reviewability is the key linchpin that bases your argument, when it's really just in a sentence about notice."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2612.699,2619.019,--But it's in a provision that's describing the exception to the general rule that's set out in 7703.
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2656.909,2672.919,"Well, yes, that's where the phrase comes in, but it does seem an odd way to establish that that is the critical element that tells you which provisions you can take forward when it just says your time is 30 days after you get notice of judicial review."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2672.919,2673.605,Under--
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2673.605,2680.675,"And here the government says, aha, judicial review, we think that does not mean subject to judicial review."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2683.627,2684.611,--So even if you throw out the term of art--
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2684.611,2685.496,Yes.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2685.496,2698.72,"--per our argument, and all you look at is the last two words of that sentence, which is Section 7702, you still have to look at 7702 and figure out when Congress told you that a final board decision could be subject to judicial review."
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2718.715,2719.182,As of.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2724.702,2725.152,--Right.
2012.11-184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2748.384,2755.657,"Ms. Harrington, would you agree that this is a remarkably strange way of Congress trying to accomplish this objective?"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2800.935,2805.071,"I mean, I'm not going to resist the idea that the CSRA is very complicated."
2012.11-184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2867.377,2879.118,"But you're not -- the Federal circuit didn't exist at the time that these statutes were written, so what -- you know, really, it would have been taken to the various courts of appeals, and you wouldn't have gotten that uniformity anyway."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2879.118,2889.541,"Right, but you would have had more uniformity than you would have had if the cases had continued to go to the district court, which is what -- which is what was happening before the CSRA, and Congress specifically wanted to stop that process."
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2889.541,2903.05,"You don't have a quarrel with your opposing counsel's position that once the Board decides the CSRA claim and the discrimination claim, the district court reviews both?"
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2903.05,2904.166,Yes.
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2904.166,2907.418,"Justice Alito was questioning that, but you don't quarrel with that."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2907.418,2908.304,We don't quarrel with it.
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2908.304,2912.156,So the lack of uniformity is inherent in this structure.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2915.524,2916.81,No--
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2916.81,2919.343,--that you say deserves more uniformity.
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2919.343,2931.451,"--It is true that a small range of procedural issues governing the board's procedures might be heard in district court, but it is truly a very small universe of issues bordering on non-existent, and let me explain why."
2012.11-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2980.3,2986.637,Is there anything you want to say on the question of which is worse?
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3047.628,3049.647,--Absolutely.
2012.11-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3049.647,3051.097,--Have we any way of knowing?
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3051.097,3053.932,"I mean, I think Congress made the determination."
2012.11-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3053.932,3065.037,"--going back to the language, and so far, in my hypothetical anyway, I think the language at best might be read, that word “ issue ”, the way you say, but need not be."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3065.037,3075.111,"But I think you can resolve the ambiguity in the use of the word “ issue ” by looking at the rest of (a)(3), which again ties the decision under (a)(1) to reviewability by the EEOC."
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3087.403,3111.518,"I have a problem, because to accept your reading is to say that judicially reviewable action differs between 770 -- differs between 7702 and the escape hatch, because the only way the escape hatch can work, it, too, cross-references 7702 in the same way that the provisions you are relying on do."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3123.909,3125.409,But not because--
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3125.409,3139.252,"It seems to me that if you concede that there is an absurd result in applying your interpretation to the escape hatch, by definition, your meaning can't be ascribable to that phrase."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3139.252,3146.755,"--Well, so just to be clear, we think the phrase “ judicially reviewable action ” should be given the same meaning in section (e) that it is given elsewhere in 7702."
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3146.755,3147.357,So if the board--
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3147.357,3147.807,Our view is--
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3147.807,3152.076,--So when does the time frames of the escape hatch commence--
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3152.076,3152.509,--So--
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3152.509,3154.928,--if the board hasn't rendered any decision on anything?
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3154.928,3155.445,--Exactly.
2012.11-184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3164.986,3184.947,"Right, but Justice Sotomayor is right, that when you define “ judicially reviewable action ” in your way, then 7702(e)(1)(B) becomes nonsensical and you have to save it by inserting additional language, by saying, you know, “ and other ” -- “ and other kinds of action ”."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3184.947,3191.803,"No, it only becomes nonsensical if you think it should apply to cases that are no longer pending before the board under section 7702."
2012.11-184,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3208.813,3216.669,"Well, it wouldn't make sense, but it's what the language would command if “ judicially reviewable action ” means what you say “ judicially reviewable means ”."
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3216.669,3220.887,It is true that our commonsense gloss on the statute is not found in the text of the statute.
2012.11-184,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3236.498,3241.634,You still have an exhaustion argument to raise if we were to send this to the district court?
2012.11-184,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3241.634,3247.621,"Well, we raised an exhaustion argument as an alternative ground before the district court."
2012.11-184,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3302.255,3303.857,"Thank you, Ms. Harrington."
2012.11-184,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3306.225,3308.675,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
