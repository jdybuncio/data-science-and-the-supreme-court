1965.256,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,7.084,"United States, Appellant, versus John W. Cook."
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,22.245,25.228,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.256,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,659.9,661.32,What are you quoting from Mister?
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,661.32,669.932,"I'm quoting from United States against A & P Trucking Company, Your Honor at 358 U.S."
1965.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,739.722,752.156,"But tell me, Mr. Feit, I gather this all comes down to an argument that the word modifying common carriers should be in effect read out of the statute, doesn't it?"
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,752.156,761.096,"No, I think our position is that the employee would have to be an employee of any firm, association, or corporation."
1965.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,768.883,773.119,"Well, 409 (a) (5) was employee of any carrier."
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,773.119,774.186,409 (a) (5) was an --
1965.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,774.186,780.56,660 now is an employee of such a common carrier.
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,780.56,781.266,Right.
1965.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,781.266,783.651,"Now, going back to firm, association, or --"
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,783.651,784.974,"Firm, association or corporation --"
1965.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,784.974,790.95,"Your argument is not that we should ignore the word such, but rather should read the firm, the word “firm”?"
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,790.95,812.361,"Read firm and the words in combination as in indicating a congressional intent to reach the business of interstate carriage, be -- an ongoing carrier business rather than Congress having any concern with the internal structure of the business or the way a carrier decides to operate his business."
1965.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,812.361,819.068,"Now, I appreciate it -- wouldn't appear on the face if this is only under your indictment, isn't it?"
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,819.554,820.206,Yes.
1965.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,820.206,821.605,I'm just wondering.
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,836.548,841.208,"As far as I know, I do not know of any such requirement, there may be one."
1965.256,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,878.827,884.129,"But in that, an employee -- if he is an employee of an individual Tolbert Hawkins, for instance, isn't he?"
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,884.129,885.237,Yes.
1965.256,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,893.359,897.092,So Hawkins apparently has a license from ICC --
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,897.092,901.489,Hakwins has a -- a registration certificate had been filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission.
1965.256,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,901.489,903.215,In the name of Tolbert Hawkins?
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,903.215,904.86,In the name of Tolbert Hawkins.
1965.256,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,904.86,910.209,"Well, he is doing business as, wouldn't be a firm at all, was it?"
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,917.352,927.53,"Well, as I said to Mr. Justice Brennan, I did not know whether any specific documents had to be filed with respect to whether he was doing business as a firm."
1965.256,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,955.109,958.058,Do you say he would be come on the firm?
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,958.058,965.068,"Yes, and I might -- no, this isn't -- this is not set out in the indictment."
1965.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,993.067,999.131,"If that's so, they didn't need the word association or corporation, did they?"
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,999.131,1005.886,"Well, this statute didn't come out full blown and born in 1948, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1005.886,1006.685,"Now, this is the one that's --"
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1006.685,1006.843,It was a --
1965.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1006.843,1008.028,-- derived from the executive (Voice Overlap) --
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1008.028,1019.704,"Yes, this derived from the Clayton Act provision which is I pointed out is essentially concerned with rail -- embezzlement of railroads, there's no question about that."
1965.256,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1040.837,1058.038,"And I gather we get nothing from the legislative history when they took over 409 (a) (5), they used the identical language except that they inserted the word such to modify common carrier."
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1058.038,1064.006,"Yes, and down further in the statute, they refer to such firm, association or corporation again."
1965.256,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1086.573,1091.247,We had a bit -- do we have any judicial interpretation of the word “firm”?
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1092.302,1102.233,"Well, I think generally speaking, I think its fair and appellee agrees, I -- a firm has generally been defined as the equivalent of a partnership."
1965.256,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1108.237,1108.78,As what?
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1108.78,1123.45,"As synonymous with company, and the word “company” there are numerous decision under specific statutes with the word company has been defined to include an individual."
1965.256,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1243.59,1246.839,"You are going to make a motion, will you Mr. Feit."
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1246.839,1246.993,"Oh, I'm sorry Your Honor, I had --"
1965.256,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1246.993,1248.855,(Voice Overlap)
1965.256,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1248.855,1251.835,I thought I was to make it at the outset of the argument.
1965.256,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1263.906,1269.822,Motion is granted.
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1272.685,1279.21,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1348.792,1350.383,"Mr. Peebles, may I interrupt this one --"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1350.383,1351.002,Yes sir.
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1351.002,1357.015,-- whether the indictment indicated where -- in what state does that collection referred?
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1357.015,1358.518,"I believe in the State of Tennessee, if Your Honor please --"
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1358.518,1365.537,"-- it said -- do I take it that therefore, it would be I suppose, subject to constitution under Tennessee law?"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1365.537,1370.903,That's correct Your Honor.
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1370.903,1372.152,Has there been any prosecution?
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1373.983,1378.486,"Your Honor, I don't know because I've never seen the defendant since he was dismissed."
1965.256,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1459.267,1460.903,"The revisers did that, you mean?"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1460.903,1466.196,That's correct.
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1521.128,1531.805,"And this I take it, even if accidental, not intended by the revisers, all because of the principle of strict construction of criminal statute."
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1531.805,1534.829,"I don't think necessarily so, if Your Honor please."
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1568.709,1583.837,"But from what -- from what in the legislative history, since this was a revision and a merger of the two sections, can there be drawn any inference that Congress intended to limit the employee statute -- was that 409 (a) something?"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1583.837,1594.449,"If Your Honor please, I think this, number one, from the very action which Congress took in substituting the language."
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1610.202,1615.263,"Well, I take it, they did that only because they approved the revision."
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1620.783,1621.661,Probably not.
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1621.661,1626.593,Just accepted the proposal of the revisers that these two statutes would be merged into this one statute.
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1626.593,1629.304,I think that's probably true.
1965.256,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1629.304,1646.494,"Mr. Peebles, suppose that Congress, in a shorthand way had left out the corporation and association and they'd just said firm, will you take that -- will it prevent them from prosecuting a corporation officer?"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1646.494,1647.637,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1965.256,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1647.637,1653.211,"No, why do you say that in that case and the -- and not in the case we have here?"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1653.211,1659.074,I would not disagree at all that firm could fairly be read to include a corporation.
1965.256,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1810.703,1812.927,"Mr. Peebles, may I get your comment on this --"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1812.927,1813.943,Yes Mr. Justice.
1965.256,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1813.943,1826.698,"-- possibility, assuming it is a possibility, that is to say that the case may not turn on the construction of the word “firm.”"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1846.173,1847.043,"Yes, Your Honor, I think so --"
1965.256,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1847.043,1881.164,"That is -- that is perhaps it could be said that -- in that the second phrase or whoever being an employee of such common carrier really means whoever being an employee of a common carrier engaged in commerce, and that such does not relate back to firm, association, or corporation but relates back to engaged in commerce."
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1897.789,1901.724,"I agree, if Your Honor please, that that is possible to do."
1965.256,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1934.444,1987.951,"I noticed in the balance of the statute, say -- an employee of such common carrier, an employee riding in or upon in a railroad car, and then skip, moving interstate commerce, embezzles, etcetera, then you follow it down and then again, they use a formula, embezzles, etcetera, assets of such firm, association, or corporation arising from -- arising or accruing from, or used in such commerce, which seems to be a reference to -- back to the phrase interstate commerce."
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,1995.697,2011.321,"Well again, I don't know if I've answered the Court's question but I -- it just seems to me that a fair reading of the statute would require that such carrier, such common carrier makes reference back to firm, association, or corporation --"
1965.256,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2011.321,2011.59,Yes.
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2011.59,2012.521,-- and not --
1965.256,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2012.521,2028.449,"There's nothing whatever in the substance of legislative history, I take it, that it indicates a specific intent on the part of Congress to narrow the old thrust of 409 (a) (5)."
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2028.449,2031.125,"I can find nothing on that, if Your Honor please."
1965.256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2085.293,2093.58,Or isn't the best guess that the reason was negligent draftsmanship?
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2093.58,2097.881,"My guess is, may it please the Court, is that this is an omission."
1965.256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2097.881,2098.261,An inadvertent --
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2098.261,2098.816,That's the best --
1965.256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2098.816,2101.202,-- inadvertent or negligent omission or (Voice Overlap) --
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2101.202,2104.844,I think that's the most logical explanation frankly.
1965.256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2108.822,2109.895,Right.
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2109.895,2118.998,Congress could -- it's been 15 years since the Schmokey case made -- decided this case or decided this same issue.
1965.256,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2145.745,2157.78,"Of course the theory is that you don't attach similar responsibility unless the fellow reads the -- he understands that he's doing something that's proscribed as right, isn't it?"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2157.78,2158.817,That's correct.
1965.256,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2158.817,2163.904,This fellow evidently used -- taking his money was proscribed --
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2163.904,2164.039,That's correct --
1965.256,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2164.039,2166.644,"-- he isn't wrong, is he?"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2166.644,2168.511,"I'm certain he knew it was wrong, if Your Honor please."
1965.256,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2170.788,2172.747,Yes.
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2179.207,2179.302,I don't --
1965.256,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2179.302,2188.434,(Inaudible) is not too vague?
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2188.434,2188.609,I'm not familiar with that case.
1965.256,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2188.609,2193.275,(Inaudible)
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2193.275,2199.438,"Well, I agree that this statute is vague."
1965.256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.954,2226.71,What possible purpose do you suppose Congress might have had in the -- if it really intended to exclude in the -- the individual?
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2226.71,2234.443,"The only logical purpose and it does not hold true in all cases if Your Honor please, that I could think of is this."
1965.256,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2288.691,2290.996,Or a small embezzlement from a big company?
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2290.996,2292.863,That's correct.
1965.256,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2292.863,2304.657,"Of course sometimes, it might not be able to prove just to -- where the intent occurred? Being it's a state carrier, and I suppose that's one reason Congress (Inaudible) isn't it?"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2304.657,2307.124,"I think that is true, if Your Honor please."
1965.256,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2307.124,2316.082,"So, while here you say that -- and that (Inaudible) Tennessee that that wasn't the problem."
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2333.885,2334.369,Well --
1965.256,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2334.369,2337.95,He was having a protection as the only carrier (Inaudible).
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2337.95,2342.758,"May it please the Court, I don't -- I'm not sure that that's necessarily true."
1965.256,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2396.999,2400.143,How would you prove legislative (Inaudible)?
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2400.143,2401.222,I beg your pardon Your Honor.
1965.256,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2401.222,2407.484,How would you prove -- assume this is a small operator and (Inaudible)
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2413.124,2416.261,"Well, there was -- there's no question that it would be difficult to prove."
1965.256,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2416.261,2419.4,You don't have to prove that as a federal offense.
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2425.563,2426.298,That's true.
1965.256,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2427.22,2439.366,"The difficulty -- in fact in this case, (Inaudible)if he proves that he took the money in Tennessee, the -- state prosecution were involved, wasn't it?"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2439.366,2444.464,That's correct.
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2444.464,2452.006,I'd see this revision Mr. Peebles was made -- how many years before Schmokey was decided?
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2452.006,2453.378,"I believe, two years."
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2453.378,2453.886,Two years?
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2453.886,2455.665,I believe the revision is from 1948.
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2458.601,2464.998,"And your argument is that Congress didn't agree, they should have --"
1965.256,1,43174,thomas_h_peebles_iii,,2464.998,2465.048,That --
1965.256,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2465.048,2467.39,-- put the word person back or something.
