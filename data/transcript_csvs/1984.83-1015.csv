1984.83-1015,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,96.478,"Mr. Derfner, I think you may proceed with a reduced audience here."
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,96.478,98.847,Thank you.
1984.83-1015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.667,341.804,"It was at least known then, though, that there would have to be a special election, wasn't it?"
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,341.804,351.992,"It was known that... it would have been known that if the county, if the state wanted to proceed with the enforcement of Act 549, they would have to have an election at some point."
1984.83-1015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.682,361.382,"Well, do you think it was very likely they would wait two years?"
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,361.382,362.917,I don't know.
1984.83-1015,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,504.41,507.945,Let me get your reaction.
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,507.945,508.562,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-1015,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,508.562,514.866,"In setting the time, what are the factors that could be used for or against?"
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,528.859,529.209,Okay.
1984.83-1015,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.125,583.91,So that a Section 5 inquiry would be a neutral eye cast on that?
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,583.91,593.718,"Yes, although in this case the Section 5 inquiry I would think would also look at the conditions precedent to the election, specifically, what is the filing period?"
1984.83-1015,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.735,827.02,May I ask just one question?
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,827.02,827.47,Yes.
1984.83-1015,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.47,837.992,"Supposing the Attorney General had cleared the Act 549 in October, would you make the same argument?"
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,837.992,874.784,"Yes, I think I would, Justice Stevens, because while it is true that there have been a number of instances in which filing periods or other situations have gone forward without somebody suing them, I think the law is clear that an act may not be enforced, and what you have is citizens who read the that Voting Rights Act says nothing can be enforced until it is precleared, and if a citizen is entitled to rely on the law, then I think a citizen should not be forced to the choice of going to file at a time when the law has not been precleared."
1984.83-1015,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.734,886.509,"But, see, presumably if that had happened, the Attorney General would have known the filing date, and he was advised that the procedure was followed that you did follow, that you told them to register, to file under both statutes."
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,886.509,893.929,"--We don't know... no, with all due respect, Justice Stevens, there is nothing in the record to show what the Attorney General was advised of in the reconsideration."
1984.83-1015,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,908.338,909.238,Let me change my hypothetical.
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,922.598,924.215,--I think he shouldn't do that.
1984.83-1015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,949.582,950.999,"Oh, it does."
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,951.582,952.799,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,952.799,960.869,Was evidence submitted before the District Court about the premature removal of the county superintendent?
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,960.869,962.405,"Justice O'Connor, no."
1984.83-1015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,984.968,986.086,Mm-hmm.
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,995.459,1003.915,"What was precleared was the abolition of the position as of this coming June, and so that it in fact, if the Court were to decide the question, it would be moot as of June."
1984.83-1015,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1015.454,1017.488,So what is your suggestion that we do?
1984.83-1015,0,15872,armand_derfner,,1017.488,1029.363,"--My suggestion, frankly, is that we are... I would prefer not to pursue that portion of the appeal at this stage, and if the Court would like, I might even be, if you thought it appropriate, I could dismiss that portion of the appeal."
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1047.842,1050.71,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1015,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.214,1493.082,"You don't really think it is mutually acceptable, do you?"
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1493.082,1496.117,"I think for the most part it is, Justice White."
1984.83-1015,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1505.556,1514.729,"Mr. Strauss, approximately how many applications for preclearance are now received by the Attorney General per week?"
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1514.729,1518.883,"I can't do the arithmetic that quickly, Justice Powell."
1984.83-1015,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1518.883,1520.016,How many were received last year?
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1520.016,1522.768,There were 8600 in the first six months of this year.
1984.83-1015,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1522.768,1523.953,8600?
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1523.953,1524.453,That's right.
1984.83-1015,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1524.453,1526.57,How many is that per working day?
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1526.57,1531.191,"That also, that's even a harder arithmetical problem, Justice Powell."
1984.83-1015,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1531.607,1532.893,It keeps the Attorney General busy?
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1532.893,1538.194,"Well, not all of these reach the Attorney General, or even the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division."
1984.83-1015,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1538.194,1539.929,The statute says the Attorney General.
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1539.929,1543.414,"Well, he has delegated his authority pursuant to the statute to the Assistant Attorney General."
1984.83-1015,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1544.95,1546.266,"Well, may I ask you just one other question?"
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1552.187,1553.722,--I believe the number is increasing slightly.
1984.83-1015,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1553.722,1554.572,That's my impression.
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1554.572,1555.806,"Yes, I think that's right."
1984.83-1015,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1611.726,1612.276,Mr. Strauss--
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1618.998,1622.116,I don't think any of them are pro forma in the sense that they are given no review.
1984.83-1015,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1622.116,1632.389,"Well, I didn't mean... a lot f things are pro forma which get a review, but that they are in clear compliance, and they go back."
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1636.893,1640.745,"My impression is that that is so, Mr. Chief Justice, a substantial proportion."
1984.83-1015,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1640.745,1648.284,"Mr. Strauss, would you regard 1984 as an atypical year because this is an election year?"
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1648.284,1650.468,"No, my impression is that it is not an atypical year."
1984.83-1015,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1650.468,1654.086,Do you anticipate 8600 more the first six months of '85?
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1654.086,1656.788,We have no reason to think otherwise.
1984.83-1015,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.788,1659.122,So 40 a day?
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1659.122,1660.307,Is that right?
1984.83-1015,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.307,1661.59,Whatever it is.
1984.83-1015,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1664.942,1668.513,"No, I don't know the answer to that."
1984.83-1015,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1672.214,1673.681,Ms. Ashworth?
1984.83-1015,2,42363,treva_g_ashworth,,1673.681,1676.666,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1015,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2014.203,2018.673,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Derfner or Mr. Strauss?"
1984.83-1015,3,15872,armand_derfner,,2018.673,2024.844,I have a point or two.
1984.83-1015,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2048.026,2048.776,"Thank you, counsel."
