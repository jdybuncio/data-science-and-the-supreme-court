1992.91-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.308,"We'll hear argument next in number 91-1671, William J. Mertens v. Hewitt Associates."
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,64.744,67.746,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1671,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,243.775,254.624,"If there were a suit under State law... and I think this question relates on all three of the points you want to bring up, or at least it... it gives me an initial grasp of the case."
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,259.466,262.729,"Well, in fact we did raise a claim under State law."
1992.91-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.164,309.248,"Mr. Sigman, what provision of ERISA did the respondent violate?"
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,309.248,324.01,"We contend that the respondent, Hewitt, violated... that... that the violation involved was the violation of the fiduciaries to adequately fund the plan."
1992.91-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.126,342.15,And what's the section of ERISA that the fiduciary violated?
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,343.292,345.171,"That would be section 404 and 409, Your Honor."
1992.91-1671,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,345.171,347.643,404 and 409?
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,347.643,347.883,Right.
1992.91-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.203,377.554,Yes.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,391.441,401.459,"I would say that damages, for example, for emotional distress would be excluded from that... by that term."
1992.91-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.459,405.022,"Well, that's simply because there's... that doesn't go to the relief, it goes to where there's a cause of action, doesn't it?"
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,405.022,407.252,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.252,414.398,What... what relief for an available cause of action is excluded by... by putting in the term equitable?
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,426.006,427.315,To redress.
1992.91-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.955,438.374,"--To... but... but to redress a breach of fiduciary duty since that breach would be sued for in a court of equity, and therefore any relief provided would be equitable relief."
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,440.074,448.179,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that the... that the limitation is, first, there must be a violation."
1992.91-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.455,462.16,"Well, tell me what remedy would otherwise be available but for this adjective equitable?"
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,462.16,471.586,"--Well, in this case we'd say make-whole relief, and we say that make-whole relief is encompassed within the adjective, within the term equitable relief, Your Honor."
1992.91-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.586,474.558,"Yes, so... so you might as well have dropped the adjective."
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,474.558,482.622,"Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, because equitable relief traditionally has encompassed make-whole relief in situations such as this."
1992.91-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.023,512.365,This is not make-whole relief.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,514.556,516.969,--We are saying that make-whole relief is available.
1992.91-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.969,518.419,So all relief is available.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,523.432,535.389,"Well, we're saying what would not be available would be relief available to the participants of the plan for the emotional injuries that they've suffered as a result of having their pension reduced so substantially, that that would be excluded, for example, Your Honor."
1992.91-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.91,536.14,Not because--
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,536.14,537.85,--That punitive damages would be excluded.
1992.91-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.85,538.652,--Well.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,538.652,545.126,We're saying that the limitation imposed is--
1992.91-1671,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,545.126,552.731,"But they're excluded not... not because of the... the manner of relief, but because there... there's no cause of action for them."
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,586.824,587.065,--Yes.
1992.91-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.596,593.94,"And it... it says ""any other appropriate relief"", doesn't it?"
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,593.94,594.21,--No.
1992.91-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.715,602.516,So it's--
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,602.516,603.097,On my part.
1992.91-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.097,604.857,--Still is equitable relief.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,604.857,605.397,"Yes, yes."
1992.91-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.573,616.915,"Well, that's interesting."
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,623.85,625.67,I'm sorry to disappoint the Court.
1992.91-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,722.485,735.285,"Let... let me ask you, Mr. Sigman, if I may, section 409(a) talks about the liability of... of a fiduciary."
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,736.474,736.815,That's correct.
1992.91-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,736.815,745.83,"And as to him, a court can offer... can order... he is subject to such equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate."
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,745.83,746.721,That's correct.
1992.91-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,752.325,752.615,Well--
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,752.615,756.018,Because the... at the beginning of the section it says
1992.91-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,761.291,762.471,--And--
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,762.471,764.133,"""And to restore to such plan any profits-- """
1992.91-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.133,767.536,--But it's... it's phrased in the... in the disjunctive there.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,769.086,770.878,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1992.91-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,770.878,786.55,"And then 502(a), section (1)(3), if the civil action brought by a participant benefit a fiduciary, that can be brought to obtain other appropriate equitable relief."
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,786.55,787.489,That's correct.
1992.91-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.489,795.954,"So that in one... in 509 it talks about equitable or remedial relief, then this section talks about appropriate equitable relief."
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,800.508,804.94,I would say that the statute could have been more carefully crafted.
1992.91-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,813.566,816.668,It just sounds like someone was talking off the top of their head that had been to first year law school.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,816.668,821.232,It sounds... I believe that it's a redundant phrase.
1992.91-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.496,844.87,May I just ask one question before you go on to the other argument?
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,856.878,858.148,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.148,863.81,And is the relief that you're asking for that those individuals should pay the amount of the underfunding into the plan?
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,863.81,868.835,"Actually, it... it could go beyond just the amount of the underfunding into the plan."
1992.91-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.802,883.515,What are we talking about in dollars?
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,883.515,889.957,"Well, it's not in the record, Your Honor, but in terms of the out-of-pocket loss which my clients have suffered--"
1992.91-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,889.957,890.728,Not... not the individuals.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,892.471,898.863,"--Well, because the PBGC has taken over the plan, the whole group has not suffered economic loss."
1992.91-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,912.052,916.587,But doesn't the PBGC have a subrogation claim against the actuary here?
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,916.587,918.978,--The PBGC is in the litigation but it did not appeal.
1992.91-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.889,928.623,"Well theoretically, I would think, they would be entitled... don't they stand in the shoes of the... of the plan?"
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,928.623,931.605,"--Well, the PBGC is now the statutory trustee of the plan."
1992.91-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.958,946.307,"What I'm trying to find out, if you can tell me just in rough figures, is by how much was the plan underfunded, which I suppose would measure the aggregate potential liability in this kind of a lawsuit?"
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,946.307,958.842,"Once again, it's not in the record, but the best answer I can give you is that in the context of the litigation, the PBGC produced what it called a termination report, indicating that the losses to the plan were in excess of $50 million."
1992.91-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.842,959.663,$50 million.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,959.663,960.084,That's correct.
1992.91-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.705,964.796,And the actuary would be liable for that amount if your theory is correct.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,964.796,967.268,--Jointly and severally liable with the fiduciaries.
1992.91-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.268,970.4,"With the... and all of whom are individuals, right?"
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,970.4,971.462,Correct.
1992.91-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.425,1071.436,Hold it a second.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,1074.168,1075.39,I'm sorry?
1992.91-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.39,1078.612,Which secretary are we talking about?
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,1078.612,1079.113,Secretary of Labor.
1992.91-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.113,1080.555,Secretary of Labor.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,1080.555,1081.344,"Correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.344,1085.908,And he is permitted to bring... bring the kind of a suit that--
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,1085.908,1086.509,Exactly.
1992.91-1671,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.509,1087.959,--We're talking about.
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,1087.959,1095.555,"The Secretary is authorized under section 502(a)(5), and 502(a)(5) has the identical language as 502(a)(3)."
1992.91-1671,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1108.081,1111.434,"But your opponent doesn't agree the Secretary has a claim, does he?"
1992.91-1671,0,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,1111.434,1112.255,Correct.
1992.91-1671,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.825,1115.968,"Thank you, Mr. Sigman."
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1118.44,1131.688,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1175.337,1184.621,"Mr. Mann, if you go to the subsection immediately before the one you're talking about, section 502(a)(1)(2), I guess, is where it talks about"
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1193.487,1198.131,"1109... I'm looking at the appendix to our brief, which is page la to the appendix of our brief."
1992.91-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1198.131,1198.853,That's what I'm looking at.
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1198.853,1199.631,Okay.
1992.91-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1231.204,1231.494,Well--
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1231.494,1232.874,--The provision at issue here.
1992.91-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1232.874,1239.409,"--Yes, but then 502(a)(2) speaks simply about appropriate relief without using the term equitable."
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1251.456,1252.077,That--
1992.91-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.077,1254.108,And then in (3) we have appropriate equitable relief.
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1255.888,1256.77,"--No, no."
1992.91-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1297.096,1302.17,What does remedial relief mean that the word relief by itself wouldn't mean?
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1302.17,1307.035,"Well, I... I share your view that remedial relief is... remedial is probably not the best word."
1992.91-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1318.473,1318.893,It means relief.
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1318.893,1330.283,"But to make sense out of the statute, it seems to me that we should assume that when Congress says equitable in one place and equitable or remedial next to it, that we have to find some meaning of the word remedial."
1992.91-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1332.394,1333.906,You're just kind of throwing up your hands.
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1333.906,1343.189,"--Well, no, but I mean the most... the most obvious meaning of... of the word in context is those things that are not equitable, which is the legal relief described in the restatement."
1992.91-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.902,1390.781,What... what do you... what do you refer to when you say you... legal relief does not mean to you money damages; money damages against the fiduciary is not legal relief?
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1390.781,1394.053,"Ordinarily, money damages are legal relief."
1992.91-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1409.134,1409.564,Right.
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1414.787,1417.09,The... the restatement describes two types of legal relief.
1992.91-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.978,1445.688,"Well, but that's no longer available."
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1448.54,1454.975,"--But if the... but if the trustee refuses to give him the property, before ERISA was passed he would have a lawsuit to get the property."
1992.91-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.134,1457.476,"It's not a lawsuit under the trust, however."
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1460.458,1462.411,--That... that's... that is exactly right.
1992.91-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1463.48,1464.461,"Okay, what's... what's the second one?"
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1464.461,1466.722,--The second... the second one is actually quite similar.
1992.91-1671,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1474.129,1483.715,If the thing... but what was the common law legal remedy for breach of fiduciary duties such as... as alleged in this case?
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1483.715,1494.091,There... you... you would have an action... in the restatement it's under section 199(c) and it's an action... an action which actually uses words very similar to section 502(a)(3).
1992.91-1671,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.856,1625.986,"Well, can't the Secretary bring a suit?"
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1625.986,1634.792,"The Secretary can bring a suit, but those... but those... that suit, under section 502(a)(5), is also for appropriate equitable relief."
1992.91-1671,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.573,1647.802,"Well, I know, but just because a beneficiary couldn't sue him or herself doesn't mean that he or she is without a remedy."
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1647.802,1648.142,--No.
1992.91-1671,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.005,1650.305,Isn't that right?
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1650.305,1653.926,"Well, just because the Secretary can sue doesn't mean the individual is without a remedy."
1992.91-1671,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.409,1659.318,"That's a different argument, yeah."
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1659.318,1660.079,"Well, I... I understand."
1992.91-1671,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.079,1660.31,Right.
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1660.31,1666.414,But respondents have conceded that... that persons other than fiduciaries can be sued under section 502(a)(3).
1992.91-1671,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.078,1674.048,May I just ask one thing to be sure I'm right?
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1686.427,1687.799,It's... it's section 404.
1992.91-1671,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.99,1693.473,404 is what is the... is the duty-creating section that was violated.
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1693.473,1693.884,--Right.
1992.91-1671,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.674,1701.095,That is only a duty on the fiduciaries.
1992.91-1671,1,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1722.06,1722.571,--Okay.
1992.91-1671,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.041,1768.711,"Thank you, Mr. Mann."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,1771.325,1782.672,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1837.195,1846.903,"Well, do you say it never... it never includes money... it never includes a remedy which... which is... is a recovery of money."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,1846.903,1849.354,"--No, I do not say that, Justice White."
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.354,1851.895,"So... so you're going on damages, dama--"
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,1851.895,1853.187,Money damages.
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1853.187,1853.708,--Well--
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,1853.708,1854.437,And--
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.437,1860.671,--Can you get... but you can get a money judgment on... in equity.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,1860.671,1864.655,"--You can get a money judgment in equity, Justice White."
1992.91-1671,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.04,1910.066,"You're saying, in essence, that the word equitable relief does not mean all relief that a court of equity in these circumstances could give."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,1910.066,1911.365,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1671,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.365,1920.732,"That there's a difference between equitable relief and the relief which a trust... court supervising a trust, which happens to be a court of equity, can provide."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,1920.732,1922.611,That's absolutely correct.
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1922.611,1930.127,"Well, do you think you can find in ERISA an intention to narrow the meaning of, quote, equitable relief, unquote?"
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,1930.127,1930.478,Yes.
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.671,1998.973,Who... who can sue to enforce 409?
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,1998.973,2004.789,"Plan participants and fiduciaries, as well as the Secretary of Labor."
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2004.789,2008.64,Under... under what provision does the Secretary of Labor sue?
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2008.64,2010.831,Under section 502(a)(2).
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.602,2029.654,"And what about section (5), (a)(5)?"
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2029.654,2044.884,"Section (a)(5) gives the Secretary of Labor the right to seek injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief, just as section 502(a)(3) gives plan participants the right to seek injunctive--"
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.884,2058.351,So the only part of... the only part of section (a) that... that provides for recovery of money from a fiduciary is (a)(2).
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2058.351,2059.484,--That's correct.
1992.91-1671,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.833,2108.616,"Mr. Frankel, am I... am I correct... I don't recall whether you made the argument, I guess I should have asked the other side, but they have very little time left."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2144.499,2146.72,"That is absolutely correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1671,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.72,2159.739,"Because (a)(5) would automatically... if it included all relief, legal as well as equitable, the Secretary would have all the power he needed under... under (5) and he wouldn't have to have been given anything under (2)."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2159.739,2161.379,That's correct.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.921,2225.823,May I just... may I just get one thing clear in my mind.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2248.778,2255.29,"--I do not believe that it was properly alleged in this case, and we did make that argument to both courts below."
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.938,2269.95,"And if the... if the complaint is in proper form, would you concede that, under the statute, that complaint would state a cause of action?"
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2269.95,2272.344,The complaint against the fiduciary?
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.344,2273.272,Yes.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2273.272,2274.494,"Yes it would, Your Honor."
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.494,2279.456,So the only issue is... is whether it also states a cause of action against a knowing participant--
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2279.456,2280.478,That's correct.
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2280.478,2282.268,--In the... who is not himself a fiduciary.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2286.492,2294.299,502(l) only gives the Secretary of Labor the power to assess fines.
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.299,2309.358,"Well, I know, but it's measured by... by the applicable... by 20 percent of the applicable recovery amount, which is the amount recovered from a fiduciary or other person ordered by the court."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2309.358,2327.05,"There are at least two forms of equitable relief which would provide the Secretary and the action that the Secretary brings under (a)(5) with a monetary recovery, though not one for monetary damages."
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.531,2350.555,"Well, what if there's... what if... what if the other person is the person who got sued here?"
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2350.555,2357.919,--The... the Secretary would not be able to assess a civil penalty against Hewitt Associates--
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2357.919,2358.199,Why?
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2358.199,2359.261,--Under these circumstances.
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.261,2359.591,Why?
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2359.591,2367.576,Because there is no amount under (a)(5) which could be awarded as appropriate equitable relief.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2382.096,2384.717,May I... may I question that in this respect?
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2398.975,2402.027,"I disagree, Justice Stevens."
1992.91-1671,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2415.368,2417.398,Under 402.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2423.403,2424.985,--Under... it would be assessable--
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.985,2425.215,Plus--
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2425.215,2427.737,"--502(l), section 2, that's correct."
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.737,2428.148,--Yep.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2443.338,2443.829,As--
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.829,2445.551,--But they called it something else.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2445.551,2446.591,--They called it.
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.772,2448.023,Immediately.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2448.023,2460.261,--Precisely what could be recovered against a fiduciary in section 409 and said that type of relief can only be recovered against fiduciaries for the benefit of the plan.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.587,2502.507,Let me... may I just back up a little.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2524.723,2527.545,"That is correct, Justice Stevens, at common law."
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2527.545,2528.476,And that would be equitable relief at common law.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2528.476,2531.218,That is not what ERISA adopted.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2536.47,2539.652,I understand your theory that they made more people fiduciaries and therefore... thereby--
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2539.652,2540.532,--And--
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.532,2542.815,--Eliminated the participants with the fiduciaries.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2542.815,2543.095,--No.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.765,2544.995,The professionals.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2544.995,2545.886,--The participants.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.842,2558.724,"Well, but as long as you say equitable you're still picking up the--"
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2558.724,2559.165,Well--
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.165,2562.908,--The common law precedent that I suggested.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2562.908,2575.776,"--Well, with regard to the common law precedent, ERISA does not adopt that common law precedent within the contours of either the structure or the language that Congress chose."
1992.91-1671,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.927,2609.487,So you--
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2609.487,2615.05,"If they had their hand in the plan's till, they could be required to disgorge that money."
1992.91-1671,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2617.281,2643.679,"--Your argument for your construction of 502(a)(3), that appropriate equitable relief doesn't include the sort of relief that a beneficiary could have gotten from a trustee in a court of equity, is based on what section 409(a) does set out as to what can... what the... can happen to a fiduciary."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2643.679,2643.979,Yes.
1992.91-1671,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2665.965,2666.285,But--
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2666.285,2668.216,"Otherwise, Congress would have said so."
1992.91-1671,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2668.216,2679.333,--But why... why should the language in 409(a) narrow what would otherwise be the ordinary construction of appropriate equitable relief in (a)(3).
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2693.654,2704.633,"What... what ERISA does, Chief Justice Rehnquist, is adopt certain principles from trust law, not all of trust law."
1992.91-1671,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.215,2761.599,"Well, I guess... is it true that if... if 502(a)(3) means what the Government says it means, you would not have needed 409(a)--"
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2761.599,2762.61,That's correct.
1992.91-1671,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2762.61,2763.171,--At all?
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2784.335,2786.596,"That's absolutely correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1671,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2800.424,2810.812,"Mr. Frankel, you were giving us, quite some time ago, two examples of monetary but not... of equitable relief which was monetary but not damages, and you gave one example as restitution."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2812.102,2825.602,"The second example is that when a fiduciary and a party in interest engaged in a prohibited transaction under the statute, that is proscribed by 406, the remedy for that is correction of the transaction."
1992.91-1671,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2833.707,2840.892,Can either of those forms of monetary relief be recovered under ERISA against a nonfiduciary?
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2840.892,2842.762,"Yes, they can, Your Honor."
1992.91-1671,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2842.762,2843.584,"The second one could not, I presume."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2843.584,2856.29,"They would be... they would be the forms that I can identify of appropriate equitable relief, that would provide plan participants or the plan with a monetary recovery."
1992.91-1671,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2856.29,2858.203,But again... but against a nonfiduciary.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2858.203,2859.823,Against a nonfiduciary.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2859.823,2867.62,May I just ask you this question about whether there's redundancy between 409 and 502.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2885.889,2887.2,"Well, Justice Stevens--"
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2887.2,2888.022,But those words aren't there.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2888.022,2896.938,"--What 502(a)(2) says is that a plan participant, fiduciary, or the Secretary of Labor--"
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2896.938,2897.348,Right.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2897.348,2901.19,--Can bring a suit for appropriate relief under 409.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2916.369,2920.463,But it doesn't say... 409 doesn't identify the universe of prospective plaintiffs.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2920.463,2924.785,It does and it only identifies fiduciaries.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2924.785,2925.746,"Well, those are defendants."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2927.567,2929.62,"Well, it says plan participants."
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2929.62,2931.7,That's 502.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2931.7,2932.411,"Well, 409 doesn't say that."
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2932.411,2932.821,That's right.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2932.821,2934.312,But 502(a)(2) does.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.312,2951.002,"But one can look at the scheme as saying 409 is... 4 in general, 404, 5, 6, defines the various duties of the trustee, and 502 defines the various remedies available to parties who may sue either on behalf of the plan or themselves."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2951.002,2954.176,"Justice Stevens, I'd... I'd respectfully disagree."
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2970.345,2970.876,"Right, yeah."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2970.876,2984.094,"Section 502(a)(2) gives the parties identified the right to bring a civil action for relief under section 409, the liability provision."
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2984.094,2991.619,Is it... is it correct that... that you read 502 as saying a civil action may be brought against a fiduciary?
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2991.619,2993.349,That is correct.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2993.349,2994.911,And that qualifies everything that follows--
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,2994.911,2995.691,That is correct.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2995.691,2996.832,--That's interesting.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3005.898,3015.406,I would agree with you that section 502(a)(2) doesn't identify the defendants who... (a)(3) does not identify the defendants who could be sued.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3027.054,3029.503,I understand your argument.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3054.819,3055.51,That is--
1992.91-1671,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3055.51,3057.531,--That's even a more bitter pill to swallow.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3060.633,3062.256,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1671,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.256,3068.968,"Well, I'm saying if you were rigidly... rigidly logical, and I would say reckless."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3076.614,3080.097,"We don't agree with that position, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1671,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3080.097,3080.916,I didn't think you did.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3080.916,3095.859,"In fact, what your position really is is that what the petitioners and the Solicitor General are asking this Court to do is to take the words that appear in 409 and imply them into 502(a)(3)."
1992.91-1671,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3112.438,3125.035,"But you are willing to imply into... into 502(a)(3) the cause of action that's set forth in 409(a), just not the remedies."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3125.035,3129.159,"That... that... that is not our... our position, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3273.535,3284.133,"May I state what I understand to be... I didn't understand from the briefs, quite frankly, but in response to my last question to Mr. Mann, he said the provision of the subchapter that they said was violated was 404."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3310.841,3312.861,For two reasons.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3314.253,3315.954,Ignoring 409 entirely.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3315.954,3317.386,--Ignoring... ignoring 409.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3361.114,3361.415,The became a fiduciary.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3361.415,3362.144,--That they became a fiduciary.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3362.144,3370.081,"Well either you have to conclude that or conclude that Congress meant by the words appropriate relief, relief that would have been appropriate under common law precedents."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3370.081,3373.432,That is a possible interpretation.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3375.793,3376.304,"You disagree, of course."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3376.304,3388.971,And I think the whole structure of the statute shows that Congress didn't decide to take the common law of trusts and the exclusive jurisdiction of equity courts and import that into ERISA.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3388.971,3393.115,What is your position on the preemption question that Justice Kennedy asked earlier?
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3400.181,3408.506,"That... that issue has not been presented to this Court before, as to whether actions against nonfiduciary service providers are preempted."
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3408.506,3411.879,"Do you have a position on the question... I know it hasn't... and I know it isn't before us, but it affects our thinking."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3411.879,3440.225,"However, this Court may conclude if it holds, as we think it should, that money damages are not encompassed with appropriate equitable relief, that it would agree with the district court in this case, in an appropriate case, that professional malpractice claims or common law tort claims against nonfiduciary service providers may not be preempted by ERISA."
1992.91-1671,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3440.225,3462.869,"Well, Mr. Frankel, is it... we have ERISA cases coming out our ears these days."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3479.743,3486.686,"I believe that that is a... is... would be consistent with existing law, although--"
1992.91-1671,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3486.686,3493.56,The only thing you're conceding is that there may be some tort claims against them or some extra trust claims remaining.
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3493.56,3494.413,--Extra trust claims.
1992.91-1671,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3506.54,3512.234,"Of course, the question will be whether that action relates to an ERISA plan, the way this Court's been construing this."
1992.91-1671,2,41287,steven_h_frankel,,3512.234,3515.366,"I... I agree with you, Justice Stevens."
1992.91-1671,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3558.687,3560.005,"Thank you, Mr. Frankel."
1992.91-1671,3,17014,alfred_h_sigman,,3562.559,3564.6,"The case... we submit the case, Your Honor."
1992.91-1671,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3564.6,3565.519,Very well.
