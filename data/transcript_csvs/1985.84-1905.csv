1985.84-1905,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.956,"We will hear arguments next in Bowen, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, against Owens."
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,13.224,16.526,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1905,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,96.412,99.43,That's a marvelous understatement.
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,99.43,101.282,"--Thank you, Justice White."
1985.84-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,273.677,276.979,"Ms. Kuhl, you say they have always treated them differently."
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,277.981,284.801,"--I believe it is, Justice Blackmun, until 1983 when... which is after the--"
1985.84-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,284.801,287.17,What about prior to 1977?
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,287.17,315.856,"--Prior to 1977, yes, they were treated differently because initially, of course, widows and widowers... well, widows at least were getting benefits and divorced spouses were not getting benefits at all, and then Congress permitted divorced spouses to get benefits, but that divorced spouses had to be married for 20 years and to meet certain criteria of dependency before they could get benefits."
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,358.183,359.199,May I go back a little?
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,364.253,380.697,"--They had always been treated differently, both because there were different assumptions about dependency of divorced spouses, and because there was a... the whole system is based on the family unit."
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.697,383.165,--Our relevant period is after 1977?
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,383.165,384.051,That's right.
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,384.051,391.804,"And during the period after 1977, and confining our attention to survivors when the wage earner... after the wage earner's death--"
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,391.804,392.354,Yes.
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.354,397.158,"--Congress then didn't treat them differently except for the one thing that's in issue here, isn't that right?"
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,397.158,403.812,"Well, they still treated them differently because there still was this ten year dependency test, if you will."
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,403.812,405.747,They had to have been married for ten years?
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,405.747,406.314,For ten years.
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,406.314,411.168,How was that... that's why there are two different classes.
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,416.222,418.988,"She had to be married, but didn't have to be married for ten years."
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,432.397,444.055,"Is it a dependency test... if the divorced wife was a millionaire, wouldn't she still get the... had been married for ten years, would she not be eligible?"
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,444.055,457.549,"Yes, but the fact that Congress may have been over-inclusive... I mean, this Court has recognized in many earlier cases that in a Social Security system Congress is forced to deal with sort of broad, generalized criteria."
1985.84-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,459.765,467.671,"Isn't that a test of genuineness rather than dependency, as Justice Stevens points out?"
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,467.671,469.689,I'm not certain I understand the question.
1985.84-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,469.689,474.474,"Well, so that there wasn't a marriage just before death in order to qualify?"
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,474.474,476.176,"No, it wasn't, because of the--"
1985.84-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,476.176,477.21,How can you say that?
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,477.21,502.726,"--Well, first of all, this Court has, I believe in Califano versus Jobst, there's sort of a chronology that the Court follows through in its opinion, but the way this ten-year test evolved, the way it evolved was, as I mentioned previously, there were no benefits for surviving... for divorced spouses, and then Congress had a two-pronged test of dependency."
1985.84-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,586.432,596.553,"As between the divorced spouse who satisfied the ten-year period, and the widow, no difference?"
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,596.553,605.476,"No, not as of 1977, with regard to survivors' benefits."
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.221,996.414,"Is that possible in the other situation where the widow's benefit... could the deceased wage earner owe a divorced... maybe was married ten or 15 years and divorced and then had a second wife, could he have double obligation?"
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,997.582,998.133,Yes.
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.201,1007.955,--So that either the widow or the divorced wife survivor could be a double dipper?
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1007.955,1019.413,"--That's correct, although I think as your description of the problem indicates, it really is best to find by the situation of looking where there's been a divorce."
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1020.448,1022.081,There's got to be at least one divorce?
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1022.081,1022.498,--Right.
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.498,1024.514,Both categories?
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1024.514,1027.366,"That, I think, is a better rational classification."
1985.84-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1082.787,1087.44,"I'm interested in your saying it was, and then changing to the possible ""could have been""."
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1090.256,1118.976,"Well, first of all I do not believe that the rational basis test requires us to discern Congress's actual motivation, so long as Congress could have rationally acted with this purpose, and in this case, first of all, I think as to dependency, Congress's purpose can be discerned from the progress of its concerns over the years with regard to widowed spouses."
1985.84-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1146.479,1152.799,"Well, I take it you're saying, although you are hesitant to express it, that there is nothing in so many words in the legislative history."
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1160.787,1162.839,"Well, yes, it is."
1985.84-1905,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.541,1196.393,How did the bill which passed the Senate differ from the bill which passed the House?
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1196.393,1206.45,"I couldn't tell you in all the particulars, but the bill which passed the Senate had no provision in whatsoever addressing the remarriage rule."
1985.84-1905,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1206.45,1211.535,And did the Senate consider it after the House?
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1211.535,1214.937,I'm not certain.
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.158,1559.895,May I go back to your first point about the fact finding issue.
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1582.992,1586.36,"--Well, it would not be one decision."
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1586.36,1593.014,"If you win, everybody in the class loses, and if you have all these hearings you'll find out if there a another reason why they might--"
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1593.014,1595.3,"Well, I'm not sure that everybody in the class loses."
1985.84-1905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.29,1610.492,--It's not collateral estoppel.
1985.84-1905,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1613.527,1633.675,"What I'm saying is that some of those people who were nominally included might be able to come back and make the same claim later if collateral estoppel did not bind them, and I think maybe more importantly, the Secretary may well have to go through the fact finding in each of these claims anyway."
1985.84-1905,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1649.85,1658.456,Mr. Deford.
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1658.456,1666.229,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1905,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1681.856,1687.493,"If the rule were otherwise, would it be possible in some cases?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1687.493,1691.027,If the rule that's at issue in this case were otherwise?
1985.84-1905,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1691.027,1691.794,Right.
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1691.794,1704.168,"As far as I know, there' no way that a Social Security recipient could receive more than he or she is entitled to under the most liberal possible benefit scheme that he or she is entitled to."
1985.84-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.708,1716.226,I don't think her point was that any beneficiary might receive double benefits.
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1720.38,1721.48,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.306,1817.627,"You can certainly say that about a lot of legislation, can't you, that was spawned by the urge to reach a compromise?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1817.627,1821.329,"--That may be an overstatement on my part, a generalization, Your Honor."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.333,1886.355,"Supposing that the legislative history in this case were perhaps clearer than it is, so that it was apparent that the Senate's balking at the inclusion of the divorced and remarried... was purely financial, that their view was that it's going to cost us more money than we have now, we may be ready to do it next year but we can't do it this year, we just don't have the money now, so we'll not give benefits to as many people as the House wanted to, in your view is that irrational?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1886.355,1888.64,I would think that would probably be irrational because--
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1888.64,1889.457,Irrational.
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1889.457,1892.009,"--Irrational, because of the amount of money at stake."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.909,1924.961,How much would have to be involved for the Senate's action to be rational?
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1924.961,1936.851,"--Obviously, I'm not in a position to draw that line, but we pointed out in our briefs, the amount of money at stake here at the absolute most was less than one one-hundredth of a percent of the annual outlay of the Social Security system."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.851,1938.386,"What was it, $17 million?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1938.386,1940.186,It was less than $17 million a year.
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1941.405,1943.44,"What, $15 million?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1943.44,1948.326,"It's unclear from the legislative history how much less than $17 million, but that's the maximum that it could have--"
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.326,1953.896,"But your argument is, anyway, that that small an amount, as you put it, makes it irrational?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1953.896,1967.656,"--No, not that that amount alone makes it irrational, but in the context of what happened between the House and Senate in this situation, I do not think it is reasonable to assume that fiscal concerns motivated Congress in this case."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1967.656,1975.828,"So you say that with that small an amount, it is irrational to think that the Senate would be motivated by concern for saving money?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1975.828,1981.649,"Well, you hypothesize that the Senate set that out in its legislative history, which of course is not the case we have here."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1981.649,1987.367,"Yes, I'm hypothesizing, that the Senate said, we are concerned about this $17 million?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,1987.367,2003.479,"I would say that even if the Senate had said that, without anything else to explain why it selected this particular discrete classification of divorced surviving spouses, that it's inappropriate for the legislature simply to say, they're not going to get the benefits but people in a virtually identical situation are."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2013.335,2017.655,Other than a desire not to spend as much money as the proponents wanted?
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2017.655,2024.976,I think just fiscal concerns alone cannot provide the basis for discriminating against a particular classification.
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2044.454,2046.573,"Of course, there, there were people being cut."
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2049.525,2058.314,"I don't think there's any indication that I'm aware of, in this Court's decision, that that distinction should make any difference for purposes of the importance of fiscal concerns."
1985.84-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2217.563,2218.813,May I ask you a question.
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2234.106,2250.184,"--I believe the House version would have removed the remarriage penalty for virtually every classification, including the ones you've mentioned, and that's why the $1.3 billion figure which has been mentioned is higher than we're talking about because it includes other classifications as well."
1985.84-1905,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2368.261,2379.486,"Well, is it your position that Congress has got to announce its reasons, or is it true that there must be discernible irrational basis for what they've done?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2379.486,2391.142,"Mr. Chief Justice, it's clear that... to this Court's rulings, that if the lowest standard of review, the rational basis test is used, that the actual reasons do not have to be set out in the legislative history."
1985.84-1905,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2460.955,2464.49,I'm not sure that's quite sufficient to describe it.
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2483.486,2498.246,"Justice O'Connor, I think we're talking here about a portion of the Social Security program, the survivors' program, and the two factors that I have set out, the question of dependency and the remarriage penalty--"
1985.84-1905,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2498.246,2514.271,"But overall, isn't it a fact that Congress just has not had unlimited funds in the Social Security Fund to distribute, and it's had to make some very hard choices, how to distribute those, and what people should receive as benefits?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2514.271,2515.655,"--I think that's true, as a general rule."
1985.84-1905,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2515.655,2517.407,This is just a part of the overall scheme?
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2517.407,2539.254,"This is a part, and a very small part, of the overall scheme, but I think it's also true that when Congress selects one classification to receive benefits and another classification to be disfavored and not to receive benefits, there has to be some discernible distinction between those classifications which explains Congress's actions."
1985.84-1905,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2539.254,2547.076,"Historically, Congress has made some differences applicable or attributable to divorce status."
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2559.684,2563.354,"In the past, Congress definitely made some decisions based on divorce status."
1985.84-1905,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2587.653,2593.39,"Well, do you think that just tied Congress's hands forevermore and that was the end of it?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2593.39,2608.317,"--No, but I think it indicated that Congress saw so few distinctions between the two classifications that if it were to distinguish between them at a later point, it had to provide, or we had to be able to discern the valid reason for that distinction."
1985.84-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.819,2702.01,"Before you get to your class action, would you agree it was rational for them to apply the remarriage rule to the parents and the children, not to the widows?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2702.01,2707.28,"--Justice Stevens, I have to confess I haven't given that any thought."
1985.84-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.252,2723.473,"I suppose one could argue that there also should be an incentive in those groups, not to discourage--"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2723.473,2743.137,"Certainly there's an incentive, but the reason we brought the case and briefed the case as it is, is because of the similarity between the two groups of spouses, and I'm certain many distinctions could be drawn between parents and children as opposed to spouses, which might make it rational to distinguish between those classifications."
1985.84-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.137,2758.829,"--I may have it wrong, but as I understand it in '77 they decided to put the divorced survivors either with the non-divorced survivors, widows, in other words, or with the children and their parents."
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2758.829,2772.773,"I think in 1977... I think all that happened in 1977 was that Congress decided to eliminate the remarriage penalty for widows alone, widows and widowers, but not for divorced surviving spouses, parents and children."
1985.84-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2772.773,2779.41,"But see, the effect of that was to treat the divorced people in the same way they treated the children and parents."
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2779.41,2788.866,"That's correct, but as I indicated, I think the distinctions between children and parents are such that it's not logical to compare those classifications."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2913.165,2919.835,"No one is challenging the standing of the people with whom the Secretary... with respect to whom the Secretary has waived, are they?"
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2919.835,2921.302,"No, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2921.302,2928.691,This is a question of whether dissimilar people can be included in the class with respect to whom the Secretary hasn't waived?
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2928.691,2931.827,"Well, the crucial issue is whether or not they're dissimilar, the term you use."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2931.827,2938.881,"Well, certainly they're dissimilar to the extent that in one group the Secretary has waived and in the other they haven't."
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2938.881,2942.851,The Secretary has formally waived for one group.
1985.84-1905,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2956.858,2963.445,But Secretaries issue regulations that define when the Secretary is to be deemed to have waived.
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,2968.749,2973.284,"--The court is not ignoring those, nor is the court overruling the Secretary."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3220.863,3225.999,Has it ever been applied against the government in any case that you know of?
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,3225.999,3229.135,"I believe the Honda case, Honda v. Clark."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3229.135,3230.485,By this Court?
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,3230.485,3232.82,"That was a Supreme Court decision, yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.407,3251.049,"Ordinarily the rule that several cases in this Court laid out was that when you deal with the government, you turn square corners, and that lots of rules that apply to a private defendant don't apply to the government."
1985.84-1905,1,25222,gill_deford,,3251.049,3256.186,"Well, this Court of course has never dealt with this express issue under the Social Security statute."
1985.84-1905,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3423.779,3425.979,"Do you have anything else, Ms. Kuhl?"
1985.84-1905,2,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,3425.979,3428.114,"Just briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.051,3493.107,"May I ask, in connection with both that point and the totalling point, the Government disagrees with the date that they picked for the 60-day rule, the date that the named plaintiff received notice."
1985.84-1905,2,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,3502.965,3506.0,It would not... we would not consider it a question of totalling.
1985.84-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3525.394,3530.546,"In other words, they can be properly included within the class even though they don't file individual actions?"
1985.84-1905,2,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,3530.546,3530.879,Yes.
1985.84-1905,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3611.813,3613.03,"Thank you, counsel."
