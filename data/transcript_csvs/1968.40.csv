1968.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,23.507,"Number 40, William Joe Johnson versus Areas Avery, Commissioner of Corrections."
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,24.494,29.099,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.40,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,321.071,327.775,"Well, aren't there some states which provide legal services for prisoners?"
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,333.678,336.839,"California has an amicus brief here, Your Honor."
1968.40,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,341.83,343.382,But some assistance?
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,343.382,348.445,"They provide the assistance of prison guards and chaplains, apparently, Your Honor."
1968.40,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,348.445,351.547,"And the clerical stuff, do they -- don't they?"
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,351.547,355.373,"They apparently, yes, sir."
1968.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,355.373,361.884,"And, apparently, the Courts have cooperated by setting up these forms to be with check lists."
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,361.884,362.373,"Yes, Your Honor, although --"
1968.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,362.373,362.655,Right.
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,362.655,373.017,"Although, I expect to argue a bit today that these forms are in fact not much better than the no assistance at all that the State of Tennessee provides."
1968.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.017,378.392,Who would might be?
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,378.392,391.834,"Your Honor, in the event that this attorney does receive these letters, what happens ultimately is that the claims -- the just claims and the unjust claims are like all going away splash kit."
1968.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,507.756,536.84,"The difference, I suppose it's -- it doesn't go to your question, your rhetorical question, but the practice is, is it not, that people who indulge in the activities, in which your client was to indulge, actually charge their fellow inmates everything that's traffic or bare and, presumably, prison employees do not."
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,536.84,543.986,"Your Honor, there is not one shred of evidence in this case that my petitioner has charged anyone for his services."
1968.40,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,602.104,607.897,Suppose he set up an office in Nashville and held himself out to do precisely this.
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,613.473,613.992,"Yes, sir."
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.991,634.042,"Mr. Warden, the issue is now, as the -- what might certainly say on Section 2242."
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,640.627,644.315,"Your Honor, I think that that's only one of the points before us today."
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.517,667.341,"What if we would say “well, perhaps, we can agree with this” as a matter of interpretation that was held in the District Court”?"
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,667.341,668.924,"The District Court did that, yes, sir."
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.76,688.199,And the next is we have to reach the constitutional claim?
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,688.199,692.353,"No, Your Honor, I don't think you would have to reach the constitutional claim."
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.499,709.324,"Well, you'd have to reach it in the -- they'd have to reach it if we didn't agree with the 2242."
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,709.324,713.942,"Yes, sir, you certainly would, in order to adopt our view of the case."
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,713.942,724.361,"Mr. Warden, this came up in the form -- well, whatever the form that took position, this has been treated all along as to the petition for habeas?"
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,724.361,726.865,"Yes, sir, it has."
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,727.767,729.68,Is he a state prisoner?
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,729.68,732.385,"He's a state prisoner, Your Honor."
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.385,735.442,That's how he gets 2242 into this.
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,735.442,741.0,"I suppose so, Your Honor."
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,753.431,755.444,It's the crux of the argument.
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,755.444,755.845,Sir?
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,755.845,759.451,"Those standings, that, I gather, reads that --"
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,759.451,759.752,Sir --
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.752,761.064,The counsel had standing.
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,761.064,765.872,"Sir, both the Federal District Court and the Court of Appeals agreed that he had standing."
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.872,767.675,That's not challenged here.
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,767.675,771.535,It's raised in the California amicus brief.
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,774.134,776.448,Why doesn't he understand it?
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,777.622,780.938,"Yes, Your Honor, I will try to."
1968.40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,804.688,806.701,How long have you been estoppel?
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,806.701,809.042,For almost three years.
1968.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,809.042,811.424,That's not -- is that contiguously or abound?
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,811.424,825.087,"He was turned loose at the end of the time that the District Court decided this case, Your Honor, and I'm going outside of the record, he was put in the day that the Court of Appeals decision came down."
1968.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,836.319,837.887,That's what I understood from the brief.
1968.40,0,34015,karl_p_warden,,837.887,839.543,"Yes, sir."
1968.40,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,842.047,845.653,"He was persistent in asserting his claimed rights, I guess."
1968.40,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,1577.327,1579.888,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.40,2,34015,karl_p_warden,,3107.948,3114.715,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has further questions for me, I have nothing further to add."
1968.40,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3114.715,3116.451,"Thank you, Mr. Warden."
