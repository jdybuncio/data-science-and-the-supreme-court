1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.522,"We will hear arguments this afternoon in No. 86-5020, John Booth against Maryland."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,76.231,78.916,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,172.711,175.496,"What exactly was introduced in evidence here, Mr. Burns?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,175.496,189.589,"--Here we have the testimony of, or the statements of the immediate family; that is, the mother... excuse me, son, daughter of the victims... the actual victims."
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.82,229.88,"You'd allow it to be introduced, I presume, if as one of the aggravating circumstances, it was shown that the victim was tortured to death in front of his wife or something like that, wouldn't you?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,229.88,230.697,--I think there are circumstances--
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.697,236.986,Then the fact that the wife was so much aggrieved by it you think would be relevant?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,236.986,240.188,"--Well, I think it would be relevant in a slightly different way, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.185,272.743,I don't understand why in principle you say simply the fact that the crime does more harm is not a valid aggravating factor.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,293.072,298.79,"I'm not sure, Your Honor, because in one case you have murder and in one attempted murder, except if there is the aggravating factor of capital crime."
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,300.776,312.467,"Well, I think you certainly would not deny that a State can have different punishments, and considerably different, for a murder that goes awry, and one that is actually committed."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,312.467,313.267,"I agree, Your Honor."
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.267,319.639,"Although the evil of the person who pulls the trigger, the blackness of his soul, is exactly the same; right?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,321.672,322.339,"I agree, Your Honor."
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.339,326.043,So somehow the harm that is inflicted upon society is a perfectly valid factor.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,329.161,337.684,"If that's true, Your Honor, we eliminate reasons for foreseeability, because I think in Your Honor's hypothetical, we do have the foreseeability problem."
1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,387.534,396.038,"But why is the blackness of the soul of the defendant, as you and Justice Scalia have been saying, the only thing that the State may produce evidence about?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,415.851,423.29,"Well, Chief Justice, I think one clear thing is presumably the defendant's background is relevant, why he's here."
1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.373,427.092,This Court has said it was relevant.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,427.092,428.175,"--Yes, in the past."
1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,428.175,430.877,And presumably this Court could say the victims were relevant.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,430.877,431.477,This Court could--
1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,431.477,435.347,So the question is: What reason supporting one doesn't support the other?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,435.347,442.934,--I think one question is: Does it have an effect on why this individual committed this particular crime?
1986.86-5020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,472.071,483.245,"Mr. Burns, do you suppose that it's possible for a State to make it an aggravating circumstance to murder someone who is a policeman?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,483.245,487.797,"--I think it is, Justice O'Connor, if I may add one thing."
1986.86-5020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.867,492.951,"Well, maybe; maybe not."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,499.79,504.575,I think if the State tied it to a knowledge and specific purpose for doing that.
1986.86-5020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,504.575,506.461,"Well, maybe; maybe not."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,519.433,520.1,"That's the question, Your Honor."
1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,568.165,582.424,"Is that any more arbitrary than Justice Scalia's example of the attempted murderer who aims for the forehead, misses and gets ten years, as opposed to the man who hits and is executed?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,582.424,590.78,"I don't think that is arbitrary at all, Your Honor, again because when I point the gun at someone, I surely must know... I mean, I think it's the basis of the criminal law--"
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.78,591.896,When you know you're going to miss?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,596.434,597.4,"--Precisely, Judge Scalia."
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.132,624.001,"I could say if you do, you're unlucky."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,625.201,626.286,Maybe very unlucky.
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,626.286,628.203,--which direction you want to look at it from.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,654.854,660.758,"The difficulty, Justice Scalia, is that I think we're going to have to simply change what we've said about criminal law for at least the last 200 years."
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,702.085,703.785,It's not deterrence; it's not deterrence.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,708.155,709.688,"--Well, Your Honor, the question of outrage--"
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.688,710.94,"Call it vindication, if you like."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,710.94,711.323,--Pardon?
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.74,713.507,"Call it vindication, if you like."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,713.507,716.559,"Well, I think that... if I may... leads us to a second problem."
1986.86-5020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,783.62,796.796,"Mr. Burns, aren't there a number of States with capital punishment laws that look to, as an aggravating circumstance, the extent to which other people might have been endangered by the conduct?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,796.796,803.7,"I think, Justice O'Connor... the ones I'm familiar with... are ones where you're talking about... and Maryland has that, too, of killing more than one person."
1986.86-5020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,806.069,806.485,No.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,813.223,820.627,"--Again, I can't say that I'm completely familiar with every other statute, other than Maryland's, but I believe those are again to be tied--"
1986.86-5020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,855.05,874.177,"Let me come back just a minute and say that... or inquire whether you think it is generally foreseeable when you murder someone that it's very likely you will leave a number of family members distraught and devastated, that that's the likelihood, really?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,874.177,878.248,"--That may be reasonably likelihood, reasonable likelihood that someone may be."
1986.86-5020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,881.783,897.877,"Well, but just if you limit it to that kind of reasonable concern, do you think that's inherently improper, viewed in the light of the other aggravating circumstances that States have adopted?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,897.877,899.495,"I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.226,965.354,"Well, Mr. Burns, hasn't tort law for a long time distinguished between intentional torts and negligent torts in this respect, that with respect to intentional torts, you take the consequences as you find them, and you're responsible for even fairly unforeseeable consequences."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,969.841,972.96,"I certainly agree, Mr. Chief Justice, there's a difference."
1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,972.96,984.951,So that an intentional killer is really not in a position as applying traditional tort laws to complain that he killed someone who had a far more bereaved family than the next person.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,984.951,989.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, I certainly agree with you that the family could successfully sue the killer."
1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1012.002,1020.691,But you're insisting that there's a foreseeable... a principle of foreseeability here that should somehow limit your client's criminal liability.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1020.691,1021.074,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1021.074,1026.428,I'm suggesting that that... that there's a very good analogy from tort law that suggests that isn't the case.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1026.428,1034.867,"Well, I suggest, Your Honor, that that obviously this Court can do as it will, but I think to do that, we're going to have to substitute tort law for criminal law."
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.32,1048.606,You think... you think that you can't be convicted of the crime of killing a federal officer unless you knew he was federal officer?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1048.606,1049.225,Well--
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.225,1050.525,Right?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1050.525,1051.075,--as always--
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.075,1052.76,You don't take the victim the way you find him?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1054.793,1055.379,--I would say if you reasonably--
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1055.379,1058.081,"I'll tell you... well, I don't think reasonably."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1064.651,1066.585,--I'm just... I'm not familiar with the case.
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.766,1097.289,"And if you rob a bank and you don't know that it's a Federal bank, you're... you're not prosecutable under the laws governing the robbery of a Federal bank?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1097.289,1110.097,"--I think it's reasonableness... is if everyone realizes that banks, most banks perhaps, many banks, are Federal banks, is if someone is deliberately posing as a drug dealer, I don't think one can reasonably say,"
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1111.316,1116.5,Everybody realizes... everybody realizes people have relatives whom they leave behind.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1116.5,1117.119,--They realize that.
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1117.119,1133.229,"And all that this Statute permits is those relatives to come in and demonstrate the harm that this individual has done, just as... just as he's entitled to put on exculpatory testimony, his mother coming on and saying, you know, ""It was my fault"", or whatever."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1133.229,1133.795,The difficulty is--
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.795,1135.081,These are just the realities of things.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1135.081,1136.881,--Presumably his mother... it may been her fault.
1986.86-5020,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.389,1153.876,Then you're getting back to your assumption that the only proper basis for setting a level of punishment is the nature of his soul.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1157.727,1160.446,"--I think, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, in part I agree with you."
1986.86-5020,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1165.533,1167.066,Can we just back up for minute?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1173.087,1174.722,"--I'm saying... I said, Justice Marshall,--"
1986.86-5020,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1174.722,1175.422,Are you from Maryland?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1181.909,1183.809,"--Now, Justice, we've changed that in Maryland."
1986.86-5020,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1183.809,1194.317,"Mr. Burns, I thought the question before us in this case was admissibility of the Victim Impact Statements."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1194.317,1195.35,"Yes, Justice Powell."
1986.86-5020,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1195.35,1197.668,"We haven't talked very much about that, have we?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1197.668,1202.755,"Well, I think this all is the question of admissibility comes down to, whether it serves one of these purposes."
1986.86-5020,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1202.755,1204.372,"Well, let me ask you this."
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1211.611,1212.795,"That's correct, Justice Powell."
1986.86-5020,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1212.795,1216.463,--introduced in evidence at the sentencing hearing?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1216.463,1217.082,"Yes, Justice Powell."
1986.86-5020,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1217.082,1219.701,Were you permitted to cross-examine?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1219.701,1227.705,"By agreement of all the parties, the preferred... the options given the Defense in this case were, you can have live or statements."
1986.86-5020,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1239.912,1241.447,"Under Maryland law, you would have had the opportunity to cross-examine?"
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1249.636,1250.386,"I don't understand, Justice Powell."
1986.86-5020,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1250.386,1254.755,--any conflicting... conflicting statements?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1254.755,1256.624,I'm afraid I don't understand your question.
1986.86-5020,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1256.624,1258.659,You don't understand the question?
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1267.063,1267.931,"Yes, Justice."
1986.86-5020,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1267.931,1273.317,And you say that was filed at the sentencing hearing.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1276.537,1276.854,No.
1986.86-5020,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1277.754,1281.239,But couldn't you have... couldn't you have insisted they be there so you could cross-examine them.
1986.86-5020,0,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1281.239,1282.139,I think that's true.
1986.86-5020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.521,1307.106,"Thank you, Mr. Burns."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1313.21,1315.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-5020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1481.72,1497.312,"Mr. Monk, I think the question I have I'd like you to address, frankly, is that the Maryland sentencing scheme, as you've been describing it and as the record discloses, is very specific."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1501.014,1501.664,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-5020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1501.664,1508.987,"--and it lists the aggravating circumstances, and the jury is told to check off on the form what ones it finds."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1525.914,1526.414,That's correct.
1986.86-5020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1526.414,1535.287,"Now, the use of the Victim Impact Statement is not described on the form for sentencing."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1583.001,1590.774,"Justice O'Connor, I would agree with you that there is no place on the form for the jury directly to consider victim impact evidence."
1986.86-5020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1617.441,1627.464,"Well, I think if I'd been a juror, I might have been quite confused about what use to make of the Victim Impact Statement in a scheme like Maryland's that has been made so specific."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1629.899,1660.851,"Well, I suggest to you, Justice O'Connor, that the process, what the jury was supposed to do in this case and I think was Maryland's process calls for, is that once the jury finds the threshold of an aggravated murder, that it was committed in the case in connection with a robbery, then they take into consideration the circumstances of the crime, the victim impact, the defendant's criminal record, in considering the aggravating quality of the crime, and then weigh that against the mitigating circumstances presented by the defendant."
1986.86-5020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1664.12,1666.989,Nowhere are they told to do that though.
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1666.989,1672.493,"Well, I think there could be an instruction if there was not a request for such an instruction in this case."
1986.86-5020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1690.27,1692.47,May I ask this question?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1707.982,1710.048,"It is not, Justice Powell."
1986.86-5020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1710.048,1713.716,It is in getting to the case in any event?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1713.716,1714.435,Pardon me.
1986.86-5020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1714.435,1714.918,I say--
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1714.918,1716.135,How does it come in?
1986.86-5020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1716.135,1719.437,--There's a separate statute in Maryland that says this is admissible in a capital case?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1719.437,1720.439,That's right.
1986.86-5020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1738.767,1758.58,"My understanding is that although counsel for the defendant in this case objected to the introduction of this Victim Impact Statement, counsel did not choose to cross-examine the parties who signed these testimonials as to the effect of the murder on them."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1758.58,1759.18,That's correct.
1986.86-5020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1765.251,1767.936,Would he have had the right to cross-examine those people?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1768.636,1769.503,--Would have--
1986.86-5020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1769.503,1773.857,"--Could you have introduced a statement if he had objected and said,"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1776.876,1781.411,"--I think he could have, and I think the Court would have been required to give him the opportunity to rebut the evidence."
1986.86-5020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1782.48,1784.113,To cross-examine them?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1784.113,1785.648,--Yes.
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1785.648,1789.017,Can you give me a case on that?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1789.017,1792.152,"Well, I think the Statute, itself, reflects it, Justice Marshall."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1793.052,1801.507,"Does the Statute say, ""An impact statement"" is admissible?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1801.507,1803.026,"--Yes, it does."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1804.276,1805.561,"It says, impact statement?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1805.561,1810.28,"--It says, including a victim impact statement, in the description of the pre-sentence report."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1810.28,1811.632,0 [Inaudibles.]
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1811.632,1813.299,"It's in the Statute, I believe."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1813.299,1813.965,That' okay.
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1815.251,1827.059,Also the... I think if the Court would look at the Maryland Court of Appeals earlier decision in Lodowski where the Court of Appeals took the opportunity to construe this Statute is further guidance in that case.
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1827.059,1829.427,"General Monk, can I ask you a question?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1838.18,1838.865,That's correct.
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1838.865,1855.725,"Do you think it would be permissible for the State Statute to provide that if a victim leaves surviving two or three children, that shall be considered an aggravating circumstance, a statutory aggravating circumstance justifying the death penalty might not otherwise be justified?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1855.725,1870.568,"Well, I think in the same vein that I think it's permissible that we decide that the commission of... or murder of a police officer in the course of his duties: If the General Assembly were to decide that, I think it's possible that that could be considered a statutory aggravating circumstance."
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1871.137,1872.803,And you think it would be constitutional to do that is what I am asking.
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1872.803,1874.921,--I think they could do so constitutionally.
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1876.771,1877.706,"No, I understand."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1903.422,1905.408,"Justice Scalia, indeed, that's what the Maryland Court of Appeals said."
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1910.945,1914.98,So it is an aggravating circumstance established by a separate statute.
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1918.95,1919.55,--That's right.
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.71,1936.762,But I suppose it could be made that under your view of the case?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1936.762,1943.332,"Well, to the extent that the Maryland General Assembly could decide that a police officer killed in the performance of duty constitutes an aggravating circumstance,--"
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1943.332,1943.832,"Well, I understand."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1944.382,1945.466,"--I think they could decide that, yes."
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.466,1956.907,Do I understand that the Maryland Statute authorizes imposing the death penalty just because the jury hears and believes the statements of victim... of relatives?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1956.907,1957.675,That's correct.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.675,1960.727,You have to find a statutory aggravating circumstance?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1960.727,1961.26,That's exactly right.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.112,1971.966,And so there's no... there's no separate aggravating circumstance for victim impact... of impact on victims?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1971.966,1975.001,"--That is exactly correct, Justice White."
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.001,1976.52,"No, but as I understand it, you think there could be."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1980.722,1983.756,"Well, I don't know that the argument would be precisely the same."
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1985.425,1999.635,"Well, if it can make the difference, and I think you've accepted that it could, between having a death sentence imposed in one case and not in another case, which was identical except for the absence of an impact statement, I don't know why that isn't the classic example of an aggravating circumstance."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,1999.635,2011.357,"Well, under the Maryland scheme, and I think under the Eighth Amendment jurisprudence of this Court, the State should and is required to limit and define those cases...--"
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.676,2012.343,"Well, this is one classic...--"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2017.078,2020.03,"I would agree that they could do so, and the General Assembly could do so."
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2038.324,2038.707,Right.
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2038.707,2039.891,--quality or nature of the crime.
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.891,2046.145,I think you must make that argument in order to sustain the Statute.
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2046.145,2064.309,"I would like to say a few more words about the Maryland statutory scheme itself because I think once the Court understands the scheme and understands the safeguards built into the scheme, they will understand why the introduction of this evidence was not arbitrary or create an arbitrary or capricious result."
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.657,2300.011,"Before you, the blue brief, the last pages of the blue brief--"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2300.011,2301.027,"--Yes, I do."
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.027,2315.12,"--Is... down there in Roman numeral... Roman numeral five and six, are those the... is that the only... are those the only mentions of the family members?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2315.12,2316.47,That's correct.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.47,2327.661,"And in six, it says... in five, it says the statement must contain any request for psychological services by the victim's family."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2327.661,2328.144,That's correct.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.144,2333.232,"And in six, it says any other information about the victim's family that the court requires."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2333.232,2335.934,That's correct.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.934,2338.552,Was there some requirement by the Court in this case?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2338.552,2340.436,The Court requested a pre-sentence report.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.04,2354.061,"Well, I know, but this seems to indicate that the Judge has to require information about the impact on the victim's family."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2354.061,2360.049,--In this case the Court did not specifically request information about the victim's family.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.107,2377.344,"Does the judge ever instruct with respect to a victim impact statement, what its relevance is, or how it should be used?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2377.344,2378.644,--The judge could instruct.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.644,2379.546,Does he ever?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2379.546,2381.379,He was not requested to do so in this case.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.379,2382.915,Does he ever?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2382.915,2385.117,"Well, I can't speak across all of Maryland's cases."
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2388.219,2392.02,But you don't recall any instance where the judge did comment on it?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2392.02,2394.222,--I have not... I do not know of such an instance.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2394.222,2397.44,"But you know... you know what a prosecutor says about it, doesn't he... don't you?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2397.44,2399.892,The prosecutor in this case read the Victim Impact Statements.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.892,2402.159,And so then argued from what?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2402.159,2406.694,"He argued from it that there... that this was a serious crime, and it caused harm to the defendant's family... the victim's family."
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.694,2412.431,"And, therefore, it helped to illuminate what aggravating circumstance?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2412.431,2416.65,"Well, in this case the aggravating circumstance was that the crime was committed while committing a robbery."
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.422,2430.208,What aggravating circumstance did the jury find in this case?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2430.208,2434.945,"Number ten that the... on the Maryland statutory scheme, that the crime was committed while committing robbery."
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.945,2436.328,Is that the only one?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2436.328,2436.845,That's correct.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2436.845,2440.515,"Now how did a victim impact statement, how could that have illuminated that?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2440.515,2440.865,Well--
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2440.865,2450.321,"It may have... did they ask for... for the especially heinous, aggravating--"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2450.321,2450.604,--No.
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.604,2451.554,--circumstance?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2451.554,2461.528,"You see that... under the Maryland scheme, there is no direction that you look for especially heinous or anything of that nature as there is in other State statutes."
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.573,2482.192,I see.
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2482.192,2492.148,--comes into evidence and is used as a weight on that side to compare to the mitigating circumstances presented by the defendant.
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2492.148,2494.833,"General Monk, while you're interrupted."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2501.753,2502.302,That's correct.
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2502.302,2506.537,--has the Appellate Court in Maryland construed that Statute and held that that is a correct instruction?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2506.537,2506.971,Yes.
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.971,2508.156,It has?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2508.156,2508.639,Yes.
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.746,2548.114,"Yes, but General Monk, doesn't the jury also know that?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2551.399,2578.884,"Well, Justice Stevens, I think that goes back to my earlier point that I... and I think it's a legislative judgment that Maryland has made that there's a role to play for victim impact evidence when we get to that final stage, after we have determined that this is an aggravated murder, and we have met all the other prerequisites of principal in the first degree and so forth, when we get to the weighing of the moral judgment, the Maryland General Assembly has said, Why can't we have a limited introduction of the impact of the crime upon the victim?"
1986.86-5020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.555,2588.207,And makes it more likely that it will impose the death sentence?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2588.207,2590.608,"--Well, I don't think that you can necessarily come to that conclusion."
1986.86-5020,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.226,2595.512,Don't you go too far when you say that the jury knows that he has a family?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2601.249,2601.766,--He does have a family.
1986.86-5020,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2601.766,2604.868,Just as the jury knows that he may have had a deprived childhood.
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2609.355,2611.088,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2611.088,2619.378,xxx... impact statement that would help the criminal?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2619.378,2626.984,"Well, I can imagine the victim impact statement that would not, in any way, indicate or add to the aggravating quality of the crime."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.57,2637.172,Do you think that would help?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2637.172,2640.124,"--Well, I don't think it would add to the heinous nature of the crime."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2640.124,2642.243,"My question was, help."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2642.243,2644.695,"Well, obviously, he committed this murder."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2645.661,2646.295,Nothing would help--
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2646.295,2648.897,--from the victim's side of the equation.
1986.86-5020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2661.138,2671.445,"--Mr. Monk, what is the relevance of the recommendation of the surviving family members as to the proper punishment to be imposed?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2671.445,2679.266,"Under Maryland's procedure, they are explicitly not permitted to make any demand for death penalty or what... any recommendation whatsoever."
1986.86-5020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2679.266,2686.938,Wasnt' there something in the Victim Impact Statement here that really incorporated their recommendations?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2686.938,2688.905,"Well, I think there were two comments that are--"
1986.86-5020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2688.905,2689.64,Right.

1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2719.909,2720.359,--I do not.
1986.86-5020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2724.045,2727.515,And so what would you do to the extent they're included?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2729.549,2730.015,They should be redacted--
1986.86-5020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2730.015,2730.701,--from the statement?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2731.217,2733.253,--The trial court should redact any such statements?
1986.86-5020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2733.253,2737.288,"--And arguably, a couple of these should have been redacted?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2737.288,2739.923,"Well, I think reasonable minds could differ on whether they could or they couldn't."
1986.86-5020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2773.711,2781.667,"Mr. Monk, while we're talking about Maryland practice, could the substance of this statement have been introduced in the trial itself?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2781.667,2787.904,"No, it could not as far as I can see, Justice Powell."

1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2924.272,2926.741,"--Well, that's essentially... I think that's essentially correct."
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2949.67,2957.943,"Well, when the prosecutor is asking for the death penalty and as he's trying to get it, he uses this because he thinks it will help him attain that goal; doesn't he?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2957.943,2962.164,"--It comes in in every case, whether the prosecutor wants it in or not."

1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2983.327,2984.677,"The probation officer does, yes, Justice."
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2984.677,2994.449,"--And if he finds out that the children of the victim think that it was good riddance, he puts that in the report, too?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2994.449,2996.051,"Well, he puts in whatever--"
1986.86-5020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2996.051,2996.451,Does he?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,2996.451,2997.837,--whatever he finds.

1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3013.046,3015.381,"Obviously, it is."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3028.522,3030.891,--He can't... he can't recommend a sentence.
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3032.074,3035.26,"Well, could he leave out some good things?"
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3036.128,3036.695,"--Of course, he could."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3055.589,3056.506,To the officer?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3056.506,3060.343,"--Well, I... the evidence doesn't have to come in to the probation officer."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3065.564,3067.897,My question was limited to the probation officer.
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3073.318,3077.705,"Well, I assume that he could call the probation officer and ask him how he prepared the report."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.855,3080.907,Can you give me a case on that?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3080.907,3087.645,"--Well, the Statute, itself, permits him to rebut, and I... it seems to me that he can do whatever is reasonable to rebut under the Maryland--"
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3087.645,3089.478,But have you ever heard of it?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3089.478,3090.145,--I have not seen--
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3090.145,3091.78,Have you ever heard of it in Maryland?
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3091.78,3094.049,"--To my knowledge, I have never seen a case where he's called."
1986.86-5020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3094.049,3095.515,I'm sure.
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3095.515,3098.167,But that doesn't... that's not to say that it couldn't be done.
1986.86-5020,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3098.167,3109.308,"General Monk, I assume that the same thing is true of all of the... of all of the aggravating factors that the State doesn't have to introduce everyone of them if it doesn't want to."
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3109.308,3110.591,That is correct.
1986.86-5020,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.591,3116.545,There's no obligation on the State to come forward with an aggravating factor though it may exist.
1986.86-5020,1,19673,charles_o_monk_ii,,3116.545,3123.318,The State needs only to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that one of the aggravating circumstances exist.

1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3156.039,3156.672,--Unless you knew reasonably...--
1986.86-5020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3157.022,3158.039,That's what the holding was?
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3158.039,3158.574,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-5020,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3158.574,3158.974,What is...--
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3159.491,3166.728,Lodowski versus State just cites in the State's brief... it's 302 Md. 691.

1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3216.344,3222.415,"Well, Your Honor, I think all the other aggravating factors are things that are focusing on precisely what the defendant did."
1986.86-5020,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3222.415,3226.384,If you assume that the only thing relevant is how evil is the defendant.
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3226.384,3227.136,How evil--
1986.86-5020,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3227.136,3228.336,How much harm has the defendant done?
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3228.336,3232.17,"--One, and two, whether what he did was foreseeable."
1986.86-5020,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3233.789,3236.574,"If you assume it's... it's those two only, and not, I think--"
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3236.574,3238.174,"--I think that's true, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-5020,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3266.261,3270.563,--You may think that the difference between murder and attempted murder is arbitrary; I don't.
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3271.747,3272.447,"--Justice Scalia, I disagree."
1986.86-5020,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.299,3277.568,A distinction you've drawn between them.
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3277.568,3280.034,--I think it's fairly easy when you look at the situation.
1986.86-5020,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3291.726,3295.363,"When you kill someone, you know he's either going to have a family or he's not going to have a family."
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3295.363,3297.546,I have no control over whether he does.
1986.86-5020,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.578,3325.882,But the intent of the two defendants is exactly the same; they both intended to kill the person.
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3325.882,3326.315,That's true.
1986.86-5020,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.315,3333.988,"And the only reason you punish one more than the other is not because he knew more or he intended more, but simply because he did more harm."
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3335.221,3344.527,"As I pointed out, Justice Scalia, if we accept that, if we accept that, then I think it becomes reasonable to weigh is, who is this victim in the community?"
1986.86-5020,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3397.811,3398.061,That's not comparable.

1986.86-5020,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3408.683,3410.216,--saying some families are worth a lot and other families are worth nothing.
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3411.018,3420.657,"--How can you get away from that is: If I have a family that's loving, caring, articulate, and upset as opposed to: Do I have a family that doesn't care very much for me, doesn't even mildly like me."
1986.86-5020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3421.524,3427.245,"Mr. Burns, may I suggest that you and Justice Scalia are not communicating because he's talking about non-death cases."
1986.86-5020,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,3434.416,3436.082,"--You're right, Justice Stevens, if that's the case."
