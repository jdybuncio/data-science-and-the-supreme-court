1967.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1907.126,1917.53,"Judge Rifkind I take it you don't quarrel with the proposition on law, that's the first of the rules for summary judgment has a burden of showing that are no material issues of fact?"
1967.23,1,41958,simon_h_rifkind,,1917.53,1921.593,"Well of course I do not, that's been the law as long as I can remember the rule of summary judgment."
1967.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1921.593,1925.073,"Yes of course, what you're saying is that was satisfied here?"

1967.23,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3729.872,3731.771,Did you ever notice his deposition?
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3731.771,3736.403,"We were under a stay, Your Honor, this was the proceeding which we asked, give us Jones."
1967.23,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3736.403,3737.591,There was a stay?
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3737.591,3739.546,"A stay, we couldn't serve anything."
1967.23,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3739.546,3743.746,"Did you move that you would be allowed to examine him, is anything--?"
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3743.746,3744.788,"Yes, yes."
1967.23,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3744.788,3747.148,-- is anything beyond those statements?
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3747.148,3753.175,"No, this was an application of the rule 56(f), we had to make our application under rule 56 (f)."
1967.23,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3753.175,3757.28,"Well, that didn't sound like an application to me, it sounded like statement --"
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3757.28,3759.309,"That's a supporting affidavit to a motion, that submits this --"
1967.23,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3759.309,3763.854,Did you make an application that you be allowed to examine Jones?
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3763.854,3766.636,Yes.
1967.23,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3766.636,3768.654,Was that one of the things to which you referred?
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3768.654,3780.4,"I am reading from it, “and submits this affidavit pursuant to rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in opposition to the defendant's Cities Service motion for summary judgment,” the very first affidavit submitted on this proceeding."
1967.23,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3780.4,3791.41,"Alright, your position is that's an application for leave to take Jones' deposition, I understand your position, but it sounded like to me."
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3791.41,3793.399,A whole series of other peoples' depositions as well.
1967.23,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3793.399,3796.438,"Where is it, do you know?"
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3796.438,3801.122,"Where is it in the record, we have a page reference to it in our briefs."
1967.23,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3828.023,3835.251,"Which of these four separate occasions that you ask for are general discovery, can you give me those?"
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3835.251,3853.823,"The first one in May in December of 1958 when the motion, when the deposition of plaintiff had gone on for some 66 occasions, we came in and said allow us to terminate our deposition and to go forward with the depositions of the plaintiff."
1967.23,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3857.141,3858.249,1958.

1967.23,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3868.334,3870.267,When was the next time --?
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3870.267,3873.454,In connection with rule 56(f) our position is --
1967.23,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3873.454,3875.455,56(f) is not general.
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3875.455,3878.043,"I say it is, and I was coming to that point Your Honor."
1967.23,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3957.191,3958.091,You have got five minutes.
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3958.091,3958.47,"Oh, I am sorry."
1967.23,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3959.975,3969.212,"Let's assume that we decide it in your favor, what would you do in the district court to oppose another motion for summary judgment?"
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3969.212,3976.161,I hope I'd get the permission -- I hope I would get the opportunity to conduct discovery of all the defendants in the case before motions come on.
1967.23,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3976.161,3978.964,How about Cities Service?
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,3978.964,3984.646,"Yes, we haven't had, we have not had general discovery of Cities Service, we haven't had the opportunity to develop this on the record."
1967.23,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4003.608,4004.837,Did you pick those?
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,4004.837,4018.187,"No, we wanted them of course, but we wanted Jones long before he died, these were the survivors that we were given the right to examine and under the most restrictive discovery order I've ever seen in the district court anywhere, it's set forth in the provisions of our brief."
1967.23,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4028.96,4031.541,"Well, suppose you get Mr. Jones now?"
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,4031.541,4037.408,We can obtain complete discovery of Cities files to find out what Jones did when he went to Kuwait.
1967.23,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4047.952,4053.652,As I read correctly in your reply brief that Jones didn't tell anybody anything?
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,4053.652,4057.928,"Jones was apparently an individual who kept things to himself, that's right."
1967.23,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4096.341,4098.247,[Inaudible]
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,4098.247,4112.256,"Yes, I was coming to Paula case, I think Paula case makes it quite clear that summary judgment I think all of the bench was in agreement on this point that you can't decide complex summary antitrust cases until everybody has an adequate discovery."
1967.23,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4150.898,4152.272,[Inaudible]
1967.23,2,45177,william_e_kelly,,4152.272,4168.631,Yes Mr. Justice White my associate hands me a record reference to Mr. Lane's affidavit in 1960 it's in the record of page 11449.
1967.23,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4239.741,4246.076,Very well.
