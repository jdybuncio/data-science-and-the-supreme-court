1998.98-238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.057,"We'll hear argument now in Number 98-238, Togo West v. Michael Gibson."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,9.357,13.25,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,48.803,55.057,"But it doesn't specifically say by the EEOC in that section, does it?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,55.057,61.753,"No, it doesn't, Mr. Chief Justice, but we believe that the two sections, read together, provide the EEOC with that authority."
1998.98-238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,73.822,78.286,So many administrative agencies award compensatory damages?
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,78.286,79.515,"--Yes, they do."
1998.98-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,86.249,91.783,In those instances is there judicial review from the amount... from the agency award?
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,91.783,102.481,"If an employee or applicant for employment is dissatisfied with the award that's made at the administrative level, he can bring an action de novo in district court."
1998.98-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,102.481,103.531,What about the Government?
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,103.531,104.632,"The agency does not, though."
1998.98-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,104.632,119.292,"So in the other statutory instances that you mentioned in your answer to the Chief Justice, I'm curious to know, are there any instances in which the Government is bound and cannot have judicial review of the amount of compensatory damages awarded by an agency?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,119.292,124.093,There are other statutory schemes that are somewhat similar.
1998.98-238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,132.609,140.346,So the Solicitor General is arguing here for the proposition that the Government is subject to unreviewable damage awards on the part of the EEOC.
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,140.346,154.074,"Essentially, yes, Your Honor, that Congress made that determination in 1972 when it provided that only employees and applicants for employment can challenge EEOC awards."
1998.98-238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.074,156.665,But at that time there were no compensatory damages available.
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,156.665,168.483,"That's correct, Your Honor, but there were back pay awards and other sorts of awards, including reinstatement, promotion and so on, that in many senses are more intrusive to agencies than compensatory damages."
1998.98-238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,181.042,187.347,The Government would have the usual appeal if the damages were awarded in the district court.
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,187.347,189.257,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.98-238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,216.084,218.826,May I just clarify one other thing about the damages.
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,231.455,232.656,"Yes, Your Honor--"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,232.656,233.536,Okay.
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,233.536,234.167,--he may.
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,234.167,235.87,And one further clarification.
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,256.161,257.201,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-238,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,279.567,289.131,"It might have made sense for Congress to say, if you want damages you go immediately to court, and if you don't want damages, you can go to the EEOC."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,289.131,291.885,"It might have made sense, but Congress did not say that."
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,301.139,316.981,"But you say... it's not exhaustion once it's an option that the employee can go there or not, and the second leg of your argument that I'm having difficulty with, I don't understand the extent of your exhaustion, waiver, or whatever."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,348.406,355.649,It would be our position in that situation that he would forfeit that by not asking for them at the agency level as well.
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,355.649,360.603,Is it true that most of these people at the agency level are not represented by counsel?
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,360.603,364.334,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor, at least a large number of them are not."
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,369.567,376.853,"Well, a lay person, really, terms like compensatory damages, they're not familiar with those words."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,400.097,407.294,There's no requirement that an employee be specifically advised of what sort of remedies he can receive.
1998.98-238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.733,444.977,"Well, how does the agency know, then, what amount of compensatory damages are being sought when it's defending these charges in the EEOC?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,444.977,459.618,"Well, presumably the employee, if he has made a claim for compensatory damages, bears the burden of proof, and the EEOC has held this, of establishing both the amount and the nexus to the alleged discrimination."
1998.98-238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,459.618,469.505,"Does the employee file some sort of a paper that says, you know, I want 50,000 dollars in compensatory damages before the... in the EEOC proceeding?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,469.505,484.594,"Well, the second step, actually the administrative process is the filing of a formal complaint at the agency level and that typically, as in this case, asks the employee what relief are you asking for, and in this case Mr. Gibson requested back pay."
1998.98-238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.074,492.699,And so... but under your view he didn't waive compensatory damages by not asking for them?
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,492.699,499.935,That's... the view that the EEOC has taken is that he doesn't necessarily have to request them in his complaint or in particular words--
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,499.935,500.496,"Well then, how--"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,500.496,503.538,--but he does have to identify the need for compensatory damages at some point.
1998.98-238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,503.538,510.103,--How does the agency know how to defend against a complaint like that if it doesn't even request compensatory damages?
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,510.103,519.078,"Well, typically that is why it's our position that the employee does need to waive the compensatory damages claim if the--"
1998.98-238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,519.078,520.772,I thought you said just a minute ago he didn't have to.
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,520.772,522.22,"--No, certainly he does."
1998.98-238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.339,545.576,"Well, but could it be at the very... I mean, if he doesn't have to do it in his complaint, which is where most claims for compensatory damages are made, could be doe it at the very end?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,545.576,556.125,"Well, then there would have to be an investigation to determine the amount of his claim and whether it is connected with the alleged discrimination, so at some point there would be a fact-finding process."
1998.98-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.033,575.596,Doesn't it put the agency in a rather peculiar position?
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,597.632,610.969,The EEOC has held that it's appropriate when an employee indicates that he suffered that kind of damage to make further inquiry to see if what he is really seeking are compensatory damages--
1998.98-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.969,615.082,I thought you said... I thought you were referring about the agency by which he is was employed.
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,617.423,618.094,"--That's correct, yes."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,618.094,618.465,Now--
1998.98-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.465,619.064,And there's a--
1998.98-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.064,622.557,"--And you say he has to make the compensatory claim before that agency, as well."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,622.557,632.845,"--Yes, although the EEOC has said that in some instances he may defer raising the claim if he's not aware of it until he gets to the EEOC level, the second level."
1998.98-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,637.637,640.609,"But he ordinarily has to raise it before the employing agency, right?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,640.609,641.05,Yes.
1998.98-238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.05,648.743,"And you're saying that the employing agency is going, what, out of the goodness of its heart, to advise him that he has a compensatory claim which it should pay?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,658.36,662.905,"Yes, he does, it does, and--"
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,662.905,664.076,"Well, Ms. McDowell, this--"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,664.076,665.256,--the EEOC has felt that--
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.256,691.752,"--the requirements, this is a peculiar kind of thing, but the... isn't the agency required to have an EEO officer who, when people complain about discrimination, is there to aid the person, so you have the agency both as being assistant to the complainant, and the agency is the adversary, but am I wrong in thinking that the agency is obliged to have an EEO counselor?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,691.752,702.712,"--Yes, and that's the very initial phase of the whole EEO process, is informal counseling, and this is an effort to try to resolve these complaints before a formal complaint is filed."
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,702.712,704.241,By the agency that would be the adversary?
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,704.241,705.393,Yes.
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,705.393,706.202,The informal counseling.
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,706.202,709.795,"Yes, that is a counselor of that agency, yes."
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,709.795,735.731,"And that's kind of a conflict of interest, where the agency is counseling the employee, and presumably that's to tell the employee what his rights are, and then the agency ends up being the target of whatever complaint the employee files, but the agency does have that obligation, to be a counselor to the employee."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,735.731,742.296,"That's correct, and as a practical matter there are different people performing these different functions within the agency."
1998.98-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,749.742,764.771,"Turning back to the sovereign immunity basic issue, are there any of these other statutes in which the agency has discretion to determine the scope of a sovereign immunity waiver?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,764.771,768.492,We're not arguing that the agency has the discretion to determine--
1998.98-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,768.492,772.055,"Well, I thought you argued Chevron deference as to what is an appropriate remedy."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,774.747,780.01,"--We don't perceive that we were making precisely that argument, Your Honor."
1998.98-238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,797.201,800.955,"Well, your brief says... your brief quotes the Chevron rule that you can fill in gaps that are left."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,811.793,817.265,"--Not that we're aware of, Your Honor, no."
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,850.978,872.283,"What would happen if the employee goes to the agency, gets counseled by the EEO advisor, who doesn't say anything abut the various types of damages, skips over the EEOC, goes directly to the court, at that point the employee has a lawyer and asks for back pay, compensatory damages, whatever."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,876.206,877.578,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.481,896.388,"Even though we are envisioning an uncounseled employee, and an officer in the agency who has the obligation to advise this uncounseled person about his rights?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,896.388,916.572,"There's an obligation to advise about rights, but there's no requirement to advise about what remedies he should be requesting in the administrative process, so yes, we would say that his failure to exhaust administrative remedies by not requesting compensatory damages from the agency would require the dismissal of his claim."
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,942.819,952.787,"It seems to me that if the EEOC is monitoring their system, it's very odd that there aren't instructions, as there are in many cases."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,978.141,988.89,"Well, in many circumstances, Your Honor, somebody who is seeking relief from the Government is required to inform himself or herself of what the statutory remedies provide."
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,989.521,999.467,"Yes, well, usually when we go to court, that's a different kind of setting, but here we're before the agency, where it's supposed to be not an adversary relationship at first, at the very first stage."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1019.629,1028.124,"--Well, as we say, it wouldn't entirely preclude an employee who could establish once he went to court that he had a good reason for not having raised the claim before."
1998.98-238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1051.892,1071.536,"Well, who is informing them, then, if they're now asking for something that a lay person would... that term, as you said, that magic term wouldn't spring into the head of uncounseled... so you said... and that may be what's happening now, but are they being advised by someone that there is this possibility?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1071.536,1099.723,"--Well, as I indicated previously, once an employee puts the agency on notice that he suffered emotional loss, medical expenses, something of that nature, then the agency is supposed to make inquiry, but as a general matter in every case across the board there's no instruction from the EEOC that employees have to advise... employers have to advise employees of any particular remedies that are available to them, whether it's back pay or a statement of compensatory--"
1998.98-238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.723,1105.049,"May I ask you a factual question just to... in... you said I think there are 7,000 complaints with the EEOC every year."
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1107.421,1108.479,"--That's correct, yes."
1998.98-238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1108.479,1112.333,"And in 80 percent of those, damages have been awarded by the EEOC?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1112.333,1112.704,No.
1998.98-238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.327,1123.951,"And... but what roughly is the percent in which claims of compensatory damages are made, do you know?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1125.713,1126.312,--That's the 80 percent.
1998.98-238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.312,1126.963,"--Oh, that's the 80 percent?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1126.963,1127.324,Yes.
1998.98-238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.324,1131.674,"Oh, I see, but they're... now, does the EEOC write some kind of an opinion when it disposes of these cases?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1131.674,1132.515,"Yes, it does."
1998.98-238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.515,1134.047,"And they're all reported, are they?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1134.047,1136.498,They're reported on West Law.
1998.98-238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.572,1152.258,"And there are cases in which the EEOC has awarded damages, and then the employee later sued and got more damages in court?"
1998.98-238,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1152.258,1156.551,I'm not aware of any actual cases in which that happened.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,1666.054,1673.828,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-238,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1752.38,1758.774,And I suppose it goes to the obligation to raise the issue at the agency level.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,1769.953,1793.531,"And that's exactly our position both in the district court and in the Seventh Circuit with respect to Mike Gibson's exhausting his administrative remedies and the argument that the Government ought to be estopped from raising the bar of exhaustion in this particular case, because the facts are undisputed that Mike Gibson was never advised of a right to compensatory damages."
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1793.531,1794.07,Mr. Kelly--
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,1794.07,1794.791,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.791,1798.474,"--the records, your client's name is Michael Gibson on the record."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,1800.935,1804.517,"Only because that's how I know him, Judge."
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1804.517,1806.518,"Well, this is a court, not a jury."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,1806.518,1808.959,"Mr. Chief Justice, and I apologize."
1998.98-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.959,1811.661,You have a bad form there.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,1812.823,1813.504,Well--
1998.98-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.504,1821.739,"The fact that that doesn't clearly say... and I agree with you, corrective action does not suggest compensatory damages."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,1826.921,1828.353,"--Well, and--"
1998.98-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.353,1832.064,"I mean, they have to make... well, I'm... I shouldn't be critical."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,1842.402,1847.384,"--Well, and Justice Scalia we have argued all three of those grounds."
1998.98-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.692,1866.648,"--Well, we didn't grant cert on that, did we, and if it came to that we would probably... my guess is remand to let them figure that out."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,1866.648,1888.521,"--You did not, Your Honor, but the opinions of this Court indicate that it's the judgment that's reviewed not the reasoning of the court of appeals, and all of the arguments that we've presented are strong reasons to affirm the judgment of the court of appeals if not according to the same reasoning, and we do agree with the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit."
1998.98-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1912.968,1917.082,"Well, that... I repeat, that's really not the issue that we're interested in."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,1941.387,1955.188,"Well, in that event, Your Honor, we have argued also that Mike Gibson invoked the compensatory damage remedy by telling the investigator from the Veterans Administration that he was seeking a monetary cash award."
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.991,2020.35,"Where are you reading from, Mr. Kelly?"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2020.35,2026.247,--I'm reading from section 1981a(c).
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2026.247,2027.156,And where will we find that in the brief?
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2027.156,2042.877,"Your Honor, that's in the appendix to the cert petition, page... that's page 32a."
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2042.877,2043.886,Thank you.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2043.886,2058.387,"The statute says, if a complaining party seeks compensatory or punitive damages, then either party may demand a trial by jury."
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.636,2091.987,And yet clearly no party can demand a trial by jury before the EEOC.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2091.987,2104.437,"--Clearly, which is why we interpret section 1981a to provide for compensatory damages at the Federal district court level, not at the administrative level."
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.396,2135.596,This is (a)(1) you're reading from?
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2135.596,2138.658,--This is (a)(1) of 1981a.
1998.98-238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2188.042,2210.045,"Well, I don't... I... going back for a second to your jury trial, which is the point that is confusing me at the moment, I might agree with you... I don't see how... the Government originally said that if it's not an administrative action there'll be a lot of extra time, expense, disruption, delay to give them... you remember that in their brief, or petition for cert.--"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2210.045,2211.047,"I do, Your Honor."
1998.98-238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2211.047,2211.818,--All right.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2242.115,2243.317,In--
1998.98-238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.317,2245.879,And it's under this section you get the jury trial right.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2245.879,2247.631,--And it's--
1998.98-238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2247.631,2251.011,"My question is, can you elucidate that a little bit?"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2282.383,2294.752,"--I'm sorry, Justice, I'm not understanding in what circumstance you might not get a jury... the right to a jury trial if you went to court."
1998.98-238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.822,2306.901,"What they say in their brief is, a Federal employee may not be proceeding under this section, within the meaning of section 1981a(c)(1), which he seeks compensatory damages under the administrative process."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2318.676,2334.577,"--As I understand the Government's argument, it is that they're proceeding under section 717, or section 2000e-16, that is, rather than under section 1981a, and I think that there are several problems with that approach."
1998.98-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2334.577,2341.623,"Mr. Kelly, before you describe the problems, did you understand that to... the Government to be saying that there's no right to jury trial in the court?"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2347.486,2350.489,"That's the way that I understood it, Your Honor."
1998.98-238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.489,2351.768,Maybe that's the explanation.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2420.052,2435.914,"Well, and Judge, I think that the answer to that is that the title VII procedures for Federal employees have always been perceived as primarily a conciliatory mechanism and not necessarily an adjudicatory one."
1998.98-238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2498.676,2503.909,"Before you go onto that, can you go back to what you said before, because I'm not sure I grasped it."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2521.19,2540.824,"It... Judge, it's... it's our... I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg, it's our understanding that the Government, like a private litigant, is able to offer relief or damages in settlement in anticipation of a liability."
1998.98-238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2557.604,2565.448,But I didn't know that the agencies had authority to voluntarily waive sovereign immunity unless Congress sanctioned that.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2565.448,2572.995,"--Well, it's our position that they don't have the ability to voluntarily waive sovereign immunity."
1998.98-238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2572.995,2576.658,But you just said that they could make a settlement that included--
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2576.658,2577.367,And--
1998.98-238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2577.367,2578.899,--compensatory damages.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2578.899,2593.228,"--And it's my understanding that the Federal Government is able to make a settlement, to engage in voluntary negotiation in the same way that a private party is, which is different than the exercise of Government--"
1998.98-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.228,2595.659,"There's some general settlement statute, isn't there?"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2596.881,2610.448,--I believe that this is... and there's... the Comptroller General's Office has issued regulations that indicate that a settlement in anticipation of litigation is an appropriate means for--
1998.98-238,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2610.448,2611.63,Isn't that the answer?
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2631.342,2633.364,--That's much more succinct than--
1998.98-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.364,2646.393,"The trouble is, I don't know of any settlement authority to settle for more than is asked for, and what you're allowed to ask the agency for is restitution, you know, back pay and reinstatement."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2663.144,2668.189,--I'm not... I'm not sure if it was a question.
1998.98-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.189,2680.657,"That's what you're saying, isn't it, that you can come before an agency with no compensatory claims, just reinstatement and back pay, and say, you know, I want 100,000 dollars and the agency says, well, you know, we'll settle for two."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2681.286,2697.928,"Like any other litigants, if the complainant says, if you don't give me 100,000 dollars I'll take you to court, I think that the agency has the ability to take into consideration a compensatory damage claim that will be made in the future in order to settle the case in--"
1998.98-238,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2697.928,2703.361,"So all he has to say is, I want back pay, I want reinstatement, and I want 100,000 dollars."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2703.361,2704.821,--Right.
1998.98-238,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2704.821,2706.854,"And if you don't give it to me, I'm going to go to court."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2706.854,2722.124,"That's right, and it's clear that Congress... whether he's correct or not in wanting 100,000 dollars for compensatory damages, it's clear that Congress gave him the right to go to court whether he gets it or not."
1998.98-238,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2722.124,2730.128,"Are you... you were in the midst of four reasons, and the first one was the, I guess relative objectivity of the court."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2730.128,2730.957,That's right.
1998.98-238,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2737.963,2745.717,"Yes, but isn't the danger not that executive officials are going to give the bank away, but that a jury is going to give the bank away?"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2745.717,2756.577,"--Well, and that's the second reason, Your Honor, and that's the expertise of the Federal district court and juries in awarding compensatory damages."
1998.98-238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.37,2764.781,"Of course, your--"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2779.891,2784.964,"Well, there are no punitive damages available against the Federal Government."
1998.98-238,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2784.964,2788.397,You're basically... you've clarified--
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2828.344,2828.895,The--
1998.98-238,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2828.895,2830.185,"--and if so, where is it?"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2830.185,2839.231,"--The same section, subsection (b), indicates that the EEOC may promulgate rules, regulations, orders--"
1998.98-238,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2839.231,2839.641,Right.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2839.641,2840.282,--and so forth.
1998.98-238,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.282,2844.593,"But decide cases on review of decisions by other agencies, does anything say that?"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2844.593,2859.493,"Well, there's a... kind of a glancing blow that idea in section 2000e-16(c), which refers to the procedure that needs to be followed before the case goes to Federal district court."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2866.078,2865.588,I see.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2866.559,2867.12,--there is an appeal to the EEOC--
1998.98-238,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2867.12,2867.46,Thank you.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2867.46,2869.63,--then the time limit after the EEOC.
1998.98-238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2869.63,2871.301,Do you just... one quick thing.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2905.646,2907.836,There are some published statistics.
1998.98-238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2929.48,2933.654,So there's some kind of practice and history of them awarding compensatory damages.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2933.654,2976.912,"Well, beginning in 1992 with the Jackson decision, which by the way is not published, and was not published in West Law or any of the private reporters, not all EEOC decisions are published in those sources, but beginning in 1992, agencies grudgingly began to award compensatory damages, or at least consider awards of compensatory damages in certain cases, and the EEOC generally has remanded cases for consideration of compensatory damages rather than awarding them itself, but there are some cases where the EEOC has awarded compensatory damages."
1998.98-238,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2976.912,2978.752,Can you go back and finish your fourth... I mean--
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,2988.459,3003.599,"The third reason I think is parity of Federal employees and private employees, and in this situation, finally I think Congress has managed to put Federal employees and private employees on an equal standing with regard to compensatory damages."
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.212,3014.818,"But they have not put private employers and Federal employers on a parity, have they, for damages?"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,3014.818,3018.199,They... with respect to--
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3018.199,3020.492,So far as the right to go from the agency to court.
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,3020.492,3026.195,"--With respect to all of the damages except punitive damages, I believe that they are on a parity."
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3026.195,3033.729,"Well, a private employer can appeal an EEOC award to the district court, can it not?"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,3033.729,3037.403,The EEOC doesn't make awards against private employers.
1998.98-238,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3044.877,3046.369,So it has to go to court itself to--
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,3046.369,3049.911,"--Those cases go to court, or they're settled before they get to court."
1998.98-238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3049.911,3053.842,"--And how does it work with the legislative employees, because that's yet another scheme."
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,3058.707,3069.132,"Well, the congressional Accountability Act sets up I think yet another scheme, administrative scheme for awarding compensatory damages, and that's an election system."
1998.98-238,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3092.938,3108.509,"In the... for the legislative employee, if he elects the administrative route, the EEOC route, is... can he, as in the case of an executive employee, go to court at the end of the line for de novo review if he's dissatisfied?"
1998.98-238,1,42904,timothy_m_kelly,,3108.509,3109.089,No.
1998.98-238,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3434.461,3439.486,To respond to Justice Breyer's question--
1998.98-238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3439.486,3440.057,"No, no, you needn't."
1998.98-238,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3445.941,3446.402,--Yes.
1998.98-238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3447.06,3447.471,Okay.
1998.98-238,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3448.542,3453.405,--position that there is a jury trial if the case ripens into an action into district court.
1998.98-238,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3486.126,3488.207,"Agency level, do you mean EEOC, or the original--"
1998.98-238,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3488.207,3490.129,"--No, the agency level, the initial level."
1998.98-238,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3501.677,3502.515,"--Yes, I have one--"
1998.98-238,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3502.515,3502.986,--Oh.
1998.98-238,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3502.986,3507.931,"--further, and that's again on the forfeiture, or waiver, whatever you call it."
1998.98-238,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3536.75,3537.031,Yes.
1998.98-238,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3552.901,3553.672,"Thank you, Ms. McDowell."
