2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.904,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-10245, Freeman v. United States."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,8.856,11.572,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,113.339,129.516,"If -- if we issue an opinion and we analyze the statute's language, the statute's purpose, and the statute's legislative history, would the opinion, the judgment be based on each of those or -- or not?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,137.455,139.074,--Yes.
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,156.166,156.868,No.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,157.485,157.985,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,157.985,160.504,--I think my question goes in a different direction.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,182.268,185.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, we don't believe that that's mutually exclusive."
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,193.041,211.587,"You quote one definition of -- the noun ""base"" in your brief uses a point from which something can develop, but you omit another standard definition of the term, the principal element or -- or ingredient of anything, considered as its fundamental part."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,213.789,224.512,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think the dictionary definition that we've given encompasses the definition that Your Honor has just -- just described."
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,227.298,228.831,"Well, there's two -- there are two different definitions."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,239.77,242.989,"--Well -- well, our contention is--"
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,242.989,258.516,"Now, if you use the latter definition, you have to decide which is more fundamental here, the agreement between the parties or the sentencing guidelines, which certainly provided the starting point for the analysis of the sentence by the -- by the district court."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,258.516,260.266,"--Justice Alito, that's correct."
2010.09-10245,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,267.622,289.12,"Isn't it enough for you to say -- or based not in whole, but in part -- based on, something could be based on several things, and one of them is the guidelines that then existed?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,289.12,289.52,--Certainly.
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,295.589,300.927,"Well, then are you saying the plea agreement was based on the fact that he was caught with -- with two guns rather than four guns?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,315.27,315.82,--Well--
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,315.82,320.222,--which makes the -- which makes the statutory language largely mute on this.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,320.222,325.626,"--Well, Your Honor, the -- the sentence is based on a number of guidelines."
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,336.766,340.718,"Well, it's also based on things that are not reflected in the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,364.418,366.986,--It would have been 117 months.
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,366.986,374.575,So he figures it's better for me to get -- it's based on his decision that I -- 106 months is better than the risk of 117.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,374.575,385.783,"Well, certainly there are a number of factors that go into plea bargaining and negotiation, but what -- I think what the court has to look at is what is said in that plea agreement."
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,398.674,402.643,"What sentence would he have gotten if he were just sentenced under the guidelines, no plea agreement?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,402.643,405.947,"--He would have got the -- he would have received the same sentence, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,405.947,407.313,"Well -- well, how do we know that?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,407.313,407.68,Well--
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,407.68,408.63,The guidelines give you a range.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,410.649,413.85,--But -- but the plea agreement here was for the bottom of the guidelines.
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,415.385,415.835,"No, I know."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,422.672,427.11,"--It would have been left -- left -- well, assume it depends upon the nature of the plea, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,428.026,428.776,There's no plea.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,430.395,433.68,--It would be somewhere within that guideline range.
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,434.03,439.668,So how can you say that this is based on the guideline range when the guideline range would not have been determinative?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,439.668,444.37,"Well -- well, we're looking -- we're looking at the content of the plea agreement, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,445.988,448.606,"Yes, I know, but my hypothetical is in a different context."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,448.606,460.914,"--But even -- even at that, Your Honor, if -- that sentence ultimately is going to be based on a guideline range, and if that guideline range is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, then the--"
2010.09-10245,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,460.914,469.103,"Counsel, could you -- maybe it would be easier if you would describe to us the situations you don't think would be based on the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,491.1,491.916,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,492.468,493.285,All right.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,505.443,507.145,"Possibly, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,507.145,507.912,All right.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,515.382,526.774,"Your Honor, the -- the Sentencing Commission, in 1B1.10 note 3, says that a below-guideline sentence can be based on the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,526.774,532.26,So there -- the Solicitor General is right; there really isn't any situation that you're claiming is not based on?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,532.26,533.462,"Oh -- oh, no, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,535.362,536.831,Give me the examples.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,536.831,537.447,All right.
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,580.693,584.895,"Well, wouldn't the guidelines, even in that situation, provide the starting point for analysis?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,601.94,603.207,That -- that's true.
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,606.809,608.678,So why wouldn't that be based on the guidelines?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,611.712,619.616,"--It -- Your Honor, it would not be based on the guidelines if those other factors were the motivating reason for the imposition of the sentence."
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,619.616,620.651,"Sorry, I don't understand that."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,622.784,624.186,"They do, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,624.186,639.612,"Well -- and aren't you giving a guideline sentence, if you give your reasons as is required by the Sentencing Commission in 6B1.2 and you say -- the judge says, I think this is a special case and, therefore, I am giving a lower sentence?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,644.183,648.385,If the parties can show that the sentence is tied to the guidelines.
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,648.385,649.851,"Well, how could it not be?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,660.109,664.395,"In that instance, he would be -- he would be applying it."
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,664.395,674.868,"Whether he gives the specific robbery 3-point whatever it is, 17 months, or whether he says, I have a special case and I depart under section 5 of the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,676.987,686.593,"If the -- if the judge were to take -- were to actually apply those guidelines and say, based on that guideline, I am going to depart, that sentence is based on the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,686.593,691.212,So from what base does a judge depart downward?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,699.901,704.322,"I think it would depend on the nature of the agreement, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,709.292,728.753,"So aren't you just asking us to permit district court judges to make up their own C agreement, to decide what the parties would have done in the absence of a higher range?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,737.276,738.728,"No -- no, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,742.347,778.353,"Mr. Heft, are you relying on -- this was -- this is a plea agreement that said, specifically, defendant agrees to have his sentence determined pursuant to the guidelines, and then the judge says that he was adopting the probation report and the application of the guidelines as set out therein, so both the -- the defendant says, I agreed to a determination pursuant to the guidelines, and the judge says, I'm going to apply the guidelines in giving you your sentence."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,791.661,808.67,"That is correct, Your Honor, and that's why we've asked the Court not to take a categorical approach to this issue, but to take either a case-by-case approach or a record-based analysis, to allow the district judge to determine, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, what our -- you know, what is the--"
2010.09-10245,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,808.67,816.109,"Mr. Heft, would you require those kinds of statements in the agreement or in the colloquy in order to satisfy the standard?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,818.811,821.263,"--That's certainly problematic, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-10245,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,851.365,853.901,"Mr. Heft, that seems very complicated."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,869.911,872.363,"Respectfully, Your Honor, I disagree."
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,896.909,903.715,"Well, in every case, they have to go through the guidelines calculation, and the parties have the opportunity to object to the calculation, right?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,903.715,904.582,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,904.582,914.571,"So what does paragraph 12 of the plea agreement contribute here, other than with respect to the fine and things besides the sentence that we're talking about?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,919.225,923.426,"I -- well, Your Honor, I think it does, Justice Alito."
2010.09-10245,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.877,969.99,Can a -- can a sentencing judge be found to have abused his or her discretion in approving a plea -- a C plea agreement which provides for less than the minimum guideline sentence and gives no -- no particular reason for that?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,975.728,990.321,"--Well, Your Honor, under -- under section 3742, the government could -- could appeal an incorrect application of the guidelines if that's what Your Honor is referring to."
2010.09-10245,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.321,991.654,Well--
2010.09-10245,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,991.654,1011.751,"But now you're talking about a plea agreement, which the government has consented to whatever this agreement is and whether -- whether -- sometimes a plea agreement will say okay, if you take a plea, we'll drop certain charges or we'll charge a small amount -- value of the drug."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1014.436,1015.319,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.315,1032.031,--Let -- let me ask my question a different way.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1052.894,1054.513,Yes.
2010.09-10245,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.965,1068.154,"Then, if that's the case, then every plea agreement is based on the guidelines, every single one, because the judge always has to consider how do the guidelines apply to this plea agreement."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1068.154,1077.26,"Well, Justice Scalia, consideration of the guidelines alone is not enough to determine whether or not that sentence is actually based on them."
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1077.26,1078.629,I don't understand why you resist that.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1110.23,1112.363,"Well, Your Honor--"
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1112.363,1117.55,"And, of course, the judge now could depart from the guidelines -- I mean, ""vary"", whatever that word -- technical word, is -- ""vary""."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1127.442,1135.429,"--They -- they do; obviously they do consider the guidelines, but then the other question is whether or not the sentence is based on those guidelines--"
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1135.429,1140.416,"Well, how could it not be, since the judge has no power if he is to apply the guideline--"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1140.416,1140.866,--Well--
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.866,1146.32,--to accept any agreement other than agreement that corresponds with the guideline?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1166.3,1167.333,"--That is what it says, Your Honor, but--"
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1167.333,1167.85,Okay.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1172.387,1172.804,--No.
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1172.804,1177.458,"I mean, I thought that was helping you, but if you want to say no, go say no and explain why that is."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1177.808,1182.577,"Your Honor, to go back to the point that Justice Sotomayor made--"
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1182.577,1182.927,Yes.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1182.927,1188.397,"--with the hypotheticals, there still can be C pleas that are not based on the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1188.397,1188.797,How?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1188.797,1190.766,"Well, the example--"
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1190.766,1191.466,Give me an example.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1191.466,1193.8,"--Well, the example that I gave -- I gave previously."
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1193.8,1194.134,What?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1194.134,1195.419,There's a guideline range.
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.419,1195.786,Yes.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1195.786,1202.823,"But the judge bases his decision, his or her decision, solely on other -- factors other than the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1203.942,1206.525,Are we supposed to psychoanalyze the judge?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1232.976,1237.079,"--Well, it depends what the judge does at sentencing, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.079,1239.912,What he does is he applies the guideline sentence.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1256.607,1268.015,"It would -- Your Honor, I would submit it would depend on the nature of the -- the plea agreement, whether or not that sentence is -- is actually based -- going to be based on the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1268.015,1268.465,"Well, I suppose--"
2010.09-10245,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.465,1279.656,"Incidentally, and it sort of bears upon this discussion, are the guidelines mandatory when they are applied in approving a plea agreement?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1296.284,1296.634,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1297.368,1301.57,"You were -- you were just at the very point when we decided Booker, is that right?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1308.676,1310.826,--I believe it was March of 2005.
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1310.826,1311.294,--All right.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1321.249,1321.949,That's true.
2010.09-10245,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1321.949,1322.685,It's on the cusp.
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1322.685,1325.401,What if there had been evidence here of that?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1340.178,1342.58,Yes.
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1387.176,1388.226,How would that possibly work?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1413.377,1414.01,Yes.
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1414.01,1426.717,"And then the guideline for that is lowered, and you say in determining whether the defendant is eligible, what -- the government would then have to have a mini-trial and prove that the -- prove count 2?"
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1426.717,1427.169,No.
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1427.869,1428.219,How would it work?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1428.219,1433.407,"--It would work -- assuming that the defendant is eligible, the case is remanded to district court."
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1433.407,1433.89,Right.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1433.89,1439.358,"As in this case, there would be a recalculation of the guidelines to determine if the--"
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1439.358,1439.558,Right.
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1454.568,1462.721,"--That's -- that's up to the district judge's discretion, whether or not to -- to reduce that -- that amended guideline sentence."
2010.09-10245,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1462.721,1465.339,How is the judge going to decide that?
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1465.339,1492.776,"Well, the -- I think that's something that district judges decide every day, whether or not -- because the judge presumably has -- has been -- is familiar with the case, with the presentence report, with the terms of the original plea agreement, with the facts of the case; and the -- and the judge can make an assessment based on those factors whether or not the sentence reduction should be granted and, if so, how much of a reduction should be granted."
2010.09-10245,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.776,1534.77,"But Justice Alito's hypothetical points out -- points up the fact that even though the agreement may mention the guidelines, it may do that just for the purpose of enabling the -- the judge more readily to approve the agreement, but there's no reason to believe that the government is interested in the guidelines, as opposed to being interested in putting this person away for a certain amount of time, especially when another count is dropped and the government says, well, I'll -- you know, I'll drop it if -- if this guy goes to prison for 2 years."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1554.081,1565.455,"Well -- well, the agreement certainly has been -- was modified by the amended guideline, and that's where the district judge has to exercise his or her discretion whether or not to grant that reduction."
2010.09-10245,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1565.455,1575.228,"But in that event, the sweet part would be open to reconsideration too."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1593.474,1595.708,"No, Your -- no, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1610.501,1611.103,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-10245,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,1611.103,1611.87,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.09-10245,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1611.87,1620.126,Mr. Gannon.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1620.126,1622.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-10245,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1643.122,1643.624,Counsel--
2010.09-10245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1643.624,1650.228,"Well, here the agreement at various points says that the parties agree on the calculation of the guideline."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1661.453,1662.885,The court certainly made the--
2010.09-10245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1662.885,1666.654,So it seems to me fair under the statute to say that it is based on the guidelines.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1666.654,1667.356,"--Well, the question--"
2010.09-10245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1667.356,1669.539,And there are other provisions in the agreement you might argue about.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1669.539,1674.324,"--Well, I think the statutory question here isn't just whether the sentence is based on the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1729.344,1734.711,"Well, they do come up with a recommendation, which is three levels below the otherwise applicable guideline."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1734.711,1741.234,"--They -- they come up with a recommendation for purposes of determining the offense level, the base offense level of 22 and then reduced to 19."
2010.09-10245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.234,1742.451,"Yes, but that's all based on the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1742.451,1755.475,"Well, that aspect is based on the guidelines, but then the guideline application computation is incomplete because the next paragraph, paragraph B, says we aren't agreed on what the criminal history is going to be."
2010.09-10245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1770.569,1779.324,But that doesn't mean that the court can't base its conclusion on his independent -- on its independent judgment on the guideline.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1779.324,1788.93,"--Well, I think what I'm trying to say, Justice Kennedy, is the agreement expressly contemplates that the judge needs to determine the applicable guideline range for purposes of determining what the fine will be."
2010.09-10245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1822.151,1826.555,"Well, you're talking about what ""based on"" means, and that's an important part of your argument."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1841.731,1843.881,"Well, I--"
2010.09-10245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1843.881,1851.437,--the last of section 24 says the defendant argues for any sentence other than the one to which he has agreed to and breached the agreement.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1851.437,1857.49,"--Well, at that point the remedy for the breach would be that the United States is relieved of its obligations under the agreement."
2010.09-10245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1857.49,1859.526,Would you -- what would that mean?
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1859.526,1868.882,"Well, I think that's -- that's part of the problem in a case like this where there was a specific sentence agreement, that it's impossible for government to get back the things that it gave up at the time, that were agreed to under--"

2010.09-10245,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1928.354,1934.424,"So you say the judgment's final, so the fact that the plea -- that there's a breach of the plea agreement is irrelevant at this point?"
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1934.424,1944.863,"--Well, I think that the remedy that the agreement contemplates of the government being released from its other obligations in the plea doesn't really leave us much of an option at this point."
2010.09-10245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.812,1993.712,"Mr. Gannon, you assert that the -- within the language of the statutory provision, the sentence here is not based on the guidelines, but it's based on the agreement, and the agreement arguably is based on the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1993.712,2005.687,"I think the agreement is arguably -- I mean, I don't think the face of this agreement proves that it's based on the guidelines, but I -- it is obvious that the parties negotiated in the shadow of the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.687,2018.912,"If -- if you take that position, that ""based on"" means determined by absolutely, then I don't think any sentence would ever be based on the guidelines after Booker/Fanfan."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2018.912,2019.361,Well--
2010.09-10245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.361,2027.683,"The guidelines form part of the consideration of the judge, but the judge's decision is not based on the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2051.466,2061.606,"--Well, I think it's not clear that the judge needed to be considering the guidelines in the course of deciding whether to accept the plea agreement."

2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2086.722,2087.322,Yes.
2010.09-10245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2087.841,2093.126,You -- you have a judge who sentences post-Booker/Fanfan.

2010.09-10245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.809,2152.748,"So you -- you acknowledge that ""based on"" covers post-Booker/Fanfan sentences by the judge?"

2010.09-10245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.266,2156.582,Yes.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2172.842,2180.881,--It is -- the test that we state in the subheading of that section of our brief is whether they're of legal consequence in the determination.
2010.09-10245,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2180.881,2183.048,Defining Mr. Gannon--
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2183.048,2184.0,"Well, our -- the."
2010.09-10245,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2184.0,2186.518,--It's not a binding legal consequence post-Booker.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2186.518,2203.544,"The test that we have for -- the overarching test is whether it is of legal consequence, and the phrase that you're talking about on page 27 of our brief, Justice Kagan, is when we know that there is something that was of binding legal consequence and was controlling, we know that that is the thing that the sentence was based on."
2010.09-10245,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2203.544,2204.563,So that's not your test.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2205.396,2215.335,"Well, that is -- in -- when something literally is controlling the analysis -- the parties' agreement here binds the district judge -- we know that that is what the sentence is based on."
2010.09-10245,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2216.287,2225.56,"Yes, but is -- is there some other instances in which you would say that something is based on, even though it's not of binding legal consequence?"
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2225.56,2230.179,"--Well, it would be of legal consequence even if it weren't controlling."
2010.09-10245,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2245.021,2259.364,"Well, then I'm back with Justice Scalia, because if it's only of legal consequence, not of binding legal consequence, if it's something that somebody considers rather than something that is determinative, it seems to me the same in the non-plea context and in the plea context."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2259.364,2276.993,"--Well, I don't think that's true in the context of a specific sentence agreement under a type C plea because of -- and this is reinforced by the language in the policy statement, 1B1.10, which the Court last term in Dillon held is binding and controls what needs to be done during the sentence reduction proceeding."
2010.09-10245,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2289.585,2296.989,Why doesn't this line of questioning lead logically to the conclusion that no sentence after Booker and Fanfan is based on the guidelines?
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2354.362,2366.335,"Well, I -- I understand the point that the analysis has certainly changed since Booker, but it is still the case that the defendant can appeal an error in application of the guidelines after Booker."
2010.09-10245,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2406.044,2420.602,"Well, I find it hard to -- I find it hard to understand the analysis that would require courts to decide whether some (c)(1)(C) plea agreements are based on the guidelines and some are not based on the guidelines."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2447.085,2457.643,"Well, I think in the context of an actual specific sentence plea agreement, that is the one that we think is off the table, because that is what is going to control the sentence."
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2480.842,2481.475,All right.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2521.283,2522.369,"Well, I -- I--"
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2522.369,2525.454,"How do you want us to take this, pre-Booker or post-Booker?"
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2525.454,2528.239,"--Well, I think that the answer is, it's different."
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2529.773,2533.475,"I know, you think the -- I think it is completely different regardless."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2539.879,2541.914,The sentencing proceeding occurred six months--
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2541.914,2543.264,I want you--
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2543.264,2544.231,--after the Booker opinion came out.
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.231,2544.616,--All right.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2545.966,2546.516,"Yes, but."
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2546.516,2548.318,Then perhaps we should have the pre-argument.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2554.971,2556.721,"I disagree, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.721,2560.673,"I mean, imagine that the that the Sentencing Commission -- imagine."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2622.079,2628.567,"Well, I think that had the Sentencing Commission adopted such a position, and if it were binding on the sentencing judge--"
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2628.567,2629.917,"Oh, it is, because of (a)(4)."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2631.119,2632.035,"--Which is -- well, because--"
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2632.035,2649.981,"--because it says in the sentencing guidelines, Judge, you will apply the guideline, unless you find a circumstance the Commission did not adequately take into account and in respect to that, you may and must consult policy statements, but guidelines and other materials."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2655.885,2669.775,"--Before Booker was decided, it -- several of the circuits had already concluded that a judge could accept a type C plea agreement that had a sentence outside the range, and that that wasn't a guidelines-based sentence."

2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2707.897,2711.618,--because the agreement hadn't given any reason for the judge to -- to leave the guidelines.
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2711.618,2711.951,Correct.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2727.295,2728.411,6B1.2--
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2728.411,2728.878,Exactly.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2728.878,2730.13,--is on the last page of the--
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2730.13,2731.663,You tell me how this differs from what I just said.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2731.663,2733.865,"--Well, I think it differs in two key ways."
2010.09-10245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.615,2737.317,You were about to tell us where it is?
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2737.317,2741.138,--It is on the last page of the government's appendix which is the 16A of our brief.
2010.09-10245,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2757.147,2759.349,But I thought you just told me that -- binding -- was not a part of the test anymore.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2759.349,2765.003,"Well, I -- but the question is whether the judge even had to apply it at all, and the judge did not need to."
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2793.653,2794.355,It's only if.
2010.09-10245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2810.782,2811.9,You're reading a different--
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.9,2812.867,I am?
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2818.471,2821.506,This is for 6B1.3?
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2821.506,2821.89,Yes.
2010.09-10245,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2824.041,2826.993,--He is reading the commentary.
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2826.993,2827.409,--Yes.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2827.409,2832.813,"I've been looking at a text of 6B1.2 itself, which leaves out the word only."
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2855.811,2857.144,I think you're right.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2866.333,2867.217,Well--
2010.09-10245,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2867.217,2871.571,"And then that is what it intended to do and that is what it said it did, but for what we are talking about."
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2896.436,2904.125,"--I -- I do think that -- that this gets puzzling as -- as you get further down, but I think that this is the simplest case."
2010.09-10245,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2941.215,2965.198,"--I don't -- I am not in disagreement with the point you're making, but I think that going back to what had bothered Justice Alito and Justice Scalia on now that the guidelines are not mandatory, is any sentence even under C really based on the agreement?"
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3013.179,3030.189,"Well, because I think that the relevant question for purposes of both 3582(c)(2) and the policy statements that the court said in Dillon controls the -- the process of implementing 3582(c)(2), is what did the judge do at the time of imposing the sentence?"
2010.09-10245,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3082.923,3083.623,--no.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3088.493,3089.06,It was--
2010.09-10245,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3089.06,3094.964,The judge was always capable of saying at the time of sentence I won't accept the 106.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3116.913,3136.207,"--And had he done that the sentencing proceeding would have proceeded differently and it may not even have right occurred then, and -- and I think because under Rule 11 if he was rejecting the plea agreement and -- and the 106 months that the parties had agreed to, he would have to give the defendant the right to withdraw the plea at that point."
2010.09-10245,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3192.877,3199.198,I am not following that argument for this reason.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3243.727,3249.547,Because for purposes of the term of imprisonment the judge was not actually applying the guidelines at that point.
2010.09-10245,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3291.791,3302.348,I thought one of the things in the plea agreement was that the -- that the judge would have the right to himself calculate the guideline range.
2010.09-10245,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3302.348,3303.431,Yes.
2010.09-10245,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3376.61,3377.527,"Thank you, Mr. Gannon."
