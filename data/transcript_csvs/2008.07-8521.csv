2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,8.237,30.185,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about a logical reading of the statute's plain language, and section 3599(a)( 2) that's printed on page 1 of the blue brief provides that when a State death row inmate seeks 2254 relief, he shall be represented by counsel."
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,128.849,143.959,"Your interpretation would make all of the provisions of subsection (e) applicable in State proceedings, so long as there's been a 2254 petition filed."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,143.959,144.81,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,188.72,189.339,I'm sorry.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,193.791,194.291,--Right.
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,202.33,204.849,"Well, that doesn't modify what comes before it, does it?"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,220.375,221.561,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,246.342,246.776,Why not?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,246.776,247.859,"--Well, because, Your Honor--"
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.859,255.782,"That would be a subsequent -- a subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings, his retrial in State courts."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,255.782,275.278,"--Your Honor, the retrial and the trial proceedings that's referred to in subsection (e), those are duties of counsel appointed under (a)( 1) of the statute, which is on page 1a, which would be trial counsel for those defendants charged with a Federal capital crime."
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,295.609,299.561,I don't see how that's possibly a plain reading of the statutory language.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,304.298,305.315,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,305.315,307.916,How do you get that out of the statutory language of (e)?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,307.916,311.451,It's in context with the whole of the statute.
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,318.055,323.342,"So now you're out of the plain language of (e), and you're looking at the context of the whole statute."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,323.342,333.532,"--Your Honor, I would submit that looking at the context of the whole statute is in accordance with also looking at the plain language used by Congress."
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,338.786,341.138,What's your answer to the plain language of (e)?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,346.124,346.624,--Yes.
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,346.624,360.384,"How do you explain under the plain language of (e) why -- how you avoid the result that once habeas counsel is appointed in Federal court, the counsel has to appear in all of these other proceedings?"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,360.384,362.367,Yes--
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,362.367,364.086,"New trial in State court, et cetera."

2008.07-8521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,372.359,373.975,But you are including then.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,407.08,416.269,"Respectfully, Your Honor, the State retrial would be an entirely new case that would not fall under ""all available post-conviction process""."
2008.07-8521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,416.269,416.921,What would?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,428.528,437.634,"Your Honor, 2254 or 2255 proceeding."
2008.07-8521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,477.726,479.878,"Well, but he couldn't find it's inappropriate, could he?"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,511.849,521.888,"--Well, Your Honor, again the key here is that Congress used the word ""appropriate"", and that's an easy legal standard for the Federal judge to determine."
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,535.262,535.798,I'm sorry.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,541.868,563.114,"--Yes, Your Honor, and -- and I would submit that that is a reference to -- if we look at (a)( 2) -- excuse me -- where it says, the very first line, post-conviction proceeding under 2254 and '55 -- so that describes -- all available post-conviction process describes the 2254 or 2255 proceedings."
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,563.114,569.351,So you're just saying a new trial because you succeed on habeas is not postconviction process?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,569.351,573.97,"No, Your Honor, not just by a plain definition of that."
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,573.97,576.636,"Is it -- well then, if you look up earlier in the statute, it says,"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,583.409,584.209,Yes.
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,584.209,585.609,Why -- why doesn't it fall under that?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,585.609,586.361,Yes.
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,602.287,605.989,Why would it not be a subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,605.989,607.822,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,607.822,612.393,Why is it not a subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,612.393,618.463,"Well, under the -- the structure of the statute, there's nothing subsequent--"
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,618.463,631.521,"Without using the words (e), and I'm still struggling to understand what you're doing with the plain language of (e)."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,631.521,631.988,--Okay.
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,678.334,679.034,"No, no, no."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,683.988,684.822,--Yes.
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,684.822,686.857,"You're financially unable, so you get somebody appointed."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,691.559,692.178,Yes--
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,692.178,697.963,"It doesn't say that, oh, if you suddenly get somebody else appointed, you know, then you can -- then he doesn't have that obligation."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,697.963,708.521,"--Your Honor, I would submit that -- that these circumstances that trigger the appointment do carry through the appointment process in that even if you look at the language used by Congress, it says"
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,713.758,724.047,"What if the remand -- what if the remand is for State post-conviction review, and there is no attorney available under State law for State postconviction review?"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,724.047,736.457,"--Yes, Your Honor, then we would be looking again at the first clause of subsection (e), and we would be looking at the language used by Congress, ""any appropriate motions and procedures""."
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.572,760.972,Excuse me.

2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.457,765.824,"It says,"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,770.778,772.963,"--Yes, and then it describes those stages."
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.963,773.846,"Yes, right."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,773.846,777.348,And then we are at four lines up from the bottom.
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.348,777.95,Right.

2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,805.884,806.734,And shall also represent --
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,814.057,827.865,"--Your Honor, if we were looking at the possibility of exhausting a claim in State court, then we wouldn't be -- none of this first part of -- of (e) would apply."
2008.07-8521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,842.29,847.361,"But you -- you would interpret ""all available post-conviction process"" as meaning Federal?"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,847.361,849.011,The habeas proceeding.
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,849.73,855.384,"Well, then why don't we interpret the clemency provision the same way, as being limited to Federal?"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,855.384,860.252,"Well, because, Your Honor, Congress doesn't use the word ""Federal"" here, and if we were to interpret it as--"
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,860.252,861.871,"Within the use of ""Federal"", what we were just talking about."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,861.871,873.679,"--Well, that's correct, Your Honor; however, when we look at post-conviction process in (e), we have the context of (a)( 2), that talks about postconviction proceeding under section 2254 and 2255."
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,873.679,877.798,"I don't know why you just didn't take the position and say, yes, it applies to all these provisions."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,892.64,895.092,"Well, Your Honor -- and that's true."
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,909.935,919.308,"Well, you see why -- I mean, if you say, well, the first part is implicitly only Federal, that makes it very hard for you to argue that the second part is not also implicitly only Federal."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,919.308,927.563,"Respectfully, Your Honor, I would disagree, and -- and that's because the words are different, used by Congress."
2008.07-8521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,940.288,941.406,I just want to make clear what your position is.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,963.086,965.105,"--No, and for two reasons."
2008.07-8521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,965.105,966.638,Do you have to take that position?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,968.24,968.907,"Your Honor, I don't have to."
2008.07-8521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,968.907,969.973,--But that is your position.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,969.973,971.509,"Your Honor, that is my position."
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.765,1021.125,"Well, but -- but, you know, it -- it mentions trial proceedings, trial, sentencing, motions for new trial, appeals, applications for writ of cert.

2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1033.766,1036.535,Not with respect to subsection (e).
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.39,1048.342,"""Subsequent stage"" does not apply to this clause."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1053.163,1054.263,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1054.263,1055.296,Okay?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1055.296,1061.733,The very beginning of (e) indicates
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.541,1073.558,Right.
2008.07-8521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.558,1081.397,"But if it did not have the ""including"" phrase, if it just stopped there, would it then include proceedings necessary to exhaust the State remedies?"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1089.502,1091.538,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, if I wasn't clear."
2008.07-8521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.275,1100.394,"But why doesn't the word ""shall"" require it?"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1100.394,1113.618,"Because, Your Honor, we're -- when we're talking about an exhaustion proceeding or returning to State court, it can only fit under this part of (e) that says that it would be an appropriate motion or procedure."
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1119.022,1126.025,"If you step back and look at the structure, it seems to me unusual that your interpretation would be correct."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1160.433,1179.91,"And I understand that, Your Honor, but I think also, if we look at the representation as it does occur in the real world, we have the AEDPA, we have this Court's decisions that -- that structure the -- the capital litigation so that State court exhaustion normally comes before the Federal habeas process."
2008.07-8521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1215.567,1218.185,So let's go back to the earlier question.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1227.707,1236.23,"--Your Honor, competency and clemency are in their own ""shall"" clause, mandatory clause, in and of themselves."
2008.07-8521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1241.098,1241.714,Right.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1243.566,1249.204,"The post-conviction process would refer to anything in the 2254, the 2255."
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1266.249,1268.368,But only things in Federal court.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1268.368,1276.188,"Your Honor, that is it my reading of -- of 2254, 2255."
2008.07-8521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1276.188,1286.495,"Does that seem reasonable that Congress would have -- suppose you had a real complicated case with five or six issues in it, and they find out one issue is not exhausted."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1295.935,1296.885,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.891,1308.159,"Now, where is that language again, ""appropriate motions and""--"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1308.159,1316.646,"--It's four lines up from the -- or five lines up from the -- the bottom, the end of that line -- ""appropriate""--"
2008.07-8521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.646,1318.265,"--No, but that's in the next -- next clause."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1318.265,1320.467,"--That's in the first ""subsequent stage"" clause."
2008.07-8521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1320.467,1325.87,"But why does -- why does that limit the interpretation that -- of the words ""subsequent stage"" --"
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1338.861,1340.144,"Your Honor, it may."
2008.07-8521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.144,1340.796,What?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1340.796,1342.063,It may.
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1380.755,1382.938,But I thought it was your position that it didn't apply in that situation.

2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1383.873,1388.075,I thought it was your position that it did not apply in that situation.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1388.075,1390.111,That it wasn't mandatory.
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1393.479,1393.979,So you think it's discretionary.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1393.979,1394.546,--Yes.
2008.07-8521,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1394.546,1407.655,"The court can -- as a matter of discretion, can order the -- the counsel who's appointed to represent the -- the petitioner in the habeas to go back and handle the exhaustion of a claim in State court."
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1407.655,1408.472,"Absolutely, Your Honor."

2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1431.669,1432.438,Correct.
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1432.438,1433.254,--to Federal prisoners.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1442.144,1443.494,"It does, Your Honor."

2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.719,1456.403,Why not?
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1458.269,1473.348,"--Well, Your Honor, in this case, in (a)( 1), we would -- we -- because (a)( 1) sets out the factors that trigger the appointment of counsel, we have to have a defendant who's charged with a capital crime, who's indigent, and who otherwise doesn't have a lawyer."
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.348,1473.731,Right.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1476.883,1477.533,That's correct.
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.905,1487.389,So what?

2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1536.921,1539.29,"It says ""adequate representation""."

2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1701.877,1705.531,"--Your Honor, these are the words that Congress used."
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1720.874,1723.576,And we know that they read this text carefully before they voted for it.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1724.326,1725.309,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.309,1726.445,We don't know any of that.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1726.445,1727.395,Your Honor--
2008.07-8521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.395,1728.295,These are all assumptions.
2008.07-8521,0,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,1728.928,1731.563,--The -- the language of the statute is the best intent of Congress.
2008.07-8521,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1735.551,1737.067,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1745.406,1756.464,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 3599 authorizes federally funded representation only in the three categories of proceedings specified in subsection (e)."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1810.265,1812.217,May I just make sure I understand your position?
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1824.525,1829.678,--For that -- for that habeas -- for that person's Federal habeas petition--
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1829.678,1830.078,Yes.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1830.078,1835.665,--it requires the appointment of -- of a Federal habeas attorney qualified to practice in Federal court.
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1835.665,1844.938,So he -- he is entitled to a lawyer in the -- in the Federal collateral review of a State death penalty case?
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1844.938,1847.138,"In the Federal review, that's correct, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.138,1850.156,And what in the statute limits the scope of that review?
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1850.156,1853.108,"Well, subsection (e) limits the scope of that review, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.746,1861.698,But -- but you agree that (e) applies to State prisoners.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1861.698,1869.736,--We agree that (e) sets out the scope of services to be provided by the appointed attorney during the 2254 proceeding.
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1869.736,1873.271,In the -- for a State prisoner in a Federal collateral proceeding?
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1873.271,1876.992,"We agree -- we agree with that, Your Honor, because we think that term ""proceedings"" each time--"
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1876.992,1880.277,"And -- and what, then, in that proceeding does the word ""clemency"" refer to?"
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1883.229,1893.502,"--We think, Your Honor, that a habeas petitioner who's coming to Federal court under section 2254 has available to him no proceedings for clemency because the term ""proceedings""--"
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.502,1895.704,Even though the statute says so in so many words.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1895.704,1915.617,"--Well, it's -- the menu of services, if you will, set out in subsection (e) applies both to lawyers who are appointed under (a)( 1) who are doing work in Federal court for Federal defendants facing a Federal capital charge and also for attorneys appointed under (a)( 2) who are representing habeas petitioners under section 2254."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1941.082,1948.503,"Now, supposing, on the eve of execution, he wanted to apply for a stay of execution, he'd be entitled to representation before a Federal judge."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1948.87,1950.021,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1950.021,1957.675,"But what if the Federal judge says, you have to -- under our practice you can't get a Federal stay without first exhausting your attempt to get a State stay."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1964.697,1966.681,"Subsection (e) would not authorize that, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1966.681,1980.624,So he'd have to get a separate counsel to -- to go to the State court because -- even though the Federal judge required him as a normal matter of practice to exhaust the State remedy under the very limited situation of a stay on the eve of execution.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1980.624,1983.743,"Well, Your Honor, State courts also appoint counsel."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.743,1984.528,"Well, I understand that."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1984.528,1985.145,There's nothing--
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1985.145,1989.23,But he would have no right to have his Federal lawyer get paid for doing that work?
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1989.23,1994.383,--Would not get paid by the Federal Government for litigating a matter in State court that may have no connection to Federal law.
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1994.383,1999.287,"For litigating that -- just for the -- this, for the stay application on the eve of execution?"
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1999.287,2003.506,"Well, Your Honor, I -- it would not be a Federal judicial proceeding, and, therefore, it would not be covered--"
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.506,2004.022,"Oh, I understand."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2004.022,2004.438,--by subsection (a)( 2).
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2004.438,2009.39,"But it comes in with the -- the general language of ""other appropriate motions and procedures"", and so forth."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2015.83,2020.532,We -- we think that the Federal limitation applies throughout the text of 3599.
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.532,2021.298,You think that's perfectly clear from the text of the statute?
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2021.298,2021.984,"I am sorry, Justice--"
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2021.984,2024.417,You think that's perfectly clear from the text of the statute?
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2024.417,2033.957,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that the Federal limitation is apparent from a number of aspects of the statute, including the fact that Congress didn't use the ""Federal"" modifier anywhere else in the statute."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.957,2039.093,"And it could have used the ""Federal"" modifier very easily just by inserting the word ""Federal"" at appropriate places."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2039.093,2049.801,"Well, if it had inserted the word ""Federal"" in some places and left it out in others, that might be probative intent -- probative evidence that Congress intended the -- the other instances to be Federal and State as well."
2008.07-8521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2057.49,2069.465,"You don't doubt in the scenario Justice Stevens hypothesized that the Federal defender would, in fact, represent the person before the State court."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2086.14,2089.628,But the -- subsection (e) doesn't bar the lawyer from doing that.
2008.07-8521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2103.769,2104.471,So he presumably--
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2104.471,2105.238,He may be appointed as well.
2008.07-8521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2105.238,2124.182,"--is spending a huge amount of time and resources on this -- in the nature of these proceedings, and you want to go back and say, all right, on this day you spent 6 hours redoing your papers that were filed before the Federal judge to file them before the State judge, and you don't get paid the -- whatever -- how -- what do CJA attorneys get paid these days?"
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2124.182,2127.567,"In capital cases for fiscal year 2008, it's $170 an hour."
2008.07-8521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2127.567,2129.336,"So he goes back and says, look, you don't get that."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2141.644,2143.013,"Well, Your Honor--"
2008.07-8521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2143.013,2149.917,"Since you know as a practical matter, because of professional responsibility, that person is going to represent the defendant in the State court proceedings."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2149.917,2167.961,"--Well, Your Honor, the limitations in subsection (e) are -- are there for a reason, and it's precisely because the State -- the State post-conviction process that would become available under Petitioner's reading of the statute is certainly not limited to a few hours spent on the eve of execution in State court."
2008.07-8521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.05,2178.017,Would we have to reach that question here?
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2215.609,2221.346,"--I think it isn't, Justice Breyer, because 2254 is not a reference to proceedings in State court."
2008.07-8521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.5,2230.202,That's right.
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.384,2282.117,I thought this was a Federal law.
2008.07-8521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2284.335,2288.954,"He happened to be the person who wrote it, and it's referred to in the Solicitor General's brief."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2310.736,2311.569,"--Well, I--"
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2311.569,2313.521,Did his colleagues know what he said?
2008.07-8521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2313.521,2314.638,"Yes, they did."
2008.07-8521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2314.638,2315.288,I'm sorry.
2008.07-8521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2318.925,2325.996,My experience in Congress is that the Members of Congress do know the kinds of things that they are voting on.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2328.114,2339.672,"--Well, Your Honor, let me answer your point about Congressman Conyers first because I think that the suggestion in Petitioner's brief is that Congressman Conyers was -- had misinterpreted the text of his own amendment."
2008.07-8521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2352.729,2354.265,I think you're wrong about that.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2416.422,2421.958,"--Well, Your Honor, the text of Congressman Conyers' amendment wiped out the Gekas amendment."
2008.07-8521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2477.227,2479.329,"What do you do with ""other""?"
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2485.483,2499.41,"We think, Your Honor, that the purpose of that phrase, which was added, as I -- as I tried to explain in my previous answer, was added at a time when there was no -- there was no funding available for a 2254 petitioner."
2008.07-8521,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2525.375,2528.595,"Well, I understand that, but it's still executive clemency."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2528.595,2529.995,"We agree, Your--"
2008.07-8521,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2529.995,2535.416,"When -- when the -- when the clemency decision is made, it's not being made by these other people who are helping out the President."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2537.618,2549.092,"--We don't disagree with that at all, Justice Souter, but we think that the phrase ""or other"" was simply Congress' attempt to make sure that proceedings before these other officers were--"
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2549.092,2551.458,"Should the Constitution be amended, it would cover that."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2551.908,2558.698,"--Should the Constitution be amended to permit -- to permit legislative clemency, I think that -- I think that that is right."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2584.914,2589.383,"Mr. Jay, would you comment on this general reaction I had to -- when I read the statute?"
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2606.929,2609.714,"In terms of the numbers of clients, yes, you are, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2609.714,2610.197,Yes.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2646.554,2654.743,"Well, we think the entire statute is intended to focus on when -- when Federal rights and Federal interests are at stake in the administration of the death penalty."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2668.336,2669.036,You say it--
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2669.036,2669.586,--limited to the category--
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2669.586,2678.608,"--There are occasionally Federal constitutional questions and sometimes arguments made in Federal clemency -- I mean, in State clemency proceedings and Federal clemency proceedings."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2678.608,2686.862,"--There are sometimes such arguments made but there is no such thing as a Federal constitutional right to clemency, and indeed the governor or the President--"
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2686.862,2691.516,"But there's arguably a Federal right, a constitutional right, to a fair proceeding in a clemency application."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2691.516,2702.538,"--Well, there is a -- in a capital clemency proceeding, the Court has recognized a -- a limited due process right, but that is not the sort of right that would be vindicated in a -- in a habeas proceeding at all."
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.538,2716.881,"Well, Mr. Jay, I -- I assume that (a)( 1), which provides for the appointment of counsel to conduct the trial in a -- in a capital case, would not have very much application either, would it?"
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2716.881,2720.849,"That's right, Your Honor; (a)( 1) applies only in Federal proceedings."
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2720.849,2724.32,"Only in Federal capital cases, of which there are very, very few."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2724.32,2725.57,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2743.399,2761.91,"Is the government's principal concern in this case the possibility, the potential, assuming the Petitioner prevails, of appointment of counsel in State post-conviction collateral proceedings, i.e., when there are unexhausted claims?"
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2773.551,2775.17,--It is the principal thrust of our concern.
2008.07-8521,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2787.011,2800.737,Do you think there's no way to interpret the statute so that it could include State clemency proceedings but only Federal post-conviction review proceedings in judicial -- before judicial tribunals?
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2800.737,2807.974,--We don't see a way to have a Federal limitation before judicial proceedings and not have it before clemency proceedings.
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2807.974,2808.457,"Well, sure."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2827.555,2839.612,"Well, our position, Your Honor, is that in every State with the death penalty, the clemency decision is made either by the -- in most cases, by the governor or by gubernatorial appointees or by other executive officials."
2008.07-8521,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2868.882,2888.093,"Of course, it would have made sense for Congress to use ""other"" as a way of referring to the States simply because it would have been a matter of indifference to Congress whether a State process was executive or was other in some way, in effect just leaving the issue open as -- as an irrelevance."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2888.093,2902.436,"I think if your premise, Justice Souter, were -- is right, that Congress intended to fund -- fund proceedings on both levels, then I -- I suspect that that's right, that it would be a matter of indifference to Congress which form the State clemency process took."
2008.07-8521,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2913.744,2928.67,"Okay, but that -- that still leaves you with the question that the -- what the -- what the words ""or other"" can possibly refer to, given the present state of Federal law, Federal constitutional law, unless they refer to State proceedings."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2928.67,2931.538,"--Well, the phrase is -- the phrase is ambiguous."
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2965.342,2965.959,Excuse me.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2972.346,2974.198,"--It is, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.198,2977.833,"I mean, assuming the State has convicted somebody, you are arguing against the State."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2977.833,2979.351,"That's true, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.351,2981.384,And the Federal Government is funding that.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2981.384,2983.136,The Federal Government would be funding that.
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3040.24,3043.342,"May I just be clear on -- on one thing on your position, Mr. Jay?"
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3053.233,3056.952,"Well, I think -- this statute, Your Honor, doesn't deal with discretion."
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3088.754,3090.187,What is the government's position on that issue?
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3090.187,3094.341,"--I don't -- I don't think we have a -- have a position on that issue, because it--"
2008.07-8521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3094.341,3098.527,It seems to me that issue would arise more often than the issue we're fighting about in this case.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3098.527,3104.28,"--It -- it might, Your Honor, because the Criminal Justice Act applies to noncapital cases as well."
2008.07-8521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3192.45,3202.556,But all this is dependent upon the defendant showing that he is financially unable to obtained adequate representation.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3215.733,3222.72,"There are some funds on -- on the State level, and I'd like to come back to how Tennessee handles that in a moment."
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3309.993,3321.716,"And that's the government's position, that under this provision, even if -- even if State funding -- well, you say State isn't covered anyway."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3321.716,3323.835,Right.
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3325.12,3344.599,"Assuming State funding is covered, assuming representation in the State is covered, it does seem to be the case that the test of whether you get some -- some Federal lawyer appointed is not whether you don't have a State lawyer, but rather whether you can pay for counsel."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3345.249,3347.468,--Whether you as a personal matter--
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3347.468,3348.301,Can pay.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3348.301,3349.586,--are financially unable.
2008.07-8521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3349.586,3350.636,That's strange.
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3350.636,3364.162,"And the -- the test for appointment is also based on when the -- at the time when the defendant is or becomes financially unable, there's no reference in the statute to when -- to the defendant becoming financially able again."
2008.07-8521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3375.018,3382.541,"Counsel, you don't really think the fact that this provision was recodified helps your argument at all, do you?"
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3382.541,3385.493,"Well, it doesn't hurt, Your Honor, and we do think that it helps because--"
2008.07-8521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3385.493,3390.646,"When I see that argument, particularly in a gray brief, that strikes me as tantamount to a confession of error."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3390.646,3393.931,"--Well, I'm certainly not here to confess to error, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3403.97,3420.999,"You were earlier resisting the notion that the particular legislative history here showed anything because of how broadly it may have been familiar, but there's no evidence at all that when Congress recodified this language, it was in fact aware of the different court of appeals decisions you cite."
2008.07-8521,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3421.449,3425.167,"--Other than the general presumption that this Court applies in these ratification cases, that's right, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3482.503,3483.439,"Thank you, Mr. Jay."
2008.07-8521,2,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,3485.889,3490.176,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3573.913,3576.449,How often is clemency granted in Tennessee?
2008.07-8521,2,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,3576.449,3582.786,"Your Honor, clemency has been granted one time since Furman that I am aware of, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3582.786,3584.721,One time in the last how many decades?
2008.07-8521,2,20722,dana_c_hansen_chavis,,3584.721,3589.023,"That would be the last 20 or 30, Your Honor."
2008.07-8521,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3599.647,3601.214,"Thank you, counsel."
