1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.648,"We'll hear argument now in Number 88-7146, Jonas Whitmore v. Arkansas."
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,10.298,13.162,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.651,199.364,"Mr. Allen, you represent Jonas Whitmore in this case?"
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,199.364,199.915,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,199.915,203.878,And what is Mr. Whitmore's standing before this Court?
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,203.878,207.892,"Your Honor, his standing is predicated upon several things."
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,263.57,267.564,But hasn't Mr. Whitmore's conviction already been affirmed?
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,267.564,270.535,It has... it has been affirmed on direct appeal.
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.966,330.237,"Well, what do you mean?"
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,334.03,334.861,"--No, sir."
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,351.193,353.577,"Well, have you been authorized to represent him?"
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,353.577,355.226,Mr. Whitmore?
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,355.226,355.547,Yeah.
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,355.547,358.28,"Are you referring to Mr. Whitmore, sir?"
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,358.28,359.479,I'm referring to--
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,365.514,374.5,"Mr. Whitmore, under the standing, of course, to reach the Article III case for controversy, has to show an injury."
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,384.308,387.329,Was he... was he competent to waive any appeal or--
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,387.329,388.368,--Mr. Simmons?
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.368,389.169,--Yes.
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,389.169,405.271,On the record before this Court I cannot seriously dispute competency as it relates to mental competency.
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.62,422.632,But you say Whitmore has got a separate interest?
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,422.632,423.501,"--Yes, sir."
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,468.426,469.494,"Well, of some substance."
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,471.237,473.257,"Well, your Honor, again--"
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.257,475.938,"Certainly, that was... that was the rule of Valley Forge, was it not?"
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,475.938,479.963,--It cannot be a hypothetical or--
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.963,484.744,"No, but I mean, even if it's actual it has to be something beyond a mere peppercorn, so to speak."
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,484.744,488.667,"--Oh, I don't think the Court used that expression."
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.975,528.356,"And your claim here is that although your client has already had his conviction affirmed and the proportionality review conducted by the Supreme Court of Arkansas he... and has lost in state post-conviction remedies, he is now in Federal habeas and he might obtain a new trial there and then he would go through the proceeding again and would be affected by the fact that Mr. Simmons' capital case was not in the pool from which a proportionality review is convicted?"
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,528.356,530.159,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1989.88-7146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.579,531.66,Why isn't that hypothetical?
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,543.269,551.086,"--Your Honor, the difference there is the difference between future or threatened injury and hypothetical."
1989.88-7146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.775,604.744,"Well, I assume the difference between future and hypothetical is sort of the difference between standing under a chandelier whose... whose connection has broken and is... is... is in the process of descending on your head."
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,615.591,616.812,Because--
1989.88-7146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,616.812,617.423,In the latter situation?
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,638.932,639.882,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.88-7146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,782.571,786.513,"Well, you're not arguing that the Simmons' waiver was invalid, are you?"
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,786.513,791.836,I seriously question the validity of that waiver under those circumstances.
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,865.449,873.405,"Well, does any case from our Court require that extensive a proceeding as you've just described in order that a waiver be deemed competent?"
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,873.405,887.123,"Your Honor, this Court has only addressed waivers in death penalty context after they have reached habeas... with the exception of Gilmore, which we have yet to discuss."
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.661,975.814,"By someone who himself has standing, who himself has suffered an injury."
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,975.814,976.274,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.274,976.914,Wouldn't you agree with that?
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,976.914,977.324,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.256,1010.927,xxx just any... any person... any member of the public can come in and say Simmons' waiver was invalid and therefore I want to appeal his case.
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1010.927,1029.681,"--Your Honor, as much, perhaps, as I would like to advocate that, I think this Court's decisions are uniform in showing that generalized grievances are redressable through the political front rather than through the judicial front."
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.78,1042.147,"So the fact that... so the fact that the waiver, you say, is questionable really doesn't add anything to Whitmore's standing, is it?"
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1042.147,1047.882,"--It does... it, of itself, doesn't add anything more to his standing."
1989.88-7146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.293,1116.028,"Mr. Allen, could I ask you... assuming that you have standing, do you know any case where we've allowed someone who would... assuming he would be injured by something that occurred at the trial level, we've allowed someone not to intervene down there but to bring an appeal here on the basis of that standing?"
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1152.756,1161.112,"--There is a strange... or an appearance of strangeness here, Your Honor, because of the absence of Simmons I from being with this."
1989.88-7146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.942,1194.476,He wasn't asserting his own standing.
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1203.551,1203.711,--Yes.
1989.88-7146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1203.981,1205.974,So that's quite different from what you're trying to do here.
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1205.974,1222.394,"--Well, that's the reason I believe that Franz v. State failed on its face, is that it did not express more than a generalized grievance over a constitutional defect."
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.787,1460.828,"Well, what if... what if there isn't mandatory appeal?"
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1474.759,1475.259,"--Yes, sir."
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1475.259,1476.169,--for him?
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1476.169,1477.041,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1477.041,1482.316,"That doesn't mean that any third person, cellmate or otherwise, could come in and appeal it."
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1482.316,1483.426,No.
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.87,1488.04,"Well, I--"
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1488.04,1489.712,--they have a procedure in place.
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1489.712,1491.392,"--I know, but that doesn't help."
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1495.166,1514.078,"Your Honor, it only... that feature of it goes to the weight of the countervailing policy, which in turn affects the threshold of injury that Mr. Whitmore must show in this Court to achieve his standing."
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.078,1515.899,"Well, I'm just saying it doesn't help him very much."
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1525.847,1529.059,"If there were a mandatory appeal, of course, Your Honor--"
1989.88-7146,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.059,1529.587,You would be--
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1529.587,1533.12,--we would not be... be before the Court on this issue.
1989.88-7146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1533.12,1558.637,"--In the... the contingency I think the remote contingency that Whitmore is retried and sentenced to death again... couldn't he at that time argue that it's the state's burden to show that his sentence is proportional and the state has in effect, by its own procedures, denied him the right to have a pool of cases and just put the burden on the state."
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1558.637,1567.464,Arkansas does not place the burden in that regard upon either the state or the convicted.
1989.88-7146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1571.945,1591.158,"Well, but I mean, if by the state's own actions that independent review is somehow inadequate, it seems to me that Whitmore again has no injury because then he's going to be able to raise the very contention that you say he can't make."
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1591.158,1602.027,"Your Honor, if I understand you correctly, I don't believe it would be a matter of him not having an injury, but it would be a matter of could he address it in another forum at that time."
1989.88-7146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1602.027,1611.822,He... he wouldn't have an injury because he tells the state that you have to show that my death penalty is proportional and you can't do it.
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1615.035,1620.029,"Of course, at that time Mr. Simmons would have been long since executed."
1989.88-7146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1621.889,1625.111,"Well, but we're talking about Whitmore's injury by hypothesis."
1989.88-7146,0,15402,arthur_l_allen,,1625.111,1626.173,"--Yes, sir."
1989.88-7146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.403,1654.694,"Yes, you may, Mr. Allen."
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1655.565,1666.852,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-7146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1908.965,1910.685,I'm... I'm just curious.
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1913.119,1915.469,"Thirty-two people on death row, Justice Blackmun."
1989.88-7146,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1915.469,1917.669,Any females among them?
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1917.669,1921.222,"There was one, but her case was overturned and she's now serving life without parole."
1989.88-7146,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1952.945,1958.698,"Well, I suppose we don't have to even get to that point if there's no standing here."
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1958.698,1959.907,"Justice O'Connor, I agree."
1989.88-7146,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1964.612,1966.362,"So probably that's the first thing we look at, isn't it?"
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,1966.362,1966.712,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-7146,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1993.247,2005.763,Do you think he would have standing if he were here in a situation where his own proportionality review had not been conducted yet?
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2005.763,2007.265,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1989.88-7146,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2103.016,2105.918,Isn't that case on appeal now in the Eighth--
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2105.918,2107.09,"Yes, Your Honor, it is on appeal to the Eighth Circuit."
1989.88-7146,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2107.09,2107.658,--Circuit?
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2107.658,2108.108,"Yes, it is."
1989.88-7146,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.731,2172.402,xxx willing?
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2174.404,2176.046,"--He said, ""I want to waive""."
1989.88-7146,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.717,2184.131,And he doesn't want... and he turns down any... has he turned down any kind of representation by anybody else?
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2184.131,2184.641,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-7146,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.504,2203.939,And has he purported to forbid Mr. Whitmore to represent him?
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2203.939,2207.962,"He has indicated in letters that are not a part of the record, Your Honor, that--"
1989.88-7146,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.962,2209.334,I... was this briefed?
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2210.875,2211.686,"--Yes, Your Honor, he did."
1989.88-7146,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.556,2230.458,And has he... has he read that brief?
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2230.458,2232.68,"Yes, Your Honor, he has read the briefs."
1989.88-7146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.989,2317.68,"Let me ask you one question, if I might, Counsel."
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2317.68,2317.971,"Yes, sir, Justice Stevens."
1989.88-7146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.971,2319.112,It's running through my mind.
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2350.286,2352.347,"No, Your Honor, I think not."
1989.88-7146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.885,2388.073,"Would any person... just a citizen of Arkansas who says, we don't really like having the state behave in this fashion... would any... would anybody have standing to bring that matter to the attention of a Federal court?"
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2388.073,2390.436,"In your hypothetical, Your Honor, in this case, I think no."
1989.88-7146,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.436,2397.27,"How about a public defender who says, I want to go ahead and talk to this inmate?"
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2397.27,2400.322,"Justice White, I think the answer to that is no also."
1989.88-7146,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.737,2406.917,"Oh, no."
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2407.799,2409.562,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1989.88-7146,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.562,2410.961,--It's on the standing argument.
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2429.954,2430.395,"Well,--"
1989.88-7146,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.395,2431.406,Could he get into court?
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2431.406,2458.116,"--In the instance... if, in your hypothetical the defendant is sentenced to die and has decided to accept that sentence and done so knowingly and intelligently and waived such and with the standard of Arkansas with the appreciation between life and death, though represented by a public defender through the entire process, and then the public defender shows up to the Department of Corrections and finds he's in the hole, if you will, and is not permitted to talk to him, I don't think that public defender has standing to raise this issue."
1989.88-7146,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.116,2469.173,"Well, I know, but you say that... you say that if this fellow changed his mind an hour before his execution was scheduled, he'd get an appeal."
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2469.173,2469.674,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-7146,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.674,2482.162,"Well, then the public defender wants to be able to talk to him up till the minute of the execution and the people... and the prison says, sorry, the fellow's waived and that's the end of it."
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2482.162,2484.885,"Well, in the instance, Your Honor, I think in terms of the waiver."
1989.88-7146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2522.703,2533.891,"The only thing I am suggesting, Counsel, is that perhaps you're right on the merits with the waiver and all the rest of it, but the standing position could be quite extreme in some... in some cases, I think."
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2533.891,2535.143,"Justice Stevens, I--"
1989.88-7146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.143,2537.033,"Of course, maybe that doesn't mean that it isn't... it isn't--"
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2537.033,2539.394,"--I've asked myself that question and there is the potential that you can create, certainly in hypothetical--"
1989.88-7146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.394,2539.544,--Yeah.
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2539.544,2540.946,--and it seems grossly extreme.
1989.88-7146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.946,2541.437,Yeah.
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2541.437,2546.641,"But in the instances, I think this Court is bound by that standing provision of the Constitution."

1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2553.797,2556.148,"He has retained counsel, Justice Kennedy."
1989.88-7146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2556.148,2556.859,Or retained counsel.
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2556.859,2557.199,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-7146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2557.199,2566.096,"Do... do we know that that retained counsel will remain with him throughout the period during which the sentence is being executed, up to the last hour?"
1989.88-7146,1,29766,j_steven_clark,,2566.096,2568.669,We knew in the instance of the first case.
1989.88-7146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2600.972,2604.622,"If he does, what's the state of preparation of the trial transcript?"
