1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.389,We'll hear argument next in Burch against Louisiana.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,15.34,18.956,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-90,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,79.235,81.176,"Including a not guilty verdict, is that correct?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,81.176,81.81,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-90,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,82.444,89.142,"One of the six could be for the finding of guilty but of the other five are for a finding of not guilty, that's the verdict?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,89.142,90.998,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,127.919,130.277,Are you making any point what the corporation did?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,130.277,130.959,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,135.079,137.507,Why?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,137.507,147.001,The only rationale we can present to the court as to why they -- their case should be considered is that they were tried under the same statute.
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,173.98,175.464,"There is a vote, six to nothing."
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,175.464,176.484,Yes Your Honor.
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,176.484,178.08,"Well on a corporation, that is --"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,178.08,179.58,That's correct.
1978.78-90,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.11,219.231,Under your theory then any one who is convicted in Louisiana under this particular Section of the constitution even though by a unanimous six men jury or six person jury would be entitled to be free?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,219.231,226.661,"I -- I don't know that the decision would have to be retroactive but I think they could've raised that point under that argument, yes Your Honor."
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,295.064,300.03,"Well, what about six out of 12?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,300.03,303.426,I don't know of any case in which the court has decided that issue Your Honor.
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,303.426,306.269,"Well, I'm talking about this very case."
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,306.269,308.779,In this case Your Honor the -- its constitution --
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,308.779,314.731,"Well, if you'd gotten six out of 12, you'd get same as if you'd got six out of six?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,314.731,319.773,"You still have six people voting to convict that are to acquit, that's correct Your Honor."
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,321.198,321.994,"Well, you -- well I'm trying to --"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,321.994,322.556,Yes.
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,322.556,326.177,"-- find out, we're arguing about figures or unanimity."
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,326.177,337.37,"Well, here you have both aspects, the non-unanimous character of the Louisiana statute and the fact that only six are required to constitute the jury with only five required"
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,337.37,342.13,"Do you think that that's still open, the six-man jury for -- is still open?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,342.13,346.209,"No, no, I -- if -- that was foreclosed by Williams versus Florida."
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,346.209,346.267,Yes.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,346.267,351.001,So this Court has said that the six-man jury with a unanimous verdict --
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,351.001,351.511,That's okay.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,351.511,352.662,"-- is constitutional, yes sir."
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,352.662,353.613,So you're not arguing that?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,353.613,354.72,"No, sir."
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,397.913,403.3,"When you say classical form, traditional form what do you mean by that?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,403.3,403.428,The --
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,403.428,404.18,12?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,404.18,405.001,That -- I'm sorry Your Honor.
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,405.001,407.178,Do you mean 12?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,407.178,407.705,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-90,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,429.376,436.918,"Well, I have six -- the six-man jury is all right in terms of just the cross-section, there was the six men of jury here."
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,436.918,438.28,There was Your Honor.
1978.78-90,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.591,447.367,So there was jury and in terms of deliberation would you say that if there is a split vote indicates more deliberation or less?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,447.367,449.126,"In the case, less deliberation Your Honor."
1978.78-90,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.126,449.666,Why?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,449.666,469.532,"Because of the split vote Well, I the believed that some of the sociological studies indicated in the Ballew decision, indicate that if there is a split vote so that only a majority is required or a percentage with not a unanimous vote then there is less deliberation insofar as time is concerned then there ordinarily would be."
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,469.532,469.814,I suppose --
1978.78-90,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.814,476.63,"Well, at least but the people of the five here, have at least had to face up to dissenting vote, haven't they?"
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,476.63,477.571,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-90,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,478.231,487.406,"Well, five out of just -- could say, lets say it was Negro defendant and one of the six jurors were a Negro."
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,487.85,488.356,Yes.
1978.78-90,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,488.356,492.572,-- five others could just say will you go there and play solitary in the quarter and we will decide this case.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,492.572,494.345,That's our argument Your Honor.
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,496.263,499.982,But you do not suggest that's present in this case to you.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,499.982,503.1,Not in -- we do not know what happened in the jury room in this case Your Honor.
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,503.1,506.206,So you're not suggesting any hypothesis about that processes about that.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,506.206,508.816,We are â€“ we're not suggesting any hypotheses.
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,508.816,541.634,"No, on that point that you were discussing with Mr. Justice White, when I was in law school it was common for the lecturer to say that divided court opinion carries more weight than a unanimous opinion of a multi judge court whether it was three under the part of appeals or nine here because that showed that the contest -- the issue was contested right -- to the end of the line."
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,550.816,551.014,Well --
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,551.014,559.509,This was the wisdom of lawyers and law teachers until -- at least a few years ago.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,559.509,564.923,"Well, of course Your Honor, we have no way of knowing exactly what goes on in a jury room but --"
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,564.923,570.218,You are and now what goes on in the conference room of the Court of Appeals or a State Supreme Court.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,570.218,571.137,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,597.68,608.084,Those are the same sociological studies that said a jury of less than 12 is bad because it reduced the chances of an acquittal.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,608.084,608.842,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,608.842,616.642,"And the by the same token, a jury of 24, 36 or 48 would cut the other way, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,616.642,618.359,Those were the same studies Your Honor.
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,630.125,633.712,"Now, -- if they're all alone -- if they don't have a --"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,633.712,634.648,"Yes, if all along -- that's correct."
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,634.648,635.953,-- number of six there?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,635.953,636.267,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,681.846,690.005,"Mr. Peebles, I have a lot of problem with this cross-section, the jury, how many would you need in New York City?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,690.005,691.557,How many would we need in order to have another -- the cross-section?
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,691.557,696.25,"So, (Voice Overlap) the cross-section of Manhattan? Above a thousand, when it should?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,696.25,702.426,"Well, it would be -- I would be the perfect, how do you -- I suppose sir, this Court has said that six is adequate --"
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,702.426,702.942,Yes.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,702.942,705.499,-- in Williams versus Florida.
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,705.499,709.168,If I'm trying to keep it not -- rearguing that one is not very -- what he did.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,709.168,712.935,The court has said that and we don't call with opposition.
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,722.635,727.211,"Well, your argument is that if you -- by six, you mean six unanimous?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,727.211,728.205,Yes.
1978.78-90,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,728.714,729.42,That's your point?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,729.42,729.794,That is right.
1978.78-90,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,729.794,733.555,Because it's all that the court can do is deal with the system.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,736.248,736.542,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-90,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,736.542,742.607,I -- even with the 12 member unanimous jury you might have 12 peas in the pot.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,742.607,743.171,That's correct.
1978.78-90,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,743.171,746.652,"Now, any particular jury didn't know cross-section at all."
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,746.652,747.569,That's correct sir.
1978.78-90,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.569,749.655,But one deals with the system.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,749.655,753.392,That's correct.
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,809.452,816.269,Do you relate this to the burden of proof in criminal cases as distinguished from the burden of proof in civil cases?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,816.269,818.298,"I would Your Honor, I think that we (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.298,826.534,"Most of the states permit a five or six verdict in civil cases, do they are not after -- sometimes after a certain lapse of time?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,826.534,832.636,"Well, some of the -- I'm not familiar with any courts which do that, their -- maybe the case."
1978.78-90,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.018,887.102,"Well, isn't there some interest too on the part of the state in not taking people away from gainful employment in order to serve as jurors if they can get by with less?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,887.102,912.855,"Well, I think that is a legitimate reason but if you're -- we are suggesting simply that that type of reason which I think is essentially the same as the argument I suggested that they would reduce a deliberation time, same kind of thing is simply counterbalanced by the fact that you are reducing the very nature of the jury."
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,920.281,925.761,"How is that state into a serve by removing a requirement of unanimity, I don't quite understand?"
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,925.761,927.035,"Oh, it does not."
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.565,937.348,"Yes, I know."
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,937.348,948.627,"-- no matter what and they have to be paid. Presumably, they would not hang as often and they would be out for a shortly -- shorter periods of time."
1978.78-90,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1004.457,1015.746,"Well, as a mathematical proposition, a hung jury can be a benefit to a defendant on a five to one basis just to sure -- four or two basis just to surely as it can be to the prosecution."
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,1015.746,1017.49,That -- that is correct Your Honor.
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1051.029,1056.106,This is an unfair question and I hope it hasn't been asked when I was out of the room.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,1073.445,1077.129,That would be a closer question Your Honor.
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.978,1112.191,How about the 10 out of 12?
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,1112.191,1114.088,"Well, the court has held that is constitutional."
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.088,1114.34,Yes.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,1114.34,1117.646,But you have more total numbers there of the jury.
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1185.253,1194.45,Of course in Ballew many members of the court weren't very impressed with what they called the numerology of the studies.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,1194.45,1194.694,Yes Your Honor.
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1194.694,1197.821,I suppose you're less impressed to hear.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,1197.821,1198.825,Well --
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1198.825,1201.401,"See, Ballew wasn't a court opinion."
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,1201.401,1201.944,Yes.
1978.78-90,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1201.944,1203.16,It's a court judgment.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,1203.16,1205.038,"It was a court judgment, yes."
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.747,1252.244,"Mr. Peebles, I'm not being critical because as you know in -- what was written in Ballew case, I gave substantial weight to the studies."
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,1252.244,1252.985,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-90,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.985,1255.179,But not everybody was in agreement.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,1255.179,1259.141,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1299.473,1299.912,Very well.
1978.78-90,0,32323,jack_peebles,,1299.912,1304.25,Thank you.
1978.78-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1304.25,1305.548,Mrs. Korns.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1305.548,1308.531,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1343.628,1348.374,"Are you -- your reasoning then, four out of seven would be unassailable too."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1348.374,1351.117,There we get to the slippery slope argument --
1978.78-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1351.117,1358.461,"You said that -- since we've approved a six member jury, then a fortiori we would have approved a seven member jury."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1358.461,1359.1,I don't --
1978.78-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1359.1,1364.497,"But if that's all of this, just the numbers then four out of seven would -- as I understand your position."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1364.497,1368.782,"Well, our position Your Honor is anchored right on this case."
1978.78-90,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1618.655,1623.541,"Mrs. Korns, do you -- are you saying, I just want to be sure I understand, I haven't read that particular study but --"
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1623.541,1623.759,Just coming out.
1978.78-90,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1623.759,1634.475,-- do you -- it suggests that its easier for the prosecutor to get a conviction when he asks to convince 12 people to agree unanimously than it is to convince a majority of six persons?
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1634.475,1635.136,"Yes, and I'm just telling you what --"
1978.78-90,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1635.136,1636.09,Some rather improbable (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1636.09,1655.032,"-- Professor Bernard Grofman's article is one of the things that he proves with these formulas that he -- he advances, he concludes, does it so, that -- well first of all, I have to admit in all honesty that he prefers a 12 man jury to a six-man jury."
1978.78-90,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1672.852,1684.425,"Well, but is he advocating it on the ground that it is harder to persuade a majority of six to convict than it is to persuade all 12 of the 12 man jury to convict, is he (Voice Overlap)?"
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1684.425,1686.491,Apparently he is Your Honor but I don't understand all his formulas.
1978.78-90,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1686.491,1689.216,"Well, do you support that argument?"
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1689.216,1690.206,"Your Honor, as I say --"
1978.78-90,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1690.206,1690.965,"I don't know, im just listening."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1690.965,1692.707,I don't understand these mathematical formulas --
1978.78-90,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1692.707,1693.769,"Well, I wouldn't understand that one either now."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1693.769,1694.988,-- just to tell you the truth.
1978.78-90,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1702.555,1707.577,I think maybe the term numerology may apply to what he wrote rather than what Mr. Justice Blackmun wrote.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1707.577,1710.779,I'm -- I just site this to this Court as I say because his Professor Stuart Nagel --
1978.78-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1710.779,1712.176,"Well, it may be."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1712.176,1712.615,I beg your pardon?
1978.78-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1712.615,1724.387,It may be that a prosecutor and the jurisdiction that he studied doesn't bring a case for violation of the misdemeanors that have six-man jury unless the proof of guilt is overwhelming.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1724.387,1724.49,"Oh, he is not --"
1978.78-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1724.49,1731.583,"Or if he does, bring felony prosecutions if there's probable cause to bring the prosecution before a 12 member jury."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1733.855,1734.142,Right.
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.433,1855.42,"Well, Mrs. Korns, is it speculation -- do you contend that it would be speculation that its -- would be harder to persuade five out of five to convict than it would be to persuade five out of six to convict."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1858.462,1868.134,"Our position is in a five out of six jury Justice Stevens which is what we have here, this jury which would have reach the unanimity, 95% of them."
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1869.143,1870.484,But they did in this time though.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1870.484,1879.373,"They didn't this time but if a six-man jury, five of whom -- if a six-man jury have to be unanimous they're going to become unanimous 95% of the time."
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1879.373,1879.765,Right.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1879.765,1886.028,"And once the vote reaches one to five, it's not going to -- the one is not going to turn around the five."
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.028,1886.132,But they could --
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1886.132,1895.517,"So all he's going to get is a 5% chance of a hung jury and the state can try him again and have just as good -- I mean, a very (Inaudible)."
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.725,1900.369,Well that really -- it does not respond to my question.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1907.065,1907.966,Right.
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1907.966,1910.456,With the requirement of getting five out of six to convict.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1910.456,1911.144,"Well, I understand, yes."
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1911.144,1912.011,Would you not agree --
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1912.011,1912.36,Right.
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1912.36,1913.24,-- that it's easier to get five out of six --
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1913.24,1915.332,In other words why if Ballew is no good --
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1915.332,1915.686,Let me finish my question.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1915.686,1916.906,-- aren't we any good.
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.906,1923.233,Is it not -- would you not agree that its easier to get five out of six to convict than it is to get five out of five to convict?
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1923.233,1927.134,"Oh, Your Honor I'm going to avoid that question because I don't think that's the issue."
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.506,1928.573,Well I think it is --
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1928.573,1928.861,-- is the six-man panel.
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1928.861,1930.589,-- and I'd like you to answer it.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1930.589,1942.713,"The issue we think is, is a six-man panel valid as a cross-section of the community as a protection against tyranny is -- so and so, which this Court not only found in Williams but upheld and reaffirmed in Ballew."
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1942.713,1947.381,"Well I understand, you just don't want to answer my question."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1948.105,1948.444,We rely --
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.444,1949.446,"-- (Voice Overlap), that's probably right."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1949.446,1957.934,"We rely -- alright, we rely on Apodaca versus Oregon and Johnson versus Louisiana and when the present Louisiana constitution would --"
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1957.934,1961.375,"In which case, do not answer my question."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1961.375,1962.598,Whether its --
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.598,1973.975,I'm just asking you whether you think we need statistics to demonstrate what I regard as a rather obvious proposition that it would be harder to persuade five out of five to convict than it would be to persuade five out of six to convict?
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1973.975,1974.307,Yes.
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1982.179,1982.479,Well --
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,1982.479,1993.941,"That when you get below six, you -- so, that -- respectfully, I don't think that's an issue here because of the reasons of striking down Ballew are not here."
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.131,2014.772,"Then your argument Mrs. Korns, I -- you say my question is totally irrelevant to that analysis."
1978.78-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2017.806,2019.608,Exactly Your Honor.
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2019.608,2020.672,Because you still have your six people.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2020.816,2021.139,"Of course, --"
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2021.139,2021.952,-- three out of six would be adequate.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2021.952,2028.244,Of course in Williams this Court said -- the whole argument was how far are we going to go?
1978.78-90,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.244,2035.008,"In fact I don't know why under your analysis you couldn't have a jury that said if any one of the six believes he's guilty, that's enough."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2035.008,2042.776,"Well, most -- even Scotland, Scotland from time immemorial has had a bare majority verdict."
1978.78-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2103.222,2105.25,"Well then, two out of three would be even better."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2105.25,2111.659,"Well, this Court has said you can go below six so obviously we're not going to get six."
1978.78-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2111.659,2115.376,"Well, now you're five in your state."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2115.376,2116.316,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2120.872,2122.475,That's all Ballew decided was that --
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2122.475,2122.535,Right.
1978.78-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2122.535,2123.314,-- total number.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2123.314,2127.652,The total number and reaffirmed Williams many times.
1978.78-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2142.724,2146.496,"Well, the vote of one of them doesn't count, it isn't six?"
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2149.039,2158.518,I'd like to point out in this case that obviously the vote of one did count and he was listened to because the jury deliberated for 15 minutes.
1978.78-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2188.242,2198.605,"Mrs. Korns, you missed an opportunity to point out that this Court allows dissenting opinions and dissenting votes but we count them anyway."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2198.605,2200.749,"No doubt about that, absolutely."
1978.78-90,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2200.749,2207.884,"I call the people who voted for Outland in 1936, their votes were counted but Frank D. Roosevelt was President."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2207.884,2213.187,"Well, if this Court -- the members of this Court don't have any further questions I'll submit the matter Your Honor."
1978.78-90,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2213.187,2219.724,"Mrs. Korns, I might say this, you mentioned a little while ago that -- what is it?"
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2219.724,2219.933,Grofman?
1978.78-90,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2219.933,2223.943,95% of your cases are unanimous.
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2223.943,2229.391,"No, I said that both Professor Nagel and Kelvin, and Ziffel and everybody agreed that it was --"
1978.78-90,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2229.391,2234.777,"Oh, I'm talking about Louisiana's experience that 98 -- 95% of your six-man jury convened a (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2234.777,2236.571,No -- if I've said that --
1978.78-90,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2236.571,2238.417,Well how many do -- what is the percentage?
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2238.417,2241.117,Nobody has ever kept -- that's my very point Your Honor.
1978.78-90,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2241.117,2252.365,"Well, in any event, certainly some of them that come in with a five to one conviction vote, if you had a unanimity requirement might come in with the unanimous vote were --"
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2252.365,2258.019,"Oh, 95% of the time, they would under general rules of way jurors behave."
1978.78-90,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2258.019,2260.364,"Because once you get to five on one, that's all over with."
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2260.364,2273.015,"The -- and the others are tired of listening to it and they either bully or persuade the other person to give in just like in the old days, they wouldn't give him any light, heat, a food and they drag him from courts from one stand to the other until finally they all say --"
1978.78-90,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2273.015,2277.346,They do all these -- do Louisiana do this?
1978.78-90,1,34722,louise_korns,,2277.346,2281.268,"We'd like to, I think Your Honor but we can't."
1978.78-90,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2282.523,2283.044,Alright.
1978.78-90,2,32323,jack_peebles,,2284.55,2286.546,Not unless the court has any questions Your Honor.
1978.78-90,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2286.546,2287.308,Thank you counsel.
