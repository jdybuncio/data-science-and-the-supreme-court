2018.17-1229,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.04,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1229, Helsinn Healthcare versus Teva. Mr. Shanmugam."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,7.04,14.72,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the America Invents Act, Congress transformed the nation's patent laws."
2018.17-1229,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,50.52,55.28,"Well, it might not be consistent with the actual meaning of the word ""sale,"" though, right?"
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,55.28,56.48,The critical phrase --
2018.17-1229,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,56.48,59.76,"If you're having -- if you're -- if something's on sale, it doesn't have to be on sale to everybody."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,62.72,93.64,"Well, the critical phrase, Mr. Chief Justice, is not ""sale."" It is ""on sale."" And I do think that the more natural understanding of ""on sale"" is that something has been made available for purchase by the public. And so, for instance, if after this argument in the lawyers lounge I turn to my friend, Mr. Jay, and I say, I see that you didn't bring a coat today, I'll sell you my coat for $5, I'm not sure that that would be putting my coat on sale in the same way that it would be if I turned around to the audience and said I'll sell this coat to the highest bidder."
2018.17-1229,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,93.64,100.84,"Why not? I don't -- and if it's sold, it's pretty hard to say something that has been sold was not on sale."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,100.84,123.76,"I think that the concept of ""on sale,"" Justice Kavanaugh, conveys some sense of broader availability or, at a minimum, that there's some ambiguity about that. That is to say, I think I'm willing to recognize that perhaps you could make the argument that even offering something privately to one person could be said to be putting something on sale. Our view as a textual matter is that to the extent that there's any ambiguity --"
2018.17-1229,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,123.76,131.12,"Isn't it always the case that if you offer it to even one person or to a small group of people, it's on sale?"
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,131.12,131.56,I think that I would --
2018.17-1229,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,131.56,133.0,I -- I guess I'm not understanding that.
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,133.0,140.48,"I think I would say, Justice Kavanaugh, that something can be on sale regardless of how widely it is, in fact, sold."
2018.17-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,172.12,205.2,"You said that the opinions of this Court support you, but, of course, you know perfectly well is you have -- we only have Justice Story, Learned Hand, and I guess various others, maybe John Marshall for all I know, who -- who -- who said that that isn't the sole purpose, that the purpose of this on-sale rule including private sales is to prevent people from benefiting from their invention prior to and beyond the 20 years that they're allowed."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,205.2,205.56,Justice --
2018.17-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,205.56,213.08,"And -- and that's -- so I read that, I had my clerk look it up, seems right."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,213.08,225.6,"Justice Breyer, Respondents' whole argument before this Court, I would respectfully submit, is really a junior varsity version of congressional ratification. No fewer than six times in their brief they refer to the two centuries of precedent."
2018.17-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,225.6,225.8,Uh-huh.
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,225.8,230.76,"I would respectfully vigorously disagree with that, particularly with regard to this Court's decisions."
2018.17-1229,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,282.64,287.24,Doesn't commercial exploit -- exploitation also undergird the bar?
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,287.24,294.36,"I don't think we would dispute that that is one way of characterizing the underlying purpose, and that is what Judge Hand said in the Metallizing opinion."
2018.17-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,294.36,296.24,"And, of course, that can all be secret."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,297.44,298.0,But I don't think --
2018.17-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,298.0,298.52,You have an invention --
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,298.52,298.84,I think to --
2018.17-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,298.84,303.48,"-- that is practiced -- well, I'm looking at the word ""practice."" And it's not just one word."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,314.36,314.88,Let me say --
2018.17-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,314.88,324.52,"And, therefore, we have two that do not involve the public awareness of the invention itself or how it is produced."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,324.52,343.04,"So let me say just one last thing about this Court's decisions and then address that concern directly. I think that if you were to adopt our interpretation under which public availability is required to trigger the on-sale bar, just like all of the other bars, you would not have to discard any of the reasoning of this Court's cases and you wouldn't have to change any of the outcomes of this Court's cases."
2018.17-1229,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,397.16,398.12,"Mr. Shanmugam, is it --"
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,398.12,399.76,Our submission is simply that the statute --
2018.17-1229,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,399.76,410.48,-- may -- may -- would you please clarify one thing? I -- I thought that one argument was that the AIA changed the way it was.
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,425.8,433.32,"Justice Ginsburg, as I said at the outset, I think that what Congress did in the AIA was to clarify the proper understanding of the phrase."
2018.17-1229,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,452.24,452.72,If that was a --
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,452.72,453.48,-- in terms of what the --
2018.17-1229,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,453.48,464.0,"-- if that was a clarification, it was a terrible clarification because there were a lot of efforts, as you well know, to actually change the ""on sale"" language, and those all failed."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,464.0,470.8,"I think, in fairness, Justice Kavanaugh, I would say that this was exactly the way to achieve Congress's dual objective."
2018.17-1229,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,471.08,477.88,"You don't think it would have been easier to just change it directly, as many members of Congress tried to do repeatedly and failed?"
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,477.88,482.32,"I -- I think that that is, with respect, an overstatement of what members of Congress tried to do."
2018.17-1229,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,707.76,717.56,"On -- on the first part of what you just said as to what the law was, the amicus brief, the Lemley amicus brief says the law has always treated secret sales and uses as prior art."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,718.96,720.12,I am disagreeing with that.
2018.17-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,739.8,808.68,"What about Bonito Boats? I mean, in Bonito Boats, this Court, while it isn't necessary for the holding, does quote Learned Hand, and it does say it is a condition upon the inventor's right to a patent that he shall not exploit his discovery competitively after it is ready for patenting. He has to go ahead and patent it or keep it a secret forever. So an inventor who, in fact, in year one has his invention ready for patenting, and goes around from one person to another secretly selling it to each with a confidentiality agreement, is a person who is exploiting his agreement -- his invention, and, therefore, since he didn't do it through a patent, he loses the right for a patent. That seemed to me the clear -- pretty clear rationale of Learned Hand, of why the Court did that in Bonito Boats, of why Justice Story said what he said, and I think it's that that the Lemley brief was relying upon when they made that statement."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,808.68,814.24,We are not disagreeing that that can be fairly read to be a purpose of the on-sale bar.
2018.17-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,846.08,853.44,"Can we -- can we accept that point, write something in your favor on that, that is, that there is a question of what is on sale."
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,886.44,886.84,I -- I don't think we want --
2018.17-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.84,887.52,-- the Lemley brief. I've read the Lemley brief.
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,887.92,890.16,"Justice Breyer, I don't think we want much more than that."
2018.17-1229,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,893.6,893.84,Yes.
2018.17-1229,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,893.84,907.24,"I mean, I think that we think that this Court should correct the Federal Circuit's error, which is to say that public availability is not required. Now Respondents, we believe, have forfeited any argument that there is public availability here."
2018.17-1229,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,938.08,949.32,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart."
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,949.32,959.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the government's view, there are two basic reasons that the transaction at issue here shouldn't be held to trigger the on-sale bar."
2018.17-1229,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1089.24,1091.04,If you ask a consumer.
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1101.92,1102.36,I think you --
2018.17-1229,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1102.36,1105.24,That I didn't win is irrelevant to me.
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1110.6,1121.04,"You -- you might use a phrase like ""on sale to distributors"" or ""on sale to resalers"" -- ""resellers,"" but I don't think you would use the phrase ""on sale"" standing alone."
2018.17-1229,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1129.88,1150.52,"This definition of ""on sale,"" to be frank with you, I've looked at the history cited in the briefs, I looked at the cases, I don't find it anywhere. You're sort of giving ""on sale to the public"" its meaning, but those are not the words used by Congress."
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1157.76,1172.48,"It said -- it retained the phrase ""on sale,"" but it added the phrase ""or otherwise available to the public."" And that served two purposes. It functioned as a catch-all so that things that were not enumerated might still constitute prior art."
2018.17-1229,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1183.92,1186.88,Doesn't that defeat your argument?
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1186.88,1187.32,I'm sorry?
2018.17-1229,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1187.32,1208.72,"If that phrase has an independent meaning, and you've just given it two, then why don't we take the words Congress used with their history? Because they didn't say ""on sale to the public""; they just said ""on sale."" And when you have a historical term that has a history, as a matter of course, we look at that history."
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1208.72,1215.88,"I -- I think it's certainly appropriate to -- to look to the Court's -- to -- to the history, in particular to this -- particularly to this Court's prior decisions."
2018.17-1229,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1230.52,1247.24,"So is that right? If -- if -- if you assume for a moment that the law was pretty settled before the AIA, then do you think that the AIA would -- that the language added in the AIA would have been capable of flipping that settled law?"
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1247.24,1251.72,If you thought it was settled by this Court's decisions that the on-sale bar applied to this sort --
2018.17-1229,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1251.72,1259.52,How about if I say it was settled because this Court had decided Pfaff and because the Federal Circuit had a number of cases?
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1259.52,1318.04,"I -- I don't think that's sufficient to treat the law as settled, especially because there is evidence both from the face of the statute, the fact that ""otherwise available to the public"" was added, also from the legislative history, that Congress was attempting to clarify that the enumerated terms were ways of making the invention available to the public. I mean, the other thing I would say to -- to follow up on something that my -- my colleague mentioned is that one of the justifications for the on-sale bar traditionally has been prevent the inventor from profiting before he is ready to put his invention up for patent. And that justification -- that justification is neither sufficient nor necessary on Respondents' view of the case. That is, as Mr. Shanmugam pointed out, Respondents themselves agree that there are other transactions by which Helsinn could have gotten money up front, could have gotten seed money in return, for instance, for promising a share of the profits."
2018.17-1229,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1351.56,1351.72,So --
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1351.72,1353.0,-- because there's a UCC sale.
2018.17-1229,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1353.0,1357.6,"So, Mr. Stewart, I'm going to ask you to accept my assumption, and it's a big assumption, I realize that."
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1373.36,1380.0,"No, I think that would be a fairly oblique way of attempting to overturn kind of a settled body of law."
2018.17-1229,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1403.92,1404.24,You --
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1404.24,1406.2,"I'm sorry, Justice Kavanaugh?"
2018.17-1229,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1406.2,1406.88,Go ahead.
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1406.88,1440.08,"And the -- the Court has recognized that even when an invention is being used out in the public square in a manner that is visible to the public, it's not the sort of public use that triggers the public use bar if it is being done for experimental purposes, to verify that the invention will work as a stage precedent to patenting. And the Court in Pfaff strongly indicated, if a sale is made so that the buyer can engage in experimentation, rather than to use the product to achieve its intended benefits, that won't trigger the on-sale bar."
2018.17-1229,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1440.08,1457.32,"You -- you mentioned the legislative history, but, here, isn't this a classic example of trying to snatch victory from defeat in some of the legislative statements? In other words, there was this law before, as Justice Kagan mentions, a huge effort to change it, lots of proposals to change it."
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1468.16,1471.76,"Well, to answer that, let me point to -- to one of the things --"
2018.17-1229,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1471.76,1473.4,What's wrong with thinking that way?
2018.17-1229,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1473.4,1498.12,"I think what's wrong with thinking that way is that, as we've pointed out in our brief, the -- the prior art provision encompasses two conceptually distinct ways of placing an invention in the public domain. If the invention is patented or described in a printed publication, that means that the inventive idea has been made available to persons skilled in the art such that they would be able to make it."
2018.17-1229,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.64,1567.52,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Jay."
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1567.52,1578.08,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A product that is sold or offered for commercial sale is on sale, as this Court has consistently read that term."
2018.17-1229,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1654.6,1671.04,"Well, I think the most serious argument you have to deal with is the meaning -- the plain meaning -- the fairly plain meaning of the new statutory language. So you say ""on sale"" means on sale publicly or on sale privately, right?"
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1671.04,1671.4,Right.
2018.17-1229,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1671.56,1672.04,All right.
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1672.04,1673.52,"-- on sale, period, full stop."
2018.17-1229,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1673.52,1673.88,Okay.
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1699.0,1701.04,I -- I think it would be confusing.
2018.17-1229,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1717.52,1741.0,"It would be -- it would be nonsense because the meaning of ""otherwise"" is in the same -- in some other manner, to do the same thing in some other manner. And you have -- what we have now after this change is an enumerated -- is an enumeration of a number of things that are public, a printed publication in public use, two things that are obviously public. Then we have on sale."
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1754.16,1755.92,So two points.
2018.17-1229,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1756.44,1758.2,"That's what ""otherwise"" means."
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1758.2,1789.92,"So, of course, you know, Your Honor sort of asked me to assume that this is a statute that's being written from scratch, and I think that that takes off the table all of the history of the statute as it was before 2011. But, second, even taking -- even taking that off the table and looking at the statute, a statute like the one that you've proposed, the reason that your example is different from this statute is that, in your example, there's one category, on sale privately, that doesn't even have any overlap with available to the public. And we've never disputed that many sales do, in fact, make inventions available to the public."
2018.17-1229,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1839.52,1841.52,So -- so the new category consists of offers?
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1841.52,1847.8,"The new -- sorry, the new category consists of things that make the -- that otherwise make the invention available to the public."
2018.17-1229,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1847.8,1849.76,And what would be within that category?
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1849.76,1856.44,"An oral presentation at a conference without slides, you know, PowerPoint slides that get distributed."
2018.17-1229,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1929.16,1930.04,Mr. Jay --
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1930.04,1930.36,Yes.
2018.17-1229,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1930.36,1933.24,-- you were cut off before you gave an example.
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1955.24,1957.52,So let me answer the second part first --
2018.17-1229,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1957.52,1958.12,Confidential-wise.
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1958.12,1961.04,-- just because I think -- I think -- I think it's a pretty straightforward answer.
2018.17-1229,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1969.76,1975.48,"I'm sorry. Explain that to me, an on sale -- no -- there is no on-sale bar --"
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1975.48,1975.72,Right.
2018.17-1229,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1975.72,1977.6,-- public or private?
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,1977.6,1977.88,Right.
2018.17-1229,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.44,2128.68,"Can -- can you answer Justice Alito's and Justice Sotomayor's first question? That is, I can think of examples, but they're a little awkward."
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2173.88,2176.6,"So I actually -- and thank you, Your Honor. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2176.6,2180.76,The -- the example that we thought of actually is -- is --
2018.17-1229,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.76,2182.84,There were an awful lot of them.
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2182.84,2188.52,"There are -- is very close to your -- your football, baseball, swimming example."
2018.17-1229,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2216.2,2218.04,"Well, I'll give you another one."
2018.17-1229,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2218.04,2219.56,"Well, it would be nonsense."
2018.17-1229,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2219.56,2221.16,"I'll give you another one, Mr. Jay."
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2240.52,2245.56,So I think that the reason that that hypothetical -- so I think I would say no.
2018.17-1229,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2248.12,2250.12,"In other words, can I buy nutless brownies?"
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2250.12,2251.28,I think so -- I think you can.
2018.17-1229,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2267.92,2271.8,"You're saying it's not even like a little bit doubtful what ""on sale"" means?"
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2271.8,2276.76,"Certainly not by the time the AIA was -- was enacted, no, I don't think that it was."
2018.17-1229,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2293.28,2298.16,"Because, in Mr. Shanmugam's excellent brief, he -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1229,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2298.16,2302.52,"-- he certainly seems to think that ""on sale"" means something different from what you thought it meant."
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2319.12,2324.6,"So -- well, of course, it is doing something on both sides' reading, and I think that, you know, that it creates this new category --"
2018.17-1229,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2324.6,2325.04,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2325.04,2325.48,-- but -- right.
2018.17-1229,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2325.48,2326.08,You know what I mean.
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2326.08,2326.36,I do.
2018.17-1229,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2382.36,2383.4,But given your position --
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2383.4,2384.12,-- at the end of the process.
2018.17-1229,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2384.12,2388.84,"I'm -- I'm sorry. Given your position, you have the wrong answer to the brownies hypothetical, I think, because --"
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2388.84,2394.0,"Oh, so if you -- if you -- my answer to the brownies hypothetical is -- is based on the idea --"
2018.17-1229,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2394.0,2398.8,"As a term, it covers with nuts or without nuts, right?"
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2398.8,2401.76,So I -- I guess it -- right. It depends --
2018.17-1229,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2401.76,2403.24,Maybe we lost the hypothetical.
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2403.24,2403.68,"Yeah, right."
2018.17-1229,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2410.52,2411.52,"Well, it's a good --"
2018.17-1229,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2411.52,2413.24,You were saying it was ambiguous -- (Laughter.)
2018.17-1229,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2413.24,2414.68,You were saying it's ambiguous.
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2420.64,2423.64,"I -- so I am saying that ""on sale"" is ambiguous."
2018.17-1229,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2424.16,2424.72,Not --
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2424.72,2425.72,-- if you open the dictionary and --
2018.17-1229,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2425.72,2427.4,"You're saying it's not ambiguous, ""on sale""?"
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2427.4,2431.0,"I'm saying that ""on sale"" is not ambiguous."
2018.17-1229,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2437.2,2441.48,"Even though it says ""otherwise available to the public,"" it's still not ambiguous?"
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2441.48,2447.08,"Even though it says ""otherwise available to the public,"" it's still not ambiguous, that's right, because it -- it would take more than that."
2018.17-1229,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2491.8,2504.48,"Well, they cite the Paroline case as an example of a case where a term -- a statute was structured like this, and the term in the catch-all then was used to influence the interpretation of the preceding terms."
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2504.48,2504.72,It was --
2018.17-1229,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2504.72,2505.76,Why is that different?
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2505.76,2510.56,"It was used as -- the Court said, it was used -- it summarized what the -- you know, what the preceding terms did."
2018.17-1229,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2604.48,2621.88,"Mr. Jay, say we disagree with you, just for the purposes of this hypothetical, and think that the introduction of the ""otherwise"" clause introduced some ambiguity about what ""on sale"" means now. I understand the Patent Office has an interpretation of the statute."
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2625.12,2629.2,I -- I think that it -- it would only be relevant if it had the power to persuade.
2018.17-1229,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2895.12,2904.2,"Mr. Jay, would the prior secret sale of an invention by somebody other than the patentholder invalidate the patentholder's patent?"
2018.17-1229,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2904.2,2947.2,"I think the answer is yes, but I -- I've not seen cases like that because I think it would be exceptionally difficult to discover, whereas the way that the sale in this case came to light and the way in which sales in patent cases generally come to light is through discovery from the inventor. You know, as the Court said in Pfaff, you want the inventor to have control about the timing and the choice to commercialize the invention. And so a rule that gives the inventor control over that necessarily has to leave out the possibility that someone else might also have the invention and start selling it, but that's not been an implementation problem in -- in reality. If the Court has no further questions, I'm prepared to yield back the balance of my time."
2018.17-1229,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2947.2,2950.84,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam, you have four minutes remaining."
2018.17-1229,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2950.84,2955.72,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Our fundamental submission today is a simple one."
2018.17-1229,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3063.68,3069.2,"You have a whole brief, I mean, you know, you have a brief -- I mean, everybody's is excellent."
2018.17-1229,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3093.08,3093.52,Just as --
2018.17-1229,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3093.52,3095.0,Now that gives a meaning to it.
2018.17-1229,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3095.0,3095.52,Yes.
2018.17-1229,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3100.2,3100.96,Sometimes.
2018.17-1229,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3104.4,3105.28,-- with a catch-all provision.
2018.17-1229,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3236.12,3237.52,"Thank you, counsel."
