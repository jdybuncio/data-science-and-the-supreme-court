1984.83-1708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.507,We will hear arguments next in Reynolds against Byrd.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,79.614,80.503,Thank you.
1984.83-1708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.175,219.845,Mr. Bell--
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,219.845,220.896,Yes?
1984.83-1708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.896,236.384,--do you think we should assume that a prior arbitration of the state law claims would have preclusive effect in a subsequent federal trial involving the same issues?
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,236.384,244.922,"If you are talking collateral estoppel, I do not believe so, because the mechanisms of arbitration generally are such."
1984.83-1708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,260.771,269.166,"So in your view, at least, the prior arbitration of the state claims would not have preclusive effect?"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,269.166,270.738,--Absolutely not.
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.073,280.994,"Mr. Bell, is it not your view, though, that the arbitration should await the federal case?"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,280.994,281.925,"No, sir."
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,281.925,283.585,"Oh, you want the arbitration to proceed?"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,283.585,316.266,"I personally would subscribe to the Dickenson theory approach, and that is one of the circuits that have decided against intertwining, and it feels that the protections afforded under the '34 Act are better served by reserving to the federal district court the right of priority to determine the federal securities law claim and thus stay the arbitration until that federal securities law claim has in fact been determined."
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,316.266,317.398,We must have misunderstood one another.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,317.398,318.109,I am sorry.
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,318.109,319.779,You say the federal trial should go first.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,319.779,320.591,"Yes, I do."
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.591,321.9,"Yes, that's what I thought your position was."
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,321.9,322.321,Yes.
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.019,339.455,"Of course, your position really evaporates, I suppose, if Wilco doesn't apply to this case."
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,339.455,344.517,"--That is the subsidiary question involved here, Mr. Justice White."
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.517,345.837,Don't you have to address that?
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,345.837,347.428,"Yes, I intend to address that."
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,347.428,348.069,Okay.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,352.2,357.253,Initially I was just going to give you a little of the background of the facts of this case.
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.253,358.185,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,358.185,385.784,"According to the complaint, the securities broker/dealer or his registered representative, its registered representative advised Dr. Byrd that if he were to sell his dental practice and invest some $160,000 into the stock market under the management of this registered representative, that the dentist would receive about $4,000 a month, I assume in perpetuity, or at least for his lifetime for annual income."
1984.83-1708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,510.993,513.327,We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,526.274,540.894,"Again, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we had mentioned or I had mentioned just prior to the adjournment that the Ninth Circuit in similar circuit opinions had caused some legal problems."
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.06,582.411,You are really walking a... going up one side of the street and down the other.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,589.918,591.677,"I recognize, sir, that--"
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,591.677,600.964,"And you want to wait until... delay the arbitration, one of the purposes of which is speed and economy."
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,606.817,614.733,"--Mr. Justice White, if you would permit me, I am not saying that that is what I would want to do."
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.733,615.524,"No, but that is what--"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,615.524,617.383,I am saying that that is what the Dickenson--
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.383,618.745,--That is what your motions were aimed at.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,618.745,619.747,"--That is correct, and I am--"
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.747,621.858,"Well, you are stuck with the Wilco case basically."
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,621.858,626.911,"--Well, we are stuck with the Wilco case, at least to this point, but--"
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,626.911,628.771,"Well, without it... you are stuck with it."
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,630.563,634.904,--Then there would be no intertwining because there would be no federal claim subject--
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,634.904,637.058,"--Well, I know, but you wouldn't be... you would be arbitrating everything--"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,637.058,637.947,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.947,638.948,--including the Securities Act claim.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,638.948,640.01,"Yes, sir, Mr. Justice."
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.01,640.918,Which you don't want to do.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,642.02,643.141,I would like to.
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,643.141,644.461,I see.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,644.461,667.356,"I would like to have this Court revisit whether or not Wilco applies to '34 Act claims or 10(b)(5) claims because of the distinctions that this Court noted itself in the Scherk case, those distinctions primarily being the fact that 10(b)(5) or the rights created to sue under 10(b)(5) are not expressly provided in the '34 Act."
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.356,671.47,"Well, Congress said Wilco is based on the fact that Congress had provided--"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,671.47,705.463,"Special rights under the '33 Act, but those special rights are not to be found in the 1934 Act, and this Court analyzed that proposition in the Scherk case and in my opinion came very close to providing one with a platform to say that the Wilco rationale, the Wilco holding does not apply to a claim brought as an implied private right of action under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act."
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,721.111,723.164,--All the Courts of Appeals have--
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,723.164,723.675,--They have all assumed it.
1984.83-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.675,724.426,--Yes.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,724.426,793.812,"They have all assumed it, and it is out of that assumption that this intertwining policy really has grown, but even if this Court, to continue for a moment on Wilco, even if this Court were to use this opportunity, the subsidiary question to make the pronouncement that Wilco does not apply to claims brought as implied rights under the '34 Act, that wouldn't remove the intertwining argument, because that argument could then next be presented in connection with a situation where there is an express statutory right and a special right of the type that this Court determined in Wilco attaches to Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act, and someone then could bring a case that would combine a claim that is specifically, let's say, brought with regard to Section 12(2) of the '33 Act and move into that claim on the common nucleus of facts stakeoff claims that would be subject to arbitration, and the intertwining argument would then raise its ugly head again."
1984.83-1708,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,818.598,843.266,"Apart from the Wilco question, Mr. Bell, if the prior arbitration of the state law claims would not have preclusive effect in the handling of the Federal Securities Act litigation, then why should the District Court have to stay the arbitration?"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,843.266,848.039,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't think it does, and Justice White brought up this question."
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,931.865,949.415,"Mr. Bell, you suggested earlier that there would be no res judicata or estoppel effect of the arbitration... would you take the same position if the arbitration went forward and there were judicial enforcement of the arbitrator's award, so you do have a judicial decree determining certain rights?"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,949.415,953.587,"--I am not sure, Justice Stevens, that I understand your question."
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.587,954.879,Say there is an arbitration.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,974.661,995.043,"I don't believe so, sir, because while there are, as you correctly noted, provisions for in effect converting an arbitration award into a judgment, in view of the fact that you do not have before the Court, in the case I have seen, you do not have findings of fact from the arbitrators."
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1014.959,1015.598,"Well, there could be."
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1024.062,1025.775,--I recognize the possibility of that.
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.775,1027.295,And that judgment could say the same thing.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1027.295,1029.037,I recognize the possibility.
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.026,1031.368,It doesn't always have to be.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1031.368,1033.168,--in practical life it doesn't really happen.
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.168,1037.122,"But if it did happen that way, I suppose that would pretty well answer that issue, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1037.122,1046.148,"If it did happen that way, and there were findings, and in effect it was confirmed by a judgment of a court, you would have a much stronger argument for collateral estoppel."
1984.83-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1046.148,1051.331,"Mr. Bell, I gather you risk punitive damages in the federal court, suit, don't you?"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1051.331,1068.113,"Well, with regard to... as you know, Justice Brennan, with regard to Section 10(b)(5) claims, or claims under the '34 Act anyway, that Act by its own language does not permit damages beyond actual damages suffered by the plaintiff."
1984.83-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1091.769,1094.02,"But there couldn't be any in the arbitration, could there?"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1094.02,1108.328,"--Well, that issue I know has been decided in the state of New York, and the highest court in the state of New York has held that as a matter of public policy, arbitrators are not permitted to award punitive damages."
1984.83-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1112.881,1121.746,"I take it if these state court suits had been brought in state court here, it would have gone to arbitration, would it not?"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1121.746,1122.728,That is correct.
1984.83-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1122.728,1127.4,So then you are sure you wouldn't be exposed to punitive damages.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1127.4,1129.132,That is correct.
1984.83-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1129.132,1137.027,Does that have anything to do with your desire to get into arbitration rather than to stay in the federal court?
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1137.027,1138.49,Of course it does.
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1488.287,1490.587,May I ask one quick question before you do?
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1490.587,1490.927,Yes.
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.927,1501.136,"Under your view of the Seventh Circuit position, which I guess is the same one you take in this case, when may the arbitration go forward, after all appeals have been completed in the federal trial, or after the trial?"
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1501.136,1507.199,"I don't believe that that has been precisely decreed, Justice Stevens."
1984.83-1708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.476,1521.408,So it could be a several year delay.
1984.83-1708,0,21956,eugene_w_bell,,1521.408,1522.69,It might be.
1984.83-1708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1648.671,1649.843,Very well.
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,1653.224,1673.806,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, respondent in this case, Dr. Byrd, sees the issue before the Court as being whether the District Court has discretion to deny arbitration of claims which are otherwise arbitrable when those claims are factually and legally intertwined with a nonarbitrable federal securities claim."
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.942,1773.383,"I suppose our judgment, if we were to make it, that Wilco was not applicable to a claim under the '34 Act, ever though that question is not squarely presented, might affect our judgment as to the force of the intertwining argument."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,1773.383,1774.973,"It certainly would, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.633,1850.233,"Well, normally, even if there is an intertwining, so to speak, the Federal District Court isn't required to entertain the pendent claims, is it?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,1850.233,1852.735,"It is a matter of discretion, Your Honor, yes."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.735,1853.486,"Normally, yes."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,1870.015,1871.137,"It would be arbitrated, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.137,1872.036,"Quickly, too."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,1872.036,1873.248,Yes.
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.273,1881.462,"Well, why should it wait?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,1883.305,1885.716,"--Well, if it occurs first."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.716,1895.922,I would guess an arbitration proceeding could nine times out of ten proceed and be concluded before the securities trial is even well under way.
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,1895.922,1914.644,"The petitioner maintains that a prior arbitration of the pending claims would not affect the federal securities claims, but every Court of Appeal which has considered the question, including those which have opted for a bifurcated proceeding, have expressed concern over the effect that a prior arbitration would have."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1914.644,1915.425,What would be wrong with that?
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,1915.425,1923.871,"Well, it would take from the District Court its exclusive jurisdiction over the federal securities claim by deciding the issues in the arbitral forum."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.871,1928.033,"Well, it wouldn't be trying a federal issue."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,1937.54,1942.531,"Your Honor, that is the point of the intertwining exception."
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.592,1967.82,What is wrong with the federal court having to defer on the same set of operative facts to litigation in some other forum on factual questions?
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,1971.393,1973.062,"No, it does not."
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.936,1993.485,"Well, that is true in any case of res judicata or collateral estoppel, but why shouldn't ordinary principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata apply to a Federal Securities Act claim just like any other claim that is made in federal court?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,1993.485,2003.813,"--Because, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the Congressional purpose was to retain for federal securities claims the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2004.863,2006.204,You can't say that in this case.
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2012.008,2013.639,"Well, that's true in the '33--"
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.639,2017.031,"Well, how can you say what the Congressional intention was then?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2017.031,2019.435,--From the--
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2019.435,2021.274,Like you could in Wilco.
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2021.274,2024.957,"--I will admit, Your Honor, that the circumstances are not identical."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.215,2048.792,"Don't you think it is odd to say that pendent claims need not be entertained by a District Court, and you have to go on and say, and they can't be... and yet they can't be tried out until some other case is tried?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2050.615,2051.504,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.456,2062.262,"Well, I know the discretion of the District Judge, but say he says, I exercise my discretion not to entertain these pendent claims."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2062.262,2062.861,And that has happened.
1984.83-1708,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2062.861,2072.458,"Yes, and yet you would still say that the arbitration may not proceed on the pendent claims that have been rejected by the District Court."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2072.458,2074.451,"I don't know that I would, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2095.373,2105.49,"I agree that your opponent's position is not exactly clear, but at one point in his argument he seemed to say that he would be delighted if the arbitration could go forward."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2105.49,2109.083,"I believe that is true, and yet that was not their motion."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.083,2115.806,"You would oppose the arbitration going forward, however, on the grounds that it would interfere with the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal court."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2115.806,2117.218,That's correct.
1984.83-1708,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2117.218,2128.765,"What's the purpose, then, in contracting parties agreeing to dispose of their cases by arbitration if these blocks are going to be erected?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2128.765,2131.626,"That is a good question, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2131.626,2137.54,"This Court has certainly said, and all the Courts of Appeals have said they favor arbitration."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2139.002,2145.936,"Certainly, and this Court also has reaffirmed quite recently its strong support of resolving disputes through arbitration."
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.897,2171.974,"But the reason it wouldn't occur is because of objections you make to speedy arbitration, it seems to me."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2181.389,2185.723,"Your Honor, in any case there will still be a bifurcated proceeding."
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.353,2189.724,"Well, as long as you are right on the Wilco issue."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2191.687,2193.267,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2193.267,2199.282,"Mr. Benham, do you agree that under the federal act you would not be entitled to punitive damages?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2199.282,2201.785,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2201.785,2207.416,"Do you think it would be in an arbitration, under the arbitration contract between the parties?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2207.416,2218.715,"Well, the arbitration provision provides that it should be... shall be arbitrated according to the laws of the State of New York, and under the laws of the State of New York, arbitrators cannot award punitive damages."
1984.83-1708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2218.715,2225.748,"Yes, so you would have to try the cases together for you to obtain punitive damages."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2225.748,2238.838,"Well, there is reason, Your Honor, to challenge the efficacy of the choice of law that would apply in arbitration in this case, but if New York law is applied, it is true that punitive damages would not be obtained."
1984.83-1708,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2238.838,2243.54,Would you get them in the federal courts if it severed the state law claim?
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2243.54,2245.67,"I believe we would, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2247.813,2249.675,On what theory?
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2249.675,2254.458,"--Well, the only restrictions, not on the federal claim, on the state law claims."
1984.83-1708,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2259.621,2263.006,"No, but would the arbitration agreement, wouldn't the state court send the case to arbitration?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2263.006,2265.575,If they were actually brought in the state court?
1984.83-1708,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2265.575,2266.296,Yes.
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2266.296,2267.608,Yes.
1984.83-1708,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2275.311,2277.532,"Well, I don't quite understand where you get punitive damages."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2277.532,2287.52,"Well, in the state law claims brought, as long as they are tried in a state... in a court, there is a right to punitive damages."
1984.83-1708,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2287.52,2287.93,In a state court?
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2294.105,2298.347,"Unless it was invalidated, it could not."
1984.83-1708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2298.347,2311.345,"But coming back to my question, if the claims are tried together on pendent jurisdiction in the federal court, the federal court can award punitive damages on the state law claim."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2311.345,2312.117,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2312.117,2312.896,Right.
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2330.209,2336.861,"No, Your Honor, it does not, as long as the case is tried in any court."
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2363.288,2366.691,What if it were arbitrated under the law of the state of California?
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2375.016,2376.859,I could find no authority on that.
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2389.605,2396.361,"That, too, is kind of inconsistent with the theory of arbitration, isn't it?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2407.758,2409.21,"Well, that is true."
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.096,2419.776,I don't see why.
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2427.283,2429.142,You certainly are.
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2598.753,2602.634,"It would not, though, I take it, if you adopted the Seventh Circuit view."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2602.634,2617.685,"If you adopt the Seventh Circuit's view, we would contend that it also impacts on the federal securities claim in a more subtle way in that it puts the plaintiff to a choice as to whether to litigate his claim in two separate forums or whether to forego either the federal securities claim or the pending claims."
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2617.685,2628.992,"Well, that impacts on the pendent claim, but if he has the right to choose, how does it impair his federal claim, because he can go forward with his federal claim unimpaired by the other claim under the Seventh Circuit view."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2630.535,2637.958,"You mean that because of the delay and expense of prosecuting two separate proceedings, he cannot do both?"
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.958,2647.665,"Well, no, because the arbitration must await the conclusion of the federal proceeding in order to protect the very value that you are relying on, namely, the integrity of the federal claim."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2647.665,2661.223,"Nevertheless, it is possible that a plaintiff may decide to forego the federal securities claim and proceed only on the state... the pending claims because of the delay and expense of resolving the entire matter."
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.913,2695.176,"Well, the impact is, he may have something he prefers."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2697.878,2699.26,That is true.
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2816.065,2824.32,Is that an issue in this case whether apart from the Securities Act rule of Wilco this contract would have been enforceable under California law?
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2824.32,2826.601,Not directly whether it would be enforced.
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.382,2843.093,"Yes, but I--"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2843.093,2845.074,"In the context of this case, neither of those exist."
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2845.074,2857.972,"--Well, but I take it someone under... someone who is assigned an arbitration contract under California law is presumably bound by it unless it was not enforceable under the law of California."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2859.502,2860.564,"That is true, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2860.564,2865.597,So isn't the question before the District Judge is this contract enforceable under California law?
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2865.597,2869.06,"Yes, Your Honor, I guess it would be."
1984.83-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2869.06,2873.622,He doesn't have to go into all the other factors.
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2881.007,2882.707,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2959.547,2962.95,"May I just ask you... maybe this is obvious, but I am just trying to think it through."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2977.309,2980.812,As to those claims which are legally and factually intertwined.
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2980.812,2981.633,Which are pendent to the federal claim.
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2981.633,2990.8,"And there are circumstances where, although acknowledging the intertwining doctrine, certain claims were nevertheless sent to arbitration, for example in Sibley versus Tandy."
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2990.8,2996.814,"Your argument really is strongest in a case where everything would be tried at once, presumably where you get total intertwining in effect."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,2996.814,2997.623,Yes.
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2997.623,3005.599,"The net effect, though, is to just make a nullity out of, A, the arbitration agreement itself, and B, the federal policy in favor of arbitration."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,3005.599,3009.41,It does in that particular circumstance.
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3009.41,3009.941,Maybe it is the right answer.
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,3011.994,3013.223,That's correct.
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3013.223,3024.871,"And I suppose you would say that if the District Judge found intertwining, he necessarily would entertain the pendent claims rather than exercise his discretion not to?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,3024.871,3028.214,"No, he would have the discretion to entertain them or not."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.214,3029.246,Even though he found them intertwining?
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,3029.246,3033.466,"That is all we are asking for, Your Honor, is that the District Judge have the discretion to make that decision."
1984.83-1708,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3033.466,3040.341,"Well, he should never find intertwining if he is going to not entertain it."
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,3044.825,3047.038,"That's true, Your Honor."
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.038,3056.723,"What standard would guide his discretion if you say he has a preoption of either trying it all in one ball of wax or saying, well, I will do what your opponents want?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,3058.736,3064.48,I think he would have to find that the issues were factually and legally intertwined.
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3064.48,3065.131,Right.
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,3065.131,3065.598,And he--
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3065.598,3068.891,"Having found that, what standard then guides his discretion?"
1984.83-1708,1,21820,eric_v_benham,,3068.891,3079.059,--Whether there would be an adverse impact on the federal securities claim by severing the claims and sending them to arbitration.
1984.83-1708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3117.523,3119.694,Very well.
1984.83-1708,2,21956,eugene_w_bell,,3120.906,3121.975,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3122.887,3124.92,You have four minutes remaining.
1984.83-1708,2,21956,eugene_w_bell,,3124.92,3135.236,"It is of interest to me that the attention of the argument focused quickly on punitive damages, which are, of course, not available under the federal laws."
1984.83-1708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3173.701,3176.273,"Mr. Bell, I am still a little confused."
1984.83-1708,2,21956,eugene_w_bell,,3183.048,3186.66,--I agree that there are cases that so hold.
1984.83-1708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3186.66,3187.749,How about this case?
1984.83-1708,2,21956,eugene_w_bell,,3187.749,3205.961,The Ninth Circuit has awarded punitive damages under... has affirmed the award of punitive damages when a 10(b)(5) claim was tried along with state claims and said that while we can't--
1984.83-1708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3205.961,3208.222,But in the state claims?
1984.83-1708,2,21956,eugene_w_bell,,3208.222,3210.223,--Beg pardon?
1984.83-1708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3210.223,3211.995,Allow punitive damages--
1984.83-1708,2,21956,eugene_w_bell,,3211.995,3213.225,For the state claims only.
1984.83-1708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3213.225,3214.086,--for the state claims only.
1984.83-1708,2,21956,eugene_w_bell,,3214.086,3215.458,The state claims only.
1984.83-1708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3215.458,3226.235,"Well, now, tell me, if this case were tried in California state courts, if those state claims were brought there, I gather there could be no punitive damages, could there?"
1984.83-1708,2,21956,eugene_w_bell,,3226.235,3230.796,"No, because under... the claims would be referred to arbitration."
1984.83-1708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3230.796,3232.088,"That's what I thought, yes."
1984.83-1708,2,21956,eugene_w_bell,,3232.088,3251.63,"And to return to the question asked earlier about arbitration, I believe the rationale of the New York state opinion with regard to an arbitrator's power to award punitive damage would be applied in almost any state that considered it, and that is that punitive damages are not a matter of a plaintiff's right."
1984.83-1708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3378.165,3378.785,"Your time has expired, Mr. Bell."
