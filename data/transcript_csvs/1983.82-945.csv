1983.82-945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.687,We will hear arguments next in Sure-Tan and Surak Leather Company against National Labor Relations Board.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,86.269,101.738,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, is it an unfair labor practice for employer to ask the Immigration and Naturalization Service to investigate the immigration status of its employees?"
1983.82-945,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,166.461,171.985,"Incidentally, does he know the immigration status of his present employees?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,171.985,175.067,"Your Honor, I don't know."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.999,491.224,What if it is found as a matter of fact that the employer acted solely because of his opposition to the union and the employees' desire to have a union?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,497.959,501.162,"If that were found, it would make no difference, Your Honor."
1983.82-945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,510.929,514.87,Let's assume in the abstract that that's correct.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,524.788,529.849,"Certainly, Your Honor, and it does so in every case that involves motive."
1983.82-945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,529.849,530.46,It did so here.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,530.46,532.012,"Yes, it did so here."
1983.82-945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,532.012,545.36,"The board said, in effect, all right, this is an exercise of your right to petition the government, but in the circumstances in which you exercised that right, it has some other meaning to us."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,545.36,546.862,In essence--
1983.82-945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,546.862,547.752,Isn't that what they did?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,547.752,548.893,"--That is what they did, Your Honor."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.903,586.087,So you don't dispute the fact that there was an anti-union motive somewhere in this set of facts?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,586.087,599.026,"--I cannot put myself in Mr. Surak's head, but I can certainly tell you there was a dispute between the union and the company, just as there was in Bill Johnson's Restaurant, and the--"
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.026,609.732,"Now, so there was... the employer was motivated by an anti-union bias, I take it."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,612.243,614.326,"--Certainly not, and he--"
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.326,615.806,--But there was that in the case.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,615.806,617.228,--That was found below.
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.228,618.858,"Yes, yes."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,618.858,620.921,"And that is not relevant, however, with--"
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.921,622.551,"And sustained, and enforced."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,622.551,630.315,"--That is not relevant, however, with respect to the right to exercise the constitutional right to report a violation of the law."
1983.82-945,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.315,647.169,"Mr. Flaherty, are you sure that the right to turn in aliens to the... illegal aliens to the INS can be equated with filing a lawsuit in state court, the way you had in Bill Johnson's, for constitutional purposes?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,647.169,650.02,"Very definitely, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-945,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,696.7,699.582,"But, Mr. Flaherty, isn't there a difference in the facts here?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,707.306,710.699,He had had reports several months earlier.
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,710.699,714.792,He listed other people besides these who were not in fact illegal aliens.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,714.792,716.042,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,716.042,718.285,So he really didn't know which were and which were not.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,718.285,720.106,He had received reports--
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,720.106,721.107,That what?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,721.107,723.428,--that some of these employees were present illegally.
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,723.428,723.739,Some of them were.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,723.739,724.487,And also--
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,724.487,727.75,"And he sort of just tossed a bunch over and said, look at all of them."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,727.75,741.049,"--He had asked the employees after the election, before this letter was written, whether they were present legally, and a number of them said, no, they weren't, so he did know at that time."
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,742.669,743.761,Does the record show that?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,743.761,745.07,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1983.82-945,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,745.07,763.112,"Mr. Flaherty, in Bill Johnson's, is it possible it should be distinguished because there the employer was asserting, trying to assert in state court an alleged injury to the employer's own reputation?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,774.451,784.356,"The holding in Bill Johnson's focused on the First Amendment right to petition the government, and it said, for that reason, as well as--"
1983.82-945,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,784.356,795.473,"Well, I think the opinion also focused on the fact that the employer would have been left with no forum in which to pursue a remedy for an actual injury to the employer."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,797.736,799.056,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1983.82-945,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,812.637,816.667,"Well, it was certainly discussed by the Court, and apparently relied upon."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,816.667,818.089,--It was discussed.
1983.82-945,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.838,848.578,But the complaint was not against these men.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,850.04,851.71,I am sorry?
1983.82-945,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,851.71,854.812,The complaint was against the union.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,854.812,859.035,"No, the letter, Justice Marshall, was--"
1983.82-945,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,859.035,860.087,I am not talking about the letter.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,866.18,868.613,--That--
1983.82-945,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,868.613,870.092,Correct?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,870.092,873.054,--This letter was written after the union won the election.
1983.82-945,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,874.136,875.917,And that is what brought it on.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,875.917,879.4,This petition to the government is what brought on this case.
1983.82-945,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,880.651,884.712,"Well, was the letter brought on by the election?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,884.712,891.518,I can... It was written after the union won the election.
1983.82-945,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,891.518,895.109,And that is what... it came after the election.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,895.109,896.83,"That's correct, after the union won the election."
1983.82-945,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,896.83,898.73,"And before the election, everything was hunky-dory."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,898.73,906.647,"Well, before the election... it was after the election that he asked the employees whether they were legally present here, and they admitted that they were illegally present here."
1983.82-945,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,910.01,918.645,"Well, the board and the lower courts drew the inference from the factual situation, though, that he was animated by antiunion animus in doing this."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,918.645,919.254,That is--
1983.82-945,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,919.254,921.737,And certainly we don't review that sort of thing now.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,921.737,922.306,"--No, we are not reviewing that."
1983.82-945,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,957.679,974.341,What have lower courts done in the labor law area about instances where an employer has reported an employee out of an antiunion animus to law enforcement officers for commission of a crime?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,978.272,982.686,"Justice O'Connor, I am not aware of any other cases."
1983.82-945,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,987.239,998.448,"I think it may be in this Court, but have there not been some other cases below in the dealing with reporting of criminal violations?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1000.919,1002.619,"I am not aware of any, no."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.619,1006.733,What was the issue in Johnson?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1016.188,1036.182,"That is correct, and it was alleged that the suit was brought in retaliation for the employees exercising their concerted... their right to engage in concerted protected activities, and in retaliation for their having filed a complaint, and that is precisely what is presented here."
1983.82-945,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1082.351,1091.598,"Mr. Flaherty, is it illegal for an employer to hire illegal aliens?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1091.598,1093.378,"No, it is not, Justice Blackmun."
1983.82-945,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1093.378,1112.22,"Well, if you prevail here, then isn't a way to avoid the confines of the Labor Act just to keep hiring illegal aliens, and when one gets into a labor bind, report them to the INS?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1112.22,1121.717,"Your Honor, in this case, Sure-Tan is subject to... they voted in the union."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.508,1149.505,"Could you have fired, without committing an unfair labor practice, could you have fired the illegal aliens for the reason that they were illegal aliens?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1149.505,1156.749,"For the reason that they were illegal aliens, certainly."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.781,1162.583,"And that would be a firing for cause under the collective bargaining agreement, if there was one?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1162.583,1164.596,There was not a collective bargaining--
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.596,1165.097,I know.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1173.052,1185.359,"--That would depend upon the arbitration case law, and I have not read arbitration cases covering that, but I would certainly think that firing an illegal alien because he is an illegal alien would be just cause."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.359,1189.333,Even after the union won an election?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1189.333,1192.022,"Yes, it would."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.115,1205.593,"So you would say that if one of the reasons for firing a person is that he is an illegal alien, and another reason is because he is a member of the union, that it is not an unfair labor practice?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1205.593,1208.024,"Definitely not, in this case."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1208.916,1209.885,Definitely not what?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1210.946,1217.179,"--It is not an unfair labor practice in this case, because he had a right to report a violation of the law, a First Amendment right."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.179,1223.844,"--Well, I would think it would be a fortiori in this case if you are right in my example."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1241.056,1244.038,If there is antiunion animus?
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1244.038,1244.889,Yes.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1244.889,1249.191,"I would say no, then there would be an unfair labor practice."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1249.191,1250.052,All right.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1250.052,1257.455,Because in that case you are not reporting a violation of the law.
1983.82-945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1262.998,1264.42,You are sort of... you are enforcing the law yourself then.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1271.914,1279.481,"--Well, no, in this case the enforcement of the law came by reporting it properly to the law enforcement agency."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.813,1288.608,"Well, I know, but you say you would be privileged to fire them without committing an unfair labor practice, right?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1288.608,1292.489,You did not mention that there was antiunion animus in your hypothetical.
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1292.489,1305.346,"Well, let's say there was not an antiunion animus, but there was a collective bargaining agreement that says you can't fire except for just cause, and he fires a bunch of employees because they are illegal aliens."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1309.1,1316.664,"Well, interpretation of a collective bargaining contract depends upon arbitration case law and the past history of the parties and so forth."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.664,1318.166,"Well, what is that law, do you think?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1319.506,1324.24,"I definitely think that they could fire under that circumstance, yes--"
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.24,1324.889,"Yes, yes."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1331.704,1335.798,--That would violate the labor laws.
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1360.342,1362.816,"Mr. Flaherty, may I ask you a follow-up on Justice Blackmun's question?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1362.816,1363.525,--Sure.
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.525,1384.518,"You responded by pointing out in this case there was a remedy that was possible, but just as the general problem, would it not be true that if you prevail, an employer would be well advised to hire illegal aliens before they are organized and let them know promptly that if they do organize, they will be reported; if they don't organize, they won't be?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1391.613,1394.125,Well--
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.125,1396.556,Maybe that's fine.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1400.119,1421.373,"--Regardless of how this Court holds, Your Honor, it is a possible consequence, yes, but if this Court were to hold that that is an unfair labor practice, to report a crime to the law enforcement agency, that would not end this problem at all."
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.167,1434.511,But the result for which you are arguing would encourage the employment of illegal aliens by unorganized employers.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1436.293,1438.815,It is a possible consequence.
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1441.637,1444.649,Which in turn might encourage more illegal aliens to come to the country.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1444.649,1452.894,"--People hire illegal aliens for a number of reasons, whether it be to perform work that other people don't want to do because they work for less money."
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.978,1460.629,But you think we should encourage the practice?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1460.629,1464.25,Certainly not and I am not saying that this Court would--
1983.82-945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.25,1467.743,But the result for which you are arguing I think you have acknowledged would encourage the practice.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1467.743,1468.594,--It is possible.
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1591.463,1604.533,What if the only remedy the board imposed was an order to reinstate once the company... once the alien is back in the country legally?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1604.533,1609.105,"That would comport with immigration laws, certainly."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.105,1612.408,"Well, what about the labor laws?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1612.408,1615.921,That would comport with the labor laws as well.
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.921,1623.204,"Well, I know, but that would leave a remedy standing, a remedy which is premised on an unfair labor practice."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1626.246,1633.782,"Well, assuming, contrary to fact, that there was an unfair labor practice, a remedy that would--"
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1633.782,1658.567,"Well, I am just saying that in this very case, if the only remedy that had been imposed by the board was an order to reinstate once the... if and when the alien is back in the country legally, Now, you would still be here, I take it, because that remedy would be... the predicate for that remedy would be an unfair labor practice, was the fact that there was an unfair labor practice."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1658.567,1659.208,--That's right.
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.5,1676.949,"Well, I know, but the board could have had full regard for the labor board... for the immigration laws, and you still would be here."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1676.949,1691.028,"If they had full regard for the immigration laws, then they would not have... first of all, they would not have imposed back pay for a period of time when they were not lawfully available for work."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1691.028,1702.428,"I guess what I am asking really is that the Court of Appeals may have been wrong in some of its remedy decisions, but that doesn't mean it was wrong in saying there was an unfair labor practice."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1702.428,1705.948,"Oh, I certainly think they were wrong in saying there was an unfair labor practice."
1983.82-945,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.948,1707.31,But you are making two different arguments.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1707.31,1708.261,"Yes, I am making two different arguments."
1983.82-945,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1708.261,1720.35,"One, that there was no unfair labor practice because of the board's failure to integrate it with the immigration laws, and second, even if there was an unfair labor practice, that the Court of Appeals' substitution of a remedy was improper--"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1720.35,1720.847,That's correct.
1983.82-945,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.847,1721.428,--even if there was a violation.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1721.428,1722.63,That's correct.
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.348,1765.998,"Yes, but the board, under the board's order, wouldn't the tolling of back pay be ended if the alien came back to the country illegally, and was available for work?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1765.998,1767.668,--I would certainly hope so.
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1767.668,1775.915,"Well, I know, but under the terms of its order, the alien wouldn't have to be back here legally."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1775.915,1781.078,"Well, I think if they are not lawfully available for work is how I interpret that."
1983.82-945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1781.078,1781.729,I see.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1781.729,1787.693,"But I think certainly if there is any ambiguity in what they advised, it should be construed that way."
1983.82-945,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1799.401,1808.627,"Of course, you object to the ALJ's four weeks back pay as much as you do to the Seventh Circuit's longer period, don't you?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1808.627,1810.117,Definitely.
1983.82-945,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1889.709,1893.252,How did the employer communicate with them on the job?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1893.252,1901.337,"--By attempts to... a combination of, I believe, English and Spanish."
1983.82-945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.337,1904.119,At least he got the message across.
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1904.119,1905.38,He got the message across.
1983.82-945,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.676,1936.809,"On this question about the Spanish letter, there were about a dozen employees, right?"
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1936.809,1939.671,"--There were eleven employees, five of whom were--"
1983.82-945,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1939.671,1948.356,How much would it cost to translate eleven... translate one letter to eleven people?
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1948.356,1949.427,--I couldn't speak to that.
1983.82-945,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1949.427,1952.54,"About $1.25, I guess, something like that."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,1955.161,1971.271,"The courts have held and our brief points out cases to the effect that the government is not required to communicate in a foreign language with its citizens, and yet the board would require... impose that upon Sure-Tan, contrary to its prior cases."
1983.82-945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2006.674,2009.337,"Your time has expired, Mr. Flaherty."
1983.82-945,0,35832,michael_r_flaherty,,2009.337,2009.857,Thank you.
1983.82-945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2009.857,2011.119,Mr. Kneedler.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2011.119,2019.012,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before beginning, I would like to emphasize two points."
1983.82-945,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2099.505,2100.336,"Well, Mr. Kneedler--"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2100.336,2100.737,Yes.
1983.82-945,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.737,2112.774,--I am interested to know whether the government takes the position that the board's result here can be defended only in the circumstances of the immigration laws.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2162.157,2165.609,That would present much different considerations.
1983.82-945,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2213.72,2218.673,"Well, but the obligation of the employer at least by statute and case law is much the same."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2225.418,2252.696,"--Well, what the Ninth Circuit suggested in the passage that has been quoted by petitioners is really that it is not the board's function to enforce the immigration laws by excluding illegal aliens or determining the documentation of illegal aliens and excluding them from board protection, that the employer should take that problem to the Immigration Service if that is his point, that he wants to help enforce the immigration laws."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.461,2293.194,"Well, in Mr. Justice Rehnquist's example of the felon, the fugitive, would all the board have to do is find that the employer wouldn't have fired him except for an antiunion animus, and wouldn't have turned him in except for that?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2296.216,2298.237,"Well, that is ordinarily what is--"
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.237,2299.506,He gets on the stand and he testifies.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2317.99,2321.492,"--Again, I think that because of this--"
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2321.492,2323.143,"Well, that is all there is."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2323.143,2332.158,"--Well, yes, in finding the normal unfair labor practice, that is true, but my question or my point is that there may be--"
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.158,2333.49,What is abnormal about that?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2333.49,2336.832,"--Well, nothing, if one looks only to the purposes of the immigration laws."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.814,2362.289,So the policy of enforcing the laws against murder or something are stronger than enforcing the immigration laws.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2369.113,2371.544,"--No, certainly the Department of Justice is--"
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.544,2373.014,One crime is different than another?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2373.014,2375.657,"--No, but there are other--"
1983.82-945,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.657,2383.001,The board is entitled to weigh each crime and make final decisions for the whole country as to what laws ought to be--
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2383.001,2387.456,"--No, what we are suggesting is with particular reference to the National Labor Relations Act."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.95,2404.897,"--So your answer is yes, it does make a... the board does sit to decide which laws are to be ignored and which are not."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2404.897,2405.556,"--No, I--"
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.556,2408.979,"Or it can pick out the immigration laws at least, you say."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2408.979,2414.163,"--Well, it is not the board's own assessment of that."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.851,2431.274,You mean sometimes it is all right not to report illegal aliens?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2431.274,2446.115,"Well, absent an antiunion animus, and really, in a sense, an abuse of the reporting process, it would ordinarily be entirely appropriate and the responsibility of an employer or any other citizen to report."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.877,2459.581,"Well, he has to be able to prove he loves the union before he can turn an illegal alien in?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2459.581,2467.986,"--No, the initial burden is on the board to establish an antiunion animus."
1983.82-945,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2467.986,2469.368,Let's try another one.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2481.547,2498.958,"Well, another... again, it might depend on the application of misprision of felony statutes, which is another consideration that would apply in the area of murder or any other felony."
1983.82-945,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2523.395,2549.16,"Do you think you could support your position by saying that of course there is a duty to report illegal activity, there is a civic duty, and there is a First Amendment right to do it on the edges of that, but the National Labor Relations Board isn't concerned about civic duty or other factors."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2559.399,2564.95,"Well, that would obviously... I mean, that would control this case, yes."
1983.82-945,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2564.95,2565.401,Even where--
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2568.923,2569.825,That's right.
1983.82-945,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2597.852,2598.353,Mr. Kneedler?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2598.353,2598.793,Yes.
1983.82-945,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2598.793,2610.611,"In the example you have been discussing for the last five minutes, let's assume that the felon who escaped from Illinois or wherever it was was sent back and put in prison for four years."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2617.516,2625.361,"Well, we would first have to determine whether the board could find an unfair labor practice."
1983.82-945,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2625.361,2641.632,"Well, let's assume, as I think Justice Rehnquist said, in reporting this fellow, the employer said quite candidly he was a leader of this antiunion movement, so I thought I had better report him, get him off my back."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2641.632,2652.899,"Well, I have suggested that in the case of a felony or a murder, a crime like that, that the board, although it hasn't addressed it--"
1983.82-945,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2652.899,2654.558,The board would have to reinstate him after?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2654.558,2660.963,"--No, I am suggesting there may not be a violation in those circumstances, so the question of reinstatement would never be reached, but--"
1983.82-945,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2660.963,2664.576,If... I don't quite see the distinction.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2676.094,2734.732,"--Well, the board does not reach the question of remedy, either reinstatement or back pay, until it has first found that the employer has violated the Act, and in the situation of a felon and the employer's reporting of a felon, if the board did not find for the reasons that I have suggested that the employer had violated the Labor Act, then there would be no occasion to impose a remedy, but in the situation where the board does find a violation of the Act, as here, because of the appropriate accommodation of the two statutes leads to that result, then it is appropriate for the board to consider the normal remedies, which are under 10(c) of the Act reinstatement with or without back pay, and then at that point the board would determine whether reinstatement and back pay were appropriate in light of the policies of the statute that the employers relied upon."
1983.82-945,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2734.732,2738.474,"That wouldn't encourage people to report crime, would it?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2750.853,2758.039,"Well, in this circumstance, I think it is important to stress the narrowness of the rule we are suggesting."
1983.82-945,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2758.039,2767.394,Are you saying that the only crime to which your argument applies is where one employs an illegal alien and then discharges him?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2767.394,2771.506,"That is all that is presented here, and that is all we are submitting here."
1983.82-945,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2772.868,2781.003,"I understand that, but it seems to me the principle that you advocate is not going to be easy to carry."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2781.003,2809.47,"--Well, there are affirmative indications in the purposes and background of the immigration laws to reinforce that conclusion here, purposes that I would think would be absent under most state criminal codes in the commission of a murder or something like that, and Congress has enacted two statutes here that have to be given due consideration by the board and the Court."
1983.82-945,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2853.171,2857.593,I am not so sure that it is just the immigration law.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2860.064,2883.529,"Well, but in the immigration laws, there is the affirmative... there is the affirmative support for the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, and in the typical Title 18 offense, I would think you could not find that support."
1983.82-945,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2883.529,2890.153,"Well, maybe you will tell me exactly what was the violation of the labor law."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2890.153,2893.516,In this case.
1983.82-945,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2893.516,2894.177,In this case.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2894.177,2894.687,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-945,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2903.774,2910.737,"Well, why wouldn't that apply to the report of spitting on the sidewalk?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2910.737,2954.736,"Well, if I could go back, in a cast like... Let me go back to Bill Johnson's, and really, what petitioner is really arguing here is that there is an implied exception from the labor laws for his conduct because of the policy favoring reporting of crimes and the policy of enforcing the immigration laws, and the question is whether the Court should recognize an implied exception for retaliatory conduct that would otherwise be a violation of the Act, and that requires looking to the competing statute, and here it is a violation because the policies of the competing... of the other statute, the immigration laws, are--"
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.736,2956.228,Or the Constitution.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2956.228,2960.58,"--Well, petitioners do rely on the Constitution."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2961.011,2961.692,What about that?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2961.692,2962.302,--Well--
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2962.302,2965.933,First Amendment.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2965.933,2972.778,"--I would note in the first instance that they did not raise that before the board, before the Court of Appeals, or in the petition for certiorari here."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.274,2986.476,What about the Nor Pennington line of cases generally?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3016.275,3027.255,"Well, in those cases, those cases have involved, as in Nor itself, political activity, which is at the core of the right of petition political activity--"
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3027.255,3029.466,"What about California Transport, or whatever that was?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3029.466,3045.617,"--Yes, that was an invocation of the adjudicative process before an administrative agency, and what the companies were doing in those circumstances fits within the language of the First Amendment and fits within this Court's decision in Bill Johnson."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3057.445,3063.307,"So your answer to the constitutional claim is there is just no constitutional right, protected constitutional right to report a crime?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3063.307,3066.488,"No, our submission does not go that far."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.209,3067.84,"Well, what is it?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3067.84,3079.097,"--that it is not an absolute right, and where the employer does it in retaliation for other protected activities by the person who is being reported, that there is not an absolute right to do so."
1983.82-945,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3103.364,3119.914,"Well, but certainly it wasn't... the employer's reporting may have had an indirect effect on those activities, but since the people... the activities were being conducted by people who had no business being in the country, I don't see how you can fault the employer on that account."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3125.657,3152.015,"But the employer brought it about, and concededly in this Court did so for... solely for antiunion reasons, and in terms of the constitutional right, in re Quarles and Butler, which opposing counsel has cited, the Court did not suggest that a right to inform about violations of the law derives from the First Amendment."
1983.82-945,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3191.301,3194.213,"Mr. Kneedler, may I ask another question?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3209.613,3212.084,That's correct.
1983.82-945,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3216.846,3217.177,Right.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3252.812,3266.541,"Unless it were shown that the employer was acting for some antiunion reason under the Court's decision, he could, and I am not sure what the antiunion reason would be after the employee had long since left."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3266.541,3269.934,"Did the board suggest this remedy, or was it... did the court come up with it by itself?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3269.934,3271.844,The board has not--
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.844,3272.465,The six months.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3272.465,3274.856,--The board had not ordered it in its decision.
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.871,3283.401,"Who brought it up in the Court of appeals, anybody--"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3283.401,3288.694,I think it was sua sponte.
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.694,3289.105,--Sua sponte?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3290.377,3293.549,"Yes, we are in this case."
1983.82-945,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3300.805,3307.651,"Ordinarily isn't it the board's job, not the courts, to specify a remedy?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3307.651,3309.461,"--That's correct, and as we point out--"
1983.82-945,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3309.461,3314.993,And why is it all right for the Court of Appeals here to do something that the board hadn't done?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3314.993,3318.375,"--Well, we don't suggest that it is."
1983.82-945,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3319.557,3321.047,"Well, you are defending it, you said."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3322.339,3336.198,"--Well, the board was... in this particular case, the board was willing to accept the suggestion on remand, and to adopt that, so as far as the six-month back pay, that is the board's position in this case."
1983.82-945,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3336.198,3338.278,That is the order finally entered by the board?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3338.278,3345.474,"That is... well, the board proposed a judgment to the Court of Appeals, and that was the Court of Appeals' judgment in the particular case."
1983.82-945,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3347.074,3348.076,Is that often done?
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3348.076,3350.407,I think it is quite unusual.
1983.82-945,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3350.407,3355.859,"They don't order back pay to someone who isn't available for work, do they?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3355.859,3358.093,"No, it--"
1983.82-945,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3358.093,3361.633,Here is somebody out of the country who can't legally enter.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3365.927,3378.797,"--The employee's unavailability for work is directly attributable to the employer's unfair labor practice, and under the board's policies where the employer has caused the employee's unavailability for work because of injury, because of--"
1983.82-945,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3378.797,3381.098,But the remedies are not supposed to be punitive.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3391.955,3406.227,"--What I am suggesting, though, is that even where the employee is unavailable, if the employer is responsible for causing the unavailability, the board has in the past approved the award of back pay, and here the employer is responsible for the employee's unavailability."
1983.82-945,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3407.066,3420.705,"Doesn't that encourage, as Justice Powell suggested, another illegal entry to come and see about the money, and doesn't that fly right in the face of our immigration policies?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3420.705,3426.179,"No, the award of the back pay in this case is not contingent upon the alien's re-entering the country."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3432.744,3436.056,"You is supposed to just mail it to him, if you've got his address?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3437.616,3438.267,That's correct.
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.267,3443.02,"That's just a fine, then, for violating the law, I guess."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3443.02,3444.782,It is not a fine--
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3444.782,3445.881,"Close to it, isn't it?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3445.881,3455.467,"--No, I don't... I think it's quite different from a fine, because the ordinary remedy in an unfair labor practice, discriminatory discharge case is reinstatement and back pay."
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.664,3482.075,So the employer ought to just feel lucky that it was confined to six months.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3482.075,3485.147,Well--
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3485.147,3488.941,Because the employment relation hasn't been legally terminated yet.
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3493.362,3498.615,"--Well, we certainly don't suggest back pay should run forever, and the six-month figure--"
1983.82-945,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3498.615,3503.169,"Well, there is just as much reason for running it a year as six months on your theory."
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3503.169,3518.938,"--Well, at some point the amount of the back pay might become so substantial that concerns about its being punitive rather than simply remedial might be raised, and indeed six months may be toward the cuter limit of the amount of back pay that should be awarded."
1983.82-945,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3535.96,3551.859,"Hasn't the Court... hasn't this Court over the years said that we pay great deference to the Labor Board provisions for remedy and things of that kind because they are dealing with it all the time, and they develop what we call expertise?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3556.334,3559.776,"Well, generally none, and as I suggested--"
1983.82-945,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3559.776,3561.737,"About the same as ours, wouldn't it be?"
1983.82-945,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3561.737,3562.418,--Well--
