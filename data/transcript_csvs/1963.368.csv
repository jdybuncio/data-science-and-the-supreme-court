1963.368,0,35819,milton_v_freeman,,25.678,29.028,May it please the Court.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3048.274,3051.253,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1963.368,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3853.01,3865.135,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3865.135,3869.98,"Your Honor that's, I think that's a much more difficult question."
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3940.412,3956.996,"Before you get that Mr. Terris, history this bill referred to selling out that the presumption didn't work because they didn't even arrest or whatever it was, embarrassment, indicate what the embarrassment were the facts that suffered under the presumption."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3956.996,3976.227,"Well, the kind of the kind of embarrassments Your Honor the actual situations which were discussed by the presidentially appointed committee that reported in 1938 they gave 13 illustrations."
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4021.187,4029.999,Poland made no distinction between the American naturalized and the American native born.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4029.999,4043.262,"I think, I am not certain of that Your Honor I think they did, I think these were formally Polish citizens and that's why they exercised, they claimed to have jurisdiction over them."
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4057.403,4067.988,"Well, I gather this agreement leading to the (Inaudible) was that it's only administrative convenience --"
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4067.988,4068.495,"Well, Your Honor I --"
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4068.495,4073.772,(Inaudible) obviously is not at the time but were actual embarrassment --
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4073.772,4074.534,That's right Your Honor.
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4074.534,4079.455,"Under the presumption, it was approved to some workability and therefore trying to (Inaudible)"
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4079.455,4083.507,"Well, let me address myself directly to the question of administrative convenience."
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4098.31,4106.526,"Well, would the government be defending the statute constitutionally if there were absolutely nothing except that it was easier to do it with the definite rule and with a presumption."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4106.526,4111.106,"No, Your Honor that's certainly not this case."
1963.368,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4140.202,4143.607,With any of the --
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4143.607,4151.265,The potentiality with any American citizen but history has shown that is most likely with naturalized Americans citizens.
1963.368,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4162.673,4175.685,"Then again I suppose that if they are native born Americans -- rather naturalized American citizens but native born from some other country, from the country in which they are in, does the government treat them any differently?"
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4181.332,4182.317,"Yes, yes its --"
1963.368,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4182.317,4183.745,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4183.745,4196.143,That's the basis for my response to Mr. Justice Goldberg that the foreign affairs difficulties are markedly less in regards to Section 3 52 a (2).
1963.368,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4211.308,4217.438,"(Inaudible) maybe foreign citizens, I mean ones you said that indicate they were not similar --"
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4217.438,4225.062,"They are -- not nearly to the same extent, not nearly to the same extent but there is, certainly have been embarrassments by native born citizens."
1963.368,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4225.062,4237.908,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4237.908,4242.496,Well Congress has the full power to decide who can become a citizen.
1963.368,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4249.926,4261.031,I was wondering whether they could make any condition in that position that any person who became naturalized (Inaudible) remain in United States?
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4261.031,4262.082,I think they could Your Honor.
1963.368,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4262.082,4264.506,If they have not stayed United States well for years.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4264.506,4265.04,Your Honor I --
1963.368,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4265.04,4270.914,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4270.914,4278.047,Your Honor I think you can -- I think that is exactly what Madison said that that Congress did have that power.
1963.368,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4278.047,4282.805,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4282.805,4283.56,No it would not.
1963.368,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4283.56,4285.528,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4285.528,4299.391,It would let Mrs. Schneider on under the wire because this provision is identical to that under the 1940 statute and in fact we do suggest that in our brief that she became a citizen with this condition attached.
1963.368,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4299.391,4324.64,"Mr. Terris what's -- what would be wrong with -- would the embarrassment be solved, or the government probably solved if this section read that a foreign born citizen, foreign born person who became naturalized did not go back to his hometown and lived there more than three years without consent of the Secretary of the State?"
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4324.64,4328.444,"I think that, I think that would beat the problem."
1963.368,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4355.741,4360.168,It was a better statute (Inaudible) service to military case?
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4360.168,4364.296,Well that -- I think there is some possibility of that.
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4364.296,4389.598,"What about the old (Inaudible) that consul withheld -- there used to be statutes which if you remained abroad for a period but within that time you went for a consul and said I retain my American citizenship that -- you retain it, what was, what was wrong with that approach rather than this?"
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4389.598,4397.705,"Well Your Honor that would not, that kind of a statute in no way solves the problem which I have, which I have been discussing."
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4435.054,4453.838,"Perhaps I will ask in regard to Mr. Justice White question, doesn't this act give the Secretary of State most unlimited discretion to determine who can go to -- to the country of his birth and --"
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4453.838,4455.238,He doesn't have any discretion Your Honor.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4455.238,4456.015,I beg your pardon.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4456.015,4457.404,He doesn't any discretion.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4457.404,4478.729,"I thought that this Section 352 A which says that this is not applicable as to certain persons, it says that not applicable to any person who is veteran of the Spanish American War, World War I or World War II."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4486.742,4489.139,Yes.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4489.139,4553.69,"Any veteran of Spanish American War, World War I and World War II, or the Korean hostilities having served in army on an active duty status so forth it's a very long, long section and then, then it says or who has established to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State as evidenced by possession of a valid unexpired United States passport or other valid document, that he is temporarily outside of the United States for the purpose of (a) carrying on a commercial enterprise which in the opinion of the Secretary of the State will directly and substantially benefit American trade or commerce, or (b) any scientific research and so forth or (c) engaging in such work or activities under such unique and unusual circumstances as maybe determined by the Secretary of State to be directly and substantially beneficial to the interest of the United States."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4555.049,4558.589,"Well Your Honor one, there is a short answer to this."
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4573.571,4574.973,And what is that one?
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4574.973,4579.637,That's the five year provision which does not apply to the appellant.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4579.637,4586.812,"It's in this same area that we are talking about, it does put them, does give a very (Inaudible) instruction."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4586.812,4600.252,"Your Honor the Secretary of State may have -- I would debate that he does not have unlimited discretion under that, but I without trying to discuss that problem, the short answer is that that this provision in no way covers the appellant."
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4605.661,4635.357,"No, but isn't it discriminatory if you do let veterans live abroad that way or if you do let anybody whom the Secretary of State thinks is furthering the interest of the United States or that he thinks he is engaging in an appropriate business or professional activity abroad."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4635.357,4638.938,"Which -- Your Honor I must insist that that is not this case, there is nothing from statute."
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4638.938,4640.2,There is nothing to do with it?
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4640.2,4641.882,"No, it has nothing to do with it."
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4649.325,4653.182,"(Inaudible) probably we wait for Mr. Freeman to answer, then he would give us --"
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4653.182,4667.268,"Well I just -- would like to make this particular your point what is before the Court is not even the entire confines of this provision, what is before the court is its application to this appellant under Section 406 of the act."
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4814.641,4818.523,"Mr. Terris, are there any exceptions or exemptions to this act?"
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4818.523,4819.359,Yes.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4819.359,4819.789,Where?
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4819.789,4821.515,Section 353 Your Honor.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4821.515,4825.988,Where do I find them?
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4825.988,4838.634,"They are in the -- I think page two or three of the government's brief and there are so in the appendix to appellant's brief on pages 76, 78."
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4838.634,4843.167,"Well that's what I was reading, what I read to you."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4843.167,4845.98,No you were reading from section 354 Your Honor.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4845.98,4848.695,I'm reading on page 78.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4848.695,4852.016,That's right and that's section 354.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4852.016,4855.024,"Yeah, all the rest of them are --"
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4855.024,4859.997,The ones on pages 76 to the top of 78.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4859.997,4861.693,"To the top of 78, yes."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4861.693,4862.884,Apply to section which we're dealing with.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4862.884,4866.854,Don't waste anymore of your time I'll read it.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4866.854,4875.347,In Perez this Court also noted that voting in foreign elections suggested a transfer of allegiance from the United States to a foreign country.
1963.368,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5116.144,5127.639,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5127.639,5129.648,The distinction between naturalized and native born?
1963.368,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5129.648,5132.974,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5132.974,5136.46,With the exception of the foreign statute and the 1907 statute.
1963.368,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5145.61,5147.746,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5147.746,5148.152,That's right.
1963.368,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5148.152,5148.866,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5148.866,5149.149,That's right.
1963.368,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5149.362,5150.184,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5150.184,5167.554,"No the first statute is in 1907, we think that executive -- the history starting with the exercise of executive discretion is equally relevant, since this was discretion exercised by the agency which conducts American foreign relations."
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5200.136,5209.362,Well I would say Congress has already done that and (Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5209.362,5211.03,It is done what Your Honor?
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5211.03,5216.498,Made a distinction that between naturalized -- if you go back to the place of your birth as I understand it's three years isn't it?
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5216.498,5217.278,That's right.
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5217.278,5219.334,If you don't come back within three years you lose it.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5219.334,5219.877,That's right.
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5219.877,5224.481,If you don't come back to the place of your birth go to some other nation you have in five years.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5224.481,5224.942,That's right.
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5224.942,5227.99,So there is a distinction that Congress has already drawn.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5227.99,5230.278,And that Congress has made other distinctions too.
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5230.278,5240.888,"And what is the reason for that, is that if an American naturalized citizens goes to some other nation outside of his birth he is not as much of a problem or nor perhaps any problem."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5240.888,5253.471,"That's right Your Honor, I think probably the major reason for the five-year provision is the question of retransfer of allegiance and it was thought by Congress that the likelihood of retransfer of allegiance is less in a third country than it is in your native country."
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5253.471,5258.898,"I see, it become citizen of a third nation, is that it?"
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5258.898,5260.079,It's not a matter --
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5260.079,5263.74,"(Inaudible) in Germany of naturalized American, he now goes to Switzerland."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5263.74,5271.008,"Your Honor, I don't think it's a matter any of this being solicited to some other countries, I think it's the question of being solicited to this country."
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5271.008,5280.331,"Well I'm trying to find out what the problem is for this country, if the naturalized American citizen born in Germany goes to live in Switzerland or the Philippines or somewhere else."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5280.331,5294.961,"Your Honors I suggested to Mr. Justice Goldberg, I think it's -- a government would have a very difficult burden of trying to show foreign relations embarrassments from that provision which is not involved in this case --"
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5294.961,5295.866,The five year provision?
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5295.866,5302.937,"The five year provision, but I again emphasize that 352 (a) (1) --"
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5302.937,5310.267,I suppose you'd say a fortiori you couldn't find it as to native born American foreign relations.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5310.267,5311.931,"That's right Your Honor, precisely."
1963.368,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5312.494,5315.69,That's the ground on which you say this clarification is reasonable.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5315.69,5316.544,That's right.
1963.368,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5334.186,5353.435,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5353.435,5355.806,"These are native born Americans, you are talking about now?"

1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5369.38,5369.878,If needed --

1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5373.145,5389.585,"That's right Your Honor, that they can -- that the -- first Congress has the power to take away citizenship from native born or American citizens -- or naturalized citizens, if there was a showing of strong likelihood of embarrassment in American foreign affairs."
1963.368,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5395.785,5406.476,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5406.476,5406.996,That's right.
1963.368,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5406.996,5408.907,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5408.907,5434.654,"Your Honor's question suggest some, a problem that face Congress, if we had, if Congress had passed a statute providing that all citizens lost their citizenship upon three years residence abroad then it would have been subject to attack, whenever a native born citizen was expatriated on the ground that we could not make a sufficient showing of embarrassment and embroiling the United States in foreign conflict."

1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5479.962,5489.422,"All I could, Your Honor all I can say about that is that a 100 years of history show that that doesn't work."
1963.368,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5547.434,5560.904,(Inaudible)
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5560.904,5577.523,I think mainly Your Honor they say that you can't travel to those countries and that maybe one of the reasons if they say it is they don't want to be involved in problems once the person is there even having warned may not be enough to prevent the conflict.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5577.523,5596.098,And Mr. Terris on the question of how much effect we should give to the concern of Congress over the effect of living in another country might have on people who were born in that country.
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5639.813,5644.182,Your Honor I am sorry I don't entirely follow.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5644.182,5664.922,"If they don't -- if they don't want the foreign influence as to, to be brought to bear on our people and our government and it has been concerning them for 100 years it seems a little strange to me that we would permit foreigners to come over here and vote for President of the United States."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5664.922,5672.103,"Your Honor the concern is not about foreign influences, the concern is about demands that are placed in our citizens by foreign governments."
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5675.171,5697.657,"Right I understood you to say that living over there could cause them to accept the home ways, the old home ways again and affect their loyalty in an adverse way and that that was the thing that it caused them for a 100 years to be concerned about naturalized citizen living abroad."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5697.657,5713.971,"Your Honor I may say that I think you are dealing -- you are discussing State legislation not Federal Legislation and the states apparently those states no longer exist today, those states apparently regarded aliens who lived a while in this country is having been influenced by American ways."
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5714.166,5721.818,"But the point is, as I'm concerned over and some jurisdiction it seems to me over election for President of the United States."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5721.818,5727.187,Yes Your Honor I think actually this is maybe support more broad position.
1963.368,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5727.187,5729.418,"All right, I agree that."
1963.368,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5729.418,5739.577,"The reason, I suggest that is apparently the states' believe that an alien who lived in this country for a while took on enough American ways so he could be trusted to vote in American elections."
1963.368,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,6683.346,6728.127,"Yes Your Honor, it establishes the discrimination between born and naturalized citizens, by showing that there are a series of exemptions which are in the nature of rewards for naturalized citizens and if they come within them by good conduct of some kind such as serving in our armed forces or pursing some activity of which the Secretary of State approves in his discretion, then they will obtain from the Government of the United States the right to be just as good as a naturalized citizen and if they don't do that then they are not just as good as a naturalized citizen and they don't get the right to stay either in the country of their origin or in any foreign country."
1963.368,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6728.127,6729.493,Naturalized and native born.
1963.368,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,6729.493,6745.665,"Native born citizens, that they get the rights and these are in the nature of rewards for naturalized citizens which if you meet these exemptions you are then equated with a born citizen in your rights to reside abroad."
1963.368,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6745.665,6776.715,"Well what I want to know is this, does this Section of 354 have any direct bearing on this case, that portion of the sub division one which says engaging in such work or activities under such unique or unusual circumstances as maybe determined by the Secretary of State to be directly and substantially beneficial to the interest of the United States."
1963.368,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,6776.715,6817.976,"That provision as Mr. Terris said, applies to people who reside not in the country of their origin and it says they -- if the Secretary of State says I approve of what you are doing then you may reside more than five years in Libya or wherever else if you didn't come from Libya and it says you then have the right, let's say if you are a petroleum engineer, you have the same right to live in Libya for ten years and to make a contract that a born American citizen has without the permission of the Secretary of State, there are no discretionary provisions as to the right to live in the country where you originally came."
1963.368,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6817.976,6819.12,Three years?
1963.368,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,6819.12,6838.081,"But as to those there are exemptions which say that if you are working for the Government of the United States and we won't take your citizenship away and so on, if you reside in that country or if you are working for an American firm but you may not take an offer from a foreign firm if you are living there."
1963.368,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6938.1,6941.442,(Inaudible)
1963.368,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,6941.442,6949.464,No I do not unless it's conditioned on something relating to loyalty that can be applied to born and naturalized citizen alike.
