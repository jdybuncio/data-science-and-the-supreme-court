1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,9.872,12.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,60.103,63.705,I'm sure the Court is as anxious as I am to get to the merits.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,74.013,75.163,Justice Kennedy--
1997.97-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,75.163,76.03,It seems not concrete.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,89.504,90.388,--Justice--
1997.97-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,90.388,92.556,"I'm dealing with the question in the abstract, it seems."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,92.556,111.084,"--Justice Kennedy, I think that the question of Article III justiciability, which of course must be measured at the time the suit was commenced or, really, in this case at the time that the pre-1990 claims were settled and all that was left in the case was the facial challenge to the 1990 act, is a close one."
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.464,263.601,"General Waxman, let me see if I understand you."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,274.142,276.025,That is correct.
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.025,277.025,--in this facial challenge.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,293.118,297.736,Respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American people.
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.736,299.188,"--beliefs and values, right, okay."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,299.188,299.688,Yes.
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,300.988,304.724,"Do they, indeed, ensure that they have decent panels?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,307.176,311.83,"--They ensure... Justice Scalia, they ensure that they have diverse panels, and--"
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.83,312.78,But that's just half of it.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,322.185,337.278,"--Well, the chairperson has the discretion to create the pro... the selection procedures any way she or he wants, so long as he is satisfied or ensured that general standards of decency will be taken into account in the process."
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.015,344.134,"What do you mean, in the process?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,344.134,344.784,--In the process of--
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.784,345.267,In the process of selecting the panel?
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,345.267,346.167,--In the process--
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,346.167,348.686,How do you take into account standards of decency in selecting the panel?
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,348.686,349.205,--In... no.
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.205,350.105,I don't understand how you do that.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,350.105,360.043,"In the process of deciding which proposals will be granted on the basis of merit and excellence, and here's how the NEA has construed the statute to work."
1997.97-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,415.297,423.367,"Well, quite apart from the... what the NEA has done, I've got some difficulties about the standing question akin to those that Justice Kennedy mentioned."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,433.092,438.726,"--Absolutely, and what's so... I don't want to use a pejorative adjective."
1997.97-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,487.976,492.713,"Well, I think you can take one position in the legislature and another in the courts."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,495.332,496.332,What's... right.
1997.97-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,510.759,514.961,"--Well, Mr. Waxman, could we talk about the statutory language?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,561.941,566.143,"Well, Justice O'Connor, both lower courts agreed with you."
1997.97-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,568.761,577.617,"Well, if that is the meaning of the statute, do we nonetheless have a justiciability question, or do you think--"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,577.617,577.7,--I--
1997.97-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.7,581.835,--if that's the meaning of the statute we don't have a problem of justiciability?
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,581.835,582.769,--I'm not sure.
1997.97-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,618.944,620.91,"Well, do they have to have suffered a denial?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,648.629,668.341,"Well, I guess if we're talking now simply about justiciability and not the merits, and I'll restrict my comments accordingly, first of all, because of the way the agency has interpreted this statute before it was very shortly enjoined from doing it at all, it hasn't had the occasion to define the terms general standard of decency and respect for diverse values."
1997.97-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,696.11,703.764,"Now, are you suggesting that we would find it nonjusticiable because they have not gone through the process of defining--"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,703.764,726.712,"--Not because they haven't... not because they haven't gone through the process, and again this falls a little bit into the merits, but I think the justiciability is very much in question, because these terms, general standards of decency and respect for diverse beliefs and values, can be defined by the agency, could readily be defined by the agency in a manner that is not viewpoint discriminatory, as--"
1997.97-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.712,747.043,"--Are you saying, General Waxman, that if the law is as you say it is, then nobody is being hurt because these words are largely hortatory, is that essentially your position, and that challengers can't say, agency, you've got it wrong, you have to interpret this more strictly against us than you're willing to do?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,750.161,758.434,"--Well, that's... that's the essence of why we think, if our reading is right, there probably is not much of an Article III case or controversy."
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.434,760.45,"--Even if your reading is wrong, aren't you saying--"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,760.45,760.867,Even if our reading--
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.867,761.552,--that even if your reading is wrong?
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,761.552,762.352,--Even if... right.
1997.97-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,769.706,771.472,But how would we even get to that?
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,799.808,815.901,"--No, that's... we're absolutely not, but I think the appropriate course for this Court to take if it rejects... if it concluded that our statutory interpretation was unreasonable would be to permit the agency... after all, none of these people have grants that have... this is not an as-applied challenge."
1997.97-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,827.809,830.911,"Hasn't it had 8 years, hasn't it had 8 years to do that?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,830.911,832.962,Precisely to the contrary.
1997.97-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,866.501,866.834,Even issuing a reg?
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,866.834,867.284,Of course.
1997.97-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.719,877.522,Why didn't the Government seek a stay from a single-judge injunction?
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,877.522,883.76,I think the answer... I don't know the answer to that question.
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.76,884.795,"You weren't around then, either, right?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,884.795,900.388,I was around--
1997.97-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,901.222,902.757,But that's in the--
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,902.757,904.207,"But let me just say this, we--"
1997.97-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,904.207,912.363,"--General Waxman, that's been affirmed on... that view that the law is unconstitutional been affirmed on appeal, and there was a denial of rehearing en banc."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,912.363,914.064,"--That's true, and I think that--"
1997.97-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,914.064,916.164,Nobody sought a stay from this Court.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,916.164,923.42,"--And I... if... Mr. Chief Justice, if I can just get to what I thought my... the pitch was going to be after my wind-up, the point is--"
1997.97-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.574,964.394,"General Waxman, are you trying to persuade us that, even after the statute was passed, Andres Serrano would have the same chance of getting a grant as he did before?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,964.394,967.43,"--Well, I don't know whether... I don't think we have to--"
1997.97-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.43,968.798,"Yes, but that's what you're arguing."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,968.798,970.648,"--decide whether he would have the same chance, but what I'm suggesting is--"
1997.97-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.648,974.166,"Well, if he has a lesser chance, doesn't the... hasn't the statute had some impact?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,974.166,977.535,"--Well, I... we don't think actually that he would have a lesser chance."
1997.97-371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.75,1054.57,"It seems to me you're going to have a hard time persuading me the statute's essentially meaningless, which is basically what you're arguing."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1054.57,1058.622,"Well, we... I feel like I'm here making an argument in support of a... we didn't--"
1997.97-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1058.622,1060.205,I have the same problem.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1080.285,1088.641,"--In other words, if, instead of having two criteria with considerations, there were four criteria that had... and each thing had to be judged?"
1997.97-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1088.641,1089.057,Yes.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1089.057,1090.907,Our position would be twofold.
1997.97-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1168.926,1169.709,"Well, I would think--"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1169.709,1175.763,--If I may just finish... much the same as the decision the Combined Federal Campaign made in the Cornelius case.
1997.97-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1175.763,1180.317,--I would think that most artists would say that they're interested primarily in mode of expression.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1184.869,1185.721,I--
1997.97-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1185.721,1188.507,It seems to me ultimately that's an unstable line you're drawing.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1188.507,1192.375,"--Well, I do respectfully disagree to this extent, Justice Kennedy."
1997.97-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.154,1238.856,"Well, will you help me with some just basic inquiry?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1258.733,1259.602,--Assuredly right.
1997.97-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1259.602,1277.731,"Now, if the Government wants to educate children, or people, and chooses to speak by way of paying for certain kind of artistic expression as a means of the Government speaking and educating, and insists on decency and diversity, it can do that."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1277.731,1279.431,We believe that it can.
1997.97-371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1279.431,1279.914,All right.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1296.275,1306.833,"I will state the obvious and suggest that the question probably would be better answered then my friend Professor Cole, because we don't think that there is any constitutional problem here with this provision."
1997.97-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1320.891,1323.224,"General Waxman, may I suggest that maybe there is something different?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1361.432,1367.169,"Well, I guess I have a couple of answers: 1) a chairperson could have done that."
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.256,1427.493,"General Waxman, I thought your first response to Justice Ginsburg's question was going to be, so what?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1443.503,1449.489,I knew that that would... I knew you would support--
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1449.956,1450.775,You knew I was going to say that.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1450.775,1454.477,May I reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal?
1997.97-371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1454.477,1455.177,But why isn't he right?
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1455.993,1457.179,Well--
1997.97-371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1457.179,1459.631,"I mean, does the Government have to or not?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1459.631,1483.33,"--Well, if you're talking about... if we're talking about whether Congress can say, okay, the NEA is going to apply the following standards but it's not going to fund Robert Mapplethorpe, that raises many different constitutional concerns that don't have... in other words, going to single out one particular person, at that point may violate... it would have to be scrutinized under, for example, the Due Process Clause as to whether there is a rational basis--"
1997.97-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1483.33,1495.22,"Well, is it constitutionally principled for the Government to do this by a wink-wink, nudge-nudge--"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1495.687,1499.672,"--That's... that is not... that's not, Justice Kennedy, what we're suggesting was done here."
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.462,1537.464,But you assume that that's unconstitutional.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1541.466,1542.966,"--I... Justice Scalia, I--"
1997.97-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1542.966,1543.332,Can it say that?
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1544.182,1549.036,"--Justice Scalia, I am not assuming... I'm not standing up here arguing that it would be unconstitutional."
1997.97-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1562.295,1576.019,"So you in effect are saying, I'm not going to rest my argument on the claim that the Government is hiring anyone to speak here, or that what it's doing bears an analogy to that, or that in fact the Government is buying art, or that it bears an analogy to that."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1591.046,1592.898,"Well, I think the Government is the buyer."
1997.97-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1593.665,1594.248,What's it buying?
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1594.248,1594.767,--It's buying--
1997.97-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1594.767,1596.65,"What does it own, when it... after the grant?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1596.65,1606.99,"--This... I think this is a distinction without a difference to our argument, but it is... in fact it's behaving as Governments and sovereigns as arts patrons always have."
1997.97-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1608.207,1610.026,"Yes, but the King ended up with the picture."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1611.792,1613.978,--The King did not necessarily end up with the picture.
1997.97-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1634.142,1637.527,"Okay, then you are saying there is an art patrons rule."
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1652.019,1652.869,"Well, I think--"
1997.97-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1652.869,1653.553,Is hiring its speaker.
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1653.553,1654.055,--Yes.
1997.97-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1682.939,1685.407,"Why are they required, when they're not required to do this at all?"
1997.97-371,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1693.744,1723.347,"--Unless you have a program, Justice Souter, in which the NEA is simply disestablished because of a belief that the First Amendment wouldn't permit funding of the arts, or unless you can set up a program where, you know, the proposals that were on the thickest paper, or the ones that came in, you know, first, were granted, inevitably the decisionmaker is going to be making the kind of aesthetic judgments that, for example, were not permitted in Ward v. Rock Against Racism."
1997.97-371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1724.199,1724.649,"Thank you, General Waxman."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,1726.734,1739.042,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.511,1771.513,"Rosenberger was quite different from this, Mr. Cole."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,1786.123,1791.843,"--There is a degree of selectivity involved here but there was also, Chief Justice Rehnquist, a degree of selectivity in Rosenberger."
1997.97-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1799.331,1800.164,"Well, that's quite different, I think."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,1800.164,1814.691,"Well, I don't think it makes a constitutional difference, and I think when you look at Rosenberger what Rosenberger... what the University of Virginia did was, they said we will fund not any student activity that comes to us, but any student activity that is related to the educational purposes of the university, so they were selective."
1997.97-371,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1815.991,1819.309,"Yes, but I think the Chief Justice is correct in making the distinction."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,1849.245,1866.856,"--Well, I'm not sure, Justice Kennedy, whether there's a distinction between a Government agency which makes judgments about educational purpose and allocates funds selectively on that basis, or academic merit, which is what public universities do in hiring, and the NEA, which makes judgments base on artistic merit."
1997.97-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1883.401,1911.651,"Mr. Cole, may I suggest that one is a prize or an award, and there really is a difference between a student activity fund that if you're not social and you're engaged in some respectable student activity you get it, and an award, a prize, a grant that is highly selective, and so I quite agree, and I don't think that you can maintain that this is just like Rosenberger, just like a bulletin board, anybody can put up their names or draw from that pot except certain people."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,1911.651,1912.068,--Okay.
1997.97-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.224,1945.891,You're a better predictor than I am.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,1947.991,1951.795,"Well, you were in the majority, so you're a better predictor than I am, I'm sure."
1997.97-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.58,1955.53,My record's not too good.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,1958.032,1962.853,"--I guess... I think what's important is that it shouldn't come out differently, and here's why."
1997.97-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1994.638,1998.859,"Well, I'm not sure that decency or indecency is viewpoint-based."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2000.976,2001.978,"--Well, I think--"
1997.97-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2001.978,2007.982,"I'm not sure that respect is a viewpoint-based thing, or diversity."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2014.701,2015.051,--Right.
1997.97-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2015.617,2022.621,And I'd be interested for you to also pursue whether we have an Article III case at all here.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2022.621,2022.921,--Okay.
1997.97-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2066.864,2067.08,All right.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2072.518,2074.768,"--Well, in essence that's what the NEA says."
1997.97-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2077.32,2078.07,I didn't hear that.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2078.07,2088.175,"--Well, they say in their mission statement, and it's cited in the record, that they create a national forum for the exchange of ideas by creating, as is set forth in the statute, a--"
1997.97-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2088.175,2092.46,"Well, I'm talking about a public forum in the sense that this Court had used it."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2097.947,2099.483,"--Well, I think under forum analysis we win."
1997.97-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2104.201,2105.22,That doesn't answer the question.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2110.522,2111.207,--I--
1997.97-371,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2111.207,2111.924,Yes or no.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2111.924,2126.049,"--We take the position that whether it does or not we prevail because this Court has held that even in a nonpublic forum viewpoint neutrality is required and vagueness is not permitted, and these criteria are both viewpoint-based and vague."
1997.97-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.376,2190.124,"I think I would agree with you if the agency here were applying the law the way you interpret it and the way the lower courts interpret it, but I do find it strange that where you have a law which, however unrealistic the interpretation may be, the agency says, we're interpreting it in such a way that we will fund Mapplethorpe and everything else."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2190.124,2191.909,Well--
1997.97-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.909,2193.259,"Now, that may be wrong."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2199.146,2199.682,"--Well, it certainly--"
1997.97-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.682,2200.398,--But why did that hurt you?
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2200.398,2204.634,"--Well, it hurts us for the following reason, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2240.823,2247.745,"Mr. Cole, may I stop you just for a moment, because it sounds like you are veering away from a case that would be fit for summary judgment, which is what this was."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2251.547,2252.08,--I think--
1997.97-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2252.08,2254.332,"There was no hearing about that, to develop that."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2254.332,2255.082,--I don't think there's--
1997.97-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2255.082,2259.22,The Government... you're making assertions today.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2284.002,2287.621,"--Well, Your Honor, all I can say is the record is very clear."
1997.97-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.328,2327.911,He was the chairman of the NEA at the time?
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2327.911,2332.665,"--He was the Chair... yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist, he was the Chair at the time that the statute was being enforced."
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.075,2396.508,"They're quite vague about how they apply it, I agree with that, but I also found right in the record what the Solicitor General just quoted was there, on page 33, the instructions that they give, so if you have an... I assume you don't object to that as a correct... my basic question is, given the uncertainty that you... you started with a premise, and if I accept that premise a lot flows."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2427.277,2428.077,Yes.
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2428.077,2428.646,All right.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2438.502,2444.738,"Well, Justice Breyer, two points with respect to that."
1997.97-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2459.312,2467.067,"Well, we've said you can't bring a facial challenge if any part of the statute can be constitutionally applied."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2467.067,2476.09,"--And our position is that this statute is unconstitutional because it is viewpoint-based, it uses a viewpoint-based criteria... it would... it would be--"
1997.97-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2476.09,2481.427,"If you say it could be... the language could be applied where children were involved, you lose your facial challenge there."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2481.427,2496.853,"--I don't think it could be applied where children... but what the Court could do in a... what the agency could do is decide whether a particular application was suitable for children, but an application could be suitable or unsuitable for children for all sorts of ways that don't have to do with viewpoint."
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.581,2517.35,"No, that wasn't my question."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2575.537,2588.445,"--Well, Your Honor, in the Lakewood case the Government came forward and said certainly there would be appropriate considerations that the mayor could use in deciding how to allocate these benefits to speech."
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2594.932,2624.768,"Well then, should we also strike down the entire NEA, because at the very beginning of it, after all, there is at the very beginning all kinds of language about how this has to be done with general regard for taxpayer sensibilities, and do we have to strike down the FCC statute because the FCC says award licenses in the public interest, which has been plainly interpreted to give the FCC power to do all kinds of restrictions in the area of indecency."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2641.645,2642.112,--Well--
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2642.112,2646.197,"My question is, why should we not give them the same presumption we give to every other agency?"
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2648.299,2651.251,"--Well, first of all they did it, and you can see how they did it--"
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2651.251,2652.068,The client got the grant.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2652.068,2662.643,"--The client... the way that this statute... the way that this statute was enforced, they never issue a decision saying, you're denied because of indecency."
1997.97-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2687.174,2702.284,"And that would be so no matter how the agency itself is interpreting the statute, because you claim that the possibility of interpreting it to mean what it says is substantial enough that artists who are developing projects are not likely to develop projects that would offend--"
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2702.284,2702.636,Well--
1997.97-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.636,2703.303,--the statute as it's written?
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2703.303,2707.938,"--Well, I think certainly it applies here, where the agency did apply it in a way that was chilling."
1997.97-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2709.873,2716.111,"Let's assume the agency didn't, because I think that's going to be a very controverted proposition that wouldn't justify a summary judgment."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2764.124,2778.534,"--Well, that is... that is... we would make that claim, but we would also make the claim, Justice Scalia, that the Government itself took... has taken the position in this litigation that the statute is indeterminate, and no one can guess how the chairperson might implement the statute."
1997.97-371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2778.534,2783.855,"If you take Justice... if you answer yes to Justice Scalia, then you're just sticking pins into yourself, basically."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2790.842,2792.527,"No, I'm not saying that, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1997.97-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2817.142,2818.844,"Now, I don't know why you've run away from this."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2843.309,2843.876,That's right.
1997.97-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.876,2844.995,"--to challenge the regulation as written, wouldn't you?"
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2844.995,2845.378,That's right.
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2851.982,2898.63,"Now, is it the case, just to go to the merits for a second, and I'm only asking these questions in order to get your response, say, if, in fact the NEA wants to give a grant for somebody to produce something that's public work, and suppose what they do is a white supremacist group, and they want to have racial epithets all over the picture, and the NEA says we think that's an inappropriate use of this money, in your opinion is that... and we can imagine the most... imagine the most horrible ones you can possibly think of, all right, and they say, the person gets up there and he says, I'm a member of the Ku Klux Klan, or whatever, and this is my point of view, and is it your view that the Constitution requires the NEA to fund that, that particular applicant?"
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2898.63,2902.748,"--Well, Justice Breyer, the Constitution doesn't require the NEA to fund anybody."
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2902.748,2903.598,"No, no... no, I'm sorry."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2908.069,2908.719,Right.
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2908.719,2925.963,"--Tough, for... take... everything you say is correct, and then we get to this point, and the panel's sitting there and saying, you know, I grant you it's as good a work of art as anything else, purely artistically, but I don't think that this particular work of art is appropriate for a school, for a public place, for a television program."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2939.623,2951.431,"Our position, Justice Breyer, is that it is unconstitutional for the Government to set up the funding program to fund private speech broadly and then to exclude recipients based on their viewpoint."
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2966.524,2970.226,"So do we have to distribute, or exhibit it in the courthouse?"
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2970.226,2972.844,"--No, because then you're engaged in Government speech."
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2977.23,2979.415,If it's a program... I have that.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2980.332,2984.902,"--If it's a program for a school, I think it's appropriate to consider what is suitable for children."
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2993.592,2996.46,So they have to exhibit my example in the school.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,2996.46,2997.044,--No.
1997.97-371,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3039.906,3056.265,"Well then... then... I take it then that you would say that if general standards of decency were left out of the statute so the statute read, NEA must take into consideration respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American people, same problem, unconstitutional viewpoint?"
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3056.265,3059.95,"--Well, I think they have to bread together, Your Honor, in--"
1997.97-371,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3059.95,3060.167,No.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3060.902,3061.302,--Okay.
1997.97-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3071.308,3080.997,"--But that's the problem, what it means, that... and that's... the Government tells us, this is what it means, and you say no, it can't mean that, and two courts have said it can't mean that."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3109.683,3129.061,"--Well, I'm just saying what they did, and I'm saying that the suggestion that decency and respect might be considered simply through picking diverse panels and no more, and not taking decency and respect even into account in choosing the panels is completely inconsistent with the statute."
1997.97-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.712,3157.497,"Mr. Cole, may I ask you a question about your constitutional position?"
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3187.283,3187.966,Right.
1997.97-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.966,3189.25,And maybe have a list of 20 things.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3202.276,3217.785,"Well, the reason, I think, is the distinction this Court drew in Rosenberger between Government speech and facilitating private expression, and when the Government comes out and says, we're engaging in a Government speech program, we know, as the citizens of the United States, it is the Government speaking."
1997.97-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.343,3236.264,"No, it isn't, because they say very clearly, it's general... for all kinds of speech you can think of except topics 1 through 20."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3256.86,3257.796,--Well--
1997.97-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.796,3259.079,Why can't they do that?
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3259.079,3259.762,--that was Rosenberger.
1997.97-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3264.016,3266.635,Your whole point... your whole case rests on Rosenberger?
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3266.635,3273.539,"Oh, I don't think so, Your Honor, because in Lamb's Chapel this Court held that viewpoint discrimination is not permitted in nonpublic forums."
1997.97-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.764,3291.417,"But you've just agreed it can if you give a list of 20 topics that you will finance, and finance private speakers to speak any way they want to on those topics."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3295.119,3296.635,"Oh, well, I'm... if you're saying--"
1997.97-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3296.635,3299.068,They're financing private speech on the 20 topics they want to--
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3299.068,3303.039,"--If they're... Justice Stevens, if they're funding topics, that's subject matter."
1997.97-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.772,3308.693,"--No, they're funding artists, but artists who just portray these particular 20 topics that they've designated."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3308.693,3309.076,Right.
1997.97-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3335.76,3343.747,"Well, it's surely viewpoint discrimination if you say, I'll finance a program that says don't... say no to drugs, but I won't finance one that says say yes to drugs."
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3345.032,3347.834,"--That is, and then that would be the Government speaking and we would know that."
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3362.827,3363.493,I see where you're going there.
1997.97-371,1,20648,david_d_cole,,3373.783,3376.051,"--Well, for two reasons, Justice Breyer."
1997.97-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3383.122,3387.458,"You mean, people who are professionals know more about what's artistically good than the average person?"
