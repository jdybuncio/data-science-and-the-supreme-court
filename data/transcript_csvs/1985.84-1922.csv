1985.84-1922,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,We will hear arguments first this afternoon in United States against Koecher.
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,12.224,40.458,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in November of 1984, respondent was called before a grand jury investigating espionage, and asked three questions: whether she had ever met with agents of the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service; whether she had ever delivered classified documents relating to the national security of the United States to those agents; and whether she had ever been paid for the delivery of those documents."
1985.84-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,405.311,407.013,"Mr. Wright, may I interrupt?"
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,419.238,431.462,"--We contend, as I believe five Courts of Appeals have agreed with us, that it does not protect communications made in the furtherance of criminal activity, but other than that, we have not challenged that, but--"
1985.84-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,431.462,444.019,"But in this particular case, if you prevail, you would think you could ask about communications between the husband and wife in this particular inquiry."
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,444.019,445.585,--We would make that argument.
1985.84-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,449.47,453.839,Thank you.
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,453.839,463.445,"The Court noted in U.S. v. Nixon that privileges are not lightly created nor expansively construed, for they are in the derogation of the search for truth."
1985.84-1922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.941,490.862,"Well, is it the government's policy to ask non-family members to testify even though their testimony isn't needed?"
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,490.862,502.07,"--No, but in the case of family members it is the government's policy to see whether the evidence can be obtained from other sources."
1985.84-1922,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,502.07,505.938,You have got to bend over backwards to avoid calling them if you can avoid it?
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,505.938,509.157,"Roughly, yes, that is right."
1985.84-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,522.316,534.891,"Of course, it is true, isn't it, Mr. Wright, that the only time you really reach this issue is if you granted immunity, because I suppose the spouse could always plead the Fifth Amendment by hypothesis in the category of cases we are dealing with."
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,534.891,536.007,That is true.
1985.84-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.159,542.927,"Well, but you granted immunity, didn't you?"
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,542.927,545.963,--We would have to if she is a joint participant.
1985.84-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,545.963,556.67,"So we are really not... we are mostly talking about the testimony for purposes of investigation before a grand jury, I would suppose is the most important area that you... well, no, you... off then with trial testimony, too."
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,556.67,557.753,That's right.
1985.84-1922,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,557.753,568.561,How much of a showing do you have to make at the grand jury level that the wife is a part and parcel of the work of the husband?
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,568.561,572.946,It is our position that we have to come in with some independent evidence--
1985.84-1922,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,572.946,574.013,Like what?
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,574.013,595.046,"--In this case, for instance, we have Mr. Koecher's own statements to FBI agents that Mrs. Koecher was a part of the conspiracy, that she served as his courier, that she met with Czech agents in Czechoslovakia, in New York, and in Vienna on a number of occasions over a 20-year period."
1985.84-1922,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,602.049,609.036,"Well, there is serious doubt in my mind because she is innocent until proved guilty."
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,609.036,610.471,We have not--
1985.84-1922,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,610.471,610.988,Right?
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,610.988,612.571,--We have not shown joint participation--
1985.84-1922,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,612.571,612.923,Right?
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,612.923,613.857,--beyond a reasonable doubt.
1985.84-1922,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,616.959,629.133,"I mean, I am just wondering why, under normal circumstances you can't do it, so all you do is charge her as a co-conspirator, and then automatically they lose the privilege."
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,629.133,632.069,"Well, we think we have to do more than charge as a co-conspirator."
1985.84-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.104,853.796,"Mr. Wright, perhaps this is a similar thought to the one Justice Marshall expressed, but at the time the trial is taking place, when you seek to get the testimony, do you assume that they are criminals or that they are innocent?"
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,853.796,860.719,Our position is that we have to come forward and make a prima facie showing of joint participation.
1985.84-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.719,864.771,Are they still entitled to the presumption of innocence?
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,864.771,869.658,I presume until we make that showing they certainly are.
1985.84-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.658,875.479,But it is a probable cause showing under your standard as I understand it?
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,875.479,886.7,"As I have read the cases, the probable cause prima facie showing required in the lawyer-client privilege cases, for example, have--"
1985.84-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.7,893.273,"So you make a probable cause showing before the grand jury, but the presumption of innocence survives that showing normally."
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,893.273,894.39,--Certainly.
1985.84-1922,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.39,897.325,"But here you are suggesting it doesn't, I guess."
1985.84-1922,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,897.325,903.979,"Wouldn't you be satisfied with just showing enough to be accused, not convicted?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1560.788,1592.492,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the government today is asking this Court to do something that it has never done before, to put a woman in prison for refusing to testify in a criminal matter against her husband of 22 years, and despite Mr. Wright's emphasis on the particular questions that were asked in this case, there is no question but that any testimony given by Mrs. Koecher in this investigation could well have led to potential incrimination of her husband."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1620.662,1623.948,"But there have been a lot of changes in recent years, have there not?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1623.948,1626.732,There have been changes in the marital privilege in recent years.
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.858,1669.742,How long had that part of the privilege been extant?
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1669.742,1671.861,"--That part of the privilege goes all the way back as well, Justice White."
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.361,1673.444,And yet we changed it.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1673.444,1674.563,You changed it.
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1675.78,1676.915,The tradition of the common law process.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1676.915,1679.95,--And I don't think we need to make another--
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.95,1684.669,"When did the present code of evidence, when was it passed by Congress?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1684.669,1691.758,"--In, I guess the rules of evidence were promulgated in about 1972 by this Court, and then by Congress a few years later."
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1691.758,1692.125,Two.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1695.56,1696.027,That's right.
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1696.527,1698.793,It left it to the Court.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1698.793,1700.145,"--Oh, there is no question about it, Your Honor."
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.614,1711.118,"So in terms of the kind of decision, you are not objecting to our considering this matter?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1711.118,1711.72,"--Oh, no not at all."
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.653,1714.822,You just think we ought to consider it your way.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1714.822,1733.966,"Absolutely, although I do think that as the Chief Justice said in his opinion for the Court in Trammel, that this Court should be very cautious before changing rules of privilege that go back as far as this one does, and particularly where those rules of privilege trench on matters respecting the family."
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.966,1737.335,"Well, we took one step at it in Trammel."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1737.335,1739.37,"Absolutely, Justice White, and I think that--"
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1739.37,1740.554,That is caution.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1740.554,1741.206,--Excuse me?
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.206,1742.456,That is caution in itself.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1742.456,1752.428,"That certainly is caution, but what the Court did in Trammel, as I said a moment ago, was to really undermine the basis for the principal criticism of the marital privilege."
1985.84-1922,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1771.675,1775.027,"Mr. Lynch, how many states have abolished the privilege altogether?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1775.027,1776.229,--Nineteen.
1985.84-1922,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1788.62,1794.857,"Well, that is why it might take more sense to abolish it altogether than to create an exception."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1794.857,1816.87,"Well, insofar as the government's position in this case makes no sense whatever, it seems to me that abolishing the privilege might be more sensible than that, but abolishing the privilege is a step that this Court has refused to take, not 400 years ago, but in Hawkins in 1958, in Trammel, and in its recommendations to Congress with respect to the Federal Rules of Evidence."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1816.87,1819.672,Was there any occasion to abolish it completely in Trammel?
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1819.672,1822.274,"Well, in Trammel, Mr. Chief Justice, as--"
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1822.274,1825.243,The question wasn't presented to us on the broad basis.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1825.243,1831.964,"--Well, the government didn't argue for the abolition of the privilege there, just as the government does not argue for the abolition of the privilege here."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1838.22,1853.562,"But in these cases, did the Court not... the Court's opinion not point out that the root of this whole idea went back to the time when the woman was nothing, the woman was merged into the man when they were married?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1853.562,1855.745,"Yes, I think that is an important point, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1878.378,1888.485,How much do you rest on the proposition that for the one spouse to testify against the other would undermine the marriage relationship?
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1888.485,1890.618,"Well, that is what this Court said in Hawkins."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1893.954,1901.06,"If the Court orders the spouse to testify, doesn't that eliminate that fact?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1901.06,1903.495,"I don't think it does at all, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1903.495,1910.082,Then the spouse is given the choice of pleasing her husband or going to prison.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1910.082,1917.07,"The spouse certainly has an excuse, as it were, in the moral court in which she would have to argue with her husband."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1945.172,1964.3,"But on the other hand, doesn't this give the man or the woman an advantage over all other criminals, that if you take your husband or your wife in and commit the crime, then you have got a preferred witness status?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1964.3,1966.002,"No, I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1966.002,1973.489,You don't think that encourages joint crimes by husband and wife?
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,1973.489,1978.643,"I don't think that is, with all respect, a particularly realistic way to look at marriage."
1985.84-1922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.214,2068.986,"Mr. Lynch, I wonder if your use of the word ""betray"" a couple of minutes ago isn't a rather inappropriate term."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2092.751,2108.111,"Well, I am sorry, Justice Rehnquist, if you think that I overstressed that point, but I do think that the essence of marriage, as this Court said in Griswald against Connecticut, is bilateral loyalty."
1985.84-1922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.615,2196.069,"Well, the Fifth Amendment analogy is my loyalty to another person, I myself?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2196.069,2196.919,That's right.
1985.84-1922,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.101,2250.636,Why shouldn't you have one on parent and child?
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2253.772,2255.457,"--Yes, the short--"
1985.84-1922,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2255.457,2256.974,"That is kind of close, isn't it?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2256.974,2258.059,--The short answer to that--
1985.84-1922,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2258.059,2258.726,Isn't it?
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2258.726,2259.342,--Justice Marshall--
1985.84-1922,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2259.342,2262.861,The relationship is longer than the marital relationship.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2262.861,2266.665,--It is longer and different in a number of other respects.
1985.84-1922,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2275.954,2277.604,That is what Trammel said.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2277.604,2278.723,--That is right.
1985.84-1922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2319.381,2325.62,But there are analogies in the way the attorney-client privilege is treated to what the government is asking for here.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2325.62,2333.79,"There are analogies there, but as I was suggesting before, Justice Rehnquist, those are not true analogies, because the nature of those privileges is different."
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.765,2431.973,A lot of your argument sounds as though you are objecting to the government's argument because it doesn't go far enough.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2431.973,2434.589,"--I hope I am not sounding that way, Justice White."
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.589,2435.291,It sounds that way.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2444.614,2449.934,"Well, I think no one else has ever taken this approach because this approach just doesn't make sense."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2465.444,2473.031,"Before you go on to a new point, let me see if I can get your picture clear in mind."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2483.072,2484.156,Or income tax evasion.
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2484.156,2488.392,Now the wife is called before the grand jury.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2516.127,2539.575,"I am suggesting that it is... it presents a conflict, first of all, within the conscience of the spouse that puts the marital relationship under tremendous strain, and secondly, that if the wife does testify, essentially what the court has done in that situation and and what the law has done in that situation is to turn the spouses directly against each other."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2544.912,2545.462,"Well, I hear what you are saying."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2553.418,2562.191,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't see that the spouses were pitted against each other at any earlier point than the point at which one of them--"
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2562.191,2578.716,"Well, ordinarily, if two people go into a criminal... two or three people go into a criminal enterprise, there is the risk that they may be pitted against one another, and it often happens that one will testify against the other in exchange for some lesser sentence."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2578.716,2601.732,"--And as this Court recognized in Trammel, the very reason why Mrs. Trammel in that case could be permitted to testify despite the prior history of there being a privilege that would prevent her testifying, the very reason was that her decision to take that option, her decision to become a witness for the prosecution had undermined the marriage."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2606.72,2607.153,Wait a minute.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2652.514,2653.598,--I don't think it is his right.
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2670.51,2676.964,"He is calling... in a sense, you are letting his willingness to have her go to prison--"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2676.964,2678.316,"Well, he doesn't have much say in the matter."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2683.82,2685.603,--Mr. Lynch--
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2699.645,2703.181,"We may have some misunderstanding, but I guess I think that is my point."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2715.857,2726.73,"The husband is not... has a right to say that even if you are being compelled to do this, I am through with you?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2726.73,2730.7,"I don't... well, I suppose, yes, he clearly does have that right, because--"
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2730.7,2732.2,"Well, that is what he is doing."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2732.2,2735.418,--But I don't think--
1985.84-1922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2735.418,2739.806,"Mr. Lynch, isn't it your point that if you prevail he won't have this power?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2739.806,2742.341,"--That is exactly right, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2760.886,2764.088,But how serious a conflict is that?
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2774.729,2782.316,"Well, every spouse who has ever been compelled under this exception, which, granted, is a small number, has taken that option."
1985.84-1922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2795.393,2798.678,"Well, is there any reason to believe that she is a typical example?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2798.678,2819.274,"Well, the government tells us there are no typical examples, because despite the enormous benefits they expect to accrue to law enforcement, they tell us that in the 12 years since this idea was first thought up in Van Drunin by the Seventh Circuit, we haven't had an adequate basis to decide what the empirical effect of it is because it is too short a time and it doesn't come up very often."
1985.84-1922,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2829.33,2833.166,How long did the spouse spend in jail in the Clark case?
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2833.166,2835.518,I don't know for certain.
1985.84-1922,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2872.623,2881.896,"Well, Mr. Lynch, presumably we have a substantial body of experience in the 19 states which have eliminated the privilege altogether."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2884.431,2886.967,I am not sure what that experience shows.
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.994,2907.13,"How many of the 19 did it by legislation, and how many by a court decision?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2907.13,2909.148,"--I don't know the answer to that, Justice White."
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.517,2921.956,"There must have been some investigation, some hearings and some decisions about the impact on law enforcement."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2921.956,2926.694,"--Curiously, Justice White, I think probably not, although I can't answer that definitely not."
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.694,2933.948,"They just decided this is a... we don't have anything else to do, let's just look around and pass these laws?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2933.948,2935.55,Not at all.
1985.84-1922,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.857,2949.657,Law professors.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2952.659,2955.344,"--Indeed, that is something like what happened here."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2964.633,2966.585,--How long ago did he first say that?
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,2966.585,2971.573,"About 1903, I think, was when he made that."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3016.935,3017.868,They may be true.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,3017.868,3024.191,"--I have no doubt about it, although, as I say, none of them says anything as weird as what the government says in this case."
1985.84-1922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3034.129,3039.8,"His position couldn't have been adopted without a statute, because you have to have an immunity statute or you have the Fifth Amendment privilege."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,3039.8,3042.652,"Well, that is true, although as I understand it I don't--"
1985.84-1922,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3042.652,3046.87,"That is why I don't suppose you have any experience in the 19 states, because they all have the Fifth Amendment privilege."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,3046.87,3047.187,--Yes.
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3056.226,3061.428,The position you advocate... I will put it in the form of a question.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,3083.459,3090.113,"If it is, Mr. Chief Justice, it is only because... by reason of nature, not by reason of anything the law does."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3092.082,3101.255,"By reason of the law you are advocating, it is certainly a great inducement to take your wife, because she can never turn state's evidence."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,3101.255,3103.271,"--No, that is not true after Trammel."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3104.373,3107.575,On that kind of a relationship at the starting point.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,3117.28,3119.882,"Well, or alternatively, as in Trammel, that--"
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3119.882,3123.168,Even it she is compelled to testify.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,3123.168,3135.592,"--Yes, but it seems to me that always the safest person to recruit to be your co-conspirator is someone who will be devoted to your interests, who loves you, who won't turn you in."
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3188.444,3191.813,"So you want the government to break up the marriage, not the parties."
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,3191.813,3197.299,There are two important differences between that situation and this one.
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3221.784,3226.336,Maybe the government will adopt your guidance in this case if you prevail.
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,3226.336,3234.174,"I imagine they might try, although certainly if one looks to the evidence they have produced so far, it is clear what is going on in this case."
1985.84-1922,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3364.976,3372.498,"Would you claim the privilege if I asked you, do you oppose getting rid of it altogether?"
1985.84-1922,1,25642,gerard_e_lynch,,3372.498,3374.632,I absolutely oppose getting rid of it altogether.
1985.84-1922,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3400.149,3402.017,"Mr. Wright, do you have anything further?"
1985.84-1922,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3402.017,3404.167,"Yes, I do."
1985.84-1922,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3431.787,3440.809,"May I ask, Mr. Wright, under your view, if you prevail... say you have a case in which the spouses were joint participants for about a year or two years, say."
1985.84-1922,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3446.63,3458.288,"Of course, we don't believe that that is presented here because we believe that she joined the conspiracy in 1963 or 1962, whenever she first attended meetings with the Czechoslovak agents."
1985.84-1922,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3458.288,3460.64,Say you wanted to ask her about what happened in 1960.
1985.84-1922,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3463.34,3466.342,"Well, I don't think we do... I think that probably we could."
1985.84-1922,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3469.46,3479.165,"I am just wondering what the scope of the exception you are asking for is, whether it is just, once the privilege is waived, it is waived as to everything, or only for the period of joint participation?"
1985.84-1922,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3481.184,3487.688,We have thought it through to the extent that we certainly believe it relates to everything of the matter that is under investigation.
1985.84-1922,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3492.057,3500.063,"What if the husband were engaged in espionage at a time and all she knew was when he was home and when he was traveling or something, and you wanted to ask her about his whereabouts?"
1985.84-1922,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3506.817,3507.752,--We think not.
1985.84-1922,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3605.013,3605.446,Very well.
