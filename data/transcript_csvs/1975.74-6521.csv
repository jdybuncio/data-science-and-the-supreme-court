1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,54.123,57.101,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1975.74-6521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,96.652,101.269,"Against whom no other claim is pending, is that right?"
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,101.269,104.177,Yes your Honor that is correct.
1975.74-6521,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,139.206,144.178,Would their clearly be a cause of action under State law in Washington?
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,144.178,144.538,Yes there would your Honor.
1975.74-6521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,144.538,145.806,Against the County?
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,145.806,146.848,"Against the County, yes sir."
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,173.007,178.043,As you look at complaint where was a State cause of action stated?
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,178.043,178.777,You Honor the –
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,178.777,180.739,Where in the appendix?
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,182.805,186.822,Your Honor that is one of the things I feel obligated to explain.
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,197.976,202.563,I read this carefully and I just could not find a state claim cause of action stated?
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,202.563,203.272,Okay.
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,203.272,210.48,"If there is not any, why then this question assertedly involved in this case does not exist, does it?"
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,210.48,213.903,"If that is true, it does not exist, but it does exist, they are statements."
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,269.467,273.869,This maybe maintained against it but where is any cause of action stated under State law?
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,273.869,283.665,"Well, the list of State claims is not there but sufficient facts are available Your Honor to show that a claim is available against that County."
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,283.665,289.405,You are entitled to go back and file a complaint stating a cause of action under the State law but I cannot find any stated here.
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,289.405,294.252,"Your Honor under Civil Rule eight, under notice pleadings we have alleged enough facts."
1975.74-6521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,296.36,300.588,Can you identify the place we will find them as we go along so we can mark it up.
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,300.588,301.391,Yes Your Honor.
1975.74-6521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,317.603,324.942,"But generally, ordinarily a complaint must do more than reflect, it must allege, is that not so?"
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,324.942,325.564,Yes sir.
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,349.201,359.178,The question that you said the Court must the preliminary deal with arises if and only if a cause of action is stated under State law.
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,359.178,359.591,Yes sir.
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,359.591,360.571,You would agree with that?
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,360.571,361.149,Yes.
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,361.149,367.168,And I just still have trouble seeing where if anywhere is one stated?
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,367.168,372.664,Well your Honor the case of Conley v. Gibson would have to guide the Court in that determination.
1975.74-6521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.479,434.908,"Mr. Rosenberg, I noticed in paragraph 1 of your complaint on page 12 of the appendix and again in paragraph 20 on page 16, you say that in as much as the plaintiff’s dismissal was authorized by 36.16 of the Revised Code of Washington, that statute on its face is violated plaintiff’s rights on the First and Fourteenth Amendments, doesn't that kind of militate against your contention that there was a state law of claim."
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,434.908,435.972,No sir.
1975.74-6521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.93,464.134,"Well, but that, if the State of Washington has a statute that as you say in your complaint, specifically authorizes a dismissal, it may be totally unconstitutional but can you consistently with that statement statute maintain that the State Courts would grant you State relief?"
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,464.134,465.674,If a tort was involved and—
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,465.674,473.588,In the State Court’s your cause of action would be a federal cause of action because your claim would be that the state law violates the federal constitution.
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,473.588,474.07,"No sir, your Honor."
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,479.89,485.667,"It is not stated here, at least I cannot find it, I tell you, you have not pointed it out."
1975.74-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,485.667,487.959,That is what the statute said and not mentioned in here.
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,487.959,489.157,Your Honor I admit that.
1975.74-6521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,497.231,498.907,(Inaudible)
1975.74-6521,0,37259,norman_rosenberg,,498.907,499.98,Your Honor this actions is —
1975.74-6521,1,20573,donald_c_brockett,,1696.832,1700.875,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1975.74-6521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1772.996,1788.945,Do you know of any case ever filed in a Trail Court of your State stating a cause of action under 42 United States Code before 1983?
1975.74-6521,1,20573,donald_c_brockett,,1788.945,1793.487,I do not think I know of any particular actions your Honor that has been filed in the State Courts.
1975.74-6521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1806.447,1830.99,"The jurisdictional statute 28, United States Code 1343 conferring Federal District Court jurisdiction over such cause of action, would a State Court in Washington as matter of its jurisdiction under the law of the State have jurisdiction over a cause of action stated under 42 United States Code 1983?"
1975.74-6521,1,20573,donald_c_brockett,,1830.99,1837.031,I do not believe your Honor that that particular Section of United States Code gives exclusive jurisdiction.
1975.74-6521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1837.031,1849.645,"That section does not give any jurisdiction 42, volume 42, volume 28, 1343 gives jurisdiction to the Federal Courts not exclusively nor un-exclusively, it just gives federal jurisdiction."
1975.74-6521,1,20573,donald_c_brockett,,1849.645,1851.027,"Federal jurisdiction, that is correct."
1975.74-6521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1851.027,1861.095,"And I just wanted if your State Courts, Trial Courts had jurisdiction over a cause of action brought -- stated under 1983 --"
1975.74-6521,1,20573,donald_c_brockett,,1861.095,1868.114,I believe that they would have the jurisdiction with the Federal Court in order to hear that particular case.
1975.74-6521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1870.148,1871.397,(Inaudible)
1975.74-6521,2,37259,norman_rosenberg,,1871.397,1876.582,Not specific cases because again of the choice by counsel in filing in Federal District Courts.
1975.74-6521,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1876.582,1879.546,It has to bring it to the Federal District Court?
1975.74-6521,3,20573,donald_c_brockett,,1879.546,1898.581,Now the attempt in this particular case and I think again this is the poorest case where this Court to be deciding the matter of pendent jurisdiction in attaching a state claim to a federal claim because of the fact that the complaint itself alleges an absence of a state claim.
1975.74-6521,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2109.505,2113.192,"Just said is true with the respect to any diversity case, is it not?"
1975.74-6521,3,20573,donald_c_brockett,,2113.192,2114.435,That is true your Honor but I think—
1975.74-6521,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2114.435,2122.809,"The defense could be frustrated by the fact if he is pulled down the federal side, he just cannot get a definitive state to ruling on the issue?"
1975.74-6521,3,20573,donald_c_brockett,,2122.809,2123.803,That is correct your Honor.
1975.74-6521,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2173.301,2189.356,"1969 rather disparages this once valid idea about the New Englanders getting a bad deal in some other jurisdiction and vice versa, that was not?"
1975.74-6521,3,20573,donald_c_brockett,,2189.356,2201.137,That is correct your Honor and I think that is something for this Court to consider in determining whether or not -- in fact the diversity problem has not crept into the federal question problem through the use of this.
1975.74-6521,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2201.137,2204.629,But diversity jurisdiction only Congress can do that?
1975.74-6521,3,20573,donald_c_brockett,,2204.629,2204.945,That is right.
1975.74-6521,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2204.945,2209.23,"Are suggesting, we can do something about pendent jurisdiction cases?"
1975.74-6521,3,20573,donald_c_brockett,,2209.23,2212.019,"Yes, and what I am suggesting -- Excuse me."
1975.74-6521,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2212.019,2213.171,And ancillary jurisdiction.
1975.74-6521,3,20573,donald_c_brockett,,2213.171,2233.111,"Yes, and what I am suggesting is that this Court go back historically to the constitution and determine that the Federal Courts should have province and power only over cases arising under the constitution and laws of United States or diversity cases which as your Honor has said they can do nothing about."
1975.74-6521,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2246.306,2262.532,"Well, Mr. Brockett you certainly do not need any broad doctrine like that to prevail here on your case, do you all -- you are saying is that the principle of Gibbs as to pendent claim should not be extended by this Court to the new class of pendent party."
1975.74-6521,3,20573,donald_c_brockett,,2262.532,2262.835,Yes.
1975.74-6521,4,37259,norman_rosenberg,,3103.658,3105.817,"Yes sir, very briefly."
1975.74-6521,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3165.054,3166.001,Thank you gentlemen.
