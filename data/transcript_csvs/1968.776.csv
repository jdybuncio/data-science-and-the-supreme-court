1968.776,6,44028,william_m_bennett,,3246.669,3268.82,"Mr. Chief Justice and members of this Court, I think it would be refreshing and helpful in novel here today to speak for the first time of the facts of the case, the Clayton Act, the Sherman Act and your decisions and to judge the award in that light and not so much in ad hominem argument."
1968.776,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5015.857,5021.051,The other counsel exhausted their time.
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5022.331,5028.802,"Mr. Chief Justice, we had saved some time for rebuttal."
1968.776,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5035.665,5036.38,Very well.
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5036.38,5044.676,If that meets with Your Honor's approval?
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5044.676,5064.64,"What happens in this case Mr. Sonnett if a year from now would turns out that after all the studies have been made, the surveys that have been, economic analysis have been made, the search for gas reserves has been made, and Continental decides and is not going to California?"
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5064.64,5074.504,"Well, I think Mr. Justice Douglas that it will be like the wonderful operation but the patient died."
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5076.076,5085.439,"But why should we, in view of our mandate, why should we take any action on this appeal until we know what is actually going to happen?"
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5085.439,5093.599,Because the only way that we can compete is the way we are competing.
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5101.447,5109.19,"I'm not at that point here, I'm thinking about in order to get into California you have to go out and get some gas reserves, right?"
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5109.19,5112.377,"First, we have to go and see if we can get some customers and we are doing that."
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5112.377,5114.402,"Well, but you have gas reserve too, doesn't it?"
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5114.402,5116.047,We have to do that as well.
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5116.047,5125.511,"Because the gas reserve that you have, as I understand the District Court are sufficient to service only the Northwest properties, is that right?"
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5125.511,5132.732,"Well, may I give you a little fuller answer Mr. Justice Douglas to what, what we have in doing."
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5150.188,5156.427,"Well, I've read Article III of your contract in your -- is the best efforts contrary."
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5156.427,5159.795,"Yes, which is all anyone can do Mr. Justice Douglas."
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5201.721,5203.476,I'm not impugning motives --
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5203.476,5203.604,Oh!
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5204.529,5210.821,-- anything but I'm just saying the cold reality is that a year from now this --
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5210.821,5211.38,Mr. Justice Douglas.
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5211.38,5213.2,-- we may end up where we started.
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5213.2,5214.168,It is possible.
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5353.067,5359.716,I would think you'd be making a strong argument to a District Court not to approve a plan at this stage in.
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5359.716,5363.522,"Well, unless we have the assurance of the plan."
1968.776,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5560.156,5566.189,Where did you say you're trying to build that $250 million pipeline to?
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5566.189,5570.159,"From Canada, Mr. Justice Black, to California."
1968.776,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5599.508,5599.615,Was that --
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5599.615,5599.894,So that --
1968.776,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5599.894,5601.019,-- all?
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5613.655,5620.914,"Well, that certainly is not part of our planned entry."
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5620.914,5621.57,There will be another (Voice Overlap).
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5621.57,5625.229,"Justice Black, that would be other competitors."
1968.776,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5637.159,5644.126,"Well, I was interested in that because of sending gas to Texas."
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5644.126,5653.497,The three companies who now confront us in the California market will be El Paso.
1968.776,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5731.974,5743.727,But if the FPC now allowing pipelines to built from Texas to California and from California back to Texas?
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5743.727,5747.673,"Well, I can't give you a complete answer Mr. Justice Black."
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5785.723,5788.738,And those properties take it down into Oregon now?
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5788.738,5789.936,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5789.936,5790.937,But not to California?
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5790.937,5792.921,Not to California.
1968.776,7,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5840.965,5850.722,"When you stated you had to build a pipeline from Canada to California, I think you misstated record didn't you because your pipeline runs down to Oregon now?"
1968.776,7,33118,john_f_sonnett,,5850.722,5858.919,"Well, there is a segment Mr. Justice Douglas if we get access to the reserves we're now negotiating for."
1968.776,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6010.466,6011.922,Very well.
